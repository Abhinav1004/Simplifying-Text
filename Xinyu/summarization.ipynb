       "      <td>The rising number of drones in air space poses numerous challenges. Topping that list is our ability to simply detect these small unmanned aerial vehicles. Periodic near-misses between drones and large airplanes raise the specter of disaster, and the drones themselves often lack the necessary technology to locate other moving objects. To address these issues, EPFL researchers have developed algorithms capable of detecting and tracking small flying objects using a simple camera.\\nThe proof of concept was conducted as part of a PhD dissertation, and a real-time detection and collision avoidance system is now being developed in a project funded by the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI).Today’s collision avoidance systems operate actively: an airplane in flight calculates its position, altitude and course, and communicates this information to other aircraft using the same technology. Those aircraft can then evaluate the risk of a collision based on their own positioning data and, if necessary, alert the pilot. But this system is only effective as long as all aircraft are equipped with the same technology. In reality, drones often lack such systems, which are costly and heavy and consume more power.Artificial intelligence and Deep learningA camera can thus be an effective, non-cooperative (i.e., not every aircraft must be equipped with it) addition to that system, provided the camera can successfully detect a flying drone.\\nTherein lay the obstacle that researchers at EPFL's Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB) sought to overcome. The biggest challenge for a moving camera is to spot another moving object. This is much more difficult on a drone than it is on a car, which only moves in two dimensions. Drones move in three dimensions, and the camera is called on to detect objects against the sky or the ground, depending on the angle of sight.\\nPlus, drones need to locate objects as quickly as possible, such as when they are still fuzzy black dots against a dark forest. And the fact that no two drones look alike anymore – new models are constantly being developed – meant that the researchers had to find a way to teach the camera to recognize all sorts of drones.In his thesis, Artem Rozantsev showed that these challenges can be overcome. The first step consisted in using artificial intelligence and deep learning to teach the camera to recognize drones. His method combined information on both appearance (types of drones, position, etc.)\\nand motion (movement in the camera's field of view), as neither alone was capable of achieving sufficiently reliable detection. He therefore proposed a machine-learning technique that operates on spatio-temporal cubes of image intensities where individual patches are aligned using a regression-based motion stabilization algorithm.Real-time performance and accuracyBut the recognition algorithm on its own was not enough. To train a detector to recognize all types of drones in all kinds of positions, it has to have \"seen\" as many as possible. The existing database of images, however, is limited.\\nSo Rozantsev filled in the gaps by generating realistic synthetic images. The generated images, which are based only on a small set of real examples and a coarse 3D model of the object, are used together with the real examples to train the detector. A key ingredient to his method, the generated images are as close as possible to the real ones – not in terms of image quality, but according to the features used by the machine-learning algorithm.The researchers managed to develop a reliable algorithm capable of detecting a drone using a lightweight camera similar to those found in smartphones. The aim of the project, now financed by the CTI, is to train a detector using an even larger data set to improve its real-time performance and accuracy. EPFL's CVLAB researchers are working on this in collaboration with FLARM Technology AG, the leading supplier of affordable collision avoidance technology for civil aviation. The first commercial models are expected to be released next year.</td>\n",

To solve this problem, the researchers made algorithms that can be used to find and follow small drones. A real-time detection and collision avoidance system is now being developed by the European Commission for Science and Technology. The proof of concept was done as part of a Masters degree program. The biggest challenge is to be able to see another moving object. This is much more difficult to do with a drone than with a car. Drones move in three dimensions. The camera can see objects in the sky or on the ground. Artem Rozantsev used artificial intelligence to make the camera know how to spot drones. His method combined information on both appearance and position ( how long it takes to fly ). and position of the drone. Machine-learning technique uses spatiotemporal information such as image intensities. Individual patches are aligned using a software called Motion Stabilization algorithm.

       "      <td>As more drones are flying in air space, there are many challenges. To address these problems, researchers have made algorithms that can be used to find and follow small flying objects using a simple camera. A real-time detection and collision avoidance system is being developed. An airplane in flight can find out its position, how high it is, and how it will move to other aircraft using the same technology. but this is only useful if all aircraft are equipped with that technology, because it will cost a lot and will use more power. the biggest challenge for a moving camera is to be able to see where it is. The camera moves in three dimensions and can detect objects in the sky or on the ground, depending on how far away it is from the ground. the first part was using artificial intelligence to teach the camera how to recognize drones, using AI. His method combined information on both appearance and position with other information. He made a machine-learning technique that can learn from spatiotemporal data such as images. the recognition algorithm was not enough, but it has to be as easy as possible to understand. the made images are based only on a few very small things. The project is financed by the CTI and is being funded by EPFLs CVLAB researchers working on this together with FLARM Technology AG, the leading supplier of affordable collision avoidance technology, to make it easier for the car to crash into the road.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The increasing number of drones in the air has many challenges. To top that list, we can simply detect these small unmanned aerial vehicles. Occasionally near misses between drones and large airplanes raise the possibility of a disaster. The drones themselves often do not have the technology to find other moving objects. To address these problems, researchers have made algorithms that can be used to find and follow small flying objects using a simple camera. A real-time detection and collision avoidance system is being developed in a project funded by the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI ) Today's collision avoidance systems operate actively : the airplane in flight calculates its position, altitude and course ( how high the plane is ), and communicates this information to other aircraft using the same technology. The aircraft can then calculate the risk of a collision based on what they have on their own map. If it is necessary, they will warn the pilot. But this system is only good if all aircraft have the same technology. Artificial intelligence and Deep learningA camera can thus be an effective, non-cooperative ( that is, not every aircraft must be equipped with it ) addition to that system, provided the camera can successfully detect a flying drone, and provide the necessary information to make a good decision. There was an obstacle that researchers at the European Physical Laboratory ( EPFL ) wanted to overcome. The biggest challenge is to be able to see another moving object. This is much more difficult on a drone than a car, because a car can only move in two dimensions. Drones move in three dimensions. The camera can detect objects in the sky or on the ground, depending on how far away they are. Plus, drones need to find objects as quickly as possible, that is very easy when they are still fuzzy black dots in a dark forest. And the fact that no two drones look the same - new models are constantly being developed - meant that the researchers had to find a way to teach the camera to recognize all sorts of different kinds of drones.In his work, Artem Rozantsev showed that there are many things that can be done with drones. The first part was using artificial intelligence to make the camera know how to recognize drones. His method combined information on both appearance and position ( how long it takes to fly ). and motion ( movement in the camera's field of view ), because neither one could detect anything close enough. He therefore proposed a machine-learning technique that operates on spatio-temporal cubes of image intensities where individual patches are aligned using a regression-based motion stabilization algorithm.Real-time performance and accuracy But the recognition algorithm was not enough. To train a drone to recognize all types of flying machines in all kinds of places, it has to have the most people possible. The current database of images, however, is very small. So Rozantsev filled in the gap, by making realistic pictures with real people. The generated images, which are only based on a small set of real examples and a rough 3D model of the object, are used together with the real examples to make the detector more accurate. The researchers worked on making a reliable algorithm that could detect a drone using a lightweight camera similar to those found in smartphones. The researchers were able to develop a reliable algorithm that could detect a drone using a lightweight camera like those found in smartphones. The aim of the project, now paid for by the CTI, is to train a real-time detector to get even more information to improve its performance and accuracy. EPFLs research team is working on this together with FLARM Technology AG, the leading supplier of low cost collision avoidance technology for civil aviation.

       "      <td>Immunotherapy, unlike chemotherapy and radiotherapy, arms the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells. In recent years, it has proven to be remarkably successful at treating leukemia, lymphoma and other liquid cancers, or cancers present in body fluids.Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient’s T-cells – the body’s most powerful immune cells – are extracted and engineered to recognize and kill cancerous cells. Yet when they target solid tumors, the modified T-cells can also attack healthy tissue, leading to toxicity, major organ damage and potentially even death.A team of researchers from EPFL, the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Lausanne (UNIL), and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) have developed a new protein-based method to switch off the modified T cells on command – a sort of emergency safety net for patients who respond badly to treatment. The control system, known as STOP-CAR, has been tested and validated on mice infused with prostate cancer cells.\\nIts discovery could speed the clinical development of new CAR therapies that were previously considered too risky. The team has published its research in the journal Nature Biotechnology.Living drugsAt a basic level, the new control system works in much the same way as existing techniques. T-cells are taken from a patient’s blood then genetically modified so that special receptors – known as chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs – grow on their surface. These receptors enable the modified cell to recognize and bind to cancer cells.\\nA signal is then generated instructing the cell to attack.It’s at this point that the new method differs. Using computational protein design, the researchers re-engineered the receptor so that the signal generated when it binds to a tumor antigen can be switched off, effectively disabling the T-cell.The control system involves administering a molecule to the patient as a separate drug. The T-cell contains naturally binding pairs of proteins that carry information between the receptor and the inner structure of the T-cell. The molecule breaks the interaction between these proteins, thereby disrupting the signal and effectively switching off the cell.“The real advantage of this system is that we can switch the T-cell back on again if we stop administering the molecule,” explains Bruno Correia, one of the paper’s senior authors and a tenure-track assistant professor at the Institute of Bioengineering, part of EPFL’s School of Engineering.\\n“There’s no need to destroy the T-cells if they pose a threat to a patient’s health. The system lets us precisely control the effects of immunotherapy”The benefits don’t end there. Observations have shown that prolonged exposure to antigens can cause T-cell exhaustion. Switching the cells off temporarily gives them time to rest and recuperate. “This work itself, and its potential, is really exciting,” says George Coukos, director of the Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research “but I think it is also illustrative of how well-orchestrated, multidisciplinary collaborations can yield significant scientific breakthroughs. Working with EPFL and our other partners in the region, we hope to bring STOP-CAR-T therapy as quickly as possible to cancer patients.”This study was supported by Ludwig Cancer Research, the Biltema and ISREC Foundations, the European Research Council, the National Center of Competence for Molecular Systems Engineering, The Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, Whitaker and the National Research Foundation of Korea.</td>\n",

The system gives T-cells time to rest and get better after being exposed to certain drugs.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Immunotherapy helps the body fight cancer cells by attacking them. In recent years, it has been very effective at treating people with leukemia, lymphoma and other liquid cancers, or other cancers in the body. But when they are targeted, the changed T-cells can also attack healthy tissue. T cells are taken from a person's blood and then genetically modified so that special receptors, called chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs ), can grow on their surface. These receptors allow the modified cell to recognize and fix to specific molecules. The control system gives a drug to the patient as a different drug instead of the drug. A signal is then sent to the computer to attack. The molecule breaks the bonds between these proteins, and makes the signal weak. The system lets us control how the drugs work for us. Switching the cells off for a short time gives them time to rest and recover. The work itself, and what it can do, is really exciting, he said.</td>\n",
       "      <td>A group of researchers from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Lausanne (UNIL ) and the chUV have made a safety net to keep the T cells from being changed on command. the control system, known as STOP-CAR, has been tested on mice with prostate cancer, to see how it works. This discovery could speed the development of new CAR therapies, which at first were not safe to try. the new control system works the same way the old techniques work. T cells are taken from a person's blood and then genetically modified so that special receptors ( called chimeric antigen receptors ) can grow on their surface. the researchers changed the receptor so that the signal generated when it binds to a particular antigen can be switched off. The molecule breaks the bonds between these proteins, which means that the cell stops working. Long periods of exposure to antigens can cause T cell exhaustion.

       "      <td>Immunotherapy, unlike chemotherapy, strengthens the body's ability to fight cancer cells. In recent years, it has been proven to be very effective at treating leukemia, lymphoma and other liquid cancers.Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR ) T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which the cells that make up a personâ s immune system are made to recognize and kill cancerous cells. A team of researchers from EPFL, the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Lausanne (UNIL ) and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV ) have made a new way to turn off the modified T cells on command. This way, they can attack healthy tissue, leading to toxicity, major organ damage and possibly even death. The control system, called STOP-CAR, has been tested on mice with prostate cancer, to see if it works. Its discovery could speed the development of new CAR therapies, things that were thought to be too risky. The team has published its research in the journal Nature Biotechnology.Living drugsAt a basic level, the new system works much the same way as before. T cells are taken from a person's blood then they are changed so that special receptors, called chimeric antigen receptors, ( CARs ), can grow on their surface. These receptors allow the modified cell to recognize and fix to specific molecules. A signal is then sent to the cell telling it to attack. At this point, the new method is different. Using computational protein design, the researchers changed the receptor so that the signal generated when it binds to a tumor antigen can be switched off. The control system involves giving a different drug to the patient, so that the drug does not work anymore. The T-cell contains pairs of proteins that carry information between the outside of the cell and the inside of the T-cell. The molecule breaks the interaction between these proteins, causing the signal to go off and the cell shut off. The advantage of this system is that we can switch the T-cell back on again if we stop administering the molecule, explains Bruno Correia, one of the paper's senior authors and a professor at the Institute of Bioengineering, part of EPFL's School of Engineering. There is no need to destroy the T cells if they are dangerous to the health of the person. The system lets us precisely control the effects of immunotherapy by using small tubes. Some studies have shown that long exposure to antigens can cause T-cell exhaustion. Switching the cells off for a short time gives them time to rest and recover. This work itself, and its potential, is really exciting, says George Coukos, director of the Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. Coukos says that the work is also an example of how well-organized collaborations can produce big scientific breakthroughs. This study was supported by Ludwig Cancer Research, the Biltema and ISREC Foundations. It was also supported by the European Research Council, the National Center of Competence for Molecular Systems Engineering, the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, Whitaker, and the National Research Foundation of Korea.</td>\n",

       "      <td>17 hours, 19 minutes – that’s the record set last year by a Ticino-based team for visiting each and every Swiss canton while travelling exclusively by public transport. The Swiss Train Challenge was launched by Swiss broadcast journalist Nicolas Rossé in 2015, who made the journey that year in 19 hours, 46 minutes. But that was before the Gotthard tunnel was open. This Friday, a team of EPFL students including two PhD researchers will aim for the record-breaking time of 16 hours, 54 minutes.\\nAnd in a first, their itinerary was calculated by an algorithm rather than by hand.To develop the algorithm, the students first had to download the exact locations of Switzerland’s 22,080 train stations and bus stops as well as the geographical borders of each canton and the full train timetable. They then whittled down the number of train stations to the 110 “significant” ones, i.e., with potentially useful train connections. The next step was to download lists of all trains that go through these stations and their schedules, and see what other stations they go to in order to maximize their utility. This final step is what the students set their algorithm to work on – which it did for no less than ten days before coming up with the optimal itinerary.The devil is in the detail“The first (positive) surprise we got from the algorithm’s itinerary was the travel time: 16 hours, 54 minutes.\\nThat means we can technically beat last year’s record. Not by much, due to the previous teams’ hard work and the redundancies in the Swiss train network, but by enough,” says Emmanuel Clédat, a PhD student at EPFL’s Geodetic Engineering Laboratory. “The second surprise was how prominently Ticino – the canton in the south that borders Italy – features in the itinerary. We thought it would be the end point of our journey or a separate out-and-back side trip of its own.\\nBut instead, it’s a stop on the way to the Canton of Graubünden. That shows that Ticino lies along one of the main routes crossing the country.”The team will leave from St. Maurice, in the Canton of Valais, at 5:24am and end their journey at Jakobsbad, in the Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, at 10:18pm. The itinerary takes advantage of Switzerland’s many cantonal enclaves to shorten travel distances as much as possible. However, the route is strewn with obstacles; for instance, at the Alpnachstad train station, in the Half-canton of Obwalden, the students will have zero minutes to change trains.\\n“The previous winners had to make the journey twice to set their record. We might also have to make a few trial runs before we reach our goal,” says Dirk Lauinger, a PhD student at EPFL’s Risk Analytics and Optimization Chair.The pleasure of train travelLauinger’s thesis is on optimizing interactions between electric vehicles and power grids, while Clédat – his roommate with whom he decided to take part in the Challenge – is studying computer-assisted vision. So neither one of them is performing research related directly to the Challenge. Rather, they are motivated by their appreciation of train travel, as are the other students who will join them in their attempt to set a new record.Follow the challenge live on:go.epfl.ch/SwissTrainChallenge18 Contact: [email protected]</td>\n",
