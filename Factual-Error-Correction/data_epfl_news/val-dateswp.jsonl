{"id": 3, "text": "You can’t miss the three little white eggs that have been driving noiselessly around the EPFL campus on four wheels since 7 May. Halfway between a car and a bike, these electric vehicles are available to users on campus for free. And testers have not been hard to find. “We were expecting about 50 people to sign up, but we’ve had more than 250. We had planned for each vehicle to do two or three runs a day, but they’ve actually done between eight and 13!” exclaims Yoann Loetscher, one of the two founders of the startup, ENUU.\nWorking in partnership with EPFL’s Sustainable Campus initiative, the Biel-based company is using the campus as a micro lab until 1 June. Users have been testing everything about the vehicles, from how easy they are to reserve and operate using the app to their technical features, fleet management and battery recharging. The aim is to fine-tune the design before a fleet of self-service vehicles is rolled out for public use in Biel in mid-July.\nThis initiative is a first for shared mobility. Let’s start with the vehicle itself. It’s manufactured in China and modified slightly for use in Switzerland. It’s electric, about as wide as a scooter, and has handlebars and a seat – you ride it like a bike but it’s as stable as a car. You don’t need a driver’s license, and the vehicle is allowed on bike paths up to a speed limit of 30km/h. For Loetscher, what makes the vehicles stand out is that they offer the advantages of electric bikes along with protection from the rain like cars.\nThe concept is also a first. Once you’ve signed up for the service, you can locate and reserve one of these mini vehicles via an app. The vehicle’s door will open automatically when the reservation begins – and off you go! At EPFL, the vehicles are available free of charge, but the journey can’t last more than 15 minutes. In Biel, where 13 vehicles will be available, users will be able to take three free trips a day lasting a total of 30 minutes. After that, they’ll have to pay.\nResearch projects in the pipeline\n“This pilot phase is crucial for ENUU because it allows us to collect a whole range of data on everything from battery life to areas of use. We’ve noticed, for example, that people use the vehicles a lot around avenues Piccard and Forel and less so near the SG building and at EPFL Innovation Park,” explains Loetscher, an automotive engineer who graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Biel.\nFirst time users are thrown a little off kilter at the start but then get used to driving the egg-shaped vehicle in no time. Some testers regularly take the vehicles for a short 15-minute spin, while others use them to get from point A to point B. Some students have even tried racing two of the vehicles. The pilot project includes a qualitative analysis that will soon be conducted with the testers, even though the campus is not the target location for this type of vehicle.\nThe partnership between ENUU and EPFL began a year ago when the startup contacted the Transport Center. “It’s our role to encourage projects that combine research, innovation and the economy,” says Simone Amorosi, the Center’s Deputy Director. “ENUU is now in talks with two EPFL labs about possible research projects. One involves vehicle autonomy, while the other is aimed at optimizing operational management.”", "summary": "The electric car-sharing vehicle designed by Biel-based startup ENUU has proved to be a big hit on the EPFL campus, where it has been tested since 7 May.", "claim": "The electric car-sharing vehicle designed by Biel-based startup ENUU has proved to be a big hit on the EPFL campus, where it has been tested since 30 minutes", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [31, 32], "noise": false}

This low-power device plugs directly into a computer or mobile phone to add another dimension to the applications they run. The force feedback lets users feel the texture, stiffness and shape of virtual objects. This little robot joystick, which clearly punches above its weight, has already been presented at a number of specialized trade shows. From 23 to 27 April, visitors at the Hannover Messe – the leading industrial technology trade show in the world – will be able to give it a try.\nHaptic-feedback systems, which are used mainly for gaming, hit the market a few years ago but had until recently disappointed users. They were just not very realistic in the way they simulated a collision by vibrating or imitated acceleration by increasing the feeling of resistance. “Systems offering more refined tactile force feedback have come out recently,” says Marco Salerno, the cofounder of Foldaway Haptics. “But they are bulky, hard to carry around and very expensive.” His company’s foldable joystick offers a very similar experience to that of the newer systems but is easy to stow in a laptop bag or even in your pocket.\nWith the help of a small magnet, this ultralight device opens up into a joystick with an upward flick of the wrist. It goes from flat – less than two millimeters thick – to three dimensions in a fraction of a second. It is stable and solid thanks to its origami-like folding mechanism and the composite materials used to make it. When closed, it is so flat that you may wonder where the sensors and motors are. It took several years of research in the Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory for the researchers to overcome a number of technical challenges.\nThe little robot’s leading feature is the way it is manufactured, through a combination of thin layers of various materials already cut into the shape required for the folding mechanism to work. Because assembly is automated, it will be easy to mass-produce. “The fact that no manual action is required keeps manufacturing costs relatively low,” says Stefano Mintchev, the other cofounder of the startup, which received funding from NCCR Robotics to develop its technology. NCCR Robotics will also set up a .\nFoldaway Touch, a haptic button for virtual reality joysticks\nThe layer-by-layer manufacturing process means that the system can be configured in different sizes and shapes.

Hopefully without harm, and it will soon be forgotten.\nBut for the longer-term studies, Asteroid Vesta is a kind of movie star for planetologists. With 500 km in diameter, it is one of the three largest objects of the asteroid belt that formed simultaneously to the solar system we live in, four billion years ago. It is considered a “protoplanet” or a precursor of a planet. Moreover, it is the only known asteroid to have an earth-like structure – with a core, mantle and crust.\nComputer simulation reconstructs collisions between asteroids \n Using a three-dimensional computer simulation, Martin Jutzi from the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern has now accurately reconstructed how Vesta collided with other asteroids twice over a billion years ago. The models show that the protoplanet owes its elliptical shape to these collisions and that they also scarred its surface structure. They are presented in a study published today on the front page of \nNature \nmagazine.\nThe simulations also enable detailed conclusions on the composition and properties of Vesta’s interior to be drawn for the first time, which helps us to better understand the evolution of the solar system. «Based on the sort and distribution of this material at the surface of the asteroid, we are able to precisely reconstruct the various inner layers of Vesta down to a depth of 100 km», explains Philippe Gillet, head of EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory.\nBased on this information, the computer simulations demontrarte exactly how two consecutive impacts of celestial bodies led to the formation of the observed overlapping basins, which almost span the entire southern hemisphere of Vesta. The models show the size (66 and 64 kilometres in diameter), velocity (5.4 kilometres per second) and the impact angle of the bodies that collided with Vesta. This reveals a lot about the properties of the objects that were near the protoplanet a billion years ago.\nThe final images of the simulations closely resemble the shape and topography of Vesta’s southern hemisphere as observed by the Dawn mission. The models even accurately reproduce the spiral-shaped structures inside the youngest crater which are visible on images from the Dawn mission. «This shows how reliable our method is», rejoices Jutzi. “It also proves that the method we used to determine the composition of Vesta’s inner layers are accurate, adds Gillet. The simulation does show that some of the debris were ejected from a depth of 100 kilometers.”\n«The fact that we can now look inside such protoplanets makes entirely new perspectives in the re¬search on the history of our solar system possible,» says Jutzi.", "summary": "Models boost the significance of image and measurement data from space missions and help to understand our solar system.

These visits are becoming more popular every year: 2050 have registered for this year’s event, 400 more than in 2010, and 600 more than in 2009. “The growing reputation of EPFL certainly accounts for the high attendance”, comments Maya Fruehauf, who is responsible for promoting undergraduate courses. The large majority of the sixth formers come from French-speaking Switzerland (a special day is organized in January for those from the German-speaking area and Ticino), but over 450 are travelling from France. “Our visits to certain high schools and a stand at the “Salon de l’Etudiant” student fair in Paris, as well as word-of-mouth, have all worked well”, she points out. It’s also worth remembering that the degrees awarded by the School are accredited in France by the Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur (CTI), and that students selected by the ENS in Lyon, and who have passed its entrance test, may join various departments without examination. Other young people are coming from even further afield: in particular from the USA, Sweden, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Despite this surge of interest, the percentage of girls attending the open days remains stable at around 35%.\nFaced with this wave of interest, Thursday’s general information event has been reorganized for lack of a hall big enough, to be replaced by three sessions over the course of the day at the Rolex Learning Center conference hall. To get a general idea of the range of courses, the sixth-formers will take part in information sessions offered by the departments.

{"id": 22, "text": "The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.\nThey realized that one building in particular – the Saint-François parking lot – was at the core of the problem. This building links the city center with the Flon neighborhood, meaning that it could play a strategic role in turning downtown Lausanne car-free. So they decided to expand and completely transform it. “Our building holds a restaurant, a co-op market with local products, and a hotel that offers medium-term accommodations such as for artists, conference-goers and businesspeople,” says Flavien Davin. “There would also be common spaces and a co-working area to promote interaction between these groups.”\nThe students also added a public staircase along the side of the building. “We felt that this ‘patchwork building’ deserved an important role, as it sits above one of Lausanne’s public transport hubs,” says Bernard Valette, co-author of the study. “Currently, people who use the parking lot do not have direct access to the various means of public transport beneath the building. Our aim was to better coordinate the building’s different purposes.”\nPedestrian zone and distribution depots\nTheir project also encompasses the Flon train station, which is the third largest in French-speaking Switzerland in terms of passenger numbers. “Our vision was to transform the downtown area, between the Flon neighborhood and Saint-François, into a huge pedestrian zone. That would require expanding the public transport system and totally redesigning the city’s logistics,” says Valette. The students’ project takes into account the future M3 metro line, which will strengthen the link between the north and south of the city, as well as the future tram line that will connect the western side of the city to its center. They would add yet another tramline, between Morges and Lutry, in order to relieve throughtraffic south of the city.\nMaintaining the flow of goods to stores and residents in a car-free city center would require some radical thinking. For this, the students designed three major ‘automated distribution depots’ in the city through which all goods headed for downtown stores and residents would pass. These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.\nAccording to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.\nChanges ahead \nIs all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”\nSolving two problems at once\nThe students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”", "summary": "A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035.

{"id": 29, "text": "Can a home run entirely on solar facades? Apparently so, according to NeighborHub, a house designed and built for the 2017 Solar Decathlon by Swiss students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg (HEIA-FR), the Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD Genève) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR). With NeighborHub, the students wanted to show that it makes both practical and economic sense to install solar panels on a home’s facade – thereby maximizing the surface area put to use – even though sunlight can sometimes struggle to penetrate urban areas. “Unlike rooftops, facades are more likely to be in the shade since other buildings can block the sunlight,” says Philippe Couty, the engineer coordinating the project for HEIA-FR. “That could sharply reduce the amount of power that solar panels generate. But we wanted to show that solar energy can indeed be produced on facades, even in areas packed with a lot of buildings.” The project team went about searching for technology that could prove them right. Peter Cuony, head of solar power systems at Groupe E Connect and a member of the project team from the very beginning, came up with the idea of using power optimizers. The students found that these optimizers fit the bill perfectly, and they installed one in each panel to continuously monitor and adjust the solar panels’ performance.\nMaximizing each panel’s output\n In conventional solar power systems, the panels are connected in series, which means each one can generate only as much energy as the lowest-producing one. Power inverters, taking their cue from the least productive panel, convert the direct current into the alternating current that the home can use. But this method can be a major handicap for the efficiency of solar panels installed on building facades, since the weakest link (e.g. the most shaded panel) could pull down the entire system’s power generation. And that was exactly what happened before the power optimizers were installed on each panel. “Even if each panel has a different level of sun exposure and consequently generates a different amount of energy, the optimizers draw on the instantaneous maximum power generation of each panel, regardless of how much sunlight they do – or don’t – receive,” says Victor Saadé, an EPFL electrical engineering student who is leading the project group responsible for solar panels.\nAchieving energy independence\n Thanks to this novel way of using existing technology, NeighborHub can run entirely on the power generated from its facade-installed solar panels. It even generates more energy than it needs. What’s more, its rooftop remains free for other purposes, like promoting biodiversity – the space can be used to cultivate a variety of plants.\nThe energy independence achieved by the one-story house offers encouraging prospects for residential buildings. Each story could generate enough power for its own needs. That could be a major benefit for cities that are growing vertically.\n“Our house demonstrates that it is possible to produce enough energy for an entire building using solar panels installed only on the building facades,” says Cuony.\nNeighborHub’s open house next Saturday will give the public a unique opportunity to check out the next-generation house before it heads off to the Solar Decathlon competition, which will be held in Denver from 5 to 15 October 2017.\nNeighborHub open house at a glance\n “\nNeighborHub ready to head off to the United States\n”\n Saturday, 10 June 2017, 10am to 5pm\n Smart Living Lab, Halle bleue, blueFACTORY, Passage du Cardinal 13B, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland\n Free of charge, no sign-up required\n Learn more at\nThe project is supported by the following partners:\nThree public-sector partners: Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Canton of Fribourg, City of Fribourg and Smart Living Lab\nAnd the following private partners: Groupe E and Landolt & Cie SA, JPF-Ducret, Régent SA, La Mobilière and Setimac", "summary": "EPFL, in association with the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design and the University of Fribourg, is taking part in the 2017 international Solar Decathlon competition.

The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nThe School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.\nThe font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge. The School profoundly affects the lives of those who study or teach there. As a hub of research and knowledge, EPFL is a source of personal and professional fulfillment. We wanted to reflect all of that in the new design,” says Caroline Moser, CEO of Moser Design.\nThe new visual identity consists of more than just the logo, as it covers the full range of graphic elements that convey the School’s brand. The logo itself figures prominently on campus, in the form of a 2.6-meter-high metal sculpture next to the Rolex Learning Center.\nModern-day agora pays tribute to the past\nThe symbolic launch of the School’s 50th anniversary celebration would not have been complete without paying tribute to Maurice Cosandey, the visionary who in 1969 turned what was then a local engineering school into a Swiss federal institute of technology.\nThe Lombard Odier Agora was therefore inaugurated today in Place Maurice Cosandey – the square named after EPFL’s first president – in a ceremony attended by the Cosandey family.\nPlace Maurice Cosandey sits at the southern entrance of the campus, between the Rolex Learning Center and ArtLab. It was chosen for the Agora as part of an initiative originating with the ArtLab project to revamp this area. The redevelopment project was led by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE), which is headed by architecture professor Dieter Dietz. “Our goal for this project was clear: to get the entire EPFL community – especially students – involved in order to breathe life into a neglected part of campus,” says Dietz.

Two minutes and forty-two seconds. That was the first round of the day’s competition, and Jules and his teammates were pretty happy with their performance. Their top spun for longer than their opponents’, who used a drill to get theirs going.\nForty-five teams came from all over French-speaking Switzerland to compete in one of three age groups. The teams comprised three or four kids from the same age group, together with a coach. Three months before the competition, the teams were all given the same experimental challenge. This year, it was to build a top that would spin for as long as possible. “We used really basic materials,” said ten-year-old Eline. “We took a ten-centimeter-long piece of ash wood, sharpened the end with a pencil sharpener, and hammered it into a piece of fiberboard that we had cut into a round shape using a hole saw.” Good explanation from this extremely enthusiastic team, which was competing in the middle age group.\nPresenting the results of their research project\n In the second round of the competition, the kids had to present the results of a scientific project that they had completed before the competition, along with their conclusions. A team from the youngest age category explained to a jury how to make various types of vortexes with different liquids and vessels. Eight-year-old Clément, backed by a diagram projected onto a screen, used his hands to illustrate the direction in which the earth rotates. Matias, also eight years old, then continued: “I asked my brother, who’s in Australia, to check whether vortexes really do turn the other way down there.” His brother also participated in this competition once. “This interest in science runs in the family,” said his dad, who was the team’s coach that day.\nThat’s just what this competition is designed to bring out: the goal is to get kids interested in science and research. “They may not yet have the mathematical tools to understand and model a scientific problem,” said Andrea Fabian Montabert, who was in charge of organizing the competition. “But they can still come up with hypotheses, set up an experiment and improve their results through trial and error. And they can make observations and draw conclusions.” The competition lets kids try their hand at scientific and technical experiments in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\nTeamwork and cooperation\n After taking a short quiz designed to test their general science knowledge, the competitors played a fun game that required solid teamwork.

The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. \nIncreasing speed and maintaining precision\n The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot. Scientists have now been able to take advantage of the progress made in motorization – in both power and cost – and this avoids the use of any such linking components. Thus, they have really gone up a gear.

{"id": 62, "text": "“Tutu” by Miles Davis and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple have already made their mark on music history. Now they have entered the annals of science, for eternity. Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA! I've been a part of this festival for decades and it truly is a magnificent representation of what happens when different cultures unite for the sake of music. Absolute magic. And I'm proud to know that the memory of this special place will never be lost.”", "summary": "Thanks to an innovative technology for encoding data in DNA strands, two items of world heritage – songs recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival and digitized by EPFL – have been safeguarded for eternity.

{"id": 76, "text": "Pilot and psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard just \"landed\" after 72 hours of simulated flight across the Atlantic Ocean in Solar Impulse, a solar airplane which is equipped with advanced renewable technology. This second virtual flight, which started Tuesday morning and took place at the military base in Dübendorf, Switzerland, was the chance for Piccard to test his mental and physiological boundaries during strenuous flight conditions. EPFL technology monitored his mental states and cardiac rhythm throughout the flight, both in real-time and for post-flight data analysis.\n In a collaboration between EPFL, Hirslanden and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), twenty-seven electrodes placed on Piccard's head measured the electrical activity of his brain, also known as electroencephalogram (EEG). Mental states like sleep, fatigue and thinking can be detected in the fluctuations of these electrical signals. This information will be compared with a series of vigilance tests that were done during the 72 hour flight to evaluate Piccard's alertness and his ability to perform tasks.\n EPFL scientists also measured the electrical activity of the pilot's heart, also known as an electrocardiogram (ECG). The obvious reason is to detect an unusual heartbeat, or a cardiac arrest. But cardiac rhythms also contain information about mental alertness.\n “We are developing smart technology that can evaluate mental states in real-time by monitoring the heart alone,” explains EPFL scientist Francisco Rincon at the Embedded Systems Laboratory. “The 72 hours of data collected here – from the heart, the brain activity and the vigilance tests – will be helpful for developing this technology.”\n The flight simulator took Solar Impulse on one possible trajectory across the Atlantic Ocean, from Norfolk (US) to Almeria (ES), although it did not simulate all of the possible conditions one would experience in Solar Impulse's cockpit. \"Atmospheric pressure and temperature changes were not incorporated into the simulation at this stage, although both have an impact on human physiology,\" explains Solar Impulse pilot André Borschberg, \"not to mention the excitement of really flying Solar Impulse.\"", "summary": "Solar Impulse pilot Bertrand Piccard put his mental and physiological limits to the test during a 72 hour simulated flight across the Atlantic Ocean which ended today.

{"id": 77, "text": "Martin Odersky, an EPFL professor, wrote the Scala language by combining two opposing branches of programming. “This started out as a research project aimed at fusing two approaches – object-oriented programming and functional programming – in a third way,” said the researcher. Scala offers the best of both worlds in a modern, effective and high-level language that developers can use to concisely and elegantly express current programming models. \n The Scala language, whose name comes from scalable, is not particularly difficult and can be used for large-scale projects. It can also work alongside existing systems, something that makes it appealing for companies. All these features underpinned its success, particularly in industry: it was released in 2004 and now has over 500,000 developers worldwide. It is used by companies like Twitter, Netflix, Swisscom, the Swiss stock exchange; banks and financial institutions; and media concerns like the New York Times and Huffington Post; and Spark, the largest data science project in the past 10 years.\n To ensure this important language receives the long-term support it needs, EPFL is launching the today with the support of five partners: IBM, Goldman Sachs, Nitro, Lightbend and Verizon. The center, based at EPFL, will be devoted to improving the language. “Our main goal is to ensure that the Scala language is always freely available to everyone,” said Heather Miller, the director of the new center. EPFL will focus in particular on fine-tuning Scala as a programming tool. “EPFL must coordinate and guide developers in the open-source community in the effort to improve the language, its tools and its documentation,” said Dr. Odersky. “There are so many discoveries remaining to be made in our field, and I hope that EPFL will contribute to this in the future.”\n The Scala Center will also develop MOOCs. EPFL’s first MOOC on Scala, “Functional Programming Principles in Scala,” is given by Dr. Odersky and is the school’s most popular online course.

{"id": 79, "text": "Making a foray into the business world is an essential rite of passage for all EPFL engineering students. They must spend 2–6 months working for a company, after which they can also opt for an in-company master’s project to cap off their studies (\nsee text box\n). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.\nA wellspring of innovation\nBut EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.\nThe reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”\nJosep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.\nSupport for small businesses\nThe students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&D.\n“The best possible transition”\nAs delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.\nEve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said. And it was clearly a positive experience on both sides, because the firm hired her as soon as she graduated. Indeed, many students go on to be hired by the companies they work for. “We hire about 20% of our interns,” said Solà i Carós. “The advantage is that they already know our company. Internships bring us a lot of benefits in the short and long term.”\nInternships also give businesses an opportunity to form ties with EPFL laboratories. That could open the door to broader joint research projects financed by Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which aims to encourage technology transfer to industry.\nEPFL internships and master’s projects\nInternships are in general paid and give engineering students an opportunity to spend several months working for a company. They take place away from an academic setting, and the subject must be approved by the school.\nMaster’s projects are students’ final research projects and are closely overseen by an EPFL professor. They are graded (unlike internships), and typically take place in a laboratory. However, EPFL is also looking into ways to have the projects carried out at company sites, which would more effectively combine the research with business aspects.", "summary": "As part of their degree programs, EPFL students spend several months far from the academic world, working on internships or master’s projects.

{"id": 83, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process.

{"id": 85, "text": "A second small Swiss satellite is going to be launched into space. After SwissCube in 2009, the Swiss Space Center (SSC) at EPFL is working on a new project. Baptized as CubETH, the youngest member of the Swiss cubsats family takes a lot from its predecessor: it measures ten cubic centimeters and weighs less than 1.5 kg. However, its scientific mission is more ambitious. This device is the result of a partnership with the Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich (ETHZ) as well as other collaborators. Its launching is scheduled for the end of 2015 at the earliest. The prototype is currently going through the “flat sat” stage: in order to test all its electronic components, they are electrically connected as they will be in the final structure while lying flat on a lab’s table.\n\"We aim at making CubETH a high performance orbitographic tool capable of calculating its position, altitude and orientation in space with high accuracy,\" said Markus Rothacher, director of the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab at ETH Zurich and main investigator for the scientific part of the project. The idea is to design a stable satellite in order to prevent it from spinning, as it happened to the SwissCube. \"But most importantly, added the specialist, we want to create conditions for future cubsats constellations so that, for example, we could carry out thorough observations of Earth at a given time. For that reason, it is essential to know the satellites’ exact orbits so as to coordinate their trajectories and scientific equipment.\"\nProven on Earth, unprecented in space\nTo achieve a more accurate measurement of the satellite’s orbit, the researchers opted for GPS receivers designed by the Swiss company u-blox. \"These sensors caught our interest because they are small, cheap and their performance is well proven, said Anton Ivanov, SSC researcher in charge of the satellite’s entire technical design. The u-blox receivers are very common, particularly in mobile phones, but they have never been used in space. We want to prove that, by adapting its software, this low cost piece of hardware originally developed for terrestrial purposes can be used in space applications.\"\nIn addition, these sensors are compatible with other navigational systems like the Russian GLONASS or the European Galileo. Hence, researchers are envisaging using all of these GPS technologies, not only for the cubsats constellations but also in the context of the \"cleaner\" satellite project CleanSpace One. They could certainly provide the high precision necessary for carrying out the delicate maneuvers to approach and capture space debris.\nFinally, the CubETH will also have an antenna on its side to study the atmosphere’s composition and nature. The idea is yet again to verify the efficiency of less expensive components than those traditionally used in space. In such a way, the CubETH project remains faithful to the spirit behind SwissCube and cubsats in general: being a platform for testing and demonstrating the applicability of standard electronic components in space.\nAn educational role\nThe cubesats’ format was devised by the California and Stanford universities to allow scholars conduct their own spatial scientific experiments at a reduced cost. The most innovative and significant design elements of SwissCube have been kept, such as the use of cell phone batteries packaged in a waterproof and thermally controlled casing. Another preserved feature is the use of the innovative system of copper pads that provide a better attachment of the solar cells on the satellite’s walls.\nEven before its launch, the new satellite will have also played an important educational role. In addition to generating links and collaborations between the country’s two Federal Institutes of Technology, the different pieces of software on board the satellite will have been the object of study of undergraduate and doctoral students lucky enough to take advantage of a concrete project for learning about space technologies.\n*\n Other Project Partners\n:\n Academic: Hochschule Zentralschweiz (Luzern), Hochschule Rapperswil Tecknik\n Industrial: u- blox, RUAG, Saphyrion.", "summary": "CubETH is the name of a joint project between EPFL’s Swiss Space Center and ETHZ whose main objective is to build a satellite scheduled for launch in late 2015.

{"id": 86, "text": "This may be Switzerland’s last stand, since its eligibility for European research and funding programs is in jeopardy. The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.\nEPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).\nEPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.\nHowever, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants. This restriction was temporarily lifted on 15 September 2014.\nThis grace period will end on 9 February 2017. Swiss researchers can therefore still respond to calls for proposals whose deadline falls before that date.\nEPFL H2020 Advanced Grants\nSmit, Berend – MaGic\nThe Materials Genome in Action\nIt is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

{"id": 92, "text": "Grouped together under the unassuming name φ92, a family of bacteriophage viruses has perfected its specialty: they attack salmonella and coliform bacteria. The centerpiece of their arsenal is a needle-like tip that pierces its victim’s membrane. EPFL scientists have measured this miniscule weapon; at a single nanometer, it’s roughly 20 times the diameter of a helium atom. This discovery, published in \nStructure\n, a \nCell Press\n journal, will allow researchers to better understand the attack strategy used by bacteriophages, which are being intensively studied for their therapeutic potential.\n φ92’s armor-piercing weapon is made up of three chains of identical proteins. These three long intertwined molecules form an appendage sharp enough to penetrate the bacterial membrane. This molecular needle, discovered recently in EPFL’s Laboratory of Structural Biology and Biophysics, led by Petr Leiman, appears to be characteristic of all species belonging to the φ92 family of bacteriophage viruses.\n The body of a phage is made up of two main parts. The first, a hollow head called a “capsid,” contains the genetic material. The second consists of a tube, a group of appendages resembling feet, and a device designed to penetrate the membrane of its host – the needle-like tip is at the furthest extremity of the virus.\n Phages recognize sugars and proteins on the surface of their preferred host bacteria. The virus then attaches its feet to the victim, and a complex process is set in motion. A chain of proteins uncoils, pushing the injection tube and its tip through the victim’s membrane like a hypodermic needle. The tip then detaches from the tube and, like an uncorked bottle of champagne, the pressurized genetic material in the capsid is injected into the bacterium. The phage then begins to reproduce inside its victim. \n By determining the exact structure of the tip, the EPFL scientists have filled in all the missing details in our understanding of φ92’s lethal weapon. To reach this level of detail – at most a dozen or so atoms at the extremity of the tip – they used x-ray crystallography techniques, which are of high enough resolution to determine the shape of individual molecules.\n “We managed to determine not only the size, but the complete structure of the tip as well,” explains EPFL postdoctoral researcher Christopher Browning, who is first author on the article. In addition, the researchers discovered an iron atom in the appendage. “We still are not sure what it’s used for, but to the extent that this element is toxic, we have very good reason to think that it’s not there by accident.”\n This research has implications far beyond simple biological curiosity. Bacteriophages are considered promising weapons in the fight against infectious bacteria, to complement or replace traditional antibiotics. The scientists believe the shape of the needle-like tip determines in part the bacterial species that can be attacked by a phage. \n Among the avenues being explored are incomplete bacteriophages called “pyocins,” which are naturally produced by some infected bacteria. Pyocins consist of just the injection apparatus of the virus, a kind of mechanical component, but of biological origin. They’re of interest to scientists precisely because they don’t have a capsid, and thus don’t carry genetic material, explains Browning. “These things can penetrate the bacterial membrane, which can kill the bacterium, but without injecting genetic material. That sidesteps the possibility that the phage could mutate and then attack “good” bacteria. This option is being extensively studied at the moment, but we need to understand the potential of each phage with respect to the various bacteria. The form of the tip is one of those parameters.”\n--\nThe video is created by Seyet LLC (http://www.seyet.com), Petr Leiman (EPFL) and Michael Rossmann (Purdue University) and funded by NSF (http://www.nsf.gov).\nPublication: \nChristopher Browning, Mikhail M.

{"id": 94, "text": "Concrete has been around since the 19\nth\n century. Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

{"id": 96, "text": "Photovoltaics can be used directly in building and renovation projects and serve as a construction material in their own right. Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

{"id": 99, "text": "The Solar Decathlon was established as an international competition between universities in the United States in 2002. The goal is to design and build a home powered only by solar power in the space of 18 months. Indeed, the Swiss Team has been preparing for the Solar Decathlon 2017 since 2015. This year’s event will take place in Denver, Colorado from October 5-15th. The Swiss Team is made up of around 50 students from four higher education institutions: the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the School of Engineering and Architecture Fribourg (HEIA-FR / HES-SO), the Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD / HES-SO) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR) united under the banner of the Swiss Living Challenge.\nA multifunctional space...\nThe Swiss team has designed an instigator of change, a neighborhood house that can be integrated into various urban settings. The aim of NeighborHub, as it is called, is to bring neighbors together, working with them on more energy-efficient solutions. There are seven issues to consider: energy, mobility, choice of materials, biodiversity, food, waste management and water management. Visitors can get advice and take part in interactive events and discussions on these seven themes. NeighborHub’s architectural design includes a large multifunctional space to facilitate these various interactions.\n...that speaks to you\nInside NeighborHub there is a temperate zone, the \nskin\n, with a heated space, the \ncore\n, in the middle. These two areas are divided into four modules: an equipment room, a kitchen, a bathroom with a separate dry toilet and a private space with a bedroom. In this shared dwelling, not only the walls but also the furniture and other surfaces speak, as it were, to the building’s occupants by means of printed text and a system of signage devised specially for a shared space. ‘We came up with some catchy phrases to tell visitors about NeighborHub’s features so that they can settle in quickly,’ explains Flavia Viscardi, the student in charge of communication in the building. ‘To complete the house’s vibrant and informative visuals, we’ve used color coding and illustrations.’\nSunshine and plants for the building envelope\nIn line with the Solar Decathlon’s competition rules, solar panels have been installed on NeighborHub’s exterior surfaces, providing 100% of its power. Contrary to common practice, however, these panels are not fixed to the roof; instead, you’ll find the solar and thermal panels on the building’s façades and doors. The external surface consists of photovoltaic cells, together with opaque polycarbonate panels and transparent acrylic panes. ‘The unit also has vertical greenhouses, and an aquaponic system for growing fruit and vegetables with a fish tank below,’ adds Axelle Marchon, the student in charge of coordinating the architectural team.\nA closed water cycle\nThe roof of the building is partly covered by plant matter, and rainwater is collected in the middle. The water used in the NeighborHub can be separated out into various types – much like for waste recycling. The rainwater collected on the roof is used for some domestic appliances, as its low mineral content minimizes scaling. The waste water from these appliances, as well as from showers and sinks, gets used as grey water, which is treated using a phyto-purification process: the water is filtered and purified using a reed bed with different layers of gravel. There is no ‘black water’ from conventional toilets in NeighborHub, as the building is instead equipped with dry toilets. ‘The compost we get from them will provide nutrients for the crops that are grown around the NeighborHub and on the roof, thus completing the circle,’ explains Camilla Wiseman, who, together with her student colleagues, designed the entire water system.\nTimber rooms shipped across the ocean\nThe international nature of the Solar Decathlon competition means the project is subject to an extremely tight timetable. After the building has been constructed, it will be disassembled and must then be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean before reaching the competition venue. This journey cuts down the time allocation for the only two teams based in Europe. This crucial logistical factor was taken into account from the start of the project, however, and so the NeighborHub is made up of modules whose dimensions are suitable for the containers in which they will be shipped. These modules are made entirely out of wood, which is light and has a positive carbon balance. ‘Once the prefabricated modules arrive at the competition venue in Denver, Colorado, they will be assembled, a bit like a Lego house,’ says Matias Cesari, the student in charge of the building site.\nA house like no other\nAs a competition, the Solar Decathlon has focused on traditional dwelling models, featuring a single family home with a car, with various proposed energy and environmental solutions. The competition criteria and rules were therefore devised from this perspective. But are detached houses really in keeping with today’s social and environmental imperatives? ‘NeighborHub not only satisfies the Solar Decathlon criteria, it boldly presents an alternative way of living on a neighborhood scale, that is both collective and environmentally friendly,’ explains Marilyne Andersen, Dean of EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) and the Faculty Advisor of the project.\nSolid long-term diamond partners\nThe Swiss Living Challenge project could not have made it out of the classrooms without the considerable support of its partners, who provided not just their financial backing but also their expertise.

Swissmetro was intended to link the main towns in Switzerland at a speed of 500 km/h. Notari’s Master’s project is in fact a variation of the Swissmetro design, which put the trains in underground tunnels rather than through Lake Geneva.\nBut is it really possible to build a metro through Lake Geneva? What some consider sacrilegious is a fascinating technical challenge for others – one that draws on multiple disciplines, covering everything from structural design and hydraulics to geotechnics and the environmental impact.\nA submerged bridge\nNotari focused on designing and calculating the dimensions of a double-track tunnel made out of reinforced concrete: an ‘underwater bridge’ – or to be more specific, a ‘floating underwater tunnel.’ Covering a distance of around 55 kilometers, the tracks would use magnetic levitation – or maglev – to get the train to travel at high speed. With this type of system, one set of magnets is placed on the tracks; a second set on the bottom of the train is repelled by the first, which pushes the train up off the track. In some cases, the repulsive force of the magnet is controlled by a current running along the track.\nFig.1: The double-track tunnel and its compartments containing ballast. © EPFL 2018 / E. Notari\nThis kind of system is not yet used in transportation, but several countries are now testing prototypes and plan to start building soon. In 2015, the Shinkansen Maglev prototype developed by Japanese company JR Central set the world record when it reached a speed of 603 km/h. For his work, Notari drew on policy guidelines developed in Germany, which are better suited to short distances, like that between Geneva and Lausanne.\nSeveral options to choose from\nThere are several options available to an engineer looking to build a train that can run under water. The tunnel can, for example, be set under the ground, as is the case with Eurostar, which was opened in 1994 across the Channel and connects London with several cities in mainland Europe.\nNorway is looking into another option to link its fjords with its cities – an underwater tunnel suspended at a series of floats that can be seen on the surface. Yet another solution involves putting metal rods in the ground to anchor down the tunnel. However, this will only work if the tunnel itself is buoyant enough.\nYet none of these options was quite right for Lake Geneva. This was mainly because its clear waters make it popular among sports enthusiasts and esthetes, which meant the student had to design a tunnel that was at least 20 meters deep and not visible from the surface.\n30 meters underwater\nNotari therefore went with a bridge located 30 meters below the surface and supported by piers made of reinforced concrete. This solution was the most rigid, which is a crucial factor for a high-speed train. It was also the most secure in the event of internal flooding. Other advantages also guided his choice. With this solution, the temperature would be constant throughout the entire structure, which would prevent any thermal deformation as a result of the changing seasons. Waves are also at their weakest at that kind of depth, and the bridge would not get in the way of any existing structures.\nWhat’s more, the hydrostatic pressure would be a bonus in terms of the solidity of the 199 modules making up the concrete tunnels. The engineer’s tunnel measures 14.5 meters in diameter and is designed to withstand earthquakes, internal and external explosions, flooding, tsunamis and landslides. The structure would include compartments containing ballast to make it possible to stabilize the tunnel at any time based on Archimedes’ principle. To adjust to the lake’s varying depth, the height of the pillars, which are 6 meters in diameter, would range from 7.5 to 45 meters. The bridge’s route would follow the lakeshore (see Fig.2. on the left). And the two ends of the line would be connected to the Geneva and Lausanne train stations via elevators.\nToo technically feasible to be utopian\nThe idea of an underwater bridge in Lake Geneva doesn’t seem so utopian to the freshly graduated engineer. “The concept of an underwater bridge has been around for a century,” says Notari. “Our know-how has advanced significantly thanks to projects like oil platforms and offshore wind farms. What’s missing is a pioneering investor who’s ready to put up the money to fund the construction of a prototype.”\nFor Aurelio Muttoni, high-speed transportation projects have great potential: “The solution that Elia studied is technically realistic. I myself came up with a similar solution in the 1990s when studying the feasibility of crossing Lake Lugano as part of the southern extension of the Gotthard high-speed train line.” Muttoni adds that he was inspired by Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s ultra-fast train, when suggesting the topic to his student. (See the .)\nBut given the complexity of the situation, the environmental challenges and the high costs of this kind of project, Muttoni is convinced that it will be many years before Lake Geneva gets an underwater tunnel.", "summary": "Summer series.

{"id": 103, "text": "They are a group of 30-odd architecture students from EPFL, ETH Zurich, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW, Basel) and Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany), and they are preparing to don hardhats and work boots. Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.\nThis Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”\nThe structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.\nBetween tradition and modernity\nYannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction. So while the base of the pavilion can be constructed with conventional rammed earth – erected and dried on the building’s foundations – the upper floor of the pavilion will be composed by earthen blocks that will be used as prefabricated components. This approach will help cut down the building time. The earth needed for the columns of the mock-up will be taken from local construction sites and tested by experts.\nThe two students continue to marvel at the wonders of rammed earth: “We think that the sensible thing to do is to use materials available to us, and that includes earth – which is 100% recyclable,” says Claessens. “In our project, the earth walls – and not the concrete – are load-bearing. We are turning normal building codes on their head.” Pretolani is equally enthusiastic: “We felt we had a free hand in terms of project design because there is so much potential in rammed earth, which is not a contemporary material in terms of its aesthetics and does not have well-developed building standards.”\nPilot project\nThe mock-up could also serve as a pilot project for a new technique – prestressed rammed earth – in which steel cables, linked together to meet seismic standards, will run through the building’s earthen columns from top to bottom. For that reason, the engineers backstopping the students will monitor the project once it’s completed, making up for the lack of building standards.\nMany architects steer clear of earth as a building material, since they feel it slows the speed of construction and leads to higher costs. The St. Gallen pavilion could upend such conventional thinking, according to Boltshauser, since it will only take a month to build: “By combining prefabricated earth blocks with other prefabricated concrete components, the pavilion is a glimpse at what could be the future of rammed-earth construction. It will also allow us to calculate the associated savings in terms of costs and gray energy.”\nTextiles and rammed earth go way back \nThe Sittertal valley was a manufacturing region, specializing in dyeing textiles, until the 19th century. The buildings, located between the Sitter river and a canal, have been maintained and renovated and are now dedicated to the visual arts and artisanal crafts. They play host to artist residences, a library, material archives and exhibitions. “Expertise in earth building spread from France to Switzerland through the linen trade, starting in the 17th century. Using the rammed-earth technique for a building on a site that was once devoted to textiles is our way of acknowledging that history,” adds Boltshauser.\nOne week after the construction work begins, an exhibition describing the history of this building technique, called “Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” will open. This exhibition was first shown at EPFL’s Archizoom space in the spring of 2017. In St. Gallen, it will be set up in the Sitterwerk library, just opposite the students’ pavilion project.\n“Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” Sittertal, from 21 August to 15 October 2017.

Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples. Her results showed that people are exposed to a number of pesticides, and that this is not due solely to their work.

This year’s contest is more specifically called HydroContest-X, because it is being organized jointly by three universities in French-speaking Switzerland: EPFL, the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture (HEIA-FR) and the Vaud School of Management and Engineering (HEIG-VD). The contest, which is supported every year by the Hydros Foundation, challenges students to design, build and race the most energy-efficient boats possible. The event is free of charge and open to the public.\nEach team designs and builds miniature, remote-controlled boats to compete in two contest categories. The two categories are complementary, like Laurel and Hardy – one for thin and light boats, where the aim is to sail fast and far; the other for bigger and heavier ones, which must haul 200 kg of cargo to simulate a freight vessel. Boats in both categories run on batteries provided by the organizer. The event aims to not only enhance students’ education, but also build awareness about the need for cleaner, more energy-efficient shipping vessels and spark ideas for technology in this area.\nAn asymmetric boat\nEPFL students have participated in the contest every year since it was launched. And this year’s team will show up in Yverdon-les-Bains with not two, but three boats. Two of them are from last year’s HydroContest. The first one, which competed in the Mass Transport category, is a hybrid between a catamaran and an airboat that sails on a thin cushion of air. It won the innovation prize last year but was eliminated during the quarterfinals. The second boat, which competed in the Private Boats category, is a twin-foil vessel designed in 2016. This boat proved to be fast but fairly unstable; it came in second place last year behind HEIA-FR.\nThe third boat – new this year – is designed after a prao, a traditional Indonesian sailboat. It has only one hull and one lateral float, making it asymmetric. “We designed it over the past year, it works, and we’ve tested it several times, yet it still needs to be tweaked,” says Sébastien Jaffaux, head of EPFL’s HydroContest team. “So at this point it’s too early to enter it in the race. But if we get the new foils in time, we’ll run demos on the lake.”\nBut the students have big plans for next year, when, as part of the Swiss Solar Boat project, they will use their prototypes as test platforms for the 2020 Monaco Solar & Energy Boat Challenge.

{"id": 113, "text": "How can we bring to life a musical heritage now preserved in a digital format? How does this newly digitised heritage change our perception of the past? And what new cultural perspectives does it open? An interdisciplinary research project by the EPFL + ECAL Lab, Metamedia Center and the ALICE laboratory set out to address these questions. It all began when Audemars Piguet joined forces with Montreux Sounds and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) to digitise, restore and preserve the treasured archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was founded by the late Claude Nobs exactly 50 years ago. The tremendous collection comprises thousands of hours of recordings by the finest musicians on the planet. It is the first audiovisual library to have earned the accolade of UNESCO Memory of the World. “The project was inspired by the work of Claude Nobs. He was a faithful friend and so we are delighted to take part in this initiative. We are proud to participate in the colossal technological efforts needed to transform this unique heritage into a first-class digitised resource for future generations,” says Olivier Audemars, Vice-Chairman of the Audemars Piguet Board of Directors.\nWork to preserve this legacy began in 2008 and is almost complete. Over the years the archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival have taken many different formats. “All the master copies have now been digitised and work on the original tapes will be finished by the end of the summer. We can now make full use of this heritage for research purposes,” continues Alain Dufaux, Operations Director at Metamedia Center. In the past 8 years, more than 11,000 hours of video recordings (in HD since 1991) and 6,000 hours of high-quality audio recordings have been preserved in uncompressed digital formats utilizing the very latest technology. Since 2010, this unique collection has used as a database for a number of research projects at EPFL.\nLiving heritage\n The study conducted by the EPFL+ECAL Lab, the research centre for design at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the ALICE architecture studio ALICE (at EPFL), proposes a new vision for this digitised heritage. The aim is not to reconstitute the past, but instead to create a specific experience for a digitised archive. “The original concert experience is the backdrop of Lake Geneva and the mountains, the ambiance of festival-goers in their thousands, the unfolding of events on-stage, and above all the flesh-and-blood presence of the musicians. We can’t recreate this. Instead we need to make the most of what digital has to offer to create an alternative experience, a complementary experience,” explains Project Manager Nicolas Henchoz. The first private booth was launched in 2012 and awarded the Design Preis Schweiz the following year.\nA ramped-up version of the booth, dubbed Montreux Heritage Lab2, opens to the public in November in the brand new Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL. Montreux Heritage Lab2 unlocks the lion’s share of the archive footage, immersing up to 20 viewers at a time in an intense audiovisual experience.\nEPFL was guided by three principles in developing the new booth. First, the content and its cultural value take front and center. Stunning, well-preserved archival footage dominates the space, appearing on a screen whose sophisticated geometry gives the viewer a sense of depth and proximity to the stage. Then comes the surround sound – so fundamental to the immersive effect – which was orchestrated by Audioborn and Illusonic (two startups founded by former members of the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory, LCAV) with help from Hervé Lissek's Acoustic Group (LTS2) and the Yverdon-les-Bains company Relec with its PSI Audio high-precision speakers. The viewer’s experience is thus shaped by live footage and music – the very essence of the archive. The sense of immersion is further enhanced by the lateral walls of the booth, where mirrors reflect the selected footage and display information and visuals through an LED underlay. The experience is rounded out by anecdotes on the history of the festival showing up on the screens. The booth is structured to direct its light toward the Montreux Jazz Café next door and, in the evening, towards the heart of the campus. \nPurpose-designed controls afford an overview of the archive footage, placing more than 44,000 tracks at your fingertips.\n---\nFrom the outset, the project saw the light of day thanks to the crucial support from Audemars Piguet, who has been involved since the beginning.

In addition, they are stimulated by blue light. \nExploring office lighting \n Münch and her team wanted to know how our circadian rhythm could be influenced by our perception of light during the daytime. They created realistic office lighting conditions and recruited 29 young participants. “For this study, we took into account the intensity of natural and artificial light without specifically evaluating their spectra.”\nFrom daytime to dusk\n To synchronize their internal biological clocks, the volunteers had to maintain a regular sleep schedule during the seven days leading up to the test. They wore bracelets equipped with light sensors and accelerometers, so that the scientists could monitor their movements. \n The study itself took place over two eight-hour sessions. The participants spent the first six hours in an experiment room, first in well-lighted conditions (1000-2000 lux, more or less equivalent to natural light in a room). In the second session, the light intensity was about 170 lux, which is what the eye perceives in a room without a window, lit with artificial light. For this experiment, light intensity was measured at eye-level. Every 30 minutes, the subjects were asked to assess how alert or sleepy they felt. \n Finally, at the end of each session, the participants underwent two hours of supplemental memory tests in a darkened room – less than 6 lux. During these last two hours, the researchers took saliva samples in order to measure cortisol and melatonin concentrations. These two hormones are produced in a in a 24-hour cycle by the human body.\nBoosted by the light\n The volunteers who were subjected to higher light intensity during the afternoon were more alert all the way into the early evening. When they were subjected to light intensity ten times weaker, however, they showed signs of sleepiness and obtained lower scores on the memory tests. \n These results were observed even in the absence of changes in cortisol and melatonin concentrations in their saliva. “With this study, we have discovered that light intensity has a direct effect on the subjective feeling of sleepiness as well as on objective cognitive performance, and that the benefits of more intense light during the daytime last long past the time of exposure,” concludes Münch.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences our cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until early evening.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences our cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until daytime.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [24, 24], "noise": false}
{"id": 129, "text": "Swiss democracy produces lots of data: municipality-by-municipality ballot results and the votes of the National Council are publicly available, as are the responses of the candidates and voters who filled in the questionnaire on the \"smartvote\" voter recommendation website before the 2011 Federal elections. Under the supervision of professors Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran, Vincent Etter and Julien Herzen, PhD students in the Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory, explored these data to reveal a number of interesting facts. They are currently continuing their research by creating a platform, Predikon.ch, that will be able to predict the results of a federal vote based on initial results coming in from municipalities and past data.\nYes, the “Röstigraben” exists! “And it was a bit of a surprise,” admits Etter. They performed a dimensionality reduction on the municipal results for all votes since 1981. This is a standard tool used by statisticians who specialize in data analysis to produce a graphical representation of data. Two groups emerged: one French-speaking and one of German-speaking. (You can see it at ). “The municipalities closest to the intersection of the groups on the graph are also those that are geographically closest to the linguistic border,” notes Herzen.\nWhile the linguistic divide is easy to see on this representation, it’s a bit more difficult to make sense of the graph’s axes, obtained by the dimensionality reduction. “It’s not the traditional left-right and conservative-liberal divisions,” explains Etter. Over time, the Italian-speaking regions seem to move away from the French-speaking districts to join their German-speaking compatriots. In a future version of their interactive graphic, the scientists plan to add a temporal cursor that will highlight this.\nRight and Left are alive and well \nAlthough the Röstigraben can’t be explained by either the left-right or conservative-liberal divide, these classical political categories are alive and well when it comes to politicians, as the duo found when they applied the same data visualization tools to information from the 2011 Federal elections obtained from the voter recommendation website smartvote.ch.\nWith the same data analysis approach, the researchers explored whether the political parties were really all that different from one another. They showed that the positions of 25.8% of the socialist candidates were closer to the median of the green party positions than to their own party’s position. Inversely, the proportion was 18.8%. But the overlap was greatest in the PBD, with more than half of its politicians closer to the median of another party (most often the PDC, 33.1%) than aligned with their own.\nEtter and Herzen also showed that it would be easy for a candidate who filled in his or her own smartvote profile to choose responses that would optimize the number of times they would be recommended to voters that trusted the site. However, this was evidently not exploited in 2011, since the difference between the voting records of parliamentary politicians and their smartvote profile was very small.\nEbikon, a small town that has it right\nThe next step for the two computer scientists is to predict the result of an vote by combining the initial votes coming in from a small number of municipalities with the database of past results. The platform they are developing with Victor Kristof, a student in Communication systems, is called Predikon.ch, a combination of the words “Prediction” and “Ebikon.” This small town near Lucerne (population 12,000) appeared in their preparatory studies to be the one whose results most reliably predicted the federal result. “By doing the exercise with past votes, in 96% of the cases, the result in Ebikon gave us the correct result at the federal level,” explains Herzen.\nThe project’s development is hampered by the fact that each of Switzerland’s 26 cantons has a different system for presenting its data, and that often these platforms are only online for a few hours the day the vote is held, while ballots are still being counted; but nonetheless there’s a good chance that the Predikon index will soon be mentioned in the news updates on these Sundays.\nThe Predikon project, along with all of Etter and Herzen’s research, will be presented at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences Open House, Saturday November 22 at 3:30 pm in room BC420, during a seminar entitled “La démocratie suisse vue par les données.” Throughout the Open House, a Predikon demo will be held on the fourth floor of the BC building.

{"id": 140, "text": "In 2017, startups around the world raised some 4.6 billion dollars by issuing virtual tokens that can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies or services. And much of this activity is taking place in Switzerland, where ICOs brought in 850 million dollars last year according to figures published by IFZ (Institut für Finanzdienstleistungen). But so far, few manufacturers have gotten in on the act.\nLakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that develops customized, highly pure diamonds, is an exception. It is set to launch its own ICO, selling machine-hours in the form of virtual tokens. Over two million tokens – worth a total of 60 million francs – will be issued. The company plans to use this money to significantly ramp up its production capacity. Once the ICO has been completed, buyers will be able to sell their tokens or exchange them for diamonds, thereby creating the first-ever crowd-funded diamond “mine.”\nThe smaller the more expensive\n“With natural diamonds, prices go up as the stones get bigger. But with us it’s the opposite,” says Pascal Gallo, the startup’s founder and CEO. The diamonds produced by LakeDiamond are much purer than natural diamonds. The company’s manufacturing process, in which layers of carbon atoms – the sole ingredient of diamonds – are built up through vapor deposition, eliminates nearly all impurities. These industrial diamonds allow for much greater precision thanks to their hardness, thermal and electrical conductivity, and optical properties.\nThe carefully calibrated size of the diamonds – down to the micron – and the high tech processing they undergo are what set these diamonds apart. The method used to customize the diamonds was developed in conjunction with Niels Quack’s lab at EPFL. The carefully sized diamonds can be set in complex mechanical systems such as watch movements and used in high powered lasers, transistors and photonic platforms.\nThe vast majority of companies that have launched ICOs also use blockchain technology. Their main motivation is simplicity: the companies can deal directly with their investors, and this reduces paperwork and saves time. For LakeDiamond, there’s also the question of independence. “We tried traditional fundraising methods, but most potential investors were in the military sector,” says Gallo. “And we don’t want to take the company in that direction.”\nA smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain\nThe “user,” in the company’s parlance, buys a certain number of tokens secured by an Ethereum smart contract. Ethereum is one of several types of blockchain, which are used to record and share information without any external oversight. Blockchains are so safe because all transactions are verifiable and transparent. A white paper describes the project in detail and includes the transaction clauses and the code used to create the tokens (“ether”) that are issued against the cryptocurrency.\n“Our project is unique: we connect diamond growth reactors to the Ethereum blockchain, which lets token holders produce their own diamonds,” says Romain Braud, the company’s blockchain specialist. LakeDiamond’s tokens are referred to as Time-based Machine Tokens (TMT) because they represent hours of use of the reactors. They also give holders a preferential right to “mine” the diamonds ordered by the company’s industrial clients. This means that token holders can support a client project by trading in their tokens for that project – and ultimately benefiting from the value of the client’s order. Tokens can also be sold on secondary markets, just like traditional cryptocurrencies.\nThe first phase of LakeDiamond’s ICO is meant for professional investors (“token users”). The ICO will be opened to the public this fall once the company has obtained authorization from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).", "summary": "LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that produces and customizes ultra-pure diamonds for industrial use, is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) today.

{"id": 148, "text": "Scientists from EPFL and WSL have been studying soils in oil palm cultivation for years, in an effort to develop more sustainable methods for growing this crop. Palm oil production has been criticized by environmentalists because of its large carbon footprint and negative impact on biodiversity. For instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia – the world’s two biggest producers – it has directly or indirectly caused large-scale deforestation, thereby reducing biodiversity and releasing significant amounts of CO\n2\n into the atmosphere. And planting oil palm trees in the deforested areas does not make up for the lost carbon storage capacity, according to a . \nBut the findings of a new study by EPFL and WSL – appearing today in \nScience Advances\n – indicate there may be a carbon-friendly alternative to deforestation. The scientists investigated oil palm crops that had been planted on former pastures in the Los Llanos region of Colombia, the world’s fourth-largest palm oil producer. There, large areas of pastures – which themselves had been planted in the past on savannas – were replaced by oil palm plantations 56 years ago. By calculating the crops’ carbon footprint since then, the scientists found that the total carbon storage – taking into account both vegetation and soil stocks – was unchanged relative to when the land had been used for pastures.\n“Our study is the first to look at the carbon footprint of palm oil production over the long term – that is, across two plantation cycles, since oil palm trees are replaced every 25–30 years,” says Juan Carlos Quezada, a PhD student at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS) and the study’s lead author. “It’s also the first to explore how converting pastures into oil palm farms affects soil quality and fertility over the long term, looking at all soil layers, not just the surface.”\nCarbon capture\nIn tropical climates, pastures – especially those that have been neglected and degraded – commonly consist of large grassy areas with a few small trees scattered around. Planting dense populations of oil palm trees – which can reach 15 meters in height – on these pastures can increase the carbon capture rate per unit of surface area, thanks to the palm trees’ roots, trunks and leaves, as well as the vegetation around them.\nUnder typical farming methods, oil palm trees are cut down every 25–30 years and replaced with young trees to start a new plantation cycle. As the roots and other parts of the old trees decompose, they nourish the soil and partially offset the carbon initially lost in the upper soil layer when the pastureland was converted. As a result, over the long term cultivation period, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem remains unchanged compared to the initial level before land conversion took place. \nAn alternative worth exploring \n“We should bear in mind that palm oil in and of itself is not harmful – neither to our health, when eaten in moderation, nor to the economy. And we’re not talking just about multinationals – the incomes of hundreds of small farmers in Colombia and other countries depend on it,” says Alexandre Buttler, head of ECOS and a co-author of the study. “The problem lies with the negative carbon impact and loss of biodiversity caused by deforestation. But the main palm oil producing countries have large abandoned pastures that could be converted favorably, thus limiting the massive carbon loss resulting from deforestation.” \nThis study was conducted as part of the  project, a cross-disciplinary initiative funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and led by ETH Zurich. OPAL brings together project partners from Switzerland, Indonesia, Colombia and Cameroon.

{"id": 149, "text": "How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.\nHuman comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”\nCoccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”\nCoccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average. The researcher’s first step was to assess the campus’ energy balance; she looked at individual buildings and the effect that buildings have on each other. Summers will be hotter and hotter, and this will be felt more in built spaces than in wooded ones. Existing buildings will have to be renovated, and new buildings will require design changes. Particular attention will have to be paid to the exterior of buildings: “Vegetation moderates microclimates and blocks solar and infrared radiation, evapotranspiration reduces the air temperature, and plants provide shade,” says Coccolo. “These factors completely change our perceived thermal comfort.”\nTurning climate challenges into design opportunities\nTo offset the expected rise in summer temperatures, the study shows that, in addition to proper insulation, buildings and their immediate surroundings will need to provide more shade through protective features according to the level of solar radiation, the direction the building faces and the season. For Coccolo, this goes beyond simply multiplying the number of plants and trees; the focus should be on what truly enhances comfort. This may include such things as foliage density and plant height. Replacing asphalt with grass, for example, can radically change our thermal perception.\nThe Urban Systems group at the LESO-PB believes that, in the future, architects and urban planners will need to work together in designing the space between buildings, which is just as important as the space inside them (leso.epfl.ch/urbansimulation).\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press Service EPFL\n +4179 502 81 06\nSilvia Coccolo\n Postdoctoral Researcher\n +41 21 693 4543\nJean-Louis Scartezzini \nDirector of the Laboratory of Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory\n +41 21 693 55 49", "summary": "In the year 2100, temperatures at EPFL are expected to be similar to those currently experienced in Perugia, in central Italy.

The country’s long tradition of neutrality, together with its world-caliber expertise recognized by research institutions across the globe, make it ideally placed to lay the groundwork for the new concept of digital trust. “Digital trust will be at the core of our strategy,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, the Center’s academic director. “We want to become a center of excellence in the field, where all of our partners – regardless of how they are using digital services – can find answers to their questions and support for their goals.”\nThe Center will address the three critical challenges of this digital era: cybersecurity, which involves making sure that data transferred across networks cannot be hacked; transparency, which means making it clear how data is processed, sent and stored; and personal data protection, so that sensitive information, such as bank account details and medical records, stays out of malevolent hands. Engineers at the Center will work in parallel to develop new systems and methods in all three areas.\nHigh-level partners in close relationship to the citizens and the industry\n The Center will combine EPFL’s renowned expertise in cybersecurity, sensitive data protection and blockchain and smart-contracting technology with the advanced capabilities of institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), as well as companies including ELCA, SICPA, Swisscom, Swissquote, SGS and SwissRe, who have already stated their strong interest in joining the Center.\nThese partner organizations are in direct contact with individuals and businesses, and will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution. The organizations will also contribute their own experts to the research being done at EPFL in order to develop solutions to concrete problems, and will help to fund the Center.\nTwo new EPFL chairs and 24 labs involved\n EPFL has created two new teaching and research chairs in digital trust, and the search for candidates is already under way. The School also has 24 research labs in this field, mostly within the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, the School of Life Sciences and the College of Management of Technology. “It’s a genuine ecosystem that addresses the needs of the entire population. The challenges are so great that there’s no way we could overcome them without a cross-disciplinary approach,” says Hubaux. The first step will be to develop trust technologies and systems that can form a bedrock of trust between users and service providers – thereby encouraging the adoption and effective use of new technology.\nDesigned with ambitious goals in mind, the Center got an additional boost from the Swiss Federal Parliament’s decision to cap budget cuts in the areas of education, research and innovation. EPFL will leverage this opportunity to invest in research that will tackle not only the challenges mentioned above, but also those that are bound to come.\nSupport from the Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland\n The Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland (the cantons of Vaud, Neuchatel, Valais, Geneva, Bern, Fribourg and Jura), currently headed by Pierre Maudet, a member of Geneva’s cantonal government, has applauded the initiative. “This new partnership between the public and private sectors will position Switzerland as a major player in both cybersecurity and the digital trust that our society needs. We encourage all companies and research institutions working in this field to join in,” says Maudet. Philippe Leuba, the member of the Vaud cantonal government who handles innovation-linked relations between the cantonal government and EPFL, adds: “Our region is home to businesses and institutions at the forefront of digital technology, and which attract top-quality international investment. Their position as pioneers in this new partnership with EPFL augurs well for the development of Industry 4.0 in our country.”", "summary": "EPFL President Martin Vetterli has today unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust.

{"id": 170, "text": "The “classical” role for a gene is to produce proteins, which are essential for the functioning of cells. However, our genomes also encode genes that produce long non-coding RNAs, whose functions are more mysterious. Yet, since four or five years ago we know that thousands of these still poorly understood genes are present in the human and mouse genomes. How and in which organs are they activated? Is this biological “dark matter” much ado about nothing or is there something more interesting to it?\nA team led by Professor Henrik Kaessmann at UNIL’s Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) compiled an authentic catalog of long non-coding RNAs in eleven species. By adopting an evolutionary approach, they discovered that about 2500 long non-coding RNAs first appeared at least 90 million years ago in the common ancestor of most placental mammals. From a functional point of view, these “ancient” genes turned out to be particularly interesting.\nFirst author of the \nNature\n article, Anamaria Necsulea, scientist at the Laboratory of developmental genomics of EPFL, expanded the scope of the investigation on these long non-coding RNAs to six primate species (man, macaque, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan), and to mouse, opossum (a marsupial mammal), platypus (a monotreme mammal that lays eggs and nurses its young with milk), as well as to an \"external group\" composed by a bird (chicken) and an amphibian (frog). The common ancestor of all these species goes back over 350 million years.\nGenes maintained during evolution\nThe biologists used the CIG genomics platform and the Vital-IT computing center at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to identify long non-coding RNAs in several major organs of the 11 species under scrutiny. \"Thanks to bioinformatics, we discovered RNA sequences produced from genome locations where no genes had been previously mapped,\" she said. \"We then analyzed these genes to find out whether or not they encoded proteins. Thus, we could identify between 3000 and 15000 long non-coding RNA genes, depending on the species.\"\nIn the second phase of the research, a comparison among the different species allowed the scientists to pinpoint the emergence of these genes in the evolutionary history. While 11,000 long non-coding RNAs are shared by all primates, 2,500 go back to an ancestor common to man and mouse, about 90 million years ago. Only a hundred genes of this kind stem from an ancestor common to all eleven species considered, including birds and amphibians. \"One of our main findings is that the activity of these non-coding genes is controlled by the same transcription factors that regulate protein-coding gene activity. Even more strikingly, we found that the 2,500 oldest long noncoding RNA genes are regulated by factors that are important for embryonic development. This suggests that, among the 2500 long non-coding RNAs conserved during the evolution of placental mammals, a large percentage may function specifically in embryonic development.\"\nNew network of interactions\nThe third phase of the research allowed the scientists to highlight a network of interactions (specifically, co-expression interactions, that is: genes are activated in the same organs or cell types) involving both long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. For instance, they found that some non-coding genes are strongly associated to protein coding genes involved in brain function or in spermatogenesis, which suggests similar functions for these long non-coding RNA genes.\n In the case of the H19X gene - one of the most ancient long noncoding RNA genes identified in this study - its association to the placental mammals’ H19 gene (which was the first long non-coding RNA identified years ago) helped to uncover its functioning: \"The H19 prevents the placenta from excessively growing inside the mother's womb,\" said Anamaria Necsulea. \"We can assume that H19X also contributes to this function. We now plan to disable this gene in mice to test its functions in the placenta.\"\nAmong the subcategories of RNA producing genes, are these long RNA genes more useful than it originally seemed? By tracking them in 11 different species, this new study of unprecedented scale suggests that some of our genomes’ \"dark matter\" may play a role in the development and functioning of the most vital organs of our bodies. Future experimental studies will further clarify the role of these genes that have just revealed their first secrets to us.", "summary": "Biologists have studied the functionality of a poorly understood category of genes, which produce long non-coding RNA molecules rather than proteins.

{"id": 182, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.

{"id": 195, "text": "When the World Wide Web was invented at CERN 30 years ago, no one talked about open science. But the internet has become one of the pillars of open science, providing researchers with a way of sharing information with colleagues around the world.\nIn January 2017, soon after taking office, EPFL President Martin Vetterli launched the  in order to raise awareness about this important topic. One key element was the creation of the Open Science Strategic Committee (OSSC), whose members provide EPFL’s Senior Management with input on how to best promote open science. We met with Professor Katrin Beyer, who chairs the OSSC, to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by open science at EPFL and beyond.\nHow open is science today?\nScience is definitely more open now than it was five or ten years ago, and almost certainly less than it will be five or ten years from now. It is increasingly common to share research outputs beyond the traditional manuscript - such as code and data - and this practice will soon be ubiquitous. One thing we notice when discussing the topic of open science among colleagues is that significant differences exist between disciplines. This does not necessarily mean that some are more open than others – they’re simply open in different ways.\nIn some fields it is standard to share preprints; in others open data has a long tradition. Open data seems to be particularly well-established in places where researchers use a large shared infrastructure, such as CERN. These communities have worked for a long time on establishing data-format and documentation standards. It seems much harder to create such standards when everybody has their own laboratory and, often, their own experimental set-up.\nOpen science initiatives touch on several key aspects of the research process – publications, research evaluation, career promotion, funding allocation and so on. Does that mean the whole process is flawed?\nThe process is certainly flawed when it comes to access to scientific literature. Some big legacy publishers now control the majority of the journals in most fields and have profit margins of 30–40%, effectively channeling public money into the pockets of private investors. Many universities simply cannot afford to pay the subscription fees. And while illegal services such as Sci-Hub bring more equality to researchers around the globe, relying on pirated access to knowledge is not a sustainable strategy. We need to do better.\nThat said, open access as it is implemented today does not necessarily solve the economic or equality issue. If it becomes expensive to publish, everyone will be able to read the literature, but only a few will be able to publish it. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\nIn terms of career promotion and evaluating candidates for funding, in theory, the framework is already in place. Many universities, including EPFL, have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which states that researchers should be judged not just on how many articles write and the prestige of the journals in which they publish, but on all types of research output, and that quality should come before quantity. However, in practice, hiring committees evaluating large numbers of applications within a short period of time can find it difficult to implement DORA, because assessing the quality of a variety of research outputs is more time consuming than looking at numbers and journal titles. This remains a challenge.\nHow will open science affect the research community?\nOne major objective of open science is to increase the reproducibility and reusability of published work, and I think this will accelerate science in general and increase its impact. Open science also implies a more inclusive research environment. Being part of an established network of researchers is not necessary anymore to get access to data or code – any researcher anywhere in the world can build on these research outputs.\nYoung researchers may benefit the most from open science. They also have a key responsibility: they contribute a significant part of the research and need to make sure it’s produced and documented so that others can easily build on it. Research institutions need to support them in this endeavor and ensure they have all the methodological tools they need.\nWhat is EPFL’s strategy?\nThe OSSC wants to promote a bottom-up approach to open science. Researchers know best where their disciplines are going, how to innovate in the way their community shares information, and what will have a real impact in making their field more open. But it is EPFL’s responsibility to listen to its researchers and develop the services and infrastructure that will make a clear difference in supporting those striving to implement open science in their daily routine.\nIt is important for EPFL to provide training opportunities at the same time. The summer school session called “Open Science in Practice,” which took place in September, gave PhD students a look at projects and tools that other early career researchers have used in their research practice. Teaching by example is the best way to convince people that open science is possible and has a greater impact, and that good practice does not necessarily require a lot of time. The School’s library also offers a range of courses on tools that make it easier to implement open science, along with expert advice on topics such as open access and data management. We recommend expanding this catalogue even further.\nIs EPFL a pioneer in open science?\nI think EPFL is ahead of the curve, since it works hard to explore the most promising avenues and tries to be innovative in its support for open science on campus. Martin Vetterli is very outspoken about it. And to be fair, many EPFL researchers started working openly well before the OSSC was set up. The Swiss Data Science Center, for example, is a driving force in this area and a real asset. Its Renku platform may change how we track the research process, and it could significantly reduce the time required for careful documentation.", "summary": "As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, EPFL is highlighting his commitment for open and reproducible research through an exceptional Open Science Day, today.

Since 2010, roughly one-half billion francs have been invested by the private sector, who are betting on the potential of these young companies.\nEPFL spin-offs – companies that develop a discovery or invention within EPFL laboratories – claim the lion’s share. They account for 185 of the 220 million francs invested in 2014. The remaining 35 million are for start-ups that, although they may not have developed technologies at EPFL, have moved to the campus’ Innovation Park to enjoy its dynamism and to work more closely with the school’s scientists.\nSome companies have achieved a high increase in their capital, such as Mitokyne or Anokion.

{"id": 200, "text": "Coral reefs are dying on a massive scale around the world, and global warming is driving this extinction. The planet’s largest reef, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, is currently experiencing enormous coral bleaching for the second year in a row, while last year left only a third of its 2300-km ecosystem unbleached. The demise of coral reefs heralds the loss of some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching in the Maldives. Photo credit: The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers\nNow, scientists have shown that corals in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Northern Red Sea are particularly resistant to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The results are published today in the journal \nRoyal Society\nOpen Science.\nThe implications are important, as the Gulf of Aqaba is a unique coral refuge. The corals may provide the key to understanding the biological mechanism that leads to thermal resistance, or the weakness that underlies massive bleaching. There is also the hope that the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs could be used to re-seed deteriorated reefs in the Red Sea and perhaps even around the world.\nScientists at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (Université de Lausanne) in Switzerland, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period. They found that the corals did not bleach.\n “[Under these conditions,] most corals around the world would probably bleach and have a high degree of mortality,” says EPFL scientist Thomas Krueger. “Most of the variables that we measured actually improved, suggesting that these corals are living under suboptimal temperatures right now and might be better prepared for future ocean warming.”\nInterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nAt the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, the scientists exposed corals of the species \nStylophora pistillata\n, collected from the Gulf of Aqaba, to water temperatures and acidification. The conditions resemble the summer conditions of a future ocean in this region if local ocean warming continues at its current rate of approximately 0.4-0.5°C per decade. They performed an overall health check of all the major physiological functions of the corals, measuring variables like energy metabolism, the ability to build a skeleton, and nutrient exchange at the molecular level between the coral-host and their algae symbionts. These physiological variables were mostly unaffected by the harsh experimental treatment. Still, further work on ecologically relevant variables like fertility or competitive performance is needed.\nSymbiotic corals live together with an algae partner, much in the same way humans are in symbiosis with gut bacteria. Just as bacteria in the gut aid with digestion, providing valuable nutrients to the rest of the body, the algae that live within the coral-partner provide nutrients to the corals. The bacteria in our body thrive within our digestive tract, just as the algae benefit from living within the coral partner. Bleaching occurs when the colored algae are ejected by their coral-partner, and the symbiosis breaks down. If the algae do not return, the coral dies.\nCorals growing at the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nPre-acclimated to thermal tolerance\nThe coral species \nStylophora pistillata \noccurs in other regions of the world, and beyond the Gulf of Aqaba, does not necessarily demonstrate thermal resistance. The biological mechanism that underlies the robustness of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs is still unknown, but the scientists have an idea of how the species evolved to become thermally resistant.\n“Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba are pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance due to the special geography and recent history of the Red Sea,” says scientist Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences.\nAt the end of the last ice age, corals started recolonizing the whole of the Red Sea through the southern connection to the Indian Ocean. The thermal bottleneck at the southern entrance with summer water temperatures rising to 30-32°C provided a selective barrier, allowing only highly resistant individuals to move north. Ironically, this heat-resistant founding population encountered much cooler waters once reaching the northern end, where the Gulf of Aqaba is located.\nBased on this, the study hypothesized that these corals might be able to better cope with today’s ocean warming, considering that they not only descended from a heat-selected founding population, but they also started their warming trajectory from a lower temperature, compared to their counterparts in the central and southern Red Sea.\nProtection of the Gulf of Aqaba Reef\nDespite being resistant to global warming, the corals from the Gulf of Aqaba are still vulnerable to other stresses like pollution.\n“Local disturbances, such as local oil pollution, nutrients from fish farms, herbicides from gardening, may reduce the exceptionally high tolerance of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs,” says Fine.\n“This reef should receive international recognition as a natural site of great importance, because it might very well be one of the last reefs standing at the end of this century,” says Anders Meibom of EPFL. “I would like to encourage the countries around the Gulf of Aqaba – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel – to get together and create a strong protection environmental program, because even if these corals are resistant to rising water temperatures, they are still sensitive to local pollution, overfishing etc, and they need to be protected from this now.”\nScientists Anders Meibom (left) of EPFL/ UNIL and Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel.", "summary": "Coral reefs in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures.

{"id": 201, "text": "Mission accomplished! The CHEOPS satellite, named for “CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite,” successfully blasted off into space on Wednesday after a technical fault with the carrier rocket pushed the launch back by 24 hours. The satellite, which will search for planets orbiting around distant stars, is now flying along its planned path, some 700 km above the Earth’s surface. CHEOPS is the culmination of six years of work, much of which was carried out at the University of Bern and University of Geneva, in collaboration with researchers from EPFL’s Space Center (eSpace) and with support from the European Space Agency (ESA). The launch comes seven days after two astrophysicists from the University of Geneva – Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz – received the Nobel Prize in Physics in Stockholm for their 1995 discovery of the first exoplanet.\nThe satellite, which is equipped with a high-precision telescope, will seek out new exoplanets by looking for tiny variations in a star’s brightness as a planet passes between it and Earth – a method known as transit photometry. CHEOPS will also gather more information about known exoplanets, including their size, orbital elements, atmosphere and evolution, as well as their composition and nature: telluric, gas, ice giant, surface water and other features.\nEPFL involved from the outset\nThe project was a collaborative effort between three Swiss institutions: EPFL, the University of Geneva and the University of Bern. Engineers at eSpace were involved in the early phases of the mission, and worked on the satellite’s initial design. In 2012 the ESA selected CHEOPS, based on that initial design, as its first small-class (or S-class) mission, a type of smaller-scale program intended to promote innovation and education. From that point on, EPFL’s involvement largely revolved around designing the software that would be used to analyze the raw data sent back by the satellite.\nSince the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995, over 4,000 more have been added to the list – orbiting around some 3,000 stars, and all within 400 light years of the Sun. Thousands of other candidates have been detected, mainly by ground-based telescopes, but are pending confirmation. Extrapolating these numbers suggests that there could be at least 100 billion exoplanets in our galaxy alone.\nCHEOPS separated from its carrier rocket around 2 hours and 30 minutes after launch and is expected to begin sending back data in early 2020.\nPicture: (c)ESA", "summary": "The CHEOPS satellite was put into orbit on Wednesday, a day later than planned, from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.

EPFL's Space Engineering Center, eSpace, is planning a series of birthday events: a reunion of the satellite’s designers, conferences, personal accounts, previously unseen videos, and the retransmission of one of the satellite’s overhead passes. Plus, a mobile app will soon be available for those interested in keeping tabs on the satellite.\nThere is good reason to celebrate. This little CubeSat – measuring only 10 cm x 10 cm – is now playing with the big boys: it’s the oldest European satellite in its category to still be active. Only four other CubeSats have lasted longer, and they are all of Japanese design. The world record holder has been in orbit for 13 years.\nEarly on, no one thought SwissCube had the stamina. When it was launched, it was expected to function for about four months. And it even got off to a bad start: when it reached orbit it started spinning and couldn’t be used until it stabilized several months later.\nRisky decisions\nSwissCube’s long lifespan is a tribute to the 200 or so students who worked in succession on the project under the guidance of Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace. Over the years, a number of decisions that were considered highly risky at the time proved to be judicious. This includes the use of low-cost components that had never before been used in space.\nThe little satellite, orbiting at an altitude of 720 kilometers and a speed of nearly 7,500 meters per second – 28,000 kilometers per hour – still regularly transmits its position, system status and images back to Earth. That said, the satellite had to be completely rebooted on two separate occasions in recent years owing to system failures. The CubeSat rebooted properly both times, offering further proof of its sound design.\nIt is now starting to show more serious signs of fatigue. “It’s probably nearing the end of its travels,” said Simon Dandavino, the executive director of eSpace. “Its communications system is less responsive, and its data transmission capability is faltering.”\nSwissCube should eventually be picked up by CleanSpace One, the space cleanup satellite currently being built at eSpace. The purpose of that project is to develop solutions to the problem of space debris and demonstrate the feasibility of applying them in the space environment. SwissCube will therefore serve experimental purposes up to the very end.\nAn app, never-before-seen images and a replica\nSwissCube’s birthday celebration has a lot in store for its fans.

At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago. Initially, they didn’t believe their results and reran the experiment several times. Some things have changed since then, but we’re still dealing with noisy data, right?\nYes, when we first created the black-hole image, or at least the day we got the data, we entered it into an imaging script and a ring appeared. I actually went from being really excited to being mad at the colleagues who gave us the data – which I was convinced were fake. It just seemed too good to be true! Nothing ever works like that the first time. It was just so much more beautiful than any synthetic data we had created. It actually took weeks before I believed the data were real, and that our colleagues weren’t trying to trick us or test us.", "summary": "The first-ever image of a black hole was unveiled to the public this past April.

The AGORA – Cancer Centre will be able to accommodate 400 researchers and clinicians on 11,500 m2 as early as 2016.\nThe AGORA - Cancer Centre exists specifically to bring together scientists and practitioners under one roof as part of a community of expertise.\n Created as a gigantic “toolbox” in the fight against cancer, the interactive, integrated AGORA centre allows everyone to draw on the pool of resources available in an effort to combat the disease: ground-breaking progress in understanding the mechanisms specific to each pathology, optimized management of targeted therapies, networking of advances benefiting patients under treatment. ‘Bringing together doctors, researchers and bio-engineers under one roof will stimulate collaborative efforts that will lead to major breakthroughs in therapeutic strategies aimed at cancer sufferers’, stated enthusiastically Professor Georges Coukos, Head of the oncology department at CHUV and Director of the Ludwig Centre at Lausanne University.\nBehnisch Architekten: an iconic building dedicated to tomorrow’s research\nBoth interdisciplinary and disciplinary communication as the central element of successful research will be evident in the organization of the floor plans. Communication plays a central role both inside and outside the entire building,’ commented prize-winning architect, Stefan Behnisch, at the opening of the competition exhibition on CHUV premises today. The agora, the public level of the Cancer Research Center, connects as well to the existing pathways of the campus and beyond as internally, within the building to the laboratory and office levels with their individual communication areas and informal workplaces.\n The internal organization of the programmatic areas offers the users a high level of flexibility to provide the necessary freedom for future changes.\n The building skin is designed to enhance daylight use in the depth of the building. In specific areas operable windows allow for natural ventilation. This provides for a better individual climate control. The daylight enhancement systems, optimized sunlight protection, a responsible management of natural resources in the construction and maintenance of the building, as well as the use of both renewable and the existing energy systems on the site, are the preconditions for a successful and sustainable working environment. This, together with the outstanding research goals will create the future oriented image for the new facility.\nThe SCCL – Swiss Cancer Center Lausanne\n Many rich and complementary collaborations have long existed between the researchers at UNIL and EPFL and the clinicians at CHUV. The creation of the SCCL formally marks the ambition of three major Institutions to pool and co-ordinate their different areas of expertise in the field of oncology and improve the synergies between fundamental researchers and clinicians. The goal? To bring to the bedside as soon as possible the new treatments to emerge from this coordinated research.\n50% of the project’s financing already guaranteed\n The AGORA – Cancer Centre is a project implemented by the ISREC Foundation and a number of partner institutions with a budget of 70 million Swiss Francs. The ISREC Foundation has made it possible to launch the project with an initial installment of 15 million. ‘We are delighted today to see the project in motion and to have been able to unite all actors in cancer research around a common goal’, stated Jean-Marc Tissot, Director of the ISREC Foundation, today, before continuing ‘for the ISREC Foundation, which is celebrating its 50th birthday next year, making it possible to bring together researchers and clinicians has always been one of our priority goals.’ Aside from the 15 million, two donations of 10 million each have also been bequeathed to the ISREC Foundation in support of the project.

Named CHEOPS for “CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite,” the selection of this device was just announced by the European Space Agency (ESA). This satellite, which will be put in orbit in 2017, is the result of collaboration between the University of Bern and the University of Geneva, EPFL, and ETHZ. It will also receive technical support from institutes in Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, Austria, Sweden, and possibly other European countries that demonstrate interest. In terms of EPFL, the Swiss Space Center will work on the design of the device.\nCHEOPS will be equipped with a telescope of a meter and a half in length that has a diameter of 30 centimeters. It will be placed into orbit at an altitude of 800 kilometers, on the frontier between day and night. From there, over the course of three years it will observe some 500 particularly bright stars and gather as much information as possible about their planets. To do this, it will use the method of detecting transits, in other words, diminishing brightness when the planet passes between its star and the earth. Although minute, these movements are detectible by sharp instruments such as the telescope from this Swiss project.\nGas or Telluric\nFor these measurements, researchers can calculate the diameter of planets that eclipse their stars. This complementary detection method, called radial velocity, measures their mass. In combining these two pieces of information, one can determine both the density of these objects and whether they are more likely gaseous, like Jupiter or Saturn, or telluric, like Mars or Earth. The first exoplanet, 51 Peg b, was discovered in 1995 by two astronomers of the Astronomical Observatory of Geneva, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz.

{"id": 232, "text": "06.07.17 - A deep-learning algorithm developed by the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory scientists can generate melodies that imitate a given style of music. The “Deep Artificial Composer” could one day generate convincing music for multiple instruments in real time, with applications ranging from video games to helping composers in the creative process. What’s new with the DAC is that the artificial intelligence learns to compose complete melodies without any music theory from start to finish, solely based on a large database of existing music. No human postproduction is necessary.\n19.07.17 - Scientists from NCCR Robotics at EPFL and at the Lausanne University Hospital developed an algorithm that adjusts how a mobile harness, suspended from the ceiling, assists patients suffering from spinal cord injury or stroke. In a clinical study with over 30 patients, the scientists showed that the patients wearing the smart walking assist immediately improved their locomotor abilities, enabling them to perform activities of daily living that would not be possible without the support.\n31.07.17 - Scientists at the Lab of Andrea Ablasser have now discovered that a DNA-sensing mechanism of the innate immune system — which is pivotal for the immediate defense against pathogens — controls cellular senescence. The work highlights potential novel anti-tumor and perhaps anti-ageing strategies.\n23.08.17 - A researcher at the Ecological Systems Laboratory discovered a sustainable method for improving the slash-and-burn farming practices traditionally used in Madagascar, whereby a wooded area is burned to create a field for growing crops. Slash-and-burn farming also plays a role in the island’s deforestation. The environmental engineering student spent two years conducting tests in two villages in the southwest of the country. The fruit of her labors is a socially responsible and environmentally friendly system that involves generating compost and refurbishing water wells.\n04.09.17 - More than 5,000 visitors came on EPFL's campus for three days to attend the EPFL Drone Days. Drones races certainly, but research and innovation were also in the spotlight with booths presenting the drones of the future, an exhibition of robotics, conferences, demonstrations and workshops for young and old. Switzerland’s fastest drone pilot was crowned following a spectacular race.\n12.09.17 - A new drone, developed at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems with funding of NCCR Robotics, uses cutting-edge technology to deliver parcels weighing up to 500 grams. The device will never get stuck in traffic, it’s programmed to avoid obstacles, and it can reach destinations on steep or uneven terrain. Its protective cage and foldable design mean that it can be carried around in a backpack and used in total safety.\n13.09.17 - Many cancers are known to metastasize and spread by expanding nearby lymphatic vessels. This process, lymphangiogenesis, also helps the tumor evade the patient’s own immune system, and it would be expected that inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, which are only effective in a minority of patients. But scientists from EPFL and the US found the opposite: lymphangiogenesis actually enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy against melanoma. The study has significant implications for new types of cancer therapies.\n15.10.17 - The Swiss team and their solar house, the NeighborHub, has won the prestigious Solar Decathlon 2017 competition in the Unites States. The Swiss Living Challenge and its multidisciplinary team - 4 schools, 250 students (44 in Denver), 150 supervisors from the professional and academic sectors, and close to 50 sponsors - received the highest award. This unique experience is not only an important victory, but also an unforgettable and educational human adventure. The Swiss team made the audacious bet of coming up with a different concept, proposing a house at the service of a community, rather than a family home. \n17.10.17 - Given the growing number of users and the widening range of devices, streaming is no longer viable in its current form owing to the substantial amount of power and storage capacity it requires. But researchers at EPFL’s Embedded Systems Laboratory have found a way to reduce those requirements without impacting the quality of the video itself. \n31.10.17 - Paraplegics suffer from no longer feeling their legs, but the condition is often accompanied by neuropathic pain due to the spinal cord lesion. The patient feels pain originating from the legs, even though nothing else can be felt below the lesion. Now, virtual reality may be the key to providing pain relief for this type of pain, and the solution comes from restoring a sense of touch. In breakthrough research the scientists of the Foundation Bertarelli Chair in Cognitive Neuroprosthetics show that phantom body pain can be reduced in paraplegics by creating a bodily illusion with the help of virtual reality. \n08.11.17 - Researchers at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory have developed a miniature robot that can integrate perfectly into schools of zebrafish. It can swim with fish, learn how they communicate with each other and make them change direction or come together. Their work was carried out as part of an EU research program among six partner institutions\n.\n15.11.17 - The EPFL Extension School is offering people with no prior university degree the chance to get an EPFL qualification. The EPFL Extension School is particularly well suited to professionals looking to study in an innovative field without having to give up their day job. It offers courses on concrete topics that are directly linked to the job market. The school's first continuing education course, Applied Data Science – Machine Learning, offers students who successfully complete the course a Certificate of Open Studies, a new type of academic qualification for the moment offered only by EPFL.\n29.11.17 - Professor Xile Hu, an expert in catalysis, has been awarded the 2017 National Latsis Prize. Hu, who was born in China and came to Switzerland in 2007, founded the Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Catalysis at EPFL. He is known for his innovative approach, which consists of combining the concepts and methods associated with three different types of catalysis (homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic), which traditionally have remained separate. This approach has led to unprecedented understanding of fundamental catalysis and enabled the discovery of new catalysts with properties superior to those of previous materials.\n01.12.17 - In artificial intelligence (AI), machines carry out specific actions, observe the outcome, adapt their behavior accordingly, observe the new outcome, adapt their behavior once again, and so on, learning from this iterative process. But could this process spin out of control? Possibly. AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped. EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots. Their work makes a major contribution to the development of autonomous vehicles and drones, for example, so that they will be able to operate safely in numbers.\n12.12.17 - Thanks to a donation from the Werner Siemens-Foundation, EPFL will set up a Center for Artificial Muscles, collaborating initially with the University Hospital of Bern (Inselspital) and then with the University Hospital of Zurich. The first project, slated to span the next four years, will focus on developing a less invasive cardiac assistance system for treating heart failure. This prosthetic device – a ring around the aorta – will avoid the complications of hemorrhaging and thrombosis because it will not be in contact with blood. A facial-reconstruction project aimed at restoring patients’ ability to create facial expressions will follow.\n19.12.17 - EPFL President Martin Vetterli has unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust. Eight institutional and industrial partners are already willing to join. This new research platform will aim to be a center of excellence for IT security and personal data protection in the digital era. These partner organizations will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution.
