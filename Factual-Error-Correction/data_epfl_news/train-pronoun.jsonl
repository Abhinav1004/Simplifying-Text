{"id": 0, "text": "The rising number of drones in air space poses numerous challenges. Topping that list is our ability to simply detect these small unmanned aerial vehicles. Periodic near-misses between drones and large airplanes raise the specter of disaster, and the drones themselves often lack the necessary technology to locate other moving objects. To address these issues, EPFL researchers have developed algorithms capable of detecting and tracking small flying objects using a simple camera. The proof of concept was conducted as part of a PhD dissertation, and a real-time detection and collision avoidance system is now being developed in a project funded by the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI).\nToday’s collision avoidance systems operate actively: an airplane in flight calculates its position, altitude and course, and communicates this information to other aircraft using the same technology. Those aircraft can then evaluate the risk of a collision based on their own positioning data and, if necessary, alert the pilot. But this system is only effective as long as all aircraft are equipped with the same technology. In reality, drones often lack such systems, which are costly and heavy and consume more power.\nArtificial intelligence and Deep learning\nA camera can thus be an effective, non-cooperative (i.e., not every aircraft must be equipped with it) addition to that system, provided the camera can successfully detect a flying drone. Therein lay the obstacle that researchers at EPFL's Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB) sought to overcome. The biggest challenge for a moving camera is to spot another moving object. This is much more difficult on a drone than it is on a car, which only moves in two dimensions. Drones move in three dimensions, and the camera is called on to detect objects against the sky or the ground, depending on the angle of sight. Plus, drones need to locate objects as quickly as possible, such as when they are still fuzzy black dots against a dark forest. And the fact that no two drones look alike anymore – new models are constantly being developed – meant that the researchers had to find a way to teach the camera to recognize all sorts of drones.\nIn his thesis, Artem Rozantsev showed that these challenges can be overcome. The first step consisted in using artificial intelligence and deep learning to teach the camera to recognize drones. His method combined information on both appearance (types of drones, position, etc.) and motion (movement in the camera's field of view), as neither alone was capable of achieving sufficiently reliable detection. He therefore proposed a machine-learning technique that operates on spatio-temporal cubes of image intensities where individual patches are aligned using a regression-based motion stabilization algorithm.\nReal-time performance and accuracy\nBut the recognition algorithm on its own was not enough. To train a detector to recognize all types of drones in all kinds of positions, it has to have \"seen\" as many as possible. The existing database of images, however, is limited. So Rozantsev filled in the gaps by generating realistic synthetic images. The generated images, which are based only on a small set of real examples and a coarse 3D model of the object, are used together with the real examples to train the detector. A key ingredient to his method, the generated images are as close as possible to the real ones – not in terms of image quality, but according to the features used by the machine-learning algorithm.\nThe researchers managed to develop a reliable algorithm capable of detecting a drone using a lightweight camera similar to those found in smartphones. The aim of the project, now financed by the CTI, is to train a detector using an even larger data set to improve its real-time performance and accuracy. EPFL's CVLAB researchers are working on this in collaboration with FLARM Technology AG, the leading supplier of affordable collision avoidance technology for civil aviation.

{"id": 1, "text": "Some stars end their lives dramatically. They explode in a halo of light as extremely intense as it is brief – as in, milliseconds. This grand finale, called a supernova, occurs particularly with massive stars that have more than 100 times the mass of the sun.\nThe explosion produces light but simultaneously rejects iron, calcium, sodium, and other heavy elements from the periodic table of elements. Since it is very rare to observe the explosion of a star, it is often from these chemical elements released into the universe that astrophysicists trace, in function of elapsed time, the number and type of supernovae that have exploded. To shed light on the many questions that remain regarding this difficult-to-observe phenomenon, researchers rely on simulations and theoretical models of all the physical processes present (gravity, momentum, cooling gas, etc.).\nFor his master’s thesis Alexis Arnaudon is interested in improving simulation software on EPFL’s supercomputer, primarily targeting supernovae in dwarf galaxies. These aggregations of around 10 billion stars (versus 200 to 400 billion for large galaxies) are of particular interest for research on the origin of the formation of galaxies due to their relatively independent evolution from the rest of the universe. Their small mass preserves them from numerous collisions with other galaxies.\nArnaudon began by replicating the explosion of an isolated star. The goal was to correct some faults of the program and to improve resolution. Using a new supernovae model, he also calibrated the software to reproduce the galaxies already observed, Fornax and Carina. These results are a first step toward achieving more accurate models.\nThis phenomenon, which can occur two to three times per century in the Milky Way alone, constitutes a force that is the most destructive and creative in the universe. The shock wave from the supernova promotes the formation of new stars by initiating or accelerating the contraction of regions in the interstellar medium. And these chain reactions begin a process that forms stars, planets, and – why not? It happened on Earth – plants, air, and so on. “We now know that the vast amount of material and energy they eject is fundamental to creating a new galaxy,” explains the student.", "summary": "Summer Series.

{"id": 2, "text": "When they need to change direction, increase their speed or counter headwinds, birds alter the configuration of their wings. To steer, for example, they spread one wing and slightly retract the other. By adjusting their wingspan in this way, they create a calculated imbalance that causes them to turn. Up to now, only birds could do this so effectively.\nAfter observing birds in flight, researchers from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems had the idea of building an energy-efficient winged drone capable of changing its wingspan, flying at high speed and moving through tight spaces. Their research has just been published in the Royal Society journal Interface Focus.\nDario Floreano and his team wanted to develop a bio-inspired drone that could meet various aerodynamic requirements. It had to be capable of flying between obstacles, making sharp turns and coping with strong winds. By changing its geometry mid-flight, the drone can meet all these criteria. The moving part is located on the outer wings. It works like a bird's quill feathers, which are the large feathers at the edge of the wing.\n\"We were inspired by birds: they can radically transform the size and shape of their wings because they have an articulated skeleton that is controlled by muscles and covered in feathers that overlap when the wings are folded,\" explained Matteo di Luca. The drone also has feathers that it can fold and overlap like a fan.\nOne of the many challenges was in designing and building the complex morphing mechanism, in other words, mimicking nature to construct the drone. \"It is extremely difficult to find the right balance between aerodynamic efficiency and the weight of the device,\" explained Stefano Mintchev. The wing is composed mainly of composite materials in order to maximize strength while reducing overall weight.\nMorphing wings that can adapt to the environment and weather conditions are also an important issue in aeronautics. Engineers are still trying to find the ideal replacement for the rigid wings and ailerons of planes. For Floreano, the head of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, this is a promising project: \"With the foldable wings, we discovered that we didn't need ailerons to help the drone turn. By changing the wingspan and surface area during flight, we could make it turn automatically.\"\nThis winged drone therefore opens up new possibilities. Because of its ability to adapt, it could prove very efficient at low altitude, in an urban environment where winds change rapidly.\nThis work was funded by NCCR Robotics.\nReference\nDi Luca M, Mintchev S, Heitz G, Noca F, Floreano D. 2017 Bioinspired morphing wings for extended flight envelope and roll control of small drones. \nInterface Focus 7: 20160092. \nPress kit", "summary": "A drone has been equipped with feathers to increase its precision during flight.

The only catch is that these websites are often used as a platform for related apps that provide cloud-based services like photo editing, PDF merging and editing, content searching and analysis, to name just a few.\n“We want to let users know the risks they take when using these services and give them a better way to assess these risks,” said Hamza Harkous, a PhD candidate at the LSIR and the lead researcher on this project.\nWhere, when and with whom?\nThe “Accept” that users mechanically click so they can use an app to touch up a photo, for example, can open the door to the users’ entire photo collection – and to the sometimes very detailed date- and location-related information tagged to the photos. Someone could use that to figure out where and with whom the user had a drink on Tuesday at 6pm or where the user went on vacation last summer. Blindly accepting the permissions of a document filing service can also provide access to other types of data. And as a result, a third party could see who the user's main collaborators were and what topics were discussed, or figure out the user's opinions on various issues by analysing the most frequently occurring words. \n “If they want to use these services, users sometimes have no other choice but to provide access to additional information, and in so doing they sacrifice some of their privacy,” said Rameez Rahman, an LSIR researcher who oversaw the project. “The requested permissions often cover a much broader array of data than the services really require to function.”\nPrepare to be surprised!\nTo assess the scope of the problem, the researchers analysed more than seventy apps that are offered on two cloud platforms: Google Drive and Dropbox.

What does the Minergie label add to this tradition?\n Today, Minergie is more than a label; it is now part of Switzerland’s building code to build energy efficient buildings. EPFL former PhD student Ruedi Kriesi, back in 1994, created the label that combines several building technologies to reduce energy consumption. Not only does a Minergie building have to consume no more than 3 liters of fuel for every square meter—which means 5 times less than a traditional construction—it must also have a controlled ventilation, selective double glazed windows, external shading and appropriate thermal insulation. Moreover, Minergie buildings are simply more comfortable to live in.\n And you are working with EPFL Middle East to bring this to the UAE?\n We have seen, through extensive computer dynamic simulations, that similar techniques work in a desert climate. The same principles that are used to reduce heating loads in Switzerland can be adapted to reduce cooling loads, all the while improving thermal comfort. Working with EPFL Middle East Dean Franco Vigliotti, who heads the project, we even hope that the future EPFL research center will include several Minergie buildings. An exchange student from Politecnico di Milano is working in our labs, using a urban simulation program developed at EPFL (CitySim) to extend the Minergie concept to encompass an entire neighborhood or research hub.\nWhat are the obstacles?\n The major obstacles will be cultural ones, not technical. In Switzerland, it took many years and careful coordination between the professional associations of the building sector and the federal and cantonal governments to make such rewarding progress. In the UAE it will surely need a top-down decision to implement such standards. Only then will the construction sector follow.\nWhy is this important for a country like the UAE?\nIt is important for the whole world. Switzerland is currently a 6.5 Kilowatt per person society (average power used per capita on a 24/7 basis). We have to reduce this to 2 Kw in the upcoming years. But the UAE is currently a 12 kW society. If we are serious about mitigating climate change, we need to transfer our knowledge about building envelops to regions that have high energy consumption or even potential high consumption, as with India and Asia.\nWhat is the next step?\nThe next step is critical. Not only are we building on what we have learned in building science over the past 30 to 40 years, we are also taking advantage of our experience in terms of policy changing. We hope, like was done in Switzerland, to build pilot and demonstration buildings where decision makers can visit and feel the difference.

{"id": 8, "text": "A single click of the mouse triggers a surge of snapping devices and the activation of a multitude of connections. Finally, from one click to the other, the amount of electricity consumed becomes more and more significant. In fact, Internet currently represents 8% of the energy annually used in Switzerland, a figure that could soon reach the values of 15% to 20% in the coming years.\nIn order to respond to this situation, researchers at the Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL) at EPFL, affiliate of the EcoCloud consortium, have devised a solution that achieves significant energy savings, \"of at least 30%, and even up to 50% less of what is consumed today, \"said David Atienza, ESL director.\nThis new tool, called \"Power Monitor System and Management (PMSM) \", provides the means to monitor and track the power consumption of a data center. It can also be used to distribute the workload among several servers, computers that host the services offered on the Internet such as emailing, file sharing, business operations, data storage etc.\nThe system consists of an electronic box comprising a set of sensors. Each one of them can be connected either to the racks’ main power or directly to one of the cables supplying energy to the electronic components of the server. By measuring the current passing through it at some point, the sensor can gauge the power used, log the energy consumption variations and control that the system does not overheat. The information recorded is transmitted to a central server where the PMSM software is running. It is then processed together with other data - such as the room temperature or the priorities of the ongoing operations- and the system creates a table showing the evolution of the servers’ energy consumption, which can be accessed remotely and in real time.\nMore power in less space\nThe advantage of this invention is that it provides a precise and unique overview of the use of a server farm. In addition, this system is able to carry workloads from one machine to another, thus allowing significant energy savings. \"Two servers running at 40% of their capacity each, consume much more than only one at 80%\" explained David Atienza.\nDeveloped at the request of Credit Suisse, which is seeking to reduce the energetic and economic cost of its data centers, this new tool has already been installed on the racks of approximately 5200 servers of the bank’s data center in Zurich. According to Marcel Ledergerber, responsible for the management of this complex, the solution proposed by the ESL laboratory is particularly attractive to them since it contributes to a process of \"server virtualization\" that the bank has been undergoing for some years already. Such a process aims at progressively reducing the number of servers hosting a gradually greater computing power.\"The PMSM system allows us to concentrate our machines in a smaller space\", he said. \"The specific information that it provides allows us to better control the issues of temperature, and thus manage our installations more safely.\"", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a device intended for monitoring and saving the energy consumed by large data centers.

{"id": 12, "text": "An EFPL professor has decided to communicate findings from his research in a film – an atypical approach carried out by an atypical researcher in a scientific environment that traditionally favors the written word for its publications. In his film, Jacques Lévy constructs a dialogue between the famous Italian writer, Italo Calvino, and his own scientific discoveries. In “Invisible Cities,” Italo Calvino has Marco Polo describe 55 cities that he imagines him to have visited to the great emperor Kublai Khan. In this project, the Levy draws on a range of themes, such as trade or memory, touched on by Italo Calvino. His manifesto builds on a patchwork of sequences filmed in numerous Chinese cities and photographs taken on all four corners of the globe over almost 13 years.\nCities are the most productive way of bringing people together. They are a concentrate of everything that exists in a society. They always hide something new, something unexpected, because they are at the same time banal and extraordinary. We feel comfortable in cities; we know how they work. Yet merely walking through a city, we sense a tension between a feeling of surprise and one of being at home. What I found interesting in the research that led up to this film was the relationship between the singularity of each individual city and the increasingly standardized concept they are built upon.\nWhat is behind this unifying aspect? \nIn a way, the same causes lead to the same effects. For instance, every city needs a transportation network, otherwise its various areas do not communicate. Consider the subway line in New Delhi. It’s fascinating to see how the residents force themselves to wait for the passengers exiting the metro to do so before they embark. In a society where the notion of public property is only weakly present, where other people are hardly considered if they are strangers, and where the idea of urban discipline is still rather vague, this subway is somewhat the antithesis of Indian cities. A kind of self-conditioning is taking place, and you can tell that they are in the process of learning. New Delhi’s subway line is unique in that it is New Delhi’s subway line, but at the same time, it is a lot like any other subway on the planet.\nWhat is the connection to literature? \nCities are a genre, in the same way that detective stories are a literary genre. They all follow the same rules. But the beauty of the genre arises from variation within these rules, where creativity is constrained, but present nonetheless.\nAnd why use cinema to carry this message?\nI did not aim to make a popular film, but rather to understand specifically how video could contribute in a project that is based on the same principles as the work leading up to any other scientific publication. Here, the premise is to strengthen the viewer’s lucidity, rather than weakening it. A commercial fictional film is formatted for a certain type of reaction. In the spirit of research, the opposite has to be the case. Readers, or the audience, always have to be in a position that lets them criticize or refute the work. That means that we have to keep them awake, not put them to sleep.\nWhy did you choose to cite Calvino? \nItalo Calvino is a close companion of mine and has been accompanying me for a long time now. I’ve read and re-read him over and over again. He has had a strong influence on me and is one of the reasons behind my desire to study cities at a deeper level, not only as a theoretical object. I feel strongly in tune with Calvino’s approach, not only at the interface between science and art, which have to be considered as two distinct entities, but also in assuming the fact that there are hybrid zones, in which the researcher is concerned with aesthetics and the artist with knowledge. For me, “Invisible Cities” by Calvino is a general treatise about cities, broken up into chapters. I tell my students that it is the best treatise on urban geography and that, to this day, I cannot offer them anything better in the scientific domain.\nOne thing struck me in China: the way citizens appropriate public spaces. To me, these spaces are the quintessence of urbanity, contributing to what distinguishes one city from many of the other possible spatial configurations. The way I see it, urban designers are not the sole designers of public spaces; the people that frequent them and occupy them play their part as well. In China, citizens take over public spaces that could just as well have remained unused or mediocre. They bring along their instruments, or play music on their stereo systems to dance or do sports to, without any form of conceit. It seems so simple to do, yet this is something that you don’t find everywhere in the world, in particular in Europe, which has a long tradition of public spaces.\nThe film \"Urbanity/ies\":", "summary": "In a cinematographic manifesto, Jacques Levy, a geographer and urban designer at EPFL, offers a scientific and artistic investigation of cities.

{"id": 20, "text": "When bananas age they become covered in black spots caused by the enzyme tyrosinase. It is a natural browning process common among certain organisms, including food. This same enzyme also plays a role in the type of skin cancer known as melanoma. This cancer’s tell-tale spots are the result of a malfunction in the regulation of tyrosinase. The malfunction disrupts the pigmentation of the skin by melanin, the body’s natural protection against the sun. Chemist Tzu-En Lin took advantage of the fact that tyrosinase occurs in both ripe fruit and human melanoma to develop an imaging technique capable of measuring tyrosinase levels and its distribution in human skin.\nResearch was first conducted on ripe fruit and then on samples of cancerous tissue. It was shown that the level and distribution of tyrosinase was indicative of the stage of the disease. It is not very apparent in stage 1; in stage 2 it is present in large amounts and evenly distributed; and in stage 3 it is unevenly distributed. The team, which is directed by Hubert Girault at the Laboratory of Physical and Analytical Electrochemistry at Sion (EPFL Valais Wallis), determined that this enzyme is a reliable marker of melanoma growth.\n “The spots on human skin and on a banana peel are roughly the same size. By working with fruit, we were able to develop and test a diagnostic method before trying it on human biopsies,” said Dr. Girault.\nThe researchers made a scanner with eight microelectrodes lined up like the teeth of a comb and as flexible as the fingers of a hand.

They can empty suddenly and cause flooding, as the Swiss town of Zermatt recently discovered. One solution being studied is the controlled use of water from glacial lakes; that would enable engineers to drain them quickly in the event of an emergency, such as if a large chunk of glacier fell into a lake.\n“The main idea here is to explore several ideas at once, because the most effective way to improve the safety of people living in areas affected by glacial retreat is to deploy not just one but a combination of systems,” says Anton Schleiss, an honorary professor of civil engineering at EPFL and former head of EPFL’s Platform of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH).\nThe LCH has teamed up with other Swiss institutions like the University of Zurich and the Center for Research on the Alpine Environment (CREALP) on an eight-year research project on glacial retreat in Peru.

He set up measurement stations at glacial lakes to continuously monitor and predict the flow rate of rainwater as it runs off into catchment areas, along with changes in air temperature and water levels.\nEPFL researchers also developed models for predicting the lake swells that would be caused if a piece of large rock or glacier formation suddenly broke off and fell into a lake, triggering impulse waves. Their model can be used to design more effective dikes and other structures.\nThe GLACIARES+ project is being carried out in association with the NGO Care Peru as well as with a number of Peruvian universities and government agencies.

{"id": 32, "text": "Image:\n A model of a double-bridged peptide (the peptide in light blue, the two bridges in yellow). The background of the figures shows many examples of skeletons (also named \"scaffolds\" or \"backbones\") of double-bridged peptides (credit: C. Heinis/EPFL)\nPeptides are short chains of amino acids that can bind to proteins and change their function. They show high binding affinity, low toxicity, and are easy to synthesize, all of which makes peptides ideal for use in drug development, and many naturally occurring peptides such as insulin, oxytocin, somatostatin and the antibiotics vancomycin or polymyxin B, are already successfully used like that.\nHowever, using peptides as drugs faces two challenges. First, binding affinity: Good binding requires difficult peptide architectures and amino acid sequences that are perfectly complementary in shape and charge to the surface of their target proteins. Second, peptide stability: peptides can potentially be cut by enzymes (proteases) into smaller and useless fragments or even single amino acids.\nThe  has now addressed both of these challenges by developing the new peptide format that they call \"double-bridged peptides\". These are chains of 10-15 amino acids, four of which are chemically connected by two bridges. Each bridge links a pair of two cysteine amino acids – four in total.\nBecause the four cysteines can be placed in many different ways along the sequence of amino acids, the double-bridging strategy allowed the researchers to generate an enormously large number of structurally diverse peptide architectures. They expanded the diversity even further by using different chemical reagents that increased the number of bridges. The scientists also found that the four cysteines could be bridged by two linkers in three different ways, giving rise to three different architectures from each single peptide sequence.\nUsing this strategy, the researchers produced an enormous diversity of peptide structures, all with different “skeleton” structures. In addition, the chemists systematically changed the amino acids between the cysteines and generated libraries of billions of different double-bridged peptides. After screening the libraries, the researchers were able to isolate high-affinity binders to important protein targets.\nOne of these targets was kallikrein, a plasma protein that is associated with hereditary angioedema, a rare swelling disorder. Another was interleukin-17, a cytokine protein implicated in several inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Using the double-bridge approach for both these protein targets, the scientists developed peptides that could bind them efficiently at nanomolar concentrations. In the case of kallikrein, the peptides could bind it for more than an hour before dissociating.\nStability was also a highly attractive feature of the new peptide format. The double-bridged peptides are hardly degraded by proteases in the blood, which is a great advantage because it keeps the peptides from being eliminated too quickly, thus extending their therapeutic effects.\nBased on the results, Heinis’s lab is now applying the peptide format to many other disease targets. They have already developed new, even larger double-bridged peptide libraries and screened them against a range of disease-relevant targets. One of these peptides is already undergoing pre-clinical evaluation.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a new type of \"double-bridged peptide\" that can be tailored to bind tightly to disease targets of interest.

{"id": 33, "text": "It has become common practice to draw on pension fund assets to purchase a home. But this financial instrument, which will be referred to as “promoting homeownership,” is becoming increasingly controversial, to the point of being called into question altogether. Does it pose a threat to future homeowners? And was it responsible for the sharp rise in property prices?\n In his study, Philippe Thalmann, professor in economics and architecture and president of the Federal Commission for Accommodation, shows that the promotion of home ownership is not to blame for the sharp rise in property prices. However, it can put owners at risk, in particular when the market falters. Here, he responds to some preconceived notions that we put to him.\nThe Swiss government is seeking to allow a maximum number of people to own the home they live in. \n“Indeed, it is a mission that is enshrined in the Federal Constitution. The main argument for this is that Switzerland has one of the lowest home ownership rates among comparable countries. So what? We could just as well highlight the fact that Switzerland is among the countries with the highest proportion of tenants, and leads a small group of countries that came out of the 2008 economic crisis comparatively unscathed. On the other hand, homeowners are often considered to be better citizens because they have stronger ties to their neighborhood and village, and because they supposedly take better care of their homes. There is also a political argument. Simplifying, it can be said that tenants lean left politically, while homeowners lean to the right.”\nThe promotion of homeownership can only be used to reduce the down payment towards a home. \n“When you buy a home, you have to make a down payment of at least 20% of the price. Usually, the rest is financed using a mortgage, which is taken up with a bank. Pension assets can contribute to the down payment, but since 2012, only up to a maximum threshold of 10%.\nAlternatively, pension assets can also be pledged to replace part of the debt, bringing it down below 80%, which means also means lower interest payments. Although this means that you receive less benefits when you retire, you will have been able to save more leading up to your retirement – at least in principle. This approach is rarely adopted, in particular because debt is so cheap today and minimizing debt has not been a priority for people. The main obstacle when purchasing a home is finding the means to make the down payment.”\nPromotion of homeownership to purchase real estate is largely risk-free to those that decide to use it. \n“The risk lies not such much in the fact of using your pension assets. Rather, it lies in the fact of becoming a homeowner with little financial margin. It’s fine if you buy at the right time and the housing market continues to climb. If, however, you buy when the market is strong, and then it collapses, you can be in trouble. The bank may ask you to pay back part of your debt on short notice, given that your property will have lost part of its value. This happened in the 90s when the housing market collapsed. The homeownership promotion scheme is a financial tool that lets people become homeowners without being fully aware of, or underestimating, the risks.“\n“Over the past years, it has been the best possible investment, with a return on investment that I estimate at 30% per year, due to an average yearly increase in housing prices of 6%.\nBut what goes up quickly tends to come back down. The rise in housing prices was fueled by sinking interest rates and strong immigration. But now, interest rates can sink no further, and the Swiss population voted against immigration last February. Both phenomena that propped up housing prices have fallen away, which means that they will fall again. Once they begin to drop, the extraordinary returns of the past could become equally extraordinary losses. If you make a 20% down payment towards a home and its value drops by 6%, you lose one third of your down payment.\nAdditionally, by withdrawing a large part of your pension assets, you significantly reduce your retirement and freeze your wealth in your property. Remarkably, many owners have been forced to seek support from social services to pay for their health insurance. This was obviously not the objective, and social services now consider that things have gone to far. The point was not to give handouts to people that own their homes!”\nBy promoting homeownership, younger people can afford to purchase a home. \n“It is more nuanced than that. The average age at which people become homeowners, which is relatively high in an international comparison (between 35 and 40 years), stays the same, largely because it takes time to save enough to make the down payment and accrue enough money in your pension fund. But it has helped people from lower income classes become homeowners, who would never have been able to do so based on their savings alone. But again, they don’t purchase their home any earlier than their peers that do not have to rely on their pension funds.\nOver the past decade, pension funds have registered over 400,000 early withdrawals, with the number of homeowners increasing only by 250,000 units. That means that all of the withdrawals are being used to purchase a home. \n It isn’t quite that simple. Many individuals make multiple withdrawals. Sometimes, both spouses withdraw capital for the same investment. Based on a variety of indicators, I estimate that 210,000 households took advantage of homeownership promotion between 2001 and 2012. But turning to how the capital was used, the number of new owners is much higher than the increase in the number of owned accommodations. Indeed, many people became owners by purchasing an existing home or apartment from someone that lived there previously. Again here, the exact numbers are unavailable and indirect indicators have to be used. I estimate that 640,000 households became owners between 2001 and 2012. That means that the households that used their pension assets only represent one third of the pool of new owners.\nPromotion of homeownership led to the rise in housing prices. \n“We didn’t observe a sudden jump in prices immediately following the introduction of the homeownership promotion scheme in 1995. Instead, the evolution of the prices was progressive and continuous, despite the fact that the number of beneficiaries has been falling since it peaked in 2003. Therefore, it cannot be held responsible for the increase in housing prices that we’ve experienced over the past decade.”\nThe study was presented during a meeting organized to mark 20 years of encouraging homeownership on September 3 and 4 at the University of Fribourg.", "summary": "For twenty years, Switzerland has been promoting homeownership by letting residents draw on their pension fund assets to buy a home.

{"id": 38, "text": "Like our own bodies, cells have their own skeletons called ‘cytoskeletons’ and are made of proteins instead of bones. These network-like structures maintain the cell’s shape, provide mechanical support, and are involved in critical processes of the cell’s lifecycle. The cytoskeleton is an object of intense scientific and medical research, which often requires being able to observe it directly in cells. Ideally, this would involve highly-fluorescent molecules that can bind cytoskeletal proteins with high specificity without being toxic to the cell. Publishing in\n Nature Methods\n, EPFL scientists have exploited the properties of a new fluorescent molecule, also developed at EPFL, to generate two powerful probes for the imaging of the cytoskeleton with unprecedented resolution. These probes pave the way for the easier and higher quality imaging of cells, offering many scientific and medical advantages.\nThe cytoskeleton is a large structure inside cells that provides them with mechanical support, keeps their three-dimensional shape and internal organization, and enables them to move and divide. It consists of three major sub-structures inside the cell, which are made up of long, filamentous proteins: tubulin and actin.\nCurrent techniques for observing the cytoskeleton can be difficult to get into living cells, can be toxic, and are usually limited in resolution and duration, since the signal wears off over time. A common technique is fluorescence microscopy, where fluorescent molecules (‘probes’) are attached to cell structures and then ‘lit up’ against a dark background.\nThe team of Kai Johnsson at EPFL has developed novel fluorescent probes that can easily enter live cells, are non-toxic, have long-lasting signals, and most importantly, offer unprecedented image resolution. In 2013, the researchers developed a fluorescent molecule called silicon-rhodamine (SiR), which switches ‘on’ only when it binds to the charged surface of a protein like the ones found on the cytoskeleton. When SiR switches ‘on’, it emits light at far-red wavelengths.\nThe challenge was getting SiR to bind specifically to the cytoskeleton’s proteins, actin and tubulin. To achieve this, the scientists fused SiR molecules with compounds that bind tubulin or actin. The resulting hybrid molecules consist of a SiR molecule, which provides the fluorescent signal, and a molecule of a natural compound that can bind the target protein. One such compound was docetaxel, an anticancer drug that binds tubulin, and the other jasplakinolide, which specifically binds the cytoskeletal form of actin. Both compounds, which are used here in very low, non-toxic concentrations, can easily pass through the cell’s membrane and into the cell itself.\nThe probes, named SiR-tubulin and SiR-actin, were used to visualize the dynamics of the cytoskeleton in human skin cells. Because the light signal of the probes is emitted in the far-red spectrum, it is easy to isolate from background noise, which generates images of unprecedented resolution when used with a technique called super-resolution microscopy.\nAn additional advantage is the practicality of the probes. “You just add them directly into your cell culture, and they are taken up by the cells”, says Kai Johnsson. The probes also do not require any washing or preparation of the cells before administration or any subsequent washing steps, which greatly helps in maintaining the stability of their environment and their natural biological functions.\nThe scientists believe that they can extend their work into other types of proteins and tissues. “Cytoskeletal structures are imaged by biologists all the time”, says Johnsson. “Up to now, no probes were available that would allow you to get high quality images of microtubules and microfilaments in living cells without some kind of genetic modification. With this work, we provide the biological community with two high-performing, high-contrast fluorogenic probes that emit in the non-phototoxic part of the light spectrum, and can be even used in tissues like whole-blood samples.”\n ---\nThis work represents a collaboration between EPFL’s Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering (ISIC), Institute of Bioengineering (IBI), and the Bioimaging and Optics Platform (BIOP), with the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Chemical Biology; the Max-Planck Institutes for Biophysical Chemistry (Göttingen) and of Molecular Physiology (Dortmund); the Friedrich-Schiller-University’s Institute of Organic Chemistry (Jena); and the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (IMBA) (Vienna).\nReference\n Lukinavičius G, Reymond L, D’Este E, Masharina A, Göttfert F, Ta H, Güther A, Fournier M, Rizzo S, Waldmann H, Blaukopf C, Sommer C, Gerlich DW, Arndt HD, Hell SW, Johnsson K.

Such an “optical prism” relies on a physical phenomenon (refraction) to split light into its constituent frequencies.\nNow, a prism exists for sound. Hervé Lissek and his team at EPFL have invented an \"acoustic prism\" that splits sound into its constituent frequencies using physical properties alone. Its applications in sound detection are published in .\nThe acoustic prism is entirely man-made, unlike optial prisms, which occur naturally in the form of water droplets. Decomposing sound into its constituent frequencies relies on the physical interaction between a sound wave and the structure of the prism. The acoustic prism modifies the propagation of each individual frequency of the sound wave, without any need of computations or electronic components.\nThe acoustic prism\nThe acoustic prism looks like a rectangular tube made of aluminum, complete with ten, perfectly aligned holes along one side. Each hole leads to an air-filled cavity inside the tube, and a membrane is placed between two consecutive cavities.\nWhen sound is directed into the tube at one end, high-frequency components of the sound escape out of the tube through the holes near the source, while low frequencies escape through the holes that are further away, towards the other end of the tube. Like light through an optical prism, the sound is dispersed, with the dispersion angle depending on the wave’s frequency.\nThe membranes are key, since they vibrate and transmit the sound to the neighboring cavities with a delay that depends on frequency. The delayed sound then leaks through the holes and towards the exterior, dispersing the sound.\nAngular detection by frequency\nTo take the concept a step further, the researchers realized that they could use the acoustic prism as an antenna to locate the direction of a distant sound by simply measuring its frequency. Since each dispersion angle corresponds to a particular frequency, it’s enough to measure the main frequency component of an incoming sound to determine where it is coming from, without actually moving the prism.\nThe principle of the acoustic prism relies on the design of cavities, ducts and membranes, which can be easily fabricated and even miniaturized, possibly leading to cost-effective angular sound detection without resorting to expensive microphone arrays or moving antennas.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have invented a new type of “acoustic prism” that can split a sound into its constituent frequencies.

Materials departments also have a greater role to play.”\nSimone’s openness is a product of his prior career experience. After his initial training in materials, this native of Italy “tightened nuts on the LHC” at CERN as part of his thesis. “I learned a lot from this experience, which got me started in research and helped acquaint me with Switzerland.”\nHe earned a PhD at EPFL in laser welding and then worked in the fields of optics and solar energy, helping launch two start-ups along the way. His next foray was into the railway sector, where he worked at MATISA, a company that makes rolling stock. He found this to be a “fascinating field” combining tradition and modernity. “The rail sector is one of the keys to the future of transportation, where it has a fundamental role to play.” Looking beyond simplistic and expensive solutions based on further expanding infrastructures, Simone prefers to optimise what currently exists through modelling.\nA role in decision making\n TRACE’s mission is also to find industrial and public partners to finance research projects. In the same multidisciplinary spirit, Simone seeks an ongoing interaction with companies at several levels. He has in mind both long-term framework contracts and assignments lasting only several months. Railways, automobiles, the sociology of mobility, aeronautics: he clearly aims to branch out into other fields of work and enter into more collaborative arrangements.\nTopping things off, the new deputy director feels that TRACE should play a greater role on the advisory boards of major public and private institutions, as is the case already with the Swiss Federal Railways. “It’s an opportunity to provide input and to influence decisions before they are taken. This is particularly important given the fact that decisions in the area of transportation are implemented over the very long term. This will allow us to involve our laboratories and to expand our collaborative undertakings. It’s a virtuous circle.”", "summary": "In the five years since its founding, EPFL’s Transportation Center (TRACE) has already begun more than 75 research projects with partners in the public and private sectors.

{"id": 43, "text": "Coral reefs are home to up to one-third of global marine biodiversity and, as such, are a high conservation priority. Yet these precious ecosystems have declined rapidly in the past 20 years, resulting in significant species loss and bringing socioeconomic hardship to tropical regions of the world that rely heavily on fishing and tourism. This decline is driven by bleaching, the process by which coral dies.\nBleaching occurs when coral suffers from heat stress, which weakens the organism and can ultimately lead to its demise. “The future of coral reefs will depend on coral’s ability to adapt to warming oceans,” says Oliver Selmoni, a doctoral assistant at EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG). “Temperature is the leading cause of coral death. We’ve found a way to predict which corals are best equipped to cope with heat stress – data that’s currently absent from global conservation strategies.”\nIt is already known that certain corals are more accustomed to surviving in warmer waters and, therefore, better able to cope with abnormal temperature spikes. But extrapolating this knowledge to the scale of an entire reef has so far proved difficult. This new piece of research is a joint effort between EPFL and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) based in Nouméa, New Caledonia, with the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI). In addition to developing a method for locating so-called “adaptive” corals, the team also sought to determine how this information could be used to better protect corals by reinforcing their adaptive potential. \nA two-pronged study\nThe study marks the first time that the principles of environmental genomics have been applied to the marine environment to support coral reef conservation. The researchers focused on a flagship coral species in Japan’s Ryukyu Archipelago, cross-referencing the results of a genetic analysis with satellite data showing changes in environmental conditions – specifically, ocean temperature – over the past 30 years.\nThe team developed a model that uses objective, quantifiable and mappable variables to predict which genotypes are associated with adaptability and, therefore, make it more likely that a particular coral will be better suited to surviving in a given environment. They discovered six genomic regions involved in promoting resistance to heat stress. “We were able to identify individuals carrying potential heat-stress-adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighboring reefs,” says Selmoni.\nScaling up\nAt present, governments establish marine protected areas (MPAs) according to the level of threat posed by human activity. The EPFL team is calling for a different approach, with conservation efforts focusing on reefs with the greatest chance of survival because they carry the adapted genotypes. Another option would be to encourage genetic mutations by transplanting adaptive corals into reefs that are less able to withstand rising temperatures.\nFollowing a successful proof of concept, the model was incorporated into a web application that ranks corals by adaptability. The tool, developed for MPAs managers, will be scaled up in the future as the EPFL team studies other coral species and adds more genotypes to the database. The model is also set to be deployed in two other parts of the world. The Transnational Red Sea Research Center, founded by Professor Anders Meibom at EPFL and supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), will use it to support coral reef conservation work in the Red Sea, and ManaCo, a network operating in the Pacific region, will likewise add the model to its suite of marine conservation tools.", "summary": "Climate change is threatening the world’s coral reefs, and saving them all will prove impossible.

{"id": 46, "text": "Deep-learning systems, a major breakthrough in computer-based image recognition, are however surprisingly sensitive to minor changes in the data they analyze. Researchers at EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS4), headed by Pascal Frossard, have shown that even the best deep-learning architectures can be fooled by introducing an almost invisible perturbation into digital images. Such a perturbation can cause a system to mistake a joystick for a Chihuahua, for example, or a coffee-maker for a cobra. Yet the human brain would have no problem correctly identifying the objects. The researchers’ findings – which should help scientists better understand, and therefore improve, deep-learning systems – will be presented at the  conference, a major international academic event. We spoke with Alhussein Fawzi and Seyed Moosavi, the two lead authors of the research.\nWhat is deep learning and what is the problem with today’s systems?\n Fawzi: Deep learning, or artificial neural networks, is an exciting new development in artificial intelligence. All the major tech firms are banking on this technology to develop systems that can accurately recognize objects, faces, text and speech. Various forms of these algorithms can be found in Google’s search engine and in Apple’s SIRI, for instance. Deep-learning systems can work exceptionally well; companies are considering using them to detect tumors from a CAT scan or to operate self-driving cars. The only problem is that they are often black boxes and we don’t always have a good grasp of how they function. Should we just trust them blindly?\nIs it really surprising that we can fool these systems?\n Moosavi: Researchers had already shown two years ago that artificial neural networks could easily be tricked by small perturbations designed specifically to confuse them on a given image. But we found that a single, universal perturbation could cause a network to fail on almost all images. And this perturbation is so tiny that it is almost invisible to the naked eye. That’s alarming and shows that these systems are not as robust as one might think.\nHow does “deep learning” work?\n Moosavi: Deep-learning algorithms are learning algorithms designed to identify the important information in data sets. They consist of virtual “machines” built from artificial neural networks that are essentially neurons stacked in layers, with each layer performing a simple calculation.\n We can show a machine a thousand images of cats, for example, and tell the machine that these are “cats.” Roughly speaking, the first layer of neurons will analyze the low level features, such as the edges and corners, the second the basic shapes, and so on, until the machine pieces together the entire shape of a cat. The machine thus learns on its own from many images; each layer builds on the results of the previous one to perform its own calculations. The name “deep learning” comes from this progressive, layer-by-layer approach.\nFawzi: Once the machine has learned to recognize a cat, it can identify cats in images it has never seen. It is “smart” enough to recognize objects in new contexts – it doesn’t just work by memorization.\nHow did you carry out your study?\n Fawzi: We calculated the smallest possible perturbation that could throw off the image-recognition algorithms of the best learning systems. This perturbation prevented the systems from correctly recognizing most natural images. The perturbation was basically just a slight change in the value of an image’s pixels. To the human eye, there was only a very minor difference between the original and modified images. But for the deep-learning systems, the difference was huge. A sock was identified as an elephant; a green plant as a macaw. What was really astonishing was that the same perturbation could fool many different types of systems.\nMoosavi: Going back to the cat example, a human being – even a two-year-old – will have learned what a “cat” is after seeing five images, even if the images are combinations of pictures and drawings. As humans, we have an inherent ability to look at the big picture and ignore small perturbations since they don’t change the underlying concept displayed in an image. But deep-learning systems are not capable of such abstraction. They don’t identify a concept but rather sort through a logical series of clues. And that’s what can lead to classification errors.\nWhat problems would this cause in real-world applications?\n Moosavi: Our goal is to better understand deep-learning systems so that we can improve their performance. Right now there is a lot of interest in deep-learning applications for medical imaging, such as to identify certain proteins or tumors. But when it comes to healthcare, having fool-proof technology is essential. So we must have a good understanding of the limitations of existing systems, so that we can make them more robust and capable of delivering guaranteed results.\nSince it was fairly easy to find our perturbation, it isn’t a stretch to imagine that people with bad intentions could also come up with ways to trick deep-learning systems. That could create potential security threats, for instance.\nSo what’s the next step? \n Moosavi: We think more theoretical research needs to be done on deep learning. We would like to see scientists look more closely at how artificial neural networks work, their properties, their considerable potential – and the associated risks. The code we used in our research is available to the public, so anyone can test the perturbation and study the problem further. In terms of our next steps, we plan to learn more about how complicated architectures of artificial neural networks work, so that we can make them more robust. We are already in contact with some potential partners that seem interested in our approach.\n-----\n Source:", "summary": "“Is this your sister?” That’s the kind of question asked by image-recognition systems, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in our everyday devices.

{"id": 51, "text": "Divided into small groups of eight, and led by a tutor who will follow them during the whole term, the students perform mammoth teaching exercises such as analysis and physics. Previously, there could be 30 to 50 students in the same classroom, with only a few assistants to help them with the exercises. This meant that anyone who was having difficulty would sometimes have to wait a long time before being able to put his or her questions. “The outcome of the evaluations we performed shows that the students are very satisfied with the format of this tutoring”, explains Nadine Stainier of CRAFT. In 2010, 11 teaching programs used this approach, and no fewer than 1250 students benefited from the support of the pool of 220 tutors. The medium-term objective of CRAFT will be to allow each student to follow at least one course of analysis or physics in this format, whatever section he or she is in.\nThe Vice-Presidency for Academic Affairs at EPFL, responsible for training, has decided to support the concept of tutoring, and to double the budget in 2011. This is because it sees the potential of offering first-year students a high-quality learning framework that also emphasizes the human and relational aspects. The students thus acquire the necessary methodology to manage to complete the exercises in analysis and physics, while at the same time successfully integrating within the campus, where they will need to find their feet and develop new relationships. They will also benefit from the group dynamics: “We’ve even noticed that some groups have continued to work together outside the tutoring program, in disciplines other than analysis and physics”, points out Jean-Louis Ricci, also of CRAFT.\n Participation in the exercise sessions remains high throughout the term, and the students appreciate the possibility of sharing and pooling problems to be solved. This enables them to better understand the problems and assimilate them. “If you have understood a problem and then you explain it to others, you understand it even better!” remarks one of them.

When he's not studying, he works for a Fribourg-based company set up by his brother and other students. \"We make videos, do thermal imaging, monitor the progress of construction projects and create 3D models of plots of land,\" he explains. After reading an article about fawns being accidentally killed by farm machinery during the harvest season, he realized that his drone could serve an unexpected purpose.\n\"When they hear the tractors coming, fawns lie down in the tall grass rather than running away. They're almost invisible. When I read the article, we'd just bought a thermal camera, and the idea came to me immediately,” says Jobin. Up to now, farmers called on gamekeepers and hunters – who are responsible for protecting wildlife as well as managing it – to clear the fields of the animals. \"Gamekeepers also have thermal imaging devices that they use to sweep the fields on foot, but this flattens the grass and is very time-consuming,\" explains Jobin.\nBefore the crack of dawn\nThe farming community was extremely interested when Jobin pitched his idea.

{"id": 54, "text": "An important factor in these new, small-scale satellites is their system of communication: bearing in mind the small surface available, finding the right solution is a real challenge. Following an international competition launched by the ESA, EPFL was chosen for its innovative antenna solutions.\n These antennas, which will equip the new generation of nano-satellites, are the result of a three-way cooperation between the Laboratory of Electromagnetics and Acoustics (LEMA, Juan R. Mosig and Gabriele Rosati), the JAST company located in the EPFL Science Park (Stefano Vaccaro and Jose Padilla), and the EPFL Space Center (Anton Ivanov). “For this type of research, it’s not unusual to have international cooperation, but in this case it’s a 100% Swiss consortium”, enthuses Juan R.Mosig of LEMA, a specialist in antennas and telecommunication.\n As always with technology, the current trend for satellites is towards miniaturization. We have seen the development of real “monsters” of more than 1000 kilos that were so costly to develop and launch that only governments could afford them. Now, smaller and lighter alternatives can be considered, known respectively as micro-satellites (between 10 and 100 kilos), nano-satellites (between 1 and 10 kilos), and pico-satellites (1 kilo or less).\n The ESA project concerns new-generation nano-satellites, weighing about 10 kilos and in the shape of a cube whose edge measures 25 centimeters. It’s a daunting challenge: to find an antenna with a frequency ensuring a satisfactory output (2 to 3 Ghz) on a small-scale satellite that can commutate between omnidirectional emitting mode (distress-beacon type) and directive emitting mode. EPFL’s solution – chosen by the ESA – is a flat antenna, integrated into the surface of the satellite. By avoiding any protruding parts, the satellite is very compact and easy to manipulate during the launch phase.\n After one-and-a-half years’ work, the LEMA solution of, JAST and the EPFL Space Center was to use the four sides of a cube-form satellite. Commutation between sectorial and omnidirectional modes can thus be easily achieved. The antennas were initially simulated by computer by LEMA, and then developed and manufactured by JAST. Finally, the behavior of the antennas in space was validated, using the anechoic chamber at LEMA – a place with no echoes, partitioned off, and with a perfect absorption of the waves.\n The ESA sees a big market for medium-size satellites like the nano-satellites. With their reduced weight, the cost of launching is reduced, and they can serve many purposes. They are of a suitable size for staying close to the Earth and performing observations of our planet (ocean currents, temperature variations, concentration of pollutants etc.). They can be deployed in groups for telecommunications, or focused on a celestial body to study exoplanets, for example.

{"id": 56, "text": "Researchers at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory (LSRO), which is headed by Professor Francesco Mondada, have developed a miniature robot that can integrate perfectly into schools of zebrafish. Their work was carried out as part of an EU research program among six partner institutions,* and the findings were recently published in \nBioinspiration & Biomimetics.\n“We created a kind of ‘secret agent’ that can infiltrate these schools of small fish,” says Frank Bonnet with a smile. Bonnet is a post-doc researcher at the LSRO and one of the study’s authors. The robot is seven centimeters long – longer than the fish it’s modeled after but with the same shape and proportions. It is equipped with magnets that link it to a tiny engine installed under the aquarium to propel it through the water. The researchers chose zebrafish, or \nDanio rerio\n, for their study because it’s a robust species whose schools tend to switch direction and move about very quickly.\nThere are two aspects to the research program. The first deals with biology, studying the social interactions between individual fish. Here the robot helps scientists generate targeted stimuli and test the fish’s response. The second aspect deals with robotics, and this is where the EPFL researchers focused their work.\nFinding the right criteria\nFirst, the team determined the key criteria that would allow the robot to integrate into schools of zebrafish and subsequently influence their behavior. These included the fish’s physical characteristics, like shape, color, stripes, etc. Their behavioral characteristics were also taken into account, such as linear velocity, acceleration speed, the distance between individual fish, the size of the schools, their vibrations and motion, and the rhythm at which they move their tails.\nThe researchers also wanted to develop a closed-loop system in which the robot is able to not only influence the fish’s behavior, but also adapt its own behavior by learning how to communicate and move like they do. As a result, the robot’s swimming mechanism – initially designed with the help of biologists – gradually improved as the robot spent more time with the fish.\nFollow me!\nThe team tested their robot in different aquariums, some of which had delineated areas like little rooms and corridors. The tests involved ten schools of four zebrafish each that interacted with the robot. For each test, the researchers recorded the position and movement of individual fish, the movement of the school as a whole and the robot’s propensity to integrate into the school. They then compared their results with observations made on schools of five zebrafish swimming under the same conditions, but without the robot. And their findings were unequivocal. “The fish accepted the robot into their schools without any problem,” says Bonnet. “And the robot was also able to mimic the fish’s behavior, prompting them to change direction or swim from one room to another.”\nSimilar studies had already been carried out at the LSRO, but on cockroaches. “Fish are much more complicated animals. To integrate into an insect community, a robot simply has to emit certain kinds of pheromones. But integrating into a community of vertebrates seems to involve many more criteria, in terms of such things as appearance, movement and vibration,” says Bonnet.\n*Université Paris Diderot\n– LIED,\nUniversity of Graz – Artificial Life Lab\n, \nCybertronica research, University of Zagreb – LARICS, FCiências.ID – Associação para a Investigação e Desenvolvimento de Ciências, EPFL - LSRO.", "summary": "A new miniature robot developed by EPFL researchers can swim with fish, learn how they communicate with each other and make them change direction or come together.

{"id": 62, "text": "You have been appointed dean of ENAC until 2024. What do you hope to achieve during this time?\nWe are facing an array of challenges with major implications for our society. These challenges include climate change – as reflected in the growing #FridaysForFuture movement [a series of climate marches led by activist Greta Thunberg] – the depletion of our natural resources, the energy transition and the relentless pace of urban development. To tackle these challenges a holistic approach is required. At ENAC, we have a major strength in this respect: our skills in architecture, civil and environmental engineering give us unique competencies and synergies for developing cross-cutting innovations. Along with my colleagues at ENAC, I want to advance that potential by creating the boundary conditions for excellence in research, teaching and innovation for a more sustainable built and natural environment, on both the national and international stage.\nHow do you plan to get there? \nI plan to build on and foster ENAC’s excellent performance and successes in this respect: the NeighborHub, which won the 2017 Solar Decathlon; the Smart Living Lab in Fribourg, specialized on the built environment of the future; the Transportation Center; the Habitat Research Center; the Alpine Research Center in Valais; and our close ties with EPFL’s Energy Center. Beyond the excellent research and teaching, our research ecosystem has given rise to a number of highly promising spin-offs. My goal is to leverage these achievements and position ENAC as a center of excellence in advancing the sustainability of our natural and built environment. This will be done across all three of EPFL’s core missions: teaching, research and innovation.\nCan you give us concrete examples? \nRecently, there have been new initiatives emerging at ENAC, as are CLIMACT “Center for Climate, Impact and Action” in cooperation with the University of Lausanne and the Center of Digital Infrastructure. Together with my colleagues, I aim at exploring the role of research clusters linked to ENAC related initiatives and addressing key topics related to the sustainability of the built and natural environment. One issue I would also like ENAC to engage in, is to reflect on how digitalization can be used to stimulate sustainability, and how big data can help scientists build a collective wealth of knowledge, in order to help policymakers build livable cities. These efforts will be carried out in association with the other EPFL faculties and EPFL’s Tech4Impact initiative, which aims to find technology-driven solutions to major societal challenges. Through the latter, we will be able to turn our research into innovations that will benefit society.\nDo you have any initiatives planned in education?\nTomorrow’s engineers and architects will be required to work collaboratively in complex, fast-changing environments. So I would like to further foster our unique \"Design Together\" program, where students in architecture, civil engineering and environmental engineering join forces to find novel solutions for a sustainable future. Along the same lines, I aim at supporting and developing our \"Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory\" (SKIL), where ENAC students can suggest course subjects that will equip them for today’s challenges. Both SKIL and Design Together encourage students to develop creative and innovative solutions for our pressing problems and have generated several spin-offs – all of which serves EPFL’s mission of innovation.\nWhat do you see as ENAC’s role within EPFL?\nEPFL provides our school with a dynamic, stimulating research and learning environment. It is for us a distinctive possibility that numerous labs in other EPFL schools are also studying sustainability-related issues. Basing ourselves on ENAC’s unique disciplinary composition, which allows for bridging to other faculties, we aim at sharing and integrating knowledge with members of the other faculties of EPFL and across Switzerland for further developing the sustainability field.\nLooking at Switzerland as a whole, and even internationally, what do you see as ENAC’s strengths – and what challenges will it face – over the coming years?\nThe researchers of the three institutes of ENAC architecture, civil and environmental engineering have excellent track records and are internationally recognized. It is rare that these three disciplines are found together under the same roof. This forward-thinking structure gives us such unparalleled scope for innovation. This also implies that students and researchers from our three different disciplines need to find a common language and think creatively to deploy their full potential. So one opportunity we have is to further develop our unique approach, which can be done by embracing the digital revolution already under way and setting up processes that facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration. This is especially important at a time when our society is facing complex problems that cannot be solved from the perspective of just one field. How will climate change affect our mountains and our urban lifestyles? How can we prevent our cities from becoming suffocating hot in the summer? These are just two of the many questions we will be able to tackle at ENAC over the coming years, if we all work together.\nBIOGRAPHY \n joined EPFL in March 2016 and set up the Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS) at ENAC; she also holds the La Mobilière Chair on Urban Ecology and Sustainable Living.

{"id": 64, "text": "Hydrogen will play a key role in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. It can be sustainably produced by using solar energy to split water molecules. The resulting clean energy can be stored, used to fuel cars or converted into electricity on demand. But making it reliably on a large scale and at an affordable cost is a challenge for researchers. Efficient solar hydrogen production requires rare and expensive materials – for both the solar cells and the catalyst – in order to collect energy and then convert it.\nScientists at EPFL’s  from the School of Engineering came up with the idea of concentrating solar irradiation to produce a larger amount of hydrogen over a given area at a lower cost. They developed an enhanced photo-electrochemical system that, when used in conjunction with concentrated solar irradiation and smart thermal management, can turn solar power into hydrogen with a 17% conversion rate and unprecedented power and current density. What’s more, their technology is stable and can handle the stochastic dynamics of daily solar irradiation.\n The results of their research have just been published in . “In our device, a thin layer of water runs over a solar cell to cool it. The system temperature remains relatively low, allowing the solar cell to deliver better performance,” says Saurabh Tembhurne, a co-author of the study. “At the same time, the heat extracted by the water is transferred to catalysts, thereby improving the chemical reaction and increasing the hydrogen production rate,” adds Fredy Nandjou, a researcher at the LRESE. Hydrogen production is therefore optimized at each step of the conversion process.\nThe scientists used the LRESE’s unique solar simulator to demonstrate the stable performance of their device. The results from the lab-scale demonstrations were so promising that the device has been upscaled and is now being tested outdoors, on EPFL’s Lausanne campus. The research team installed a 7-meter diameter parabolic mirror that concentrates solar irradiation by a factor of 1,000 and drives the device. The first tests are under way.\nHydrogen stations\n The scientists estimate that their system can run for over 30,000 hours – or nearly four years – without any part replacements, and up to 20 years if some parts are replaced every four years. Their solar concentrator turns and follows the sun across the sky in order to maximize its yield. Sophia Haussener, the head of the LRESE and the project lead, explains: “In sunny weather, our system can generate up to 1 kilogram of hydrogen per day, which is enough fuel for a hydrogen-powered car to travel 100 to 150 kilometers.”\nFor distributed, large-scale hydrogen generation, several concentrator systems could be used together to produce hydrogen at chemical plants or for hydrogen stations. Tembhurne and Haussener are planning to take their technology from the lab to industry with a spin-off company called .\nOpen source software\nThanks to an open interface, it will be possible to monitor the instantaneous performance of the system.\n As part of their research, the scientists also performed a technological and economic feasibility study and developed an open-source software program called  (Solar PhotoElectroChemical Device Optimization, http://specdo.epfl.ch). This program can help engineers design components for low-cost photoelectrochemical systems for producing solar hydrogen.

To slow the aging process and maintain their performance, a team of researchers from EPFL have, in rapid succession, improved the black coating used for thermal sensors and developed an original and patented method for depositing the coating.\nThe color black is at the key element of thermal panels because it can absorb up to 90% of the energy it receives. However, over time, the effects of light and heat deteriorate the black, and the panel becomes less efficient. Engineers have developed an innovative process that deposits thin layers of 3 different materials that are more resistant, more selective and less toxic than the chromium used thus far. As such this new material provides high durability in the open air at temperatures of 300° C to 400° C, thus avoiding the use of glass vacuum tubes, which are expensive.\nA new black coating \n“We wanted to develop selective layers that absorb light well and that are less toxic than chromium. That’s why we followed the trail of these materials.” Layers deposited by a chemical process boast an exceptional heat resistance that was never achieved with traditional chromium coatings. In fact, they can withstand temperatures of 360 degrees Celcius without deteriorating in contact with air.\nFor a flat sensor, the actual average temperature is about 80° C, and in summer the temperature can reach 200° C. Regularly exposed to air and moisture, the sensor must last for 25 years on a building, which is not so easy.\n “The durability of our materials at temperatures exceeding 360° C could also be of interest to thermal power plants,” says Andreas Schüler, who heads the research team.\nFrom nanoparticles to full-scale prototypes\nMaterials are deposited by successive dipping, and each layer is heated by induction which evaporates the carbon and fixes the elements. “We started by buying simple resistors then tried induction and obtained results that far exceeded our expectations,” says the researcher. \n This method has the advantage of being rapid, with impressive energy efficiency and an improved quality in the results. And the layers are perfectly deposited and homogeneous. What’s more, a patent has been filed on this new method. The work conducted by Martin Joly has resulted in two publications.

The quantum properties of light will endow machines with gigantic computing potential and an incredible execution rate. However, much work remains to be done. In order to exploit the \"quantum\" potential of light it is necessary, among other things, to be able easily to emit photons one by one.\nThe\n \"natural\" \n creation of a photon filter\n At the heart of the  (LMSC) of Institute of Materials, the team of Anna Fontcuberta i Morral has discovered a new method for creating a miniscule and extremely high-performance single-photon source.

This is the essence of binary language. In a quantum computer the \"qbit\" (for example a photon) can have several states at once, states of superposition. It can be either 0 or 1 or both at the same time. The aim is maintain photons in their state of superposition so that the computer can carry out multiple calculations in parallel, simultaneously, which will drastically increase the speed of data manipulation.

Now, for the first time without invasive measures, a joint study from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL), in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, has verified these gains with a powerful new computer program. Reported in the PNAS early online edition last week, the soon-to-be-released software allows for individualized maps of vital brain connectivity that could aide in epilepsy and schizophrenia research.\n “The computer program brings together a series of processes in a ‘pipeline’ beginning with individual MRIs and ending with a personalized map of the fiber optics-like network in the brain. It takes a whole team of engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and medical doctors to come up with this type of neurobiological understanding,” explains Jean-Philippe Thiran, an EPFL professor and head of the Signal Processing Laboratory 5.\nA young child’s brain is similar to the early Internet with isolated, poorly linked hubs and inefficient connections, say the researchers from EPFL and UNIL. An adult brain, on the other hand, is more like a modern day, fully integrated fiber optic network. The scientists hypothesized that while the brain does not undergo significant topographical changes in childhood, its white matter—the bundles of nerve cells connecting different parts of the brain—transitions from weak and inefficient connections to powerful neuronal highways. To test their idea, the team worked with colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Indiana University to map the brains of 30 children between the ages of two and 18.\nWith MRI, they tracked the diffusion of water in the brain and, in turn, the fibers that carry this water. Thiran and UNIL-CHUV professor Patric Hagmann, in the Department of Radiology, then created a database of the various fiber cross-sections and graphed the results. In the end, they had a 3D model of each brain showing the thousands of strands that connect different regions.\nThese individual models provide insight not only into how a child’s brain develops but also into the structural differences in the brain between left-handed and right-handed people, for example, or between a control and someone with schizophrenia or epilepsy. The models may also help inform brain surgeons of where, or where not, to cut to relieve epilepsy symptoms.

Her research is being carried out jointly by EPFL’s Laboratory for Processing of Advanced Composites and Universidad de los Andes in Colombia.\n© 2019 EPFL Alain Herzog / reuse plastics from our trash cans\nCurrently PET is the only kind of household plastic that is recycled in Switzerland, but it is actually just one of seven varieties. “What I found really interesting in this project was being able to test several different types of plastic and study each one’s behavior. I initially chose five but ended up working with only three. Unfortunately my time was limited, otherwise I would’ve tested them all!” says Jaquier. She dug through garbage bins on the EPFL campus and collected various types of everyday plastic waste – empty water bottles, bottle caps, cafe latte cups, yogurt containers, milk bottles and cling wrap, for example – which she then used to make plastic threads that could be fed into a 3D printer. She made threads of polypropylene, polystyrene and high- and low-density polyethylene, a task that required delving into a new field. “I have a background in mechanical engineering, so designing prosthetics wasn’t really a problem. What was hard was the materials-science aspect of the project. I took some classes but also learned a lot as I went along,” she says.\n© 2019 EPFL Alain Herzog / The melting temperature changes according to the plastics\nOne of the materials-science challenges she faced was juggling the plastics’ different melting points: 260°C for PET but just 130°C for the polyethylene used in bottle caps, for instance. “The plastics should be kept separate, especially if we want to recycle them several times – which would make sense if our goal is to reduce waste. We also need to make sure that the plastics don’t break down after being melted several times,” says Jaquier. Another factor to keep an eye on is the threads’ diameter. “The ideal diameter for a 3D printer is 1.75 mm, but the actual diameter can vary depending on how the thread has been pulled.” And of course, enough used plastic must be collected to create the right amount thread. “Even with 140 bottle caps, I only had enough material to fill a quarter of the spool.”\nTwo weeks in Colombia\nThanks to the collaboration with the\n, the support of the the work with the \nand the contacts made with \n, by Felipe Betancur, Jaquier was able to spend a couple of weeks doing field research in Colombia.

{"id": 84, "text": "In recent years, the market for wearable sports sensors has taken off. They generate data on athletes’ progress and potential areas of improvement, as well as providing motion analysis. Yet amateurs and pros don’t require the same level of precision in measuring, assessing and comparing their performance. That’s where Gait Up comes in: while mass-market sensors generally have a margin of error of 10–20%, Gait Up’s technology slashes that range less than 3%. The startup’s device, consisting of two extremely light cases – one for each foot – delivers highly precise data thanks to algorithms that were thoroughly vetted in the LMAM at EPFL and at UNIL. The device works so well that it is being used by Sub2hrs, a group of experts from a wide range of fields – such as bioenergy, biomechanics, nutrition, engineering and coaching – whose goal is to see a marathon run in under two hours within the next five years.\nNon-stop data recording for four hours\nWhether during a marathon or ultra-marathon or while training, all high-level runners struggle with fatigue at one point or another. In order to deliver their peak performance on race day, they need to recognize the signs of fatigue and learn to work through it. One of the objective measurements they can use is their legs’ “springiness”, which can be gauged through contact time, air time and the angle at which their feet strike the ground. In order to run quickly and efficiently, runners require a certain amount of stiffness in their legs – this varies from one person to the next. By recording various data over the course of a several-hour race, Gait Up’s system can provide a snapshot of this parameter in 15-minute intervals throughout the race.\nThe company’s algorithms also generate data on each foot’s strike angle, how much time the runner is not touching the ground, the distribution of weight during foot impact, and symmetry between the two feet. Because the sensors are feather light, they can be worn during races and long runs – a significant advantage over sensors whose use is limited to the treadmill. “On treadmills, a runner’s gait can diverge from their outdoor gait by 20%,” says Benoît Mariani, Gait-up’s CEO and founder. The device’s data are so precise – they were tested through a CTI project conducted at EPFL and UNIL and have been published in three separate scientific articles – that they could even be used for medical analyses or applied to sports science research.\nGait Up’s sensors are also unique in that they do not need to be linked to any other device to work. The memory in the little wearable cases is all that’s needed to collect and store the data. Runners, their coaches and their doctors can then use the software provided with the device to analyze the data and get an accurate reading of the athletes’ performance and movement.\nA version for sprinters\nThe high-precision sensors and the algorithms used to analyze the data were developed over the course of 20 years of research at EPFL. And it has been five years since Gait Up began creating a wide range of sensors and the underlying data processing algorithms. The company’s products are used in both sports – from walking to running – and medicine – from balance disorders to detecting diseases like Parkinson’s. The startup, which was founded in 2013 and currently has around 20 employees, was acquired by MindMaze in 2017. It is now working on adding video synchronization to its running sensor, so that an athlete's body position can be viewed alongside the motion analysis.

These systems generally rely on cameras or occupants’ mobile phones. Such technologies infringe on privacy and may not function in emergencies such as fires. Scientists at ENAC’s , headed by Professor Ian Smith, have developed an alternative approach. “By installing sensors in a building’s floor slabs, we can measure the vibrations created by footsteps. That lets us calculate the number of people in the building as well as where they are located and their trajectory,” says Slah Drira, the IMAC PhD student who completed his thesis on this topic.\nTo each his own gait\nThe challenge with Drira’s approach is screening out the background noise caused by spurious events such as a door closing or an object falling to the ground. These events can trigger vibrations similar to those induced by footsteps. Another challenge relates to the vast differences in walking styles – not just between two different people but also by the same person under different circumstances. “The signals our sensors record can vary considerably depending on the person’s anatomy, walking speed, shoe type, health and mood,” says Drira.\nIan Smith and Slah Drira © 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog\nHis method uses advanced algorithms – or more specifically, support vector machines – to classify the signals recorded by the sensors. Some interpretation strategies were inspired by the convolutional neural networks often employed in pixel-based image recognition, and can identify the footstep characteristics of specific occupants.\nReal-world testing \nThe research team carried out four full-scale floor slabs: one in a seminar room at IMAC, one in an office environment at IMAC, one in the entrance of the MED building at EPFL campus and one in an open-hall space in Singapore. “These four case studies allowed us to validate our occupant detection, localization and tracking system on a larger scale. Unlike existing methods, ours needs fewer sensors – just one for every 15–75 m\n2\n, as opposed to one for every 2 m\n2\n – and doesn’t require that the floor slabs have uniform rigidity. What’s more, the localization feature of other methods had been tested only on single individuals,” says Drira.\nThe new system has applications in a host of fields. It could be used to enhance energy management protocols in offices, improve building security (like at banks and data centers), find occupants during an emergency and locate patients inside hospitals and retirement homes. This system can do all that without infringing on occupants’ privacy.\nSlah Drira © 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog\nDrira’s research was carried out within the scope of the Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) program headed by Professor Ian Smith at the  – an R&D platform established jointly by ETH Zurich and Singapore’s National Research Foundation (NRF) as part of the NRF’s Campus for Research Excellence And Technological Enterprise (CREATE) initiative.

{"id": 90, "text": "One of the greatest challenges in modern medicine is developing drugs that are highly effective against a target, but with minimal toxicity and side-effects to the patient. Such properties are directly related to the 3D structure of the drug molecule. Ideally, the drug should have a shape that is perfectly complementary to a disease-causing target, so that it binds it with high specificity. Publishing in \nNature Chemistry\n, EPFL scientists have developed a synthetic amino acid that can impact the 3D structure of bioactive peptides and enhance their potency.\nPeptides and proteins as drugs\nMany of the drugs we use today are essentially naturally-occurring peptides (small) and proteins (large), both of which are made up with the amino acids found in all living organisms. Despite the enormous variety of peptides and proteins, there are only twenty natural amino acids, each with a different structure and chemical properties. When strung together in a sequence, amino acids create peptides and proteins with different 3D structures and, consequently, different biological functions.\nUntil recently, the vast majority of amino acid-based drugs were the kinds occurring in nature: hormones such as insulin, antibiotics such as vancomycin, immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine etc. But the mounting burden of diseases means that newer and more effective medications must be developed; for example, bacterial resistance is growing globally, pushing our need for novel antibiotics. One way to address this need is the cutting-edge field of directed evolution, which mimics natural selection in the lab to evolve and develop new peptides and proteins.\nA new amino acid for new peptide drugs\nThe team of Christian Heinis at EPFL has developed a synthetic amino acid whose unique structure can considerably increase the effectiveness of therapeutic peptides and proteins. The synthetic amino acid has a very similar structure to a natural amino acid called cysteine. Cysteine is unique among the twenty natural amino acids because it contains a sulfur group. This allows it to form a bridge with another cysteine, and thereby influence the overall 3D structure – and function – of a peptide or protein.\nThe EPFL researchers initially designed five cysteine-like amino acids, all with one crucial change: each one could form two bridges instead of just one. The team achieved this by replacing cysteine’s single sulfur group with a branch containing two sulfur groups. After synthesizing the five new amino acids, the team integrated them into the structure of two bioactive peptides, one that inhibits an enzyme implicated in cancer, and one blocking a receptor found in neurons.\nTesting only a handful of cyclic peptides with the synthetic amino acid, Heinis’ team was able to identify several peptides that showed enhanced activities. The best inhibitor of the neuron receptor was 8-fold improved and the best protease inhibitor had even a 40-fold higher activity.\n“This was unexpected”, says Christian Heinis. “Usually when you tamper with a natural molecule, you end up making it worse. In this case, we found the exact opposite, which is very exciting.”\nThe emerging class of bicyclic peptides\nThe team focuses on therapeutics, where they have a strong background in developing “bicyclic” peptides – peptides that contain two rings in their structure. Bicyclic peptides have grown into a new class of therapeutic peptides that can be used on disease target that conventional small molecules or large antibodies cannot reach. Heinis’ group has generated bicyclic peptides against a range of disease targets using directed evolution. “In our work with bicyclic peptides, we learned that wide structural diversity in peptide libraries is key for achieving good binding. With this new amino acid, it is possible to produce highly diverse peptide structures.”\nHeinis aims now to use the new amino acid in directed evolution experiments. Its structural features and its ability to efficiently make cyclic peptides makes the synthetic amino acid a promising candidate for developing new, effective polycyclic peptides for targeted therapy.\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nReference\nChen S.

{"id": 94, "text": "Amélie, Elvira, Léonie and Nicolas, four students passionate about neuroscience, recently returned from a one-year stay in Boston, where they completed their masters projects at Harvard Medical School. Their work was sponsored by the Bertarelli Foundation, whose goal is to advance neuroscience by combining the skills of engineers and medical experts. Most of these young travelers are now doctoral assistants. They tell us about their experiences in America.\nImproving auditory implants with lasers \nAmélie Guex\nAge:\n 25 years old\nPerformed her research at:\n Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Department of Otology and Laryngology\nMaster title:\n \"Characterization of the Auditory System Responses to Infrared Neural Stimulation of the Cochlear Nucleus\"\n Some laboratories headed by doctors or surgeons are set directly within hospitals. I worked in such a lab during my stay. It was part of a group of labs called the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories. I found it very motivating every day to come across patients who are likely to benefit from our technology.\n As for the campus itself it was quite impressive, especially with all these red brick buildings. When I first saw it, I felt as if I were in a film.\nWhat did you work on?\n The lab in which I studied focuses on Implants for people who had their auditory nerve cut following the removal of a tumor, for example. The function of these implants - or small electrodes - is to stimulate the patients' brain stem, with the aim of helping them to recapture an auditory sensation. My mission consisted of testing an alternative method based on lasers. We wanted to see if optically-based methods could stimulate neurons more selectively than electrodes. I take a particular interest in neuroprosthetics and I greatly appreciated this research.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n The cosmopolitan city of Boston does not seem to be representative of the so-called \"American culture\". Some aspects of their lifestyle were surprising, though. Everybody follows the rhythm of huge events such as Halloween, Thanksgiving or the Superbowl. Also, some students in Boston participate in real Quidditch championnships which made us laugh (quidditch - fictional sport from the Harry Potter series). The team players run sideways with a broomstick between their legs and pass the ball. The Golden Snitch is personified by a guy wearing a yellow outfit, who holds a tennis ball. He has to hide most of the time.\nDid this exchange open doors for you?\n Yes, I'm now working on another project financially supported by the Bertarelli program. I've just started a thesis at the Laboratory for Soft Bioelectronic Interfaces (LSBI), headed by Stéphanie Lacour. We are exploring the possibility of developing flexible electrodes that can adapt more easily to the brain stem.\n----\n What happens in our brain while we are under a general anesthetic?\nElvira Pirondini\nAge:\n 25 years old\nPerformed her research at:\n Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care\nMaster title:\n \"Sparse Priors and Empirically-Tailored Basis Sets For EEG Source Localization, Applied to Cross-Frequency Coupling under General Anesthesia\"\n This is a great place. My supervisor - the Professor Emery Brown - was affiliated both to MIT and Harvard. I could therefore attend lots of talks and conferences in the two universities. In this respect, possibilities were more diversified than at EPFL. As for the quality of research and teaching, the level was quite similar, in my opinion.\nWhat did you work on?\n I was part of the team of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory that seeks to find out what is happening in the brain when patients are undergoing a general anesthetic. This question has not been answered yet. The group is formed by 50-60 people. They use several statistical methods and non-invasive techniques such as electroencephalography to unravel this mystery. The method consists of developing algorithms and models in order to depict brain activity. Personally, I was supposed to improve one of the existing algorithms that had been previously developed, following the brain observation of 10 patients under general anesthetic. My role was to speed up its computation to provide surgeons with a real-time estimation of the state of an anesthesia during surgery.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n In general, American people are very nice. I was surprised by the way television is omnipresent in their lives. A lot of discussions center around TV series. As for the education policy, I have the impression that people from Harvard are extremely specialized in their field, but if they wander away from their research, they have little knowledge. The situation is not similar at EPFL, a place where scientists seem more versatile.\nDid this exchange open doors for you?\n Yes. While participating at the Bertarelli Symposium in Boston, I got to know Sylvestro Micera, head of the Translational Neural Engineering Lab (TNE) at EPFL. Thanks to this encounter, I have now been able to start a thesis in this lab. My mission consists of observing the activity in the brain of stroke patients while they do exercises with the help of a robot.\n At the end of the exchange, Emery Brown had suggested that I perform my thesis in Boston. However, I preferred to come back to EPFL. The quality of the research is equally high and I can be closer to my family, who live in Italy.\n----\nA detection of motor disorders in patients with Parkinson disease\nLéonie Asboth:\nAge: \n23 years old\nPerformed her research at:\n Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Department of Neurology\nMaster title:\n \"Quantification of fine movement disorders in Parkinson's disease using a digitized tablet: turning experimental findings into a clinically simple diagnostic tool\"\nWhat is special about Harvard?\n Over the years, Harvard has progressively stretched to different places in Boston. Each space is devoted to a specific function. Built in a New-England style architecture, the \"Harvard yard\", for example, groups several dormitories and study areas for freshmen.\n Hospitals affiliated to the Harvard Medical School as well as centers for medical research are located on the other side of the river, which is on the Boston side. This environment encourages translational research: the transfer of findings from Basic science to clinical test, as well as human care is facilitated.\n As for education, I had the opportunity to attend a few lectures that were very proactive. Students kept trying debating different issues with professors.\nWhat did you work on?\n In the Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation of Boston, I was in charge of the development of a digitized tablet aimed at quantifying fine movement disorders related to Parkinson disease. We got the opportunity to test our technology with 20 people at different stages of the disease. Patients were asked to reproduce some pattern on the tablet, which recorded each tremor. We then proceeded to a kinematic and frequency movement-analysis. The results revealed some motor disorders that were invisible to the naked eye. We could objectively quantify inferred movements. This work was very simulating, because we developed a cheap and useful finished product that doctors could use every day. Moreover, this tool could prove useful to reduce the subjective aspects of neurological tests.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n I was astonished to see how easily Harvard students were able to put their innovative ideas into practice before the end of their studies. The launch of a startup is highly encouraged by professors. Harvard cultivates an entrepreneurial spirit among students from the very beginning of their studies. This is a major asset of American culture.\n I was also surprised to see how extravagant Americans could be. While we were in Boston, they organized a contest where people were asked to swallow as many donuts as they could, before running a distance of 5 miles in less than an hour. We have also seen MIT students dressed as Star wars characters and performing \"light saber\" combats.\nDid the exchange open doors for you?\n Yes. I have discovered the lab in which I'm working right now through the Bertarelli program. It is called the IRP Chair in Spinal Cord Repair, headed by Grégoire Courtine. My thesis focuses on optogenetics, a method which consists of activating neuronal networks with light after genetically modifying the neurons. We want to understand the regeneration mechanism of the corticospinal projections in patients with spinal cord injury. The ultimate goal is to restore the ability to walk for paralyzed people.\n----\nIs rehabilitation through robotics efficient for everybody?\nNicolas Beuchat\nAge:\n 23 years old\nPerformed his research at:\n Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\nMaster title:\n \"Estimating Motor Adaptation Dynamics from the Force-Field Adaptation Paradigm using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm\"\nWhat is special about Harvard?\n This University is very lively and there is always something going on. Harvard is located next to the MIT and both universities are full of famous professors. Talks and conferences are numerous, as are research areas.\n Moreover, as Leonie previously mentioned, Americans are more adventurous than we are, when it comes to the creation of a company. Failure is not stigmatized and more accepted than it would be in Switzerland.\nWhat did you work on?\n I was part of the Motion Analysis Laboratory which deals with rehabilitation through robotics with the help of exoskeletons, for example. Currently, the problem lies in the fact that robotic neurorehabilitation shows a large variability in its outcome in stroke patients. Some of them show very promising improvements in their motor skills whereas others show no improvement at all. In order to overcome this problem, I worked on a robotic platform devoted to predict which patient would respond positively to that kind of treatment. The tool took the shape of a lever that had to be pushed straightforward while a side force was applied. 14 patients were tested during my stay. I developed an algorithm to analyze the data collected by another laboratory. The aim was to assess patient motor learning and adaptation capabilities.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n In Switzerland, we hear plenty of prejudices about Americans and they do not apply to Boston. People are very much into sport in general, and during competitions, the show takes place both on the field and among the supporters, who often wear crazy outfits. During the basketball championship called March madness, my coworkers and I participated in a contest that consisted of predicting the result of every game during the championship. Of course, we didn't win.\nDid the exchange open doors for you?\n As a first step Yes. When I returned to EPFL I worked for a few months in José Millán's laboratory: the Chair in Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface (CNBI). Then I decided to take some time off, and to go travelling in South America. Argentina will be my first destination.\n----\nAdditional information:\n-\n- /  /", "summary": "Four students from EPFL completed their masters projects in Harvard Medical School labs thanks to the sponsorship of the Bertarelli Foundation.

{"id": 95, "text": "Predicting natural disasters in order to inform and warn populations residing in risk zones is a major challenge today. “Mathematical models exist, but they still don’t take into account all the data that are needed to establish reliable predictions, such as the influence of air temperature, the formation of thermal winds or the impact of precipitation,” explains Professor Marc Parlange. The project his team started in 2008 with a single weather station has grown, and today the stations spread over more than 20 square kilometers, covering a large part of the Val Ferret watershed. Working in the mountains requires a specific set of skills. The weather stations are installed in strategic but often hard to reach locations in the valley, whose altitude difference from bottom to top is 800 to 1,000m. Perhaps not coincidentally, there are many mountaineers in Parlange’s lab: “Doing experiments in mountainous regions is very physically demanding. The PhDs working here are very fit.”\nFinding the right river\n It’s not by chance that EFLUM’s research is taking place in the Val Ferret. Raphaël Mutzner, the PhD student responsible for hydrologic modeling, explains that there weren’t many options. “The condition was to find a river that hadn’t been subjected to human influence, to ensure that there weren’t any dams that would alter its output. Amazingly enough, it was extremely difficult to find one, even when we extended our search over the entire country. The Dranse river in the Val Ferret is ideal; it flows freely through a small, pristine valley. One side of the watershed is characterized by gentle slopes and the other has steep, rocky outcrops. There is a small glacier in the upper valley.” During this new experiment campaign, Mutzner will take ice and groundwater samples. He had previously also taken snow samples, which will enable him to isolate the isotope signature of the Dranse and thus determine the precise influence of various sources of water on the river.\nWinds and slopes\n But the influence of water input is not the only thing that makes the flow rate fluctuate. Winds also play an important role. “I’m trying to understand slope winds, which flow upslope in the daytime and downslope at night. How do they form, and when? What is their influence on evaporation? My goal is to be able to predict these winds using a new-generation model,” says PhD student Daniel Nadeau. Many tools have been deployed this summer. In addition to the 25 ground-based stations equipped with numerous sensors, two weather stations on 10m towers have been installed, and a weather balloon will be regularly deployed. Three Lidars, laser-based instruments, will be used to take continuous wind data over a height of nearly 2 km. A better understanding of the hydrology of the Alps will help us better manage the risks that are an inherent part of this magnificent environment.\n...", "summary": "EPFL’s Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory (EFLUM) is starting a new field campaign in the Val Ferret.

{"id": 96, "text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, produces hundreds of millions of proton collisions per second. But researchers working on the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment, which involves physicists from EPFL, can only record 2,000 of those collisions, using one of the detectors installed on the accelerator. So in the end, this technological marvel leaves the physicists wanting more. They are convinced that the vast volume of uncaptured data holds the answers to several unresolved questions.\nIn elementary particle physics, the Standard Model – the theory that best describes phenomena in this field – has been well and truly tried and tested, yet the researchers know that the puzzle is not complete. That’s why they are looking for phenomena that are not accounted for by the Standard Model. This quest for \"new physics\" could explain the disappearance of antimatter after the Big Bang and the nature of the dark matter that, although it represents around 30% of the universe, can only be detected by astronomical measurements at this point.\n“To extract more information from the LHC data, we need new technologies for our LHCb detector,” says Aurelio Bay from EPFL’s Laboratory for High Energy Physics. EPFL has teamed up with several research institutes to develop the new equipment that will upgrade the experiment in 2020.\nUsing scintillating fiber to detect particles\nAfter five years of work, EPFL’s physicists, together with some 800 international researchers involved in the LHCb project, have just taken an important preliminary step towards significantly enhancing their experimental equipment. They have decided to build a new detector – a scintillating fiber tracker dubbed SciFi.\nConstruction of the tracker, which incorporates 10,000 kilometers of scintillating fibers each with a diameter of 0.25mm, has already begun. When particles travel through them, the fibers will give off light signals that will be picked up by light-amplifying diodes. The scintillating fibers will be arranged in three panels measuring five by six meters, installed behind a magnet, where the particles exit the LHC accelerator collision point. The particles will pass through several of these fiber 'mats' and deposit part of their energy along the way, producing some photons of light that will then be turned into an electric signal.\n Data on how the particles traverse the fibers will be enough to reconstruct their trajectory. The physicists will then use this information to restore their primitive physical state. “What we will essentially be doing is tracing these particles’ journey back to their starting point. This should give us some insight into what happened 14 billion years ago, before antimatter disappeared, leaving us with the matter we have today,” says Bay.\nHuge data flows\nSciFi is a key component for acquiring data at the highest speed, as it includes filters that are designed to preserve only useful data. In an ideal world, the physicists would collect and analyze all of the data without needing to use too many filters. But that would involve a massive amount of data.\n“We may already be at the limit, because we of course have to save the data somewhere. First we use magnetic storage and then we distribute the data on the LHC GRID, which includes machines in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, at CERN, and in France and the UK. Many countries are taking part, and numerous studies on this data are being run simultaneously,” adds Bay. He points to his computer screen: red is used to denote programs that are not working well or those that have been trying for several days to be included among the priorities.\nBay neatly puts this initiative into a physicist’s perspective: “If the LHC doesn’t have enough energy to uncover new physics, it’s all over for my generation of physicists! We will have to come up with a new machine, for the next generation.\"\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press\n +41 79 502 81 06\nAurelio Bay\n High Energy Physics Laboratory 1\n +41 21 693 04 74\nOlivier Schneider\n High Energy Physics Laboratory 2\n +41 21 693 05 07\nTatsuya Nakada \nHigh Energy Physics Laboratory 3\n +41 21 693 04 75", "summary": "EPFL’s physicists are moving forward in their efforts to solve the mysteries of the universe.

{"id": 97, "text": "Two years ago, scientists in EPFL’s Laboratory of Astrophysics (LASTRO) discovered a quasar, a galaxy with a black hole at its center, that functioned as a gravitational lens, a kind of cosmic magnifying glass. The case was special for two reasons: it showed both the presence of the supermassive black hole as well as another galaxy in the background, very distant and in almost perfect alignment. The light coming from this distant galaxy, strongly bent by its passage near the black hole, made it possible to measure the mass of a quasar for the first time.\nSince then, using NASA and ESA’s Hubble Space Telescope the scientists have discovered several other examples of these rare specimens, selected from among a sample of 20,000 quasars. Their results are published March 21, 2012 in the scientific journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\nThis magnification phenomenon, called gravitational lensing, is caused by massive objects in the universe such as stars, galaxies, and planets. When the light from a very distant galaxy passes near one of these objects on its voyage to Earth, it is bent by the gravitational pull of the object. The image of the galaxy therefore appears severely distorted when it reaches us. There are either multiple images of the galaxy, or, if it’s in almost perfect alignment with the massive object, the image appears in the shape of a circular arc, known as an Einstein Ring. The size of the ring allows us to determine the mass of the object situated in the middle, which is acting like a lens. In the cases discovered by the EPFL scientists, the object in the foreground is a quasar, or a galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center. It would be impossible to “weigh” the quasar without this gravitational lensing effect.\nBetter images\n“We found much better examples than our first discovery, with clearer and more detailed images,” explains LASTRO physicist Frédéric Courbin. A tool like this is important, he says, because it allows us to calculate the total amount of matter, visible or invisible, contained in the quasar.\n“For the first time, we have a reliable method for measuring the mass of these objects, which are too luminous to be observed with traditional techniques,” Courbin explains. “We can thus better understand why some galaxies have a black hole and others don’t, what their incredible energy is made up of, how the matter is distributed and how it evolves. The gravitational lensing effect has already taught us much about the distribution of matter in galaxy clusters and galaxies themselves. Here the effect is produced by very special objects, whose mass has been impossible to measure up to this point.”", "summary": "To determine the mass of a galaxy, you need another galaxy.

Lo Giudice, University of Geneva.\nWhen a fetus develops, everything must be timed to perfection: cell division and differentiation, gene expression, cell-to-cell signaling, and morphogenesis must be carefully coordinated to occur in the correct sequence and for the proper amount of time. Failures in timing can result in congenital deformities, disabilities, and even death.\nThe big question that developmental biologists have been asking for a long time is this: what sets the pace and the order of developmental events?\nLooking at the development of the paw and digits in mice, scientists from the , with Pierre Fabre at the University of Geneva, have now discovered a “code” of architect genes that play a central role in the developmental cascade. The genes belong to the Hoxd group, developmental genes that are active in various combinations inside so-called “progenitor” cells – cells that are just a step more specialized than stem cells.\nBy pushing a cutting-edge single-cell RNA sequencing technique to its maximal resolution, the scientists were able to study the expression patterns of thousands of genes inside single progenitor cells. The analysis showed that each cell contains 343 genes that are associated with specific cellular states, many of which are involved in the packaging and ordering of DNA in the cell, as well as patterning how the paw’s fingers will develop.\nThe scientists identified a very restricted set of six main combinations of five Hoxd genes (Hoxd9, 10, 11, 12, and 13) in the development of digits in mice. Each combination includes one, two, or four of the genes, with the simplest (one gene) at the beginning of development and the more complex (four genes) combination occurring at the later stages of maturation.\nThe pattern by which Hox genes are expressed when they “build” the entire body – in both mice and humans – has been known and studied for over thirty years. But most of that information comes from looking at entire tissues of developing organs. In contrast, this study is the first to look at it in single cells, offering a higher resolution and clarity in the way Hox genes orchestrate the rhythm of development.\nA graph showing the five combinations of Hoxd genes in precursor cells during development of the paw and digits of mice.

Baracchini therefore expanded his website as part of his thesis research, which he defended this Friday at EPFL.\n“Meteolakes.ch is the first platform to compile lake data from three different sources: satellite images, in situ measurements and 3D computer simulations,” says Baracchini. While the first version displayed only water surface temperature and average current velocities, the website now contains a wealth of information including algae concentrations and water oxygen levels and lets users view data at different depths. Baracchini also enhanced the website’s models of Lake Geneva by adding temperature and water-velocity readings from the four main rivers that feed the lake: the Rhône, Dranse, Aubonne and Venoge.\nAn alert system\nThe updated platform contains new features as well, such as an early warning system that can predict major disturbances – like strong storm currents or upwellings – up to four-and-a-half days in advance and send an email to people who sign up for the service.\nHere are two examples of disturbances the system could detect in 2018:\nA localized storm hit Vevey on August 6. \nIn december, a gyre in the middle of the lake created an upwelling of cold water.\nAnother new feature is a “particle tracker” that can display particle dispersion patterns (such as for pollutant particles) associated with the currents modelled on the website. This feature was used to identify the origins of calcite precipitation (which caused the water to suddenly turn white) and could be useful in search and rescue operations.\nAs part of an open science approach – and to promote cross-disciplinary research on lakes – Baracchini made it possible for users to download the raw data generated by the website’s 3D models. Users can specify exactly what location, time period, variable and water depth they are interested in; the website will extract the data and send them electronically in formatted files.\nA dynamic ecosystem\nThe final update was to incorporate real-time data feeds that operate in loops. When a satellite flies over Lake Geneva and records the water temperature, these data are incorporated into the website’s models, which are then used to plan on-site measurements, which in turn provide feedback on the satellite’s accuracy. Meteolakes therefore creates a system where each data source benefits the others. This new feature also enables the website to quantify and reduce uncertainty, making it one of the most sophisticated lake-data platforms in the world.\nBy providing a more detailed view of Switzerland’s lakes, the website makes it clear just how much is going on beneath their placid surface. “Each lake is a complex, vital ecosystem that is much more active and alive than we imagine. With Meteolakes, I wanted to not just help scientists study and predict the impacts of climate change or extreme weather events, but also to allow people who enjoy our country’s lakes to realize how dynamic they are,” says Baracchini", "summary": "A new website, , provides up-to-date information – such as water temperature, current speed, the chances of a storm and the presence of algae and gyres – on Switzerland’s main lakes.

{"id": 101, "text": "One day we may be able to ingest tiny robots that deliver drugs directly to diseased tissue, thanks to research being carried out at EPFL's School of Engineering and ETH Zurich.\nThe group of scientists – led by  at EPFL and  at ETH Zurich – drew inspiration from bacteria to design smart, biocompatible microrobots that are highly flexible. Because these devices are able to swim through fluids and modify their shape when needed, they can pass through narrow blood vessels and intricate systems without compromising on speed or maneuverability. They are made of hydrogel nanocomposites that contain magnetic nanoparticles allowing them to be controlled via an electromagnetic field.\nIn an article appearing in \nScience Advances\n, the scientists describe the method they have developed for “programming” the robot’s shape so that it can easily travel through fluids that are dense, viscous or moving at rapid speeds.\nEmbodied intelligence\nWhen we think of robots, we generally think of bulky machines equipped with complex systems of electronics, sensors, batteries and actuators. But on a microscopic scale, robots are entirely different.\nFabricating miniaturized robots presents a host of challenges, which the scientists addressed using an origami-based folding method. Their novel locomotion strategy employs embodied intelligence, which is an alternative to the classical computation paradigm that is performed by embedded electronic systems. “Our robots have a special composition and structure that allow them to adapt to the characteristics of the fluid they are moving through. For instance, if they encounter a change in viscosity or osmotic concentration, they modify their shape to maintain their speed and maneuverability without losing control of the direction of motion,” says Sakar.\nThese deformations can be “programmed” in advance so as to maximize performance without the use of cumbersome sensors or actuators. The robots can be either controlled using an electromagnetic field or left to navigate on their own through cavities by utilizing fluid flow. Either way, they will automatically morph into the most efficient shape.\nInspired by nature\n “Nature has evolved a multitude of microorganisms that change shape as their environmental conditions change. This basic principle inspired our microrobot design. The key challenge for us was to develop the physics that describe the types of changes we were interested in, and then to integrate this with new fabrication technologies,” says Nelson. In addition to offering enhanced effectiveness, these miniaturized soft robots can also be manufactured easily at a reasonable cost. For now, the research team is working on improving the performance for swimming through complex fluids like those found in the human body.", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL and ETH Zurich have developed tiny elastic robots that can change shape depending on their surroundings.

{"id": 107, "text": "Last year, the Planck Telescope revealed the most detailed picture of the cosmic microwave background, the relic radiation from the Big Bang. But this map contains features that challenge the standard model of cosmology, the theory that describes our entire Universe from early on. Who is right, the map or the theory? Scientists from EPFL (Switzerland) and CEA (France) have shown that several of these enigmatic features disappear from the map by processing Planck telescope’s data differently and including other effects, such as the motion of the Milky Way. The findings are published in the August 4th, 2014 edition of the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.\nOur eyes see what is called visible light. But there is a lot of light that we can’t see, like ultraviolet and microwave radiation. It turns out that a weak glow of microwave radiation fills the entire sky, in regions between stars. But where does this glow come from?\nAccording to our current understanding of the Big Bang, this glow of microwave radiation is relic light emitted by the Universe when it was a mere 380 000 years old. Before that, the Universe was completely opaque, since light was trapped by a hot plasma. But as the Universe expanded and cooled, electrons and protons combined to form stable atoms, and light was free to propagate for the first time.\nIn principle, this first light has traveled through time and is reaching us now in the form of microwave radiation. Slight variations in this background radiation indicate the seeds of current structure in the Universe, from planets, solar systems, and galaxies all the way to clusters of galaxies, clusters of clusters.\nThe European Space Agency set out to map this radiation to unprecedented resolution by launching the Planck space telescope. Scientists collected information from the telescope and processed it to remove unwanted foreground light, like from stars and galaxies. The information was then assembled together to give the most detailed map of microwave radiation of cosmic origin – a microwave photograph of the early Universe.\nThe Cold Spot: a few tens of millionths of a degree, a big problem for the theory\nWhile the map is generally in agreement with our current theory of the Big Bang, it also contains unexpected features at large-scales, called anomalies. For example, the famous “cold-spot”. On Planck’s map, this region of the universe is characterized by its unusually low temperature. It is just a matter of a few tens of millionths of a degree difference in temperature, which might seem negligible, but it is enough for the map to no longer entirely fit the theory.\nCosmologists are at odds over the source of these anomalies. Do these large-scale features reveal phenomena that require new physics? Or does the information gathered by the Planck space telescope need to be processed differently?\nTuning the data\n A recent European study led by EPFL cosmologist Anaïs Rassat indicates that several of the anomalies disappear if the data from the Planck satellite are processed in a new way. “Using new techniques to separate the foreground light from the background, and taking into account effects like the motion of our Galaxy, we found that most of the claimed anomalies we studied, like the cold spot, stop being problematic,” explains Rassat.\nPrevious methods were left with some regions of unwanted light that needed to be masked in the analysis. Instead, Rassat and her partners from CEA in France, studied a map that avoided masking techniques altogether, giving access to the whole sky. Next, they corrected the data by taking into account the way our Galaxy moves. They also adjusted the data for distortions in the relic light itself as it traveled through moving charged particles in an expanding Universe as well as other known gravitational effects.\nStill room for new physics\n While Rassat and her collaborators have shown that several anomalies were no longer problematic, others may nevertheless persist in the data. For Rassat, this work is just a first step towards systematically going through all of the possible large-scale irregularities and trying to explain their origin. Until then, there is still room for new physics.", "summary": "The Planck Telescope allowed physicists to draw the most detailed map of the first light emitted after the Big Bang.

{"id": 110, "text": "The time has come. The \nAkademik Treshnikov\n will leave the port of Cape Town, South Africa today on the three-month Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). The imposing Russian research ship will carry over 120 people: some 60 researchers from 30 different countries and about the same number of crew members. In addition to circumnavigating Antarctica, they will visit around twelve subantarctic islands.\nThis is the first project put together by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI). It was Frederik Paulsen, a businessman and major philanthropist, who came up with the idea. He is also providing the ACE expedition with logistical backing, drawing on his extensive experience in Arctic exploration. Additional support is being provided by Presence Switzerland, a unit of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.\nThe idea behind the ACE expedition is to measure and quantify the impact of environmental changes and pollution in the Southern Ocean. This region plays a key role in climate regulation: currents of icy water deep in the ocean travel from the poles toward the equator, while warm water and air move across the ocean’s surface towards the cold regions. The earth’s climate can thus be compared to a huge heat engine. This process of heat transfer between polar and tropical regions is also an important component of the carbon cycle and a key factor in the oceans' ability to store CO\n2\n.\n“The poles are essential for climate balance, but they are also the regions where changes are most apparent: that’s where the largest temperature differences have been recorded,” said Philippe Gillet, vice president of EPFL, director ad interim of the SPI and a specialist in Earth and planetary science.\nFrom plankton to microplastics \nTwenty-two research projects will be run during this trip by teams from Switzerland, the UK, France and Australia, to name a few. The projects were selected by a panel of international experts following a call for proposals organized jointly by the polar institutes of eight countries: South Africa, France, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Norway, Russia and Switzerland.\nThe projects cover a wide range of fields, including glaciology, climatology, biology and oceanography. The topics of study include wave formation, geographical variations in plankton populations, chemical exchanges between air and water, biodiversity on the islands, the ocean’s CO\n2\n storage capacity, microplastic pollution and its impact on fauna, and an acoustic analysis of whale populations. This expedition will also build bridges between the various scientific fields. Not only will the researchers collaborate in their on-ship research, but they will build relationships that will set the stage for future collaborations at the international level.\nThe first Maritime University successfully completed\nThe ACE expedition was preceded by the ACE Maritime University. Fifty students studying marine and earth sciences at universities around the world took part. They boarded the \nAkademik Treshnikov \non 19 November in Bremerhaven, in northern Germany, and reached Cape Town on 15 December. The young researchers took intensive theory-oriented classes and then engaged in hands-on practicals that taught them different sampling and analytical techniques and how to handle basic instruments. The students also used this opportunity to learn about their peers’ work in other fields.\nA chair for the study of extreme environments \nThe SPI also has a new chair, which will be formalized today in Cape Town. The Ingvar Kamprad Chair of Extreme Environments will be supported by Ferring Pharmaceuticals and based at EPFL’s Valais-Wallis outpost in Sion. The new team will work in EPFL’s alpine and extreme environment research center. It will apply cutting-edge scientific and technological solutions to environmental challenges like climate change and global resource management. This approach will enhance Switzerland’s existing scientific, economic and diplomatic contribution to this effort.\nThe research ship will hoist anchor at 4pm today, and is scheduled to return to Cape Town on 19 March 2017.

{"id": 111, "text": "The daily dance of commuting and working – the famous French “métro, boulot, dodo” - hasn’t changed much in the past few decades, aside from our new constant companions – mobile phones. They collect a host of data as we travel, particularly about the trajectories we follow. And because most of us aren’t very adventurous, these data can also be used as a statistical basis from which to predict with a high degree of accuracy where we’re likely to go next at any given point in time. Three PhD students at the EPFL Computer and Communication Sciences School have refined this idea, which could lead to new services and applications. On June 19, the accuracy of their predictions earned them first place in the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge, an international contest involving 108 teams from universities such as TU Berlin, Carnegie Mellon and Virginia Tech.\nWhere will I go next? This was one of the challenges Nokia put forth in its contest, and the one that the EPFL students chose to tackle. Nokia provided mobile phone data from 200 volunteers in Western Switzerland collected over the course of more than a year. The contestants had access to eight months’ worth of partial data. The remaining data were used to verify the accuracy of their predictions.\nThe first task was to unveil the users’ regular behavior. The data from the phones gave clues about the places the users visited; lots of Bluetooth devices in a particularly crowded spot, wifi networks that reappeared regularly, devices to which the users connected.\n“The method is based on our habits,” explains Juha Laurila, from Lausanne’s Nokia Research Center. “If, for example, an event repeatedly occurs on a certain day of the week and a more or less identical hour of the day, then we have an element that allows us to statistically predict the user’s movements.”\nTo make the challenge even tougher, the students only had access to a limited amount of data – for example, they couldn’t use the phones’ GPS data. These constraints forced them to push the statistical techniques to their absolute limits. Starting with very piecemeal information, the three PhD students, Vincent Etter, Mohamed Kafsi and Ehsan Kazemi, were able to predict in most cases where the user would go next at any given point in time. “The goal was to glean as much information as possible from an incomplete data set,” explains Laurila. “If we add things like GPS data, then we would have an even more powerful system.”\nLooking forward, these results could be used to develop new services and mobile phone applications, such as automatic traffic notifications, automatic messaging to warn of possible delays, improved agendas, and so on. According to Laurila and Daniel Gatica Perez, co-director of the contest at Idiap, the social sciences could also benefit from these kinds of analysis methods. “This procedure could be very useful for understanding people’s habits and regular behavior, particularly in the field of computational social sciences.”", "summary": "Can mobile phones predict our behavior?

The number of patent filings has increased in similar proportions, rising from 256 between 1995 and 2004 to 539 between 2005 and 2014. This increase is due in part to EPFL's growth. But for Gabriel Clerc, head of the TTO since it was created, this rise can also be attributed to a growing awareness among researchers of the importance of gaining market recognition for their ideas and research results.\nOver half of licenses are used by Swiss SMEs\n Of the 1500 inventions filed so far with the TTO, around 40% have been or will be put to commercial use through a license agreement with a start-up or existing company. The number of innovations currently being used by companies in the form of licenses is also twice as high now (391) as in 2005 (191). More than half of these rights were assigned in recent years to Swiss companies with fewer than 250 employees. “It is gratifying to see that most of our license agreements are with Swiss start-ups and small businesses,” said Mr. Clerc. “These companies are a major contributor to the strength of our economy and employment levels both regionally and nationwide.”\nSome of EPFL’s inventions enjoy widespread use around the world. One of its first inventions to experience widespread industrial success – Reymond Clavel’s Delta robot – was created 30 years ago. It is used by many companies and is commonly found in a number of sectors, including the rapid manipulation of small objects, watchmaking, remote surgery, measurement systems and material processing.

{"id": 120, "text": "How can solar energy be stored so that it can be available any time, day or night, when the sun shining or not? EPFL scientists are developing a technology that can transform light energy into a clean fuel that has a neutral carbon footprint: hydrogen. The basic ingredients of the recipe are water and metal oxides, such as iron oxide, better known as rust. Kevin Sivula and his colleagues purposefully limited themselves to inexpensive materials and easily scalable production processes in order to enable an economically viable method for solar hydrogen production. The device, still in the experimental stages, is described in an article .\nThe idea of converting solar energy into hydrogen is not a new one; researchers have been working on it for more than four decades. During the 1990s, EPFL joined the fray, with the research of Michaël Grätzel. With a colleague from University of Geneva, he invented the photoelectrochemical (PEC) tandem solar cell, a technique for producing hydrogen directly from water. Their prototypes shared the same basic principle: a dye-sensitized solar cell – also invented by Michael Grätzel – combined with an oxide-based semiconductor.\nThe device is completely self-contained. The electrons produced are used to break up water molecules and reform the pieces into oxygen and hydrogen. In the same liquid, two distinct layers in the device have the job of generating electrons when stimulated by light; an oxide semiconductor, which performs the oxygen evolution reaction, and a dye-sensitized cell, which liberates the hydrogen.\nThe most expensive part? The glass plate\nThe team’s latest prototype focused on resolving the main outstanding problem with PEC technology: its cost. “A U.S. team managed to attain an impressive efficiency of 12.4%,” says Sivula. “The system is very interesting from a theoretical perspective, but with their method it would cost 10,000 dollars to produce a 10 square centimeter surface.”\nSo the scientists set themselves a limitation from the start – to use only affordable materials and techniques. It wasn’t an easy task, but they managed. “The most expensive material in our device is the glass plate,” explains Sivula. The efficiency is still low – between 1.4% and 3.6%, depending on the prototype used. But the technology has great potential. “With our less expensive concept based on iron oxide, we hope to be able to attain efficiencies of 10% in a few years, for less than $80 per square meter. At that price, we’ll be competitive with traditional methods of hydrogen production.”\nThe semiconductor, which performs the oxygen evolution reaction, is just iron oxide. “It’s a stable and abundant material. There’s no way it will rust any further! But it’s one of the worst semiconductors available,” Sivula admits.\nSilicon-enhanced nano-rust\nThat’s why the iron oxide used by the team is a bit more developed than what you’d find on an old nail. Nanostructured, enhanced with silicon oxide, covered with a nanometer-thin layer of aluminum oxide and cobalt oxide – these treatments optimize the electrochemical properties of the material, but are nonetheless simple to apply. “We needed to develop easy preparation methods, like ones in which you could just dip or paint the material.”\nThe second part of the device is composed of a dye and titanium dioxide – the basic ingredients of a dye-sensitized solar cell. This second layer lets the electrons transferred by the iron oxide gain enough energy to extract hydrogen from water.\nAn outstanding potential – up to 16%\nThe results presented in the Nature Photonics paper represent a breakthrough in performance that has been enabled by recent advances in the study of both the iron oxide and dye-sensitized titanium dioxide, and both of these technologies are rapidly advancing. Sivula predicts that the tandem cell technology will eventually be able to attain an efficiency of 16% with iron oxide, while still remaining low cost, which is, after all, the attractiveness of the approach. By making it possible to store solar energy inexpensively, the system developed at EPFL could considerably increase the potential of solar energy to serve as a viable renewable energy source for the future.", "summary": "EPFL scientists are producing hydrogen from sunlight, water and rust.

This system could free millions of people throughout the world from having to undergo the tedious skin test, which consists of scratching or pricking the skin to allow exposure to various allergens, and then evaluating the skin's reaction.\nA few drops of a reagent are mixed with the blood sample. The preparation is placed in a compartmentalized capsule that contains ten biochips, each of which is prepared with a different allergen. The tiny device is mounted on a plastic surface in the form of a CD and “read” by a laser. The results appear on the screen and are automatically saved to a memory card. The doctor can read, print and save the results to his or her computer. The CD can be personalized with several dozens of different allergens.\nCounting molecules\nIn a general sense, nanofluidic biochips take advantage of various special properties that fluids exhibit at the nanometer scale. Nicolas Durand built upon this technology as part of his PhD research in EPFL’s Microsystems Laboratory, and it was further developed by the Biomedical Imaging Laboratory start-up. Here’s how it works: The blood enters into contact with allergens that have been previously deposited in the biochip. The interactions between certain proteins in the blood, which are marked with a fluorochrome (a chemical substance that can emit light upon excitation) and the immobilized allergens are measured by fluorescence. The device’s laser excites the protein-allergen molecular complexes, and they emit light. The concentration of these complexes determines the degree of the allergy. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, but in this case, you’re sure to find it if it’s there.\nNext targets: cancer and Alzheimer’s disease\nAccording to the Swiss Center for Allergies, about a quarter of the Swiss population exhibits various allergic symptoms. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has announced that close to 50% of Americans suffer from allergies. On a global scale, all allergies, including food allergies, have been on the upswing since the mid-1950s. “The world market for diagnostics in 2011 was evaluated at more than 40 billion Swiss francs,” Durand reports.\nThe company’s objectives are equally promising; in addition to reducing the analysis time on their device even further, the start-up is already looking at the possibility of using the method to detect other diseases whose blood biomarkers will be commercially available, such as certain cancers and Alzheimer’s disease.", "summary": "Abionic, an EPFL spin-off, has just brought its first round of financing to a close and was selected yesterday by Red Herring as one of Europe’s 100 most innovative companies.

{"id": 125, "text": "For his semester project, Alexandre Foucqueteau came up with a new application for a little multifunctional robot called Cellulo. Created at EPFL two years ago in a collaboration between the Computer-Human Interaction Lab for Learning & Instrution (CHILI) and the Robotic Systems Laboratory (LSRO) with the support of NCCR Robotics, the robot can now help visually impaired children get around their classroom. The child moves the little robot around a map of the room. When the robot bumps virtually into something, such as a table or the teacher's desk, it can recognize the object. That may sound like a piece of cake, but getting a tablet to interact with the robot and recognize the objects was actually quite complex.\nFoucqueteau worked on the project in partnership with Agnieszka Kolodziej, a PhD student from the cognition, language and ergonomics unit at the University of Toulouse who is studying spatial awareness and language learning among blind people. \"I spent five months observing classes of visually impaired children aged between three and nine years old. The classes were very mixed, and the learning tools available did not really meet their needs. Thanks to our partnership with EPFL, we've been able to come up with a really fun and interactive project.\" That's how this new application for the little robot came to be.\nTo enable the children to visualize the classroom in 2D and understand where furniture is located, Foucqueteau had to create a model of the room and teach Cellulo to clearly indicate anything blocking the way. \"This is how it works: the robot stops, moves back and vibrates when it touches something. The child then has to say what the robot has hit. If the child is spatially lost and doesn’t know, the tablet can say what it is – the crayon cupboard or the teacher's desk, for instance.\"\nCellulo is particularly solid and easy to handle. Its mechanism is magnetic, which means it’s not easily damaged. It can also be moved quickly without breaking. So children can take their time to find their way – they can bump virtually into every cupboard, chair and table if need be. The teacher can also program the robot to follow a given path.\nFor Foucqueteau, the most difficult part was working out how to guide Cellulo. He had to delve into the programing interface, learn how to use it and modify it for his needs.\nNow that Cellulo knows its way around the classroom, Foucqueteau wants to create a collaborative treasure hunt, in which two children work together to find the virtual treasure on the map and the real treasure in the classroom.\nPress release :", "summary": "Summer series – students works:\n Alexandre Foucqueteau has taught Cellulo, a little hand-sized robot, how to help visually impaired children find their bearings and avoid obstacles in the classroom.", "claim": "Summer series – students works:\n Alexandre Foucqueteau has taught Cellulo, a little hand-sized robot, how to help visually impaired children find your bearings and avoid obstacles in the classroom.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [27, 27], "noise": false}
{"id": 126, "text": "What do monitoring a national park, identifying suitable building locations and managing a vineyard have in common? All these activities, and a wide range of others, can be carried out more quickly and comprehensively by using aerial and satellite images. The artificial intelligence platform developed by startup Picterra allows anyone to extract crucial information from drone or satellite images – many of which are in the public domain – in a few clicks. It will be presented to the public and sector professionals tomorrow at GEOSummit in Bern.\nThe system’s basic algorithms were developed by Picterra’s CTO Frank de Morsier. It can locate and count user-selected elements and spatio-temporal changes after quickly learning which objects to recognize. The machine interactively and rapidly compares the object’s characteristics with the other elements of the image, or compares the basic image with other images of the location, in order to detect changes. “Although artificial intelligence (AI) has made huge strides in the fields of ‘natural’ language and text analysis, using AI specifically to analyze terrestrial imaging is almost virgin territory,” said de Morsier, also lecturer at Geographic Information Systems Laboratory.\nHuman expertise at the heart of artificial intelligence\nUsers simply upload their orthomosaic – i.e., aerial images stitched together to form just one large image – and has also access to several sources of satellite images corresponding to his area of interest. He selects a few options from a drop-down menu and then pin-point some examples of the selected elements on the image. The process can then be enhanced through the addition of other images. The system has a huge range of potential applications, for example in the agriculture, defense, finance, shipping, government, university and research sectors. Other platforms that allow users to compile and exploit aerial images exist, but Picterra has created a simple system that everyone can use for their own purposes. It therefore relies on human expertise, which sets the direction that machine learning then follows.\nAfter it was founded in 2016, Picterra tested its system – which offers 5-centimeter resolution – using several real situations, including monitoring illegal logging in several African, Asian and South-American countries, tracking vine stocks in a large vineyard and detecting trees that are dangerously close to high-voltage cables. The startup has used the resulting expertise to develop a new, customizable system that anyone can use. It can observe areas of up to 2,000 km\n2\n ,which corresponds of the size of a satellite image. But the coverage is global: it can scan a surface of a few hectares as well as an entire continent. “For example, it would be perfectly possible for a citizens’ association to use AI to analyze a beach and distinguish between organic waste and waste of human origin, or for a company to use a customized AI system to track its cargo all around the world,” said Pierrick Poulenas, CEO.\nThe company also benefits from the liberalization of the space sector. The arrival of many companies able to build, launch and operate at low cost observation satellites, but also new types of equipment such as solar drones in low orbit. This has a direct impact on the cost of images, which has dropped while their spatial and temporal resolution has exploded. \"In the next five years, high-resolution, real-time images of the Earth will be available.

{"id": 128, "text": "Many cancers, such as melanoma, are known to metastasize and spread by expanding nearby lymphatic vessels. This process, lymphangiogenesis, also helps the tumor evade the patient’s own immune system, and it would be expected that inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, which are only effective in a minority of patients. But in a surprising discovery, scientists from EPFL and the US found the opposite: lymphangiogenesis actually enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy against melanoma. , the study has significant implications for new types of cancer therapies.\nCancer immunotherapy is one of the most promising treatments against tumors. The process involves overcoming the tumor’s suppression of immune attacks, thus allowing the patient’s own immune system to destroy it. But despite the highly encouraging results from clinics only a subset of patients is able to respond to immunotherapy. Until now, the reasons have been unclear.\nOne of the problems is that many tumors evolve clever defenses against the patient’s immune system to evade or survive such attacks. For example, melanomas and other tumors induce lymphangiogenesis with a protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C (VEGF-C). The presence of VEGF-C and subsequent lymphangiogenesis are generally signs of metastasis and create a poor prognosis for the patient. In addition, recent studies have also suggested that VEGF-C may also help the melanoma tumor suppress the patient’s immune system.\nConsequently, a team of scientists led by the lab  (now at the ) with co-first authors Manuel Fankhauser and Maria Broggi hypothesized that VEGF-C induced lymphangiogenesis and immune suppression would hinder the effectiveness of immunotherapy.\nSurprisingly, the scientists found that VEGF-C and lymphangiogenesis can strongly boost the effects of immunotherapy in melanoma. The discovery was unexpected, as the scientists were trying to enhance immunotherapy by blocking VEGF-C in mouse melanoma models. Instead, they observed the opposite: the impact of immunotherapy on mice with melanoma actually got worse when lymphangiogenesis was blocked.\nFollowing up with further studies, the researchers found an explanation for their observations: the new lymphatic vessels created by the melanoma tumor secrete the chemokine CCL21, which actively attracts naïve (undifferentiated) T cells into the tumor’s immunosuppressed microenvironment. Once in the tumor, these naïve T cells are locally activated following immunotherapy-induced tumor cell death, which triggers a positive feedback loop of long-lasting anti-tumor immunity.\nThe team tested their hypothesis on different mouse models of melanoma using multiple immunotherapy approaches, including vaccination and adoptive T cell transfer. All of these eradicated or slowed down the growth of primary melanoma tumors, and in some settings even conferred the mice with long-term protection against metastasis.\nBeyond the pre-clinical models though, the scientists tested their hypothesis in human patients with melanoma. “The difference was really striking,” says Melody Swartz. “Almost all of the patients with higher than average VEGF-C levels in their blood responded to immunotherapy. This not only resulted in eradication of the primary tumors, it also encouraged T cell infiltration into metastatic tumors and resulted in long-term protection.” The researchers therefore propose that VEGF-C can be a predictive biomarker that indicates how well a patient is responding to immunotherapy.\n“We now appreciate the numerous mechanisms of immunosuppression that a T cell-inflamed tumor develops to survive, including lymphangiogenesis,” the authors write. “But when the scales are tipped toward activating factors dominating over suppressive ones, as is the case with immunotherapy, these T cells become robust participants in antitumor immunity.”\nThe findings reveal an unappreciated role of tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis in shaping the tumor’s immune microenvironment, and pave the way for therapeutic strategies that exploit it. The study is of critical importance to cancer immunotherapy, which is growing into a formidable weapon against tumors of different types. For example, the  for leukemia and several checkpoint inhibitors are already approved for the treatment of solid tumors such as melanoma. All of these are breakthrough medicines that are now curing patients who would previously have had low chances for survival.\nContributing institutions\nInstitute for Molecular Engineering and The Ben May Institute for Cancer Research, University of Chicago\nDepartment of Oncology and Ludwig Cancer Research, University of Lausanne\nOregon Health and Science University\nBioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility, EPFL\nSwiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC), EPFL\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nSwiss TransMed\nEuropean Research Council (ERC)\nFonds Pierre-François Vittone\nReference\nManuel Fankhauser, Maria A.S.

{"id": 129, "text": "Sylke Hoehnel is preparing to make a 15-minute pitch on her startup, Sun Bioscience, at the Cartier Women’s Initiative Awards in San Francisco. We’ll know tomorrow evening whether she’s done enough to scoop the top prize. But she’s already enjoying the exposure and personal coaching that comes with being among the 24 finalists – who were selected from a field of over 2,000 female entrepreneurs from around the world. Hoehnel and her co-founder, Nathalie Brandenberg, have developed a simple, reliable, time-saving grid system that allows for the standardized growth of organoids – tiny three-dimensional organ fragments with powerful applications in drug trials and research. Their breakthrough couldn’t have come at a better time. Here, Hoehnel tells us more about her company’s technology, and how she plans to market the product on her terms.\nCan you tell us a bit more about your system?\nOrganoids are being used in an increasing number of applications, such as drug trials, but they need the right structure and a special environment to grow. At the moment, researchers are still doing that work by hand. It’s a time-consuming process that’s difficult to reproduce. Our solution, which we can manufacture at scale, combines a round grid with a microstructured gel that supports organoid growth. Using our technology, researchers can make multiple copies of the same organoid, all exactly the same size. That might seem insignificant to an outsider, but it’s extremely difficult to do when you’re working at a nanoscopic scale.\nAward entrants need to demonstrate they have a marketable product. Can you manufacture your product at scale yet, and who are your customers? \nWe’ve developed a robot that prints the structure onto the gel and assembles the grid. We began selling the system, which we call Gri3D, earlier this year. We’ve had several major pharmaceutical companies buy it, and the feedback’s been very good so far. We’re also using it ourselves as part of a cystic fibrosis clinical trial with Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). The system lets us observe, in three dimensions, how tissues respond to different forms of treatment.\nCould you build on your cystic fibrosis research and use the technology to trial drugs for other diseases? \nYes, that’s one of our aims. However, we recognize that it’s important to take things one step at a time. Many people, not least investors, have set their sights on cancer. It’s a vast market. But just understanding cancer in the human body is hard enough. Growing something in the laboratory then claiming “that’s cancer” is a bit of a leap. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic mutation, so it’s relatively straightforward to check whether a given molecule might work.\nWhat do you expect to gain from the week you are spending in San Francisco?\nWe’ve had invaluable support from people around us so far, and I think spending time there will help us grow our network further. Aside from the competition, there’s a week-long program of workshops for the finalists, including sessions with previous years’ winners. The awards are also an incredible opportunity to gain exposure. The whole thing is run like an ad campaign, with videos and an expansive social media presence. And tomorrow, we’ll be giving a TED Talk-style presentation on our business plan. To be honest, I’ve never seen anything like it (\nshe laughs\n). Standard startup competitions pale in comparison.\nHow did the selection process work? Did you have to prepare for it?\nEntrants were whittled down to the final 24 based on their applications. Once we’d made it onto the short list, a specialist pharma business coach helped us refine our business plan. The next step was to work on my pitch. The organizers are keen to make it a glitzy, glamorous event, very much in the American showbiz vein – we’re supposed to act like stars (\nshe laughs\n). Three entrants from eight regions have made it through to the finals in San Francisco. The judges will pick a winner from each region, based on their pitch and business plan.\nMore and more women are starting their own business these days, but you’re still in the minority. Do you find it hard being a female entrepreneur here in Switzerland?\nNot especially, no. I’ve been to quite a few business meetings where almost everyone else has been a man. On the odd occasion, I’ve felt a bit awkward as a woman among them (\nshe laughs\n). I also remember when we signed the agreement for our Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT) loan in front of a notary. He remarked that the whole document was written in the masculine gender, when in fact both of us are women. He said that had never come up before.\nWhat’s been the hardest part about setting up your business, and what are you most proud of?\nI learned a lot when I was studying for my PhD. But setting up a new business is an entirely different ballgame. It’s a steep learning curve. At first, you feel like you’re cast adrift at sea, doing whatever you can to stay afloat and juggle one problem after another. The fact that there were two of us from the outset was a real bonus. And we’ve since brought in a chief financial officer. All three of us have a great working relationship, we help each other out. And we’re proud of the fact that we’ve brought our product to market without external investment. We developed our system and started mass-producing it using only the money we earned from startup competitions. Very few people thought we’d manage it. But we made a conscious decision to work with our customers on the product development side. If we’d brought in investors, they’d have pushed us to focus more on cancer. We decided we weren’t ready to take that step. We’re now looking to raise two million francs from investors to take our business to the next level.\nAre you planning to keep developing your product in Switzerland?\nYes, that’s the idea. But a lot depends on our investors. If they only agree to invest if we move to the United States, that’ll leave us with no option. Ideally, we’re looking for a Swiss investor who wants us to stay put (\nshe smiles\n).", "summary": "Sylke Hoehnel, co-founder and CEO of EPFL spin-off Sun Bioscience, has reached the finals of the Cartier Women’s Initiative Awards.

{"id": 130, "text": "When the Mühleberg nuclear power station goes offline in 2019, the waters of the Aar River and Lake Biel will cool down. And since the Aar feeds into the Rhine, the effects could be felt as far away as southern Germany. Should we be worried? It’s hard to say. The drop in temperature, which EPFL researchers estimate at 0.3°C, should slow the local impact of global warming. But it can also be an advantage for nearby companies that draw water from the Aar and the Rhine to cool their machinery.\nThe EPFL study, which was published in \nWater Resources Research\n, showed for the first time the impact that closing a nuclear power plant in Switzerland will have on the physics of its surrounding rivers and lakes. The researchers’ methodology could be applied to the country’s other nuclear plants.\nTaking local measurements\n “Nuclear power plants have a major impact on the surrounding environment,” says Love Råman Vinnå, the study’s lead author and a PhD student at EPFL’s Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory (APHYS). “Around 70% of the heat produced by the Mühleberg plant ends up in the Aar. The remaining 30% is turned into electricity. The plant will stop generating heat in 2019, and it’s crucial to both gauge and prepare for the effect that will have on water temperature and stratification. We know, for example, that an abrupt temperature change at the local level is a stress factor for fish, and can change the composition of plankton.”\nMeasurements at three sites\n Vinnå points in particular to the importance of taking upfront measurements at multiple sites in order to better anticipate the consequences of shutting down a nuclear plant. His study draws on two years and four months of fieldwork on Lake Biel – from May 2013 to September 2015. His team of researchers attached sensors to ropes and submerged them deep into the lake at three different spots. They took continuous measurements of several variables such as water temperature at different depths and the speed of water currents. They also obtained data on air temperature, wind and rain from MeteoSwiss, along with key information from BKW – the company that runs the Mühleberg plant – including the amount of heat given off by the plant (around 700 megawatts) and data specific to its regular summer shutdown.\n1D and 3D models\n Vinnå then took 1D and 3D theoretical models that resolve temporal changes in lake hydrodynamics – in other words, how lake temperatures and currents evolve over time – and adapted them to the Mühleberg plant. “We started out by comparing our measurements from the lake with the figures predicted by our 1D model,” says Vinnå. “This model is useful because it's fast and cheap, but it’s less accurate than the 3D model, whose output did indeed correspond closely to our field measurements. The 3D model makes more sense for complex case studies or when more accurate results are needed.”\nHe then used the models to come up with precise forecasts of how the decommissioning of the Mühleberg plant will affect Lake Biel. This plant was relatively simple to model in this way since the lake’s water is completely replaced every two months, which made the results of the 1D and 3D models fairly close to each other. The researchers predict an average 0.3°C drop in temperature throughout the lake starting in 2019 – although the 3D model's extremes suggest that certain spots will experience a drop by up to 4°C in the winter. It also turns out that temperature differences may be noticeable as far away as southern Germany, since around 150 megawatts of heat are carried 350 kilometers away from Lake Biel.\nModeling for a utility company\n Vinnå’s thesis is being backed by Biel’s utility company, Energieservice Biel/Bienne, which supplies water, gas, and electricity to residents of the city and the surrounding Seeland region. Planning to upgrade its infrastructure, the company wanted to know which parts of the lake would be cleanest and coldest after 2019. The EPFL researchers used the 1D and 3D models to present the company with a series of recommendations, visualized in the form of a map.\nVinnå continues to work on his thesis and is already preparing another article that will be of use to Energieservice Biel/Bienne. These days, he is looking at the local consequences of climate change on Lake Biel after the Mühleberg nuclear plant closes down. One thing seems certain: by cooling the waters of the lake, shutting down the power plant should postpone the local effects of climate change – at least for a while.\nThis study was co-authored by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and is part of the ETH Domain (EAWAG). \nReference", "summary": "Mühleberg is the first Swiss nuclear power plant slated for decommissioning in 2019.

{"id": 142, "text": "What were your main sources of inspiration during the architecture competition?\nKersten Geers: \nThe circumstances surrounding this project are exceptional in several ways. First, it is a fascinating environment. The fact that it’s located on a university campus, straddling UNIL and EPFL, is also out of the ordinary. Having the Rolex Learning Center as a neighbour played a crucial role in our thinking as well.\nHow do you build something next to an emblematic structure like the Rolex Learning Center?\nK.G. : \nOur project is a response to both the RLC and Under One Roof. These two buildings are distinctive for their landscape approach, so for reasons of continuity it was out of the question to envision a towering edifice. And since the entire campus is built on gentle slopes, we too adopted a landscape approach. Our building, which will have some public spaces, is meant to be a passageway between EPFL and UNIL, via Under One Roof and the RLC – we think it may even liven up the east wing of the RLC.\nYou mention openness: will the public have access to the RTS editorial offices?\nDavid Van Severen: \nThe building will not be public, but several parts of it will be accessible, including a restaurant. It will also house a day-care centre and a multimedia library. But it's really the design itself that makes it a passageway. The editorial offices resemble a large plate – a “continuous field” – hung on four blocks. The plate floats seven metres above ground, like a canopy, protecting many possible pathways and delineating ground-level spaces, some more exposed than others. For example, there will be a large overhang under which events could be held. The public could also be involved in programmes in the main studio or other events organised by RTS.\nHow many employees will the building hold?\nK.G.: \nAt maximum capacity, 600 to 700 people will be able to work there. But the electronic media industry experiences ups and downs, by definition. Add to this the unknown ways in which this industry will evolve in 10 or 20 years – hence the need for a significant modular component.

{"id": 143, "text": "A new type of thread has been developed at EPFL that varies in stiffness depending on its temperature. This new structure could be used in future robots, orthopedics and even medical devices for biopsy. The results are now published online in .\nA drone that integrates these threads of variable stiffness can morph from a flying device into a robotic car : the motors can be used as either propellers or as wheels, depending on their position which can be adjusted thanks to the threads. When knitted, the thread could be used as an electronic cast for rehabilitation of broken joints. A modular biopsy device could be soft for safe exploration of human orifices, and hardened to favor biopsy sampling.\n“The amazing flexibility of this new lightweight thread is due to its ingenious simplicity and robustness that makes it easy to manufacture and use in a wide range of applications, shapes, and combinations with other technologies”, says the project director Dario Floreano.\nHow it works \nA silicone tube contains a metal alloy that is solid below 62 degrees Celsius, but that melts at temperatures above. By wrapping the silicone tube with thin conductive wire, the tube can be heated above this threshold temperature by simply injecting current into the wire.\nWhen the tube is heated, the thread is soft, rubbery and stretchable like the silicone tube. But when the thread is cooled below 62 degrees Celsius, the metal core solidifies and the thread becomes solid, becoming over 700 times stiffer and defining its rigid shape. The thread therefore has the ability to vary its stiffness – making it soft and deformable, or stiff and inextensible – depending on its temperature.\nThe composite thread also has self-healing properties. If the thread, in its solid state, gets cracked, it can self-heal by simply melting the metal core.\nFor EPFL scientist Alice Tonazzini, this composite material can be further explored for more advanced applications in robotics. Tonazzini says, “We would like to transform our thread into a robotic material that is able to mimic the complex functionalities of biological tissue.”\nAlong with EPFL, this work comes out of NCCR Robotics, a consortium of 23 robotics laboratories across Switzerland.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a new type of composite thread that varies in stiffness depending on its temperature.

{"id": 146, "text": "Over a billion people worldwide live without electricity. The problem is especially acute in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, where many families spend their evenings in darkness and most cell phone owners are unable to charge their device at home.\n, a startup founded by two graduates of EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI), has developed a clean, affordable battery using iron, water, coffee filters and carbon felt. With a single charge, the battery can power an LED bulb for five hours or charge a cell phone. Once used, the liquid inside can be safely released into the environment.\nA dozen of prototypes manufactured and distributed through a local branch managed by local staff are currently being tested in families. “Our technology has the potential to change people’s everyday lives,” says Briac Barthes, who holds a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering and co-founded the company. “For one of the pilot families, the battery allowed their daughter to study in the evening. Having light can also transform the way people interact, bringing socialization opportunities for isolated and vulnerable families.”\nAn alternative to kerosene\nCurrently, people living in rural parts of Tanzania use kerosene lamps to light up their homes when it gets dark. But kerosene is an expensive and highly flammable fuel that emits harmful soot particles when burned. “Breathing kerosene smoke in a confined space for five hours is as bad for your lungs as smoking two packs of cigarettes,” explains Barthes.\nIron foil, coffee filters and carbon felt\nThe new reusable, four-compartment battery solves most of these problems. To generate power when needed, the user simply has to reload the unit with consumables. First, sheets of iron foil, coffee-filter paper and carbon felt are inserted through the four doors. Next, the user pours a solution of water and iron sulfate powder inside the battery. As the liquid soaks into the carbon filter, it slowly dissolves the iron foil. This process releases electrons, thereby generating electricity. Users can then harness this power by connecting a lamp or cell phone to the battery’s built-in USB port.\n The reaction produces iron 2 sulfate, a harmless liquid widely used as an agricultural fertilizer.\nThe battery costs around half as much as a kerosene lamp. The unit itself retails for 12 dollars, while the consumables cost just 12 cents per recharge. “Once recharged, the battery produces five hours’ worth of electricity,” says Barthes.\nThe company is currently focusing on Tanzania but plans to eventually expand into other markets.\nFor further information, visit the \nFounders: \nBriac Barthes, co-founder, CEO, Master’s in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship, EPFL\nDavid Lambelet, co-founder, CTO, Master’s in Microengineering with a minor in Energy, EPFL\nJonathan Fiorentini, co-founder, CFO, Master’s in Banking and Finance, University of St. Gallen", "summary": "EPFL startup hiLyte has developed an eco-friendly battery that will allow people in Sub-Saharan Africa to light their homes and charge their cell phones.

The technology, developed from research carried out at EPFL, was initially used to make connected sports surfaces – but has since been enhanced for use in applications ranging from shopping malls and hospitals to event venues. Technis’ innovation turns everyday flooring into smart systems that can collect and transmit data in real time.\n“We wanted to create a system that could determine the number of people entering and leaving an area in real time. Our connected surface is easy to install on any type of synthetic flooring and provides an array of data for recognizing and predicting visitor behavior,” says Wiktor Bourée, CEO of Technis. Their technology uses machine learning to generate increasingly powerful algorithms that learn from the data the system collects. The algorithms can already recognize different ways of walking, objects with wheels and when a person falls, for example. This activity is translated into tables and charts, which can be viewed in real time on both computers and mobile devices. “Floors have long been overlooked in the quest to develop connected objects. Our technology is revolutionary because it doesn’t just count the number of people in a building – it’s a genuine smart system that detects, recognizes and analyzes what’s happening on a floor surface,” says Bourée.\nThe system has already been commercialized at several event venues in French-speaking Switzerland – including EPFL’s SwissTech Convention Center – and France. And unlike a camera, it’s non-intrusive, meaning it can be used in hospitals and retirement and nursing homes. The connected floor surfaces can also be combined with other types of sensors to collect even more data and better optimize the movement of people through a given area.\nTechnis has already won over 10 innovation awards and grants and has successfully completed two fund-raising rounds, the proceeds of which were used to launch its first products on the market and further its expansion.

Some groups were even able to shadow the doctors and observe an operation in order to get a better grasp of their needs. “The first task was to turn the doctors’ still-imprecise explanations into engineering specifications,” says Alexandre Pican, one of the students involved in the project. “We were really motivated by the fact that we were looking for a solution to a real problem,” adds Marc Brossard, a microengineering student.\nA more accurate assessment of how a skin graft is healing\nAlthough it was difficult to come up with a complete solution in just three months, the students nevertheless had some innovative ideas. The group working on the skin graft project had the idea of making the skin vibrate using actuators and then measuring the vibrations – and the skin’s reaction to them. Their aim was to find a contactless way of assessing how far along a large area of skin was in the healing process, and then to monitor progress using standardized data. “For now, wound analysis is very localized – it is often done by simply pinching the skin, for instance – and each doctor has their own technique,” explains Robin Fallegger, a student in life sciences engineering. “Measurements are not standardized, which can make it hard to monitor progress over several years, especially when different doctors are involved.”\nPreventing complications during a hip replacement\nA second group, under the supervision of a surgeon and a researcher from the Schulthess Klinik in Zurich, looked at ways to strengthen an instrument that breaks during one in every thousand hip replacement surgeries. “To implant the prosthesis, the femur has to be prepared using a broach. A handle is then used to remove it,” explain Vincent de Poulpiquet and Noé Schmutz, two students involved in this project. “The broach contains a small cylinder, which hooks onto the handle. If the cylinder breaks, the handle can’t be used and part of the bone has to be sawn off to get the broach out.” The team came up with a new, more resilient latching system, together with a backup solution just in case the broach breaks anyway. \nStudents looked at ways to strengthen the small cylinder of this instrument, used during hip replacement surgeries.\nThe teams comprised students from various fields, which meant they could pool their various skills. Life sciences engineering students brought and applied their biological know-how, while those in microengineering and mechanical engineering were able to determine what was actually feasible and ensure that the solutions they came up with could be replicated. The groups of students also worked with professors and other experts to get them on the right track and fill in any gaps in their knowledge.

{"id": 151, "text": "Nothing in biology is static. Biological processes fluctuate over time, and if we are to put together an accurate picture of cells, tissues, organs etc., we have to take into account their temporal patterns. In fact, this effort has given rise to an entire field of study known as “chronobiology”.\nThe liver is a prime example. Everything we eat or drink is eventually processed there to separate nutrients from waste and regulate the body’s metabolic balance. In fact, the liver as a whole is extensively time-regulated, and this pattern is orchestrated by the so-called circadian clock, our body’s internal metronome, as well as biochemical signals and eating rhythms.\nBut the liver also has an intriguing “geography” as it is actually divided into small repeating units called “lobules”, in which distinct zones perform different functions. This intricate spatial organization is known as “liver zonation”. For example, the breakdown of sugars during digestion takes place preferentially on one side of the lobule, the so-called central zone, while the production of glucose while we rest from stores such as fat, occurs on the other side of the liver, at the portal side.\nSo far, liver zonation has only been studied statically, looking into what each zone does independently of time, and vice-versa. And given how central the liver is in mammalian physiology, the two research approaches have to join efforts to understand how temporal and spatial liver programs interact.\nLiver zonation patterns of E-cadherin around the portal vein and of N-cadherin around the central vein, shown by immunofluorescence (scale bar: 100 micrometers).

Studying this link is a focus of Naef’s research, which has previously uncovered connections between the circadian clock and , our , and , the tightly packaged DNA in the cell nucleus.\nThe study came out of a EPFL-Weizmann joint grant from the Rothschild Caesarea Foundation.\nBy exploiting the ability to analyze liver tissue in every individual cell, the researchers studied approximately 5000 genes in liver cells at several timepoints throughout the 24-hour day. They then statistically classified the space-time patterns they uncovered with a model that can capture both spatial and temporal variations in the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA), a marker of gene expression.\nThe study revealed that many of the liver’s genes seem to be both zonated and rhythmic, meaning that they are regulated by both their location in the liver and the time of the day. These dually regulated genes are mostly linked to key functions of the liver, e.g. the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, but also include a few genes that have never been associated with metabolism, e.g. genes related to chaperone proteins, which help other biomolecules change their 3D structure or even assemble and disassemble.\n“The work reveals a richness of space-time gene expression dynamics of the liver, and shows how compartmentalization of liver function in both space and time is hallmark of metabolic activity in the mammalian liver,” says Felix Naef.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have carried out the first comprehensive study of how genes in the liver perform their metabolic functions in both space and time of day.

{"id": 159, "text": "Soil erosion, landslides, rising sea levels and other consequences of extreme weather conditions can weaken the ground which surrounds infrastructure. In order to maintain their structural integrity, the subsoil often has to be stabilized. Existing solutions, which commonly use cement, lime or industrial resins, do not necessarily provide with long-term stability and have often a hazardous effect on the soil quality with microplastics and toxic substances or by raising groundwater alkalinity above acceptable levels.\nMedusoil, an EPFL spin-off, is the first company in the world to develop a soil-stabilization solution that harnesses – and accelerates – a natural process: it generates mineral calcite, a powerful binder that hardens soil at the microscopic level. The solution is fast, inexpensive and consumes little energy. The company has successfully tested its technique on eroding cliffs in the Vaud Canton. It has also set up a facility to mass-produce its soil-stabilization agent as well as a mobile injection unit that can be dispatched to construction sites.\nUsing microorganisms as the triggering agent\nTaking its cue from nature, the mineralization process creates calcite crystals, which firmly bind the gravel or sand particles together. For the triggering agent, the researchers used \nSporosarcina pasteurii\n microorganisms, which they freeze-dried for easier handling. When combined with urea molecules, the microorganisms release carbonate, which binds to the calcium to form crystals. The crystals attach to particles in the ground and grow in number and size – in some cases reaching several hundred micrometers across. Urease, an enzyme released as part of the microorganism’s digestive process, accelerates the reaction, making it 1,000 times faster than in nature. And the end product is achieved in a matter of days or even hours.\nReal-world testing\nThe Medusoil team came up with the most promising fluid compositions at EPFL’s Laboratory of Soil Mechanics and then began testing them under real-life conditions in 2018. One of the pilot projects was to reinforce a sandstone cliff that had become unstable as a result of surface erosion caused by wind and by rain runoff that affected the fine soil particles. “During these tests, we were able to consolidate the soil in the target zone and make it denser, thereby improving its stability,” says Dimitrios Terzis, the firm’s CEO. The test results were corroborated by geophysical measurements, including seismic surveys, where shock waves sent through the ground traveled nearly twice as fast following the mineralization process (see figure 1). That is a clear indication that the soil is more compact and less susceptible to damage in the event of an earthquake.\nFigure 1 Results of the pilot application where CaCO\n3\n biominerals were produced in an unstable cliff.\nMedusoil’s solution is easy to apply. The mineralization mixture is injected into the ground at regular intervals through tubes. It reacts when it comes into contact with calcium to form calcite, the main component of many types of sedimentary rocks, below the surface. The results are already apparent just a few hours later. The process can also be scaled to the needs of soil-reinforcement and construction projects. Small quantities of calcite generate enough particle resilience to withstand the shear stresses caused by a major earthquake; they can also stabilize slopes or shore up existing foundations. With higher levels of calcite, the biominerals can serve as a construction material or be used for soil sealing.", "summary": "EPFL spin-off Medusoil has successfully tested its ground-stabilization process on cliffs subject to surface erosion.

The result is , a free and  that aims to revolutionize the way we use machine learning. “Humans understand shapes and colors better than numbers and equations,” says Aldo Podestà, the CEO of L2F, “which is why we think that we can use topology – the science of shapes – to build a new language between AI and users.”\n Giotto offers a toolkit that uses algorithms inspired by topology to address some of the shortcomings of machine learning. Users don’t need to be fluent in advanced mathematics, since Giotto is a turnkey method of revealing structures previously hidden within a dataset. “This new form of AI is based on graphs and their multidimensional versions, in other words, geometrical objects that can reveal essential structures within the data,” says Thomas Boys, a co-founder at L2F.\n Until now, machine learning algorithms sought performance, even if that meant depriving users of a fuller understanding of the nature of the results. “Giotto helps identify the framework underlying all relationships among the data, and this allows users to understand the data better and extract meaning from them with greater accuracy,” adds Boys. The project is named for Giotto di Bondone, the 13th-century artist who first introduced perspective into painting. L2F hopes to usher in a similar paradigm change in data science by combining machine learning with topology.\nNew horizons\n To develop Giotto, its creators worked with EPFL researchers who use topology every day.

{"id": 163, "text": "“Humans didn’t wait for the industrial revolution to provoke environment and climate change. They have been having an influence for at least 8000 years.” Jed Kaplan is putting forward a new interpretation of the history of man and his environment. This SNSF professor at EPFL and his colleague Kristen Krumhardt have developed a model that demonstrates the link between population increase and deforestation. The method enables a fairly precise estimate of human-origin carbon emissions before the advent of industrialization.\n The story of our influence on the climate began with the first farmers. At that time, the prevailing technology didn’t allow an optimal use of the soil. “For each individual, it was necessary to clear a very large area of forest”, explains Jed Kaplan. However, with time, irrigation, better tools, seeds and fertilizer became more effficient. This development was a critical factor, which would partially counterbalance the increase in population, and contain the impact of human pressure on the natural environment.\nAnimation commented by Jed Kaplan\n Agriculture – the story of a race for productivity\n The relationship between population levels and agricultural land-use is therefore not simply proportional, as was formerly believed. In the Middle Ages, Europe had fewer forests than today, although since then the population has increased more than five fold. “The real innovation in our research has indeed been the taking into account of the improvements in farming techniques. Standard models simply state that the bigger the population, the more forest is cleared; but this doesn’t correspond to the historical reality.\n Ignoring the progress in agriculture, the preceding models implied that the same area of land is required to feed a European living in the fifth century as in the 20th century. This is why scientists struggled in trying to estimate the amount of CO2 produced by man before the industrial era. The work of Jed Kaplan’s team now enables us – for the first time – to travel back thru time.\n The influence of the Roman Empire and the Black Death on the climate\n The results of this research tell a very different story from that which has been circulating up until now. They show, for example, a first major boom in carbon emissions already 2000 years before our era, corresponding to the expansion of civilizations in China and around the mediterranean.\n Certain historical events, almost invisible in the preceding models, show up strongly in the data produced by the scientists. A good example is the re-growth of the forests as a consequence of the fall of the Roman Empire. The Black Death, a plague which resulted in the death of more than a third of the European population, also led to a fall in carbon emissions.\n From the decline of the American indians to the minor ice age\n Lastly, a significant decrease in emissions began in the 16th century – the one which would herald the minor ice age. Jed Kaplan has an audacious hypothesis to explain the dip in the data curve: “Thanks to the reports of the early explorers, we know that the forests were less abundant on the American continent. Then the settlers gradually eliminated the indigenous population.” Threatened with extinction, these populations effectively deserted the forested areas, which – by taking up the carbon in the atmosphere – in turn set off the legendary frosts of the 19th century. “Of course, it’s only a hypothesis”, he concludes, “but given the data we have gathered, it’s entirely plausible”.\n Jed Kaplan’s model is not in contradiction with the previous ones on one critical point: the enormous increase in emissions from the beginning of the industrial era, and the massive use of fossil fuels. “We are just saying that our influence on the climate began a lot earlier than we thought. In 6000 BC, we were already accumulating significant quantities of carbon in the atmosphere, even though it was nothing compared to the situation today”, adds the scientist. A conclusion that could turn out to be critical in the future for the improved evaluation of the decisive impact of the forests on the climate.", "summary": "The Roman Conquest, the Black Death and the discovery of America – by modifying the nature of the forests – have had a significant impact on the environment.

{"id": 166, "text": "The main points of phase two of EPFL’s expansion in Valais were defined in the agreement in principle signed by the school and the Valais Council of State. The signing ceremony was also attended by the president of Sion and the president of the ETH Board. This new agreement builds on the one signed in 2012: it increases the number of employees and the number of scientific teams planned, and it introduces a new field of research that is closely linked to Valais’s industrial and natural environment.\nCutting-edge research in alpine and extreme environments\nSion will host EPFL’s new research center in the science and technology of alpine and extreme environments, a field that ranges from biology to physical processes. The EPFL Valais Wallis campus is ideal for this type of research thanks to its proximity to the Alps and to the canton's water and snow resources, and in view of the canton’s exposure to environmental risks, which derive largely from climate change. The research conducted at this center will cover the physics and dynamics of ice, water harvesting and hydrology, the microbial ecology of waterways, ecosystems, cryosphere biology, the science of alpine and polar macrosystems, processes associated with precipitation and snow cover, environmental robotics and natural water resource management. \nThis center offers solid perspectives in terms of future job-creating technologies in the fields of extreme materials, sensors and robotics, autonomous drones and satellites, and extreme biotechnology. It also builds on the expertise that EPFL has acquired through the Solar Impulse project. The center supports Switzerland’s aim to play a larger international role in issues related to water, the oceans and resources through its expertise as an alpine country and its scientific activity at the poles. The center’s activities also dovetail with Valais’s water strategy, which was adopted by the Council of State.\nInternational influence thanks to the Swiss Polar Institute\nThe Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) was co-founded at the end of December 2015 by EPFL and Editions Paulsen together with the Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL), ETH Zurich and the University of Bern, and with the official support of the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI). It was developed to group together research initiatives in the field of extreme environments by coordinating international projects and expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. It will be located in the Sion-based research center specializing in alpine and extreme environments, enabling it to draw parallels between the high latitudes (Arctic and Antarctic) and high altitudes (\"the third pole\", of which the Alps are a major component on the global scale). \nThe newly created SPI is already organizing an international mission to Antarctica: the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Twenty-two research projects in fields such as glaciology, climatology, biology and oceanography will be conducted during the expedition, which will run from December 2016 to March 2017. The projects were developed by teams from countries including Switzerland, the UK, France, Australia and South Africa. In September 2017, an initial assessment of the expedition will be presented at an international symposium to be held in Valais.\n“Large-scale hydropower” partnership between EPFL and HES-SO Valais \nThe 2012 plan called for all of EPFL’s hydropower activities to be transferred to Valais. But that project has been adapted to changing academic and technological factors.\nIn view of the high cost of moving the research facilities and laboratories, the partners have now opted for a close partnership under which both EPFL and HES-SO Valais will use the Lausanne-based infrastructure.\nPromising research in neuroengineering\nEPFL Valais Wallis’s rehabilitation and health cluster, which already has a research chair in neuroengineering at the SuvaCare rehabilitation clinic in Sion, will be expanded through a greater emphasis on scientific work and clinical application testing. Clinical research and observations on spinal cord repair and motor function will also be conducted in Valais. The aim will be to help people with paraplegia to regain as much mobility as possible, in part through a robotics-based rehabilitation platform. Together with HES-SO Valais, there are plans to develop a neuroprosthetic training program for physical therapists and nursing staff. Valais hospitals will also be further integrated in personalized medicine projects currently being developed in western Switzerland’s “Health Valley”.\nStrengthening and positioning the hub for green chemistry and energies of the future\nNearly 150 people from 31 different countries are engaged in research in the fields of green chemistry and energies of the future in Sion. These activities will be strengthened through the addition of two demonstrators and by positioning this research hub in the Swiss Innovation Park. Scientific work in this field is starting to generate opportunities both for startups and existing companies.\n350 high value-added jobs\nThe second phase of the project will significantly extend EPFL’s footprint in Valais and deepen its economic commitment to the canton. It will also strengthen the partnership between EPFL and HES-SO Valais, further driving research and innovation forward and adding breadth and depth to the courses taught in Valais. The EPFL Valais Wallis campus will eventually employ more than 350 researchers, with a total of 16 or 17 chairs and three permanent research groups. EPFL will finance five or six more chairs than the initial plan called for. New premises near the train station, rather than in Chandoline as initially planned, will accommodate the added researchers. The framework credit approved by the Valais parliament in 2013 remains in place.\nThese projects and their local and global impact are further examples of how EPFL fulfills the mission given to it by the Federal Council to serve society and support economic growth in Switzerland. EPFL and the Canton of Valais have entered into a partnership that takes into account the region’s unique industrial, cultural and environmental features. This partnership is designed to contribute to the canton’s growth in a number of key sectors (see box: \"EPFL Valais Wallis: phase two of the project and the expected return on investment for Valais\").\nNext steps\nThe Valais Council of State and EPFL plan to move forward quickly with a detailed academic plan and implementation schedule. The agreement of 19 December 2012 will be amended to include the process, financing and timeframe for phase two of EPFL's expansion in Valais.\n---\nEPFL Valais Wallis: phase two of the project and the expected return on investment for Valais\nThe second phase of EPFL’s expansion in Valais is designed to:\nstrengthen EPFL’s academic activities in Valais in green chemistry for energies of the future and extreme (bio)technologies and to position EPFL at the forefront of rehabilitation and health;\nincrease the appeal of both EPFL and Valais within Switzerland (Health Valley) and abroad (the Swiss Polar Institute), an effort that has already paid off internationally in terms of job creation and investments in phase 1 of the project (energy/green chemistry);\ngenerate substantial new synergies with HES-SO Valais (health, IT, big data, industrial systems), the Centre de Recherches Energétiques et Municipales (CREM), and, in the medium term, the research institute IDIAP, and to link up HES-SO Valais with the research being carried out at EPFL’s hydropower center in Lausanne;\npromote gradual technological development and job creation in EPFL’s activities in Valais, including digital and robotic technologies – especially drones and remote sensing – and to position Campus Energypolis in the future Swiss Innovation Park; and\nshowcase EPFL’s activities in Valais for investors.

Twenty-one Master’s students rose to this challenge, not only in the real world but also in virtual reality, when they created the role-playing game EPFL Survival in just a few months. The game is a free smartphone app that puts the player in the shoes of a student navigating the ups and downs of a year at EPFL.\nThe purpose of the assignment was not to showcase the students’ programming skills – although it did accomplish that. It was the culmination of a semester-long course on managing organizations, offered as part of EPFL’s . “The students were given free rein when it came to choosing the subject of their project,” says Samuel Bendahan, who has been teaching the course for the past few years. “The catch was that they had to run a project from start to finish as a large group, with all the attendant difficulties.”\nJust like in a startup\nThe theme this semester was games, and the group of 21 students quickly settled on developing an app. The project could have turned into a real headache, since the students had conflicting schedules and weren’t all studying in the same field. “It took us three weeks to define each person’s role before getting started,” says Amanda Klaeger, a student in Life Sciences and Technology. “Just like in a little startup, we broke into sub-groups to handle game design, graphics, programming and communications.”\nThat was the key to their success. “The collective leadership approach they adopted meant that everyone could be involved and take turns assuming responsibility,” adds Bendahan. “The students also proved to be very creative.” They never lost their focus despite the hurdles they encountered. “It was really rewarding to know that we would actually get the game finished by the end of the semester,” says Arthur Sauvin, a civil engineering student. Their work paid off, since the game – humorous and full of references to life at EPFL – has been a real hit on campus and on the internet.\nEscape room and innovation trade show\nOther projects that emerged from the course include a temporary escape room at EPFL, a card game and a board game. Just a few years ago, one semester project for this same Humanities and Social Sciences course led to the creation of the \nSalon des Techniques et de l'Innovation de Lausanne (STIL)\n, an innovation trade show.\nEPFL Survival can be downloaded free of charge on the Apple Store and Google Play.

{"id": 170, "text": "Scientists around the world are excited about the new possibilities being offered by advanced data collection and processing methods. But making such data understandable and useful to the uninitiated remains a challenge. With its Affinity Map, ENAC hopes to give its faculty a tool for better leveraging the vast amount of data related to their research and teaching. Such a visual method could even make it easier for scholars to share academic knowledge across the entire scientific community.\nENAC’s Affinity Map was driven by the school’s former dean, Marilyne Andersen. It is designed to help ENAC researchers spot potential academic synergies, topics they share with colleagues and possible areas for joint research. The map is fast, intuitive to use and now . “This public version is intended to show academic community the potential of data visualization and how it can help encourage research collaboration on a global level,” says Dario Rodighiero, the map’s co-author.\nDigital humanities\nRodighiero created the Affinity Map as part of his thesis in digital humanities at EPFL, which was supervised by Professors Frédéric Kaplan and Boris Beaude, and defended in January 2018. The map combines the latest visualization methods with annual data from ENAC, including journal publications, courses given and student supervision. After finalizing his prototype, Rodighiero teamed up with Ogier Maitre, an EPFL computer scientist and cartographer, to turn it into a program that can be used by anyone. Rodighiero’s work will now be extended to an even larger scale, thanks to a grant he just obtained from the Swiss National Science Foundation to conduct post-doc research at MIT so that researchers around the world can benefit from his invention.\nWhat makes Rodighiero’s thesis unique is that it is based on interviews he conducted with ENAC researchers over four years. That means his program is not just easy to use and efficient, but also tailored specifically to their needs. “Marilyne Andersen, ENAC’s former dean, saw the Affinity Map as a tool for visualizing the school as a whole and for facilitating cross-disciplinary research. It was also meant to support the development of new teaching activities – such as for the Design Together program – and new research topics at the crossroads of existing fields. But as we were building the map, we saw that researchers were really interested in seeing their laboratory represented in the Affinity Map, and it became a way of depicting the school through its faculty members. Today they all can use it,” says Rodighiero.\nThe ENAC galaxy\nThe Affinity Map looks like a galaxy of some seventy planets, each surrounded by satellites. The planets are the ENAC labs and their color indicates which of the school’s three disciplines they belong to: red for architecture; blue for civil engineering; and green for environmental engineering. The lines between the labs represent any one of three types of affinities: shared teaching subjects; joint project supervisions (including at students, PhD and postdoc levels); and joint publications.\nUsers can select filters to display only the information that interests them. For example, you can group certain kinds of planets together or arrange the planets in new ways by choosing a particular affinity. You can also zoom in on the map to view a specific lab and its joint research projects with other ENAC labs, which are displayed as satellites around the planet.\nThe LIPID laboratory and its satellites. © EPFL\nKeywords and a search engine\nShared keywords between the planets, used to indicate common research topics, are generated using natural language processing algorithms that comb through the abstracts of ENAC literature published in a given year and identify correspondences.\nThe map also contains a search engine where you can search by keyword to find out which labs worked on a given topic, like transportation systems or water treatment. You could also use the search engine to screen for a specific discipline, research topic or laboratory. And missing lines between two labs – despite their affinities – could indicate opportunities for collaboration.\nThe data used to generate the map come from EPFL’s existing dynamic databases, reviewed and updated by the labs themselves through their annual reports. There are private and public versions of the map. The private one, accessible only by ENAC faculty via a password, provides a complete picture of the myriad of ways that ENAC labs work together and makes it easier for people to contact each other. It gives the names of all researchers at each lab, their existing collaborations in teaching, thesis supervision and publications, and current research projects with non-ENAC labs. The public version gives only the names of the head of each lab in order to protect their researchers from any kind of evaluation.\nBetter than a website\nFor now the Affinity Map includes only data for 2017. But Rodighiero and Maitre plan to have it be updated every year. “Once it contains several years of data, ENAC faculty can use it to better understand its researchers’ developing careers and where the school is headed – particularly as some labs close, others open and new research topics emerge. The map will help ENAC students, researchers and professors get a better grasp of their environment and the best way to explore it. And for that, the map is more effective than any website,” says Rodighiero.\n“The Affinity Map took five years, starting at the beginning of my tenure as dean. The goal is to better understand, and therefore better ‘see’ – literally – the diversity and complexity of a school like ENAC. I’m very pleased it has been made available to the public as an interactive map so that users can discover the synergies and specific subjects that we teach and research. And I’m delighted that the project will continue to be developed both here at ENAC and beyond, reaching all the way to the United States, so that we won’t forget that we are part of greater whole, one that offers increasingly great opportunities to support and learn from each other through new affinities,” says Andersen, ENAC’s dean from 2013 to 2018 and the driving force behind the project.", "summary": "The Affinity Map showing cross-laboratory collaboration among faculty at EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) is now available to the general public.

The system detects a wide range of information, including seed type, stage of growth, hydration level, parasites and diseases. The aerial views can also be used to cut costs by ensuring that herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers are only applied to areas that need them.\nThe company has just raised 3.2 million francs from investors including the Sandoz Foundation, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Seed4Equity and the Swiss venture capital firm IV Partners. In addition, last Thursday it was awarded the W.A. de Vigier award worth 100,000 francs.\nSensing the spectral signature of plants\nHyperspectral cameras expand the spectrum of colors that can be detected by recording light wavelengths from visible to infrared. They are therefore effective in picking up the “spectral signature” of plants, which varies with their stage of growth and the surrounding conditions. A lack of water or nutrients, for example, modifies the physiological state of plants and affects how they reflect light. So a healthy plant will have a different spectral signature from that of a plant experiencing stress. Wide range of variations have been documented and put into databases.\nGamaya developed a software program that maps the nuances of the spectrum detected by the drone onto colors visible to the human eye. Each problem has a color, which means farmers can analyze their crops in detail on their computer screen. The system also provides advice – such as how much fertilizer to use – and yield projections.\nWell-suited for the vast croplands in South America\nThe system, which simply requires farmers to operate a drone, is now ready for use with soy, corn and sugar cane fields. “We are starting out by targeting Latin America, where the market is estimated to be worth five billion dollars,” said Yosef Akhtman, the company’s CEO. The farms there are vast, which means that conditions are frequently uneven. The system has already been successfully tested by farmers in Brazil.\nGamaya says its system can help farmers boost their harvest, bring down costs and reduce disease-related risks. “It could boost profits by up to 30% by helping farmers quickly and accurately resolve problems,” said Akhtman. The company, which was founded last year, has been selected by Forbes and Business Insider as one of the twelve most promising young companies in agriculture-related technologies. “This system’s ability to enhance efficiency in crop treatment could also help address the main challenge awaiting agriculture: we will have to produce as much food between now and 2050 as we did over the past 10,000 years combined.” The global population is expected to reach some 10 billion people by mid-century.", "summary": "EPFL spin-off Gamaya has just raised 3.2 million francs for its agricultural drone system.

{"id": 179, "text": "The main drawback of small drones is their limited flight time, which results from their heavy batteries and relatively inefficient propellers. So for longer missions, a small drone’s battery has to be regularly recharged or replaced. While engineers are working on new designs to address this problem, no real solution has been found – until now. Samir Bouabdallah, who has over 20 years of experience developing drone technology at EPFL and ETH Zurich, has come up with an inventive propulsion system modeled after those used by helicopters. His design, marketed through his startup Flybotix, uses just two propellers and an algorithm-based stabilization mechanism, giving his drones “the aerodynamic performance of a helicopter and the mechanical stability of a quadcopter.” Recently in China for the CES Asia conference and the Venture Leaders China program, Bouabdallah has decided to explore opportunities in this promising market.\nTwo rotors guided by stabilization algorithms \nA drone’s flying time is proportional to its size – the smaller the machine, the less time it can spend in the air. “Drones with four rotors are highly stable, making them reliable and easy to use,” says Bouabdallah. But as these drones get smaller, their propellers become increasingly inefficient. That, combined with their limited battery capacity, explains their abbreviated flying times.\nOne way to extend those times is to use a completely different kind of propulsion system. By reducing the number of propellers from four to two, for instance, engineers can make each propeller longer and the rotor more efficient. That also cuts the amount of power required, meaning the same-sized battery can run for longer. But until now, drones with two propellers were generally less stable and harder to manipulate. Bouabdallah’s design employs a ring-like structure – around 30 centimeters in diameter – in which the propellers are stacked on top of each other in the center and turn in opposite directions. His drones look more like flying saucers than the machines we’re used to seeing.\nAnother innovation relates to his drones’ stabilization mechanism. Helicopters use a complicated transmission system that enables pilots to control the blades and maintain the aircraft’s pitch. But this system is heavy, cumbersome and requires a considerable amount of maintenance. However, Bouabdallah has developed an algorithm that offsets the two rotating forces and serves the same function as a helicopter’s transmission system. His drones can therefore be piloted just as easily as quadcopters, using a conventional remote-control device.\nBouabdallah’s drone, with its unique transmission system and foam covering its outer ring, can bounce off of obstacles without breaking. The first application that Flybotix will target is inspecting dangerous or hard-to-reach areas. While in China last month the team got a lot of positive feedback on their technology and made some promising contacts. They hope to soon launch their drones on the Chinese market.", "summary": "EPFL startup Flybotix has developed a novel drone with just two propellers and an advanced stabilization system that allow it to fly for twice as long as conventional models.

{"id": 183, "text": "Making drone mapping more accurate is one of the goals of the Geodetic Engineering Laboratory (Topo), which is run by Bertrand Merminod within EPFL's School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). Drones are not only toys for big and little kids – they also serve many practical purposes. They can be used to monitor dams and railroads in order to prevent accidents, or to create 3D digital copies of historical monuments in case they are accidentally or deliberately destroyed. They can also capture images from one season to the next in order to measure soil erosion.\n\"It's very important to be as accurate as possible,\" says Emmanuel Cledat, who has just completed his PhD thesis at the Topo lab. \"When it looks like a cliff has moved slightly over the winter, you have to be able to tell whether it’s a real topographical change or just a georeferencing error.” Cledat has spent the last four years developing software capable of accurately processing data acquired by sensors embedded on drones. He received the Best Young Author Award 2020 from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) for an about his thesis project. \nPlanes and helicopters used for mapping are generally equipped with four types of sensor: a GPS (or GNSS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which determine the vehicle’s position and orientation; a camera; and a LIDAR laser scanner, which measures distances by recording the time it takes for the laser beam to travel from the scanner to the object and back again.\nA miniaturized, hybrid device\nUntil recently, LIDAR laser scanners could weigh up to 10 kilos. The Topo lab, together with EPFL spin-off Helimap System SA, were pioneers in developing aerial mapping systems involving helicopters, which can carry heavy equipment like a LIDAR scanner and a navigation-grade IMU. But in recent years, both industry professionals and researchers have been focused on making these measuring devices much smaller. Cledat was able to hybridize the data acquired by miniaturized sensors embedded on a drone (a GNSS, LIDAR, IMU and camera) such that the resulting map is almost as accurate as those obtained with a helicopter. A drone-based mapping technique is a greener alternative and one more suited to hard-to-reach terrain.\nAs part of his thesis, Cledat carefully calibrated each sensor to make them as effective and reliable as possible. To do this, he used the lab's calibration fields near Vufflens-la-Ville in Vaud Canton. He earned the ISPRS award for his work on camera calibration. The bundle adjustment software he developed is used to cross-check the measurements in order to correct them all simultaneously. This results in an accurate image of the area and of the drone's position and orientation. Cledat's software will be further developed within the lab as part of another thesis project. \nCledat plans to return to earth for the next step in his career. His upcoming project will help people who are wary of cycling around town. He wants to equip bikes with mini sensors made for drones, together with noise and air-quality sensors.

In contrast, potassium thiocyanate, or KSCN, although closely related chemically to the first two varieties, is deadly when ingested in even very small doses. This is an example of the different effects, called specific ion effects, which may result at the macroscopic scale from mechanisms acting on the nanoscale. The work of Sylvie Roke and her team at EPFL’s Laboratory of fundamental BioPhotonics (LBP) offers a new understanding of these phenomena and their influence on the functioning of the human body. They have been the subject of a recent article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS).\nSpecialized in understanding complex biological systems on the nanoscale, the researchers have revealed the physicochemical interactions between large amphiphilic ions – atoms or molecules that have lost or gained an electron – and the surfaces with which they come into contact. These interactions influence numerous processes, such as the formation of the cell membrane, the role of proteins and peptides, and even the activity of enzymes.\nWhether they are anions or a cations\nThrough innovative optical techniques, the researchers were able to study with precision the behavior of amphiphilic ions – that is to say, composed of one part hydrophilic and another part hydrophobic. It has been assumed that these compounds ensure the stability of the interface between two liquids by dipping their “head” in the water phase and “tail” in the oily phase.\nThe Roke lab found however that these amphiphilic units adopt very different structures depending on whether they are anions or cations. That is to say, the anionic amhiphiles (that have gained one electron) align interfacial water molecules and do not mix with the oil phase, while the cationic amphiphiles destroy water alignment and mix with the oil phase, resulting in two entirely different interface structures and stabilization mechanisms. Thus, even for the case of interface stabilization specific ion effects play an important role.\nLasers and complex optic techniques are used to observe molecular interactions at water/oil interface.", "summary": "Molecular interactions occurring at the interface between water and other substances can have an influence on the functioning of our bodies.

They contain a surface – usually made of metal – on which chemical nanosensors detect specific compounds in a sample of urine, saliva or blood that indicate the presence of a given protein or part of a virus. “The tests show up as positive if their sensors come into contact with the target compound,” says Olivier Martin, head of EPFL’s Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory, within the School of Engineering.\nThis biological mechanism is invisible to the naked eye, but the way the metal is structured makes it able to interact with light, creating disturbances in the light’s movement. “These disturbances are what tell us that a sensor on the metal surface has come into contact with the target compound,” says Martin. “The process creates an optical wave, which propagates and appears as a red line on a pregnancy test, for example.” His team worked with scientists at EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory, headed by Hatice Altug, to make the technology more sensitive and more effective.

Just below the aluminum they added a layer of silicon, which doesn’t conduct electricity. “The silicon acts like a soundbox,” says Martin. “Picture a kettledrum – its surface vibrates when a drummer hits it, and it’s the soundbox underneath that lets us hear the vibrations.

{"id": 194, "text": "When iron ore is mined, only the most valuable portion is sold; the rest is discharged as waste, or “tailings.” In 2013, Emile Scheepers, a metallurgical engineer who was then enrolled in EPFL’s Executive Master’s of Business Administration (EMBA) program, analyzed this situation. “We found that mining byproducts containing high levels of quartz can be used to make synthetic quartz, a material commonly used in kitchen and bathroom countertops,” he says. He presented his idea to Vale, and the company quickly came on board with the idea. Yesterday the Brazil-based mining giant presented its Vale Quartz initiative at a press conference.\nSynthetic quartz surfaces are an increasingly popular alternative to marble and granite for home interiors. They are made by pulverizing quartz, mixing it with plastic resins and pigments, compressing the mixture, and baking it an industrial oven. The resulting material is non-porous and highly robust, making it easier to maintain than natural stone surfaces. “The market for synthetic quartz surfaces is huge – it’s worth some 3 billion dollars in the US alone. The natural quartz used to make those surfaces costs over 100 dollars a metric ton, which is a lot. Our recycled version is a lot cheaper,” says Scheepers, who now works in Vale’s Swiss division.\nTurning waste into a resource \n“On top of the obvious benefit of reducing waste, our method lets miners turn a valueless byproduct into something that could be highly useful,” he adds. Vale plans to build a synthetic quartz production plant in a mining-intensive region of its home country, which will create 80 jobs directly and diversify the local economy.\nFor now, the Vale Quartz initiative is still in the planning stages. The company is also looking into other uses for its quartz-rich tailings. “Tailings are like sand–and sand is one of the most used natural resources on the planet. But it’s not as abundant as you might think,” says Scheepers. Vale therefore hopes its tailings could replace natural sand, and that its initiative will spur further efforts by the mining industry to turn waste into sustainable products.", "summary": "An EPFL engineer has discovered a way to extract value from mining waste by recycling the quartz it contains to make composite surfaces for kitchen and bathroom countertops.

{"id": 195, "text": "Swiss power utility Groupe E agreed to trigger a short circuit in its power grid so that EPFL researchers could test their revolutionary technology. Their approach uses time reversal to spot a disturbance in a grid, and it requires nothing more than a sensor coupled with an algorithm – making it potentially cheaper and more efficient than existing systems.\nThe tests were carried out on the high-voltage substation serving the city of Cressier in Fribourg Canton. A team of EPFL researchers working inside the substation connected a computer to a sensor that had been installed at a specific point in the grid. Once the connection was established, Groupe E’s operators triggered a short circuit, or more specifically a ground fault, in a section containing nearly 12km of power lines. Thanks to their algorithm, the researchers were able to pinpoint the exact spot of the short circuit in less than three minutes and determine which of the line’s three phases had been affected. “This was the first time we were able to test our technology on a full-scale power grid composed of both underground cables and overhead lines. Our results are even better than we had hoped for,” says Farhad Rachidi, the EPFL scientist co-leading the project with his colleague Mario Paolone.\nBack to the future\n Two factors underlie their method: the scientific phenomenon of time reversal, and the sophisticated equations used to model electromagnetic waves. The process takes place in several steps. First, when the short circuit occurs, an electromagnetic wave is generated along the power lines and spreads throughout the grid. It bounces off other lines from all sides and creates echo waves. When these waves hit the researcher’s sensor, the algorithm analyzes them and injects waves going in the opposite direction in a computer simulation of the grid. The simulation reconstructs the waves’ pathways until they converge at the point of the original short circuit. “Each echo we receive is a source of information,” says Paolone. “As a result, the more complex and heterogeneous a grid is, the better our algorithm works,” adds Rachidi.\nTheir highly promising – and now patented – method has sparked the interest of Groupe E and another company, Streamer. Time is of the essence when short circuits occur: they must be resolved immediately to prevent a series of outages and extended blackouts. Power utilities frequently have to send operators out in the field to repair cables damaged by lightning or frost, or to replace faulty components. And these types of grid disturbances occur often – up to once a week on Groupe E’s Fribourg grid alone.\nSeveral sensors are currently installed at strategic points across the medium-voltage grid. “We can locate a short circuit quickly if we have enough sensors in a grid,” says Frédéric Richoz from Groupe E. “Otherwise we have to turn the power off and on in various sections of the grid until we find the damaged spot – but it can take us a while to determine exactly which section of the grid contains the short circuit.”\nThe researchers’ system lets operators monitor an entire grid from a single point of measurement. And the more complicated a grid is, the better their system works. That means it’s compatible with large grids that incorporate renewable energy. “Our technology would also work in an active-passive grid that includes energy generated by individuals – like solar panels on people’s houses. That’s something that today’s conventional sensors might not be able to do,” says Reza Razzaghi, a researcher at EPFL’s Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory. “We are working on improving our algorithm so it can locate short circuits even faster, in just a few seconds,” adds Zhaoyang Wang, a PhD student at EPFL’s Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory.\nThe new technology is the result of a joint effort by two EPFL labs – the  and the  – and is described in a new book entitled \n.\n-----\nBook:", "summary": "It took EPFL researchers only three minutes to detect and locate a short circuit triggered intentionally in the power grid serving Fribourg Canton.

{"id": 198, "text": "The clocks strike noon. Tens of thousands of stoves are turned on. The Swiss are getting ready to eat. In just a few seconds, electricity consumption jumps by some 20%. The dam gates open, injecting power into the grid to absorb the spike in consumption. Production keeps pace with demand.\nBut tomorrow, in 2030 or in 2050, how will solar energy light our homes after a stormy afternoon? How will wind turbines bring pots to a boil when the evening air is still? A rise in weather-dependent renewable energies means less regularity and control in the area of production and a lower capacity to meet expected or sudden spikes in consumption. The energy transition has begun, and it is making us innovate and rethink our concepts. One of the ideas currently in vogue is to upend the core paradigm by adapting energy demand to production levels. François Vuille, the director of development at the Energy Center and co-organizer of a conference on this topic set for 10 September at EPFL, gives us his take on the issue.\nIsn’t adapting demand to supply the first step towards rationing?\n Not at all. Consumer comfort and choice are not in jeopardy. Nor is this an attempt to cut back on consumption. The “demand response” concept aims to make electricity usage more flexible and bring it more into line with the fluctuations of increasingly intermittent electricity production, which we see with renewable energies. The ability to shift demand means we could absorb peaks in production or losses in solar and wind power, both of which depend on the vagaries of the weather. This option is less expensive than solutions based on electricity storage or reserve power plants.\nSo would we have to cut back on nighttime lighting?\n Once again, this concept is not based on reducing demand but rather shifting it, without lowering our quality of life. Demand management does not affect all applications or all types of appliances, far from it. We won’t have to go without TV or lights at night. It is, however, possible to postpone the use of certain appliances like the dishwasher and washing machine or recharging an electric vehicle. The electricity consumption of appliances that store up heat or cold, such as refrigerators, freezers, water heaters and heat pumps, can be modulated significantly. There is no problem with turning them off temporarily, for example, especially if they can store up surplus heat or cold beforehand.\nHow can energy demand really be managed?\n The first step, which is already used, is to create price incentives. Day and night electricity rates already exist for both private and industrial consumers. These rates could be fine-tuned so that they follow the production profile throughout the day. The other approach is through smart grids, which several EPFL labs are already at work on. Technologies that have been developed include, for example, smart systems capable of selecting the best time to recharge an electric car depending on the grid’s production level, the vehicle’s existing charge and the needs of its upcoming use.\nHow effective could this concept be?\n It still needs to be properly evaluated, and its economic viability is not yet certain. In Europe, we are currently enjoying very low electricity prices, which makes this concept – including the smart management systems – harder to justify economically. The situation could change, however, especially if the price of CO\n2\n were to increase and be accompanied by rising electricity prices. Microgrids, like the one we are testing on the EPFL campus, will become more common in the next few years – they also need electricity demand to be more flexible and to track the energy supply more closely.\nWhat role does electricity storage have in demand management?\n Storing energy is another option to help handle production levels that, with the energy transition, will become increasingly intermittent. Energy storage and demand management are far from being mutually exclusive – they both play a part in the long-range planning, especially since energy storage is expensive and still plagued by significant energy losses.\nPublic conference: , 10 September 2015, ELA1, EPFL.

{"id": 203, "text": "It is hard to overestimate the importance of global livestock production to society and the economy. It constitutes the main source of income for 1.3 billion farmers, providing vital food for 800 million subsistence farmers, and making up 40% of global agricultural GDP. But overbreeding and dwindling genetic diversity could limit the ability of livestock populations to adapt the environmental changes, such as global warming and related new diseases. Currently on the sidelines, lesser-known livestock breeds and the DNA they carry could become key to securing the future of livestock farming.\nFor four years leading up to 2014, a  took stock of the past, present, and future of farm animal genetic resources and outlined the questions of highest priority for research, infrastructure and policy development for the coming decade. A selection of the project’s scientific output has now been published by the open access journal Frontiers in Genetics and is available online in the form of \nA shrinking genetic reservoir\nOver the past 100 years, many local breeds have gone extinct, as more productive industrial breeds have taken over. Even within these breeds, the genetic diversity between individuals is shrinking. So why does this matter? “A reduction of genetic diversity goes hand with hand with a reduction of the species’ capacity to adapt to new diseases, warmer temperatures, or new food sources,” says Stéphane Joost, the project’s chair.\n“Studying 1,200 sheep from 32 old, native breeds from around the world, we previously identified a specific gene involved in regulating their metabolism, whose presence correlated strongly with the amount of incident solar radiation – a genetic trait that made them better adapted to their environment than cosmopolitan breeds that are more productive in the short term,” says Joost. If breeds carrying such specific adaptations disappear, so too will the coping strategies they acquired throughout evolution.\nThe better choice?\nJoost’s advice to farmers: “Farmers should keep their local, well adapted breeds,” he urges. They may be less productive than their industrially bred cousins, but in developing countries with extreme climates sticking to them is often the wiser choice – a lesson that many farmers learn the hard way. After investing their savings to crossbreed a species of cow local to West Africa with an industrial breed, farmers in Burkina Faso first reaped the fruits of their investment, until they realized that all of the mixed breed’s offspring were poorly adapted to their climate and eventually died. “Only local breeds are adapted to resist to such harsh environments and withstand diseases such as trypanosomiasis, spread by the tsetse fly,” says Joost.\nAn archive of adaptation\nUnderstanding the genetic history of today’s breeds could help us find ways of adapting in the future, says Joost. “What ancestral animals conferred the species with a specific trait? And what can we do today to recover that same trait?” he asks. Knowing, for example, exactly which native species were crossbred to produce today’s breeds could help pinpoint certain well-adapted genes present in the native species that may have been lost. In the same way, well-adapted local breeds that were abandoned to the point of extinction could be recreated by cross-breeding the ancestral species they emerged from.\nTo ensure that the research carried out in this project finds its way into the agricultural community, the 31 studies will be compiled into an e-book, which will also be made available in print and distributed to stakeholders in developing countries by the FAO. But changing habits will be an uphill battle, as it involves sacrificing short-term profits for long-term sustainability – a problem that Joost and the co-organizers of the research project are well aware of. “Throughout this project, we emphasized the need to work with social scientists to effectively influence the habits of the breeders associations and other stakeholders.

{"id": 209, "text": "It was supposed to work for only one year. However, it has already been five since SwissCube orbits around the Earth. Launched in 2009, the Cubesat –a satellite model designed in the form of a cube of 10 cm per side- is still in good condition. It orbits at a height of 720 km and moves at a speed of nearly 7’500 meters per second, that is: about 28’000 km per hour, making nearly 15 daily tours of the Earth.\nIndeed, the satellite’s long life marks its success. Few people would have bet on it after the realization, only hours after its launch, that it was spinning too fast. In fact, it took nearly a year before its systems could finally be exploited. Moreover, its scientific mission -to document the phenomenon of aurora- has not been fully completed. But the data it provides are still the subject of ongoing research and student work.\nSwissCube demonstrates, with its endurance and the consistency of its beeps, that some risky design choices taken before its launch turned out to be the right ones. These include the use of low cost materials that had not been yet used in space, or the fact of giving it an essentially educational purpose. Conducted over three years, from 2006 to 2009, in conjunction with several Universities of Applied Sciences, the program not only allowed 200 students to study space technology, but also to learn to take responsibility, to take into account every detail and to work as a team. Thus, in hindsight, the reliability of the SwissCube systems highlights the excellent quality of these young people’s work.\n\"It was a great adventure, gushes Muriel Richard, project leader. We were lucky to find talented and motivated students, with a great sense of humor! To see them evolve, both professionally and personally, was very rewarding. Many of them became first-rate engineers. Since they were involved from the beginning until the launch of the satellite, they acquired practical knowledge and a global vision that are well worth a 10 to 15 years’ experience in business.\"\nAs for the ex-students, they emphasize the unique and very educational opportunity offered to them, also noting a particularly good and supportive atmosphere within the team. Undoubtedly, their participation in this project has served as a springboard for their careers.\n\"SwissCube put my creativity into orbit\"\nFabien Jordan was in charge of the part relating to the generation, storage and distribution of energy on the SwissCube. At the time an Energy Systems student at Yverdon’s engineering school, he worked on the project from April 2007 up to the launch in September 2009.\n\"Having the opportunity to build a satellite from the outset was just incredible!\", he says. In addition to the warm working atmosphere, the young man also focuses on the \"managing excellence\" of the supervising team.\" Since it was a first, this experience was bound to set an example. So it pushed us to provide a very high level of quality which, as SwissCube’s longevity proves, was accomplished.\"\nBut this adventure did not only make possible to project 10 cm3 of hi-tech into space, \"it simply put my creativity into orbit,\" explains Fabien Jordan. He now runs his own company, named Else, which offers a very innovative product: the xU, a platform that facilitates the assembly of electronic subsystems for cubesat type satellites. \"The idea was born from the nights spent in EPFL’s cleanrooms seeking for solutions to assemble all systems.\" A task complicated by the highly restrictive miniaturization and weight constraints imposed by the cubesats.\n\"I learned to work with people from different disciplines\"\nDuring his final year of Microengineering at EPFL, Guillaume Röthlisberger was named responsible for the satellite’s mechanical structure. \"Even though my studies provided me with valuable technical knowledge, I really learned to work thoroughly and with people from different disciplines with this project.\" A skill he currently puts every day into practice as an engineer at a distinguished watchmaking firm.\nAmong the highlights, he mentions the journey that took him to India to take the satellite to its launch base, from where it took off six weeks later. Knowing that five years later his work is still operational and continues circling the Earth is \"extremely rewarding for me and for the SwissCube team.\"\n\"Hearing the first beep was an incredible moment\"\nNicolas Steiner was an electrical engineering student at Yverdon’s engineering school when he tackled the temperature measurement systems as well as the energy production from solar panels attached to the Cubesat. Today, he works in Nyon for Ruag, a very active company in the field of space technology.\nUndoubtedly, the fact of having learned techniques specific to space work, that is to say: the most demanding in terms of rigor and quality, gave him tools to go after the labor market. \"SwissCube also allowed us to come into contact with all the stages of a project, to approach different disciplines, to solve practical problems and to experience things directly. All this taught us to be very pragmatic and to understand each challenge in all its complexity.\"\nAnd there were also moments of laughter, sharing and friendship, which remain in the form of dinners held every year on the anniversary of the launch. Nicolas Steiner also remembers SwissCube’s first beep once in orbit. \"It was an amazing moment! It showed us that everything had started as planned and that all our efforts made sense.\"", "summary": "Launched more than five years ago, the small Swiss satellite designed by EPFL and several other Universities of Applied Sciences, will soon have orbited the Earth 30’000 times.

A new step forward was taken on Tuesday, October 11, with the laying of the first stone of Microcity. Financed by the canton of Neuchâtel to the tune of 80 million Swiss francs, the building will house all the activities of the Institute. Eventually, the number of professorial chairs will be doubled, and the number of employees will rise from 300 to more than 600.\nIMT is well known for its activitites in the area of watchmaking.

{"id": 217, "text": "“Most studies on long-distance commuters focus on high-ranking executives who live and work in different countries. But I wanted to look more specifically at families where both parents have to travel long distances day in and day out,” says Guillaume Drevon, a geographer at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR). His research has been published in a new book titled \nProposition pour une rythmologie de la mobilité et des sociétés contemporaines\n (available in French only).\nDrevon has developed a new approach that investigates how the fast pace of modern life is affecting people’s behavior and society more broadly. His work analyzes the frequency and geographic dispersion of a given community’s activities and how individuals within the community perceive time. With his approach, scientists can obtain a better understanding of how new technology like email, 24-hour news channels and social networks – coupled with the increasing pressure to work quickly and always be productive – have accelerated the pace of life.\nChanging perception of time \nDrevon’s book describes a paradigm shift in both the theory of sociology and the research methods used, suggesting that scientists break down societies not according to conventional criteria like age and income group, but rather based on pace of life. “People’s perception of time has changed. Everything moves more quickly now that people are under constant pressure to be productive if they want to be accepted by society. That’s why we believe our research is particularly relevant today,” says Drevon.\nThe first section of his book discusses how individuals’ pace of life can be used to analyze commuting patterns. The second describes the pace of life of around 8,000 people who commute between their workplace in Luxembourg and their home in Belgium, Germany or France. And the third gives the personal accounts of around 20 couples with small children where both parents have long commutes to work. The third section also outlines the strategies and methods these parents use to juggle the many demands on their time.\nWith a little help from my friends \nDrevon found that these busy parents rely on modern apps – such as WhatsApp groups with their neighbors, shared Google calendars and Facebook posts – as well as more conventional methods like carpooling to and from children’s lessons, relying on nearby grandparents and using a bulletin board in the kitchen. And while this list of solutions may seem long, it also highlights inequalities in the resources available to different groups of parents. “Lower-income families and single parents who don’t have friends and family close by often run up against serious time-management challenges,” says Drevon.\nIn busy families where days are planned down to the last minute, even the smallest delay can throw schedules off track and trigger a huge amount of stress. Over time, such hectic lifestyles can eventually lead parents to separate, move or experience burnout. Drevon suggests that parents take advantage of time-saving services like nannies and cleaning ladies. His research shows that on a community level, an excessively fast-paced lifestyle can become a public health issue related to parents’ mental and emotional well-being.\nArrhythmia and eurythmia\nDrevon’s approach is a way of taking a society’s pulse, spotting cases of arrhythmia – people who work a night shift, for example – and eurythmia, or times when communities come together such as at local fairs and festivals. He and other scientists at LaSUR are developing a method for measuring a community’s pace of life by analyzing commuting patterns (the accompanying graphs show commuting patterns in Switzerland over a 24-hour period) and housing. The scientists hope that their method can help policy-makers make better-informed decisions regarding transportation systems and housing developments.\nCommuting patterns in Switzerland over 24 hours, measured as part of a LaSUR study. © Alexis Gumy – LaSUR, EPFL", "summary": "When both parents face lengthy commutes to work, how do families handle the additional stress?

{"id": 224, "text": "The Universe is expanding, but there is still a great deal that we don’t know. How fast is it spreading? Why is the process speeding up, pushing various celestial objects away from each other, when the force of gravity should instead be drawing them together? What roles do dark matter and dark energy play? Questions like these – which are central to current astrophysics research – may soon find answers, thanks to a fleet of EPFL-designed microrobots.\nThese microrobots developed by EPFL scientists are expected to produce a surge in the amount and quality of astrophysics data we can gather, thus expanding our knowledge. It consists of a collection of 1,000 tiny robots, which were recently manufactured and delivered to Ohio State University. In time, they will be fitted to two telescopes – the Irénée du Pont telescope, at the Carnegie Institution for Science's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, and the Sloan Foundation telescope at New Mexico’s Apache Point Observatory – which are part of the international Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). EPFL is playing an active role in the SDSS (see  from July 2020).\nThe robots will be used to automate the positioning of hundreds of optical fibers which serve to direct the telescopes towards objects in space. The primary targets will be stars within our own galaxy, the Milky Way. By measuring the stars’ luminosity, scientists can calculate the “redshift” (i.e., the increase in the emitted light wavelength) of nearby galaxies that harbor black holes or that are part of clusters, and determine how far away they are. These measurements will help flesh out SDSS’ 3D map of the Universe’s stars and galaxies.\nSome of the microrobots during manufacture. © 2021 EPFL\nA painstaking task\nUp to now, the optical fibers in the SDSS telescopes have been positioned by hand – a lengthy, painstaking task that demands extreme precision. For the telescope to be able to observe celestial objects, hundreds of fibers need to be placed in holes set in a massive aluminum plate. There is no room for error: each fiber has to be positioned to the nearest micron to ensure that the image is perfectly in focus.\nUnder the current method, it takes a month to select the target stars and design, manufacture and drill the plates, which are then dispatched to the observatory. Then an experienced pair of hands needs 45 minutes to correctly position the thousand fibers. What’s more, on observing nights, twenty minutes are required to switch plates, during which the telescope is offline. “The Swiss robots speed up this process by orders of magnitude opening up the possibility of large-scale spectroscopic time-domain exploration”, rejoice Juna Kollmeier, Director of the SDSS-V project.\nThe positioner robots are expected to be operational at the Sloan telescope this fall and in Chile early next year.\nDoubling and tripling the number of stars observed\n“In addition to huge gains in flexibility and accuracy, we also hope to substantially increase the number of objects we can observe,” says Mohamed Bouri, head of EPFL’s Rehabilitation and Assistive Robotics group and the scientist in charge of designing the robots and getting them up and running. “This will allow us to shorten observation times and double or triple the number of stars and galaxies we can target. We will also be able to use spectroscopy to observe elements of the variable universe, such as exploding stars,” says Jean-Paul Kneib, head of EPFL's Laboratory of Astrophysics (LASTRO). \nJean-Paul Kneib and Mohamed Bouri. © 2021 EPFL / A.Herzog\nThis initiative is being spearheaded by EPFL's Astrobots group, which aims to promote synergies between the fields of astrophysics and robotics.

{"id": 226, "text": "A snowy autumn, undoubtedly, but a dry winter, a spring with no rainfall and the early snow thaw have had a major impact on the groundwater and may do, in turn, on our drinking water supply. According to MétéoSuisse, the rainfall shortage is the second most severe since records began in 1864.Rainfall levels reported in 2011 against the 1961-1990 norm (in mm): in green what should have fallen; in red what actually fell.\nProfessor Aurèle Parriaux\n of the  is not unduly worried for communities with a pumping-system to the lake: “\nLake Geneva is the second largest drinking water reservoir in Europe and with Lake Baikal we have enough resources; this is a costly additional solution though because the water has to be drawn and filtered before it can be distributed and consumed”\n. For those that rely on groundwater alone, it will certainly be a trickier matter. The Professor advises various towns in the region on the optimal management of their groundwater reserves. \n“In Switzerland we have been using the groundwater table in a renewable way over the last few decades. The hollow is created, a specific proportion of the water is taken and then the sheets are left to refill in periods of low consumption”.\nThe “Morand” groundwater\n The Geneva basin contains around 20 large groundwater sheets of a few square kilometers that each supply between 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants. These are solid and stable sheets generally situated around 10 meters deep that are fairly impervious to rainfall and drought. The Morand groundwater sheet is one of these. The spring was bought in the 1930s by the town of Morges. It’s situated in the Morges wood, at the foot of Montricher. For over 80 years, it has been supplying all the households in the town as well as the neighboring villages at a rate of nearly 7000 liters per minute. Even at the beginning of May 2011, its level is already unusually low. It corresponds to the data recorded in June 2003, the heat-wave year, and June 2010, which was particularly dry. Professor Parriaux’s expertise was sought: ‘\nThis drying-up process is abnormal; it’s starting two months early. There is a risk that very low levels will be reached this summer\". In very critical cases, drastic solutions may have to be considered such as the emergency drilling of new wells installed in the parts of the groundwater sheet that still show a large reserve.”\nIn green, curve of the Morand groundwater in 2011\n This would not be the first time Aurèle Parriaux has had to present this solution. Around twenty years ago, the Joux Valley had to confront two ecological disasters in quick succession. The source in Le Brassus was contaminated by some slurry just a few days before a rail accident at the edge of Lake Brenet resulted in the drinking water well being taken out of service because of oil seepage into the ground. Emergency wells made it possible to supply drinking water to the local inhabitants.\nNatural reservoirs\n The water resources must be identified and preserved: \n“These natural reservoirs have very different inertias. The deep groundwater sheets such as those in the Aubonne delta will not be too badly affected because they are extremely thick. However, I know that some sheets at the foot of the Jura are already in difficulty”,\n the Professor explains. Empty groundwater sheets also cause problems for rivers because they serve as their supply when there is no rain. The water levels of the Venoge, for example, are extremely low and some sections have dried up. Morges is drawing some water from its Morand sheet and diverting it into the river to sustain the low water levels on the Veyron River. It’s a matter of preserving the ecosystem. With conservation in mind, the canton of Vaud commissioned Professor Parriaux’s team to draw up a hydrogeological map of its land. \n“We used a consistent mathematical model that transposes geological knowledge into water-resource parameters such as the permeability or thickness of the groundwater sheets. That enables us to map out new groundwater sheets. They form in sites where the geological material is permeable, such as the gravelly alluvia deposited after the ice age or in the chalky rocks.”\n There is an increasing demand for water and meeting this will require exploring and drilling much deeper this time. At the foot of the Jura, a 200-meter well has just been drilled. \n“This is undoubtedly a critical year; showers and storms will have no effect on the groundwater sheets because the water will stay on the surface. For this to improve, we can wish for one thing only: a rotten summer!”", "summary": "Could our drinking water resources be at risk from drought, among other things?

{"id": 229, "text": "A few weeks ago, French charity Solidarité Sida caused a sensation when it published a  as part of an awareness-raising campaign. The video in question is what’s known as a deepfake, a technique that involves using machine learning to fabricate increasingly realistic images and videos as well as audio and text files.\nThis use of a deepfake video by a charity highlights the growing prevalence of this phenomenon. While pornography currently accounts for the vast majority of deepfake videos, the technique can also be used to defraud, to defame, to spread fake news or to steal someone’s identity.\nEvolving threats\nIn September,  (IRGC) brought together around 30 experts for an interdisciplinary seminar to discuss this fast-evolving phenomenon and its growing prevalence. The IRGC has today published a report containing valuable insights into the risks associated with deepfakes.\nThe headline observation is that these risks could potentially cause widespread harm across many areas of life. “Any business organization or activity that relies on documentary evidence is potentially vulnerable,” says Aengus Collins, the report’s author and deputy director of the IRGC. Deepfakes can cause a great deal of uncertainty and confusion. In a recent case, . On a society-wide scale, a proliferation of fabricated content could undermine truth and erode public trust, the very cornerstones of democratic debate.\nThe report provides a framework for categorizing deepfake risks. It highlights three key impacts – reputational harm, fraud and extortion, and the manipulation of decision-making processes – and notes that these impacts can be felt individually, institutionally or across society.\nWith such a wide range of potential harm from deepfakes, where are risk-governance responses most needed? The experts recommend focusing on the scale and severity of the potential harm, as well as the ability of the “target” to cope with the fallout. For instance, a well-resourced company with established processes will be better able to absorb the impact of a deepfake attack than a private victim of harassment.\nInterdependent solutions\nIn the report, the IRGC sets out 15 recommendations covering a variety of potential responses to deepfakes that could mitigate the risks they present. It also calls for deeper research across the board.\nOne of the main categories of recommendation is technology, including tools that can verify the provenance of digital content or detect deepfakes. At EPFL, the Multimedia Signal Processing Group (MMSPG) and startup Quantum Integrity are currently developing a  that could be deployed in 2020. “For any given set of defenses, there will be vulnerabilities that can be exploited,” Collins says. “But maintaining and developing technological responses to deepfakes is crucial to deterring most of the misuses.”\nThe report also highlights the need for a greater focus on the legal status of deepfakes, in order to clarify how laws in areas such as defamation, harassment and copyright apply to synthetic content.\nMore generally, digital literacy has an important role to play.

But there also needs to be a positive focus on things like corroboration and the assessment of sources. Otherwise, encouraging people to distrust everything they see risks exacerbating problems related to the erosion of truth and trust.”\nWider horizons\nWhile the IRGC report focuses on deepfake risk governance, this research is part of a wider workstream on the risks associated with emerging and converging technologies, which will continue in 2020. “We are currently deciding what our next focus will be,” says Collins. “And there is no shortage of candidates.

{"id": 235, "text": "We used to talk about means of transportation; now we have transportation systems. Today’s smart systems are built around four pillars: sharing, automation, electric power and integrated mobility. Professor Matthias Finger and PhD student Maxime Audouin, both from the La Poste Chair in Management of Network Industries at EPFL, have published a new book* describing governance mechanisms that can help cities make the most of these changes. We spoke with Audouin about why governance is important.\nWhy did you decide to study transportation system governance?\nTransportation today is largely dominated by personal cars, and that has become counter-productive. Cities are gridlocked with traffic congestion – reflecting a major failure of their transportation systems. New solutions do exist, thanks in large part to advancements in information and communication technology, and they are generally based more on the usage than the ownership of the means of transport. They are paving the way to new kinds of transportation systems and making it possible to transition to a post-car, and potentially more sustainable, world. The transportation industry is being disrupted by four major shifts caused by the development of mobility solutions that are shared, automated, electric and integrated.\nWhy should cities be so concerned about governance?\nToday’s mobility solutions are being driven mainly by the private sector, where the goal is to generate a profit. For instance, Uber wants to have as many customers as possible, which means having more cars on the road and therefore greater traffic congestion. By the same token, a car maker wants to sell as many electric – and perhaps one day driverless – vehicles as possible, but if nothing is done to encourage the sharing of those vehicles, they won’t improve traffic congestion and could even make it worse. So we must look at how cities can regulate these businesses so that they also act in the public interest. Our book gives some ideas, which would help cities realize the full potential of new transportation technology.\nThrough technology like ride-hailing platforms, such as Uber.\nYes, but policymakers haven’t always had the right responses to these platforms. Many try to make them comply with regulations that were developed for conventional transportation methods. Others just simply close their eyes or try to ban them. But the companies behind these new platforms are highly disruptive and will always find a way to get around the rules. So policymakers would be wise to get one step ahead and start integrating them into existing systems.\nSo what should cities do?\nThe longer they wait to adopt new transportation technology, the harder it will be. That doesn’t mean cities should throw out the rule book and consider new technology as the solution to all their transportation problems. Rather, it gives them a chance to improve the current situation. Digital technology can give cities an unprecedented amount of data on how the transportation upstarts operate – this data can be used to develop regulations that help incorporate new platforms into existing systems. Also, it’s essential that policymakers set precise medium- and long-term targets for cutting emissions and reducing traffic congestion. Smart transportation systems can help them reach these targets – but only if the targets exist.\nYou have identified automation as another pillar of smart transportation systems. How should cities respond to self-driving cars?\nPolicymakers often forget to include citizens in their decision-making processes. But how can they make laws governing how individuals use self-driving cars if they don’t even consult the individuals in question? Many countries are vying to be the first to have autonomous vehicles on their roads – but, ironically, the percentage of people ready to use such vehicles is much smaller than one might think. Even beyond safety issues, it’s vital for cities to pass regulations encouraging people to share these vehicles. If all conventional cars on the road were replaced with self-driving cars that are neither shared nor electric, traffic conditions would not change – or could even deteriorate.\n*The Governance of Smart Transportation Systems, Eds.

{"id": 237, "text": "HSP70, a protein indicating stress in the human body, is a biomarker for prostate, colon, esophagus, lung, and brain cancer. Being able to track this protein in patients, making early diagnoses of these types of cancer much more likely, would therefore be very useful for doctors. As part of the \"Spedoc\" European Research Project, an EPFL team is developing an extremely sensitive, easy-to-use HSP70 detection platform. The device, which will be no bigger than a small suitcase, is expected to be on the market in 2014.\nHow does it work? \n The Spedoc platform requires only a drop of the patient's blood. The blood is inserted in a chip that contains many microchannels. Inside each of the channels are tiny and circular structures made out of gold, with a particular \"anti-body\" surface chemistry that is designed to \"trap\" HSP70. As the blood flows through the channels, the HSP70 proteins are trapped by the structures, of which there are thousands in the pathway that the blood follows through the chip.\nThe next step in the process involves advanced plasmonics, which the team uses to determine the number of HSP70 proteins trapped on the circular nanostructures. If HSP70 is in fact over-expressed in the blood sample, it would mean that the patient would require further tests to detect cancer cells developing somewhere in the body.\nLight detection\n Two EPFL professors have joined forces on the HSP70 project. Sébastian Maerkl is head of the Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization (LBNC), which is developing the chip measuring 1 cm2. The chip contains layers of microfluidic channels that are no wider than a human hair. It is designed to break down the blood sample into its various components.\nOlivier Martin's Nanophotonics and Metrology Lab (NAM) is in charge of the detection side of the device-design process: the NAM team is developing gold nanostructures, as well as optimizing a process to identify the HSP70 protein. \"Our technique involves shining white light on the microfluidic channels,\" says Olivier Martin. \"If a protein is caught on a nanostructure, we will observe small changes in wavelength as the light is refracted, compared with the initial light. In other words, there will be a change in color that can be observed with a spectrometer.\"\nThis is due to what is known as a surface plasmon resonance, which occurs when the electrons of a metallic nanoparticle oscillate together when they are stimulated by light. Depending upon whether the nanostructure has an HSP70 protein on it, the oscillations will be measurably different, making it possible to determine whether a given nanostructure has trapped a protein or not. The physical phenomenon of resonance oscillation upon which all of this depends only occurs at very small scales. \"The resonance is so sensitive that we can detect tiny quantities of a given molecule.\"\nAvailable soon at your doctor's office?\n The Spedoc early detection method has many advantages: fast and non-invasive, it could replace costly cancer biomarker detection methods. \"Cosingo, a Spanish company that's involved in the project, has already built a prototype, but quite a few improvements still need to be made,\" says Olivier Martin, who nonetheless can imagine a long-term scenario where such a test is widely used. \"Doctors would use our platform as a cancer screening test during their patients' regular checkups, which could lead to extremely early diagnoses.\"Could this be the beginning of revolution in cancer treatment? The Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) oncologist and Professor of Medicine Olivier Michielin takes a cautious stance, commenting, \"The HSP70 test seems quite interesting. However, it will be a long time before it becomes a routine test, although this protein is in fact high in patients with many types of cancer. In particular, it still needs to be proven that early HSP70 detection can actually change the way patients are treated and lead to real improvements in outcomes for specific types of cancer.\"Whatever the case may be for HSP70, however, the Spedoc platform will certainly prove to be useful.\"Once we have worked out the general principle, the test itself can always be adapted for use on other biomarkers,\" notes Sebastian Maerkl.\n Spedoc Project site:", "summary": "It may soon be possible to test a person for cancer with just a drop of their blood and a small machine.

However, the solutions currently under review, particularly in the context of industrial activities, are very expensive. In order to stimulate research and encourage the development of new technologies in this field, the company Gaznat and EPFL signed an agreement today for the creation of two new research chairs. They will focus on the fields of CO2 chemistry and geo-energy and will be operational by spring 2015.\nThe first chair will be responsible for finding solutions to capture, at its source, CO2 derived from industrial activities. This will include developing and testing new methods and materials able to separate more easily carbon dioxide from combustion gases released into the air through smokestacks.\nThis chair’s role will also be to study CO2 chemistry so as to synthesize new molecules and increase their value as carbon sources demanded by the industry, like liquid fuel or other derivatives. \"With this chair, an authentic center specializing in carbon capture and recovery will be created,\" notes Paul Dyson, chemistry professor and director of the Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering at EPFL.\nInteractions with rocks\nThe second chair, which will be part of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), follows the creation of the Petrosvibri chair in 2010 (a company owned by Gaznat and Holdigaz), that focuses in the study of long term CO2 underground storage. To set the conditions for a safe and effective geological sequestration, this new laboratory will analyze the interactions between carbon dioxide and the rocks where it will be pumped into. In such a way, the laboratory will gain a better understanding of the Swiss subsoil and will be able to reveal useful information regarding the risks, potential and opportunities related to hydraulic fracturing technology.\nThis new chair will also work on renewable energy sources such as deep geothermal energy, as well as the exploitation of hydrocarbons known as \"conventional\" and \"unconventional\" – the latter not coming from a permeable reservoir rock. \"This chair will also provide an edge in such fields for civil engineering students,\" adds Lyesse Laloui, tenured professor holding the Petrosvibri chair.\nTowards a neutral carbon balance\nAs for Gaznat, the creation of these chairs is in accordance with the drilling conducted in 2010 by the Petrosvibri company in lake Geneva, which confirmed the presence of natural gas in the \"Noville\" geological structure. It also echoes the commitment the gas company made this spring with several other European companies to achieve a neutral carbon natural gas transport infrastructure by mid-century. Finally, it is part of the Confederation’s 2050 Energy Strategy, which refers to the reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\"This double signature constitutes a great opportunity, commented Philippe Petitpierre and René Bautz, President and CEO of Gaznat.

The robot struggles to reproduce them on a tablet – especially the loop of the letter p. The girl kindly steps in to help, writing out the word to show the robot how to do it. She puts in effort to teach the robot... without realizing that in reality she is the one who is improving her writing skills. Yesterday, EPFL researchers presented their new teaching tool, called CoWriter, at the \"Conference on Human-­‐Robot Interaction (HRI)\", an important event in the field of interactive robotics, held in Portland, USA.\nThe program is based on learning by teaching, a recognized principle in pedagogy. When children experience difficulties in writing, they can easily lose confidence, begin to shut down, or even gradually lose interest in the learning process. Eventually, their entire education can be affected. When students put themselves in the place of a teacher and pass on what they know to their peers, they can regain their self-­‐esteem and motivation. The researchers’ idea was to make a robot play the role of the peer who needs to be taught. “Essentially, the goal is to provide a tool for teachers that is given a new role in the classroom, that of a student who knows even less than the slowest student in the class,” explains Séverin Lemaignan, one of the authors of the study.\nHardly readable letters\nScientists developed progressive writing algorithms and implemented them on an existing robot model -­‐ a 58 cm tall humanoid, designed to be likeable and interact with humans. With these algorithms, the machine can clumsily draw words on demand, and then gradually improve. To do this, it uses a vast database of handwriting examples, which allows it to reproduce common errors made by young children while learning. It is also possible to program the robot so that it addresses the particular difficulties of a student, for example, by drawing a P that is barely readable and improving its form over time.\nNew studies\nThe CoWriter system, still in the prototype stage, has already been used in primary school lessons with about seventy students ranging from six to eight years old, and then individually with a six year old child for one hour per week over the course of one month. So far the system has been very well received.\nThese experiments have mainly allowed testing the system from a technical point of view and to verify that the algorithms meet the children’s long-­‐term demands and that they lead to the desired outcome. In the coming months the researchers will conduct further studies to quantify the benefits of such a program: its effectiveness on the learning process and student progress, its ease of use for teachers and its applicability in more specialized fields such as speech therapy.\nCoWriter is an invention of the Computer-­‐Human Interaction Lab in Learning and Instruction (Chili Lab), EPFL, in collaboration with the Learning algorithms and systems Laboratory (LASA), EPFL, in the frame of the \nNCCR robotics\n, and with the Instituto Superior Técnico, part of the University of Lisbon, under the supervision of Prof. Ana Paiva.", "summary": "Who is the teacher: the student or the machine?

{"id": 242, "text": "The holy grail for both virtual and augmented reality is to produce objects and lighting conditions exactly as they would appear in the physical world, ray by ray. EPFL startup CREAL has moved one step closer to this goal with a disruptive piece of tech that is arousing strong interest. Instead of superimposing two flat images to create an artificial 3D effect, the device projects images in a similar way to a hologram and provides multidirectional light that is almost indistinguishable from real-world conditions. The firm raised 7.3 million Swiss francs in funding late last year, and its prototypes have caught the eye of some major players in this sector.\nExisting virtual- and augmented-reality headsets are known to cause a feeling of nausea in some users. This is because of the way they create virtual objects: the system sets a fixed focal distance and the image is given depth by a programmed 3D effect. Devices at the more advanced end of the market use eye-tracking technology to adjust focus. But even this method does not get around the problem of accommodation, or the process by which the eye naturally adjusts as the distance to an object varies – so that closer objects appear sharper than distant ones, for instance. This phenomenon occurs when we try to focus on an object at different distances with one eye closed: bring it closer and the background becomes blurred, move it away and the foreground loses sharpness. In the real world, accommodation works in tandem with another natural process known as vergence, whereby our eyes superimpose two 2D images to create a 3D picture. But once we put on a headset, the harmony between these two processes is broken. It is this discord that causes us to feel nauseous.\nUltra-realistic light\nCREAL founder and CEO Tomas Sluka has developed a disruptive technology that solves the eye strain typically caused by headsets. His invention dramatically improves the light field, which is considered a missing key to comfortable smart eyewear because the quantity of light traveling in all directions – including reflected light – is vital to producing a realistic lighting effect. CREAL’s new technology generates a sort of simplified hologram that brings real-life detail and depth to virtual scenes, with the light and color of each pixel changing according to the angle of view. This breakthrough resolves the disconnect between accommodation and vergence, allowing the wearer’s eye to function normally and eliminating the sense of nausea.\nContinuous depth resolution\nSluka is keen to maintain his firm’s competitive edge and is naturally keeping his cards close to his chest. “Our light field technology produces a more realistic effect than any other system,” he explains. “It can support hundreds of depth resolutions, from zero to infinite. The resolutions are distributed gradually, with more closer to the eye and fewer further away.” In fact, the technology is so powerful that people who normally wear corrective glasses can use it without them.\nAlthough the functional prototypes are quite bulky and the firm still has some technical challenges to overcome, Sluka is confident that his system will find its way into augmented reality goggles at some point in 2021. CREAL has recently taken on 14 new hires and is ready to shift up a gear after raising 7.3 million Swiss francs late last year, including 4.3 million francs from investors, a 2.5-million-franc grant from the European Innovation Council’s deep-tech champions program, and a 500,000-franc loan from the Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). Sluka believes that, a decade from now, we will all be wearing augmented reality goggles.

{"id": 243, "text": "On Sunday, 19 March, the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) reached Cape Town, South Africa. This marked the end of its trek around the southernmost continent, which began in this same port on 20 December 2016. The expedition was organized by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) and carried by the \nAkademik Treshnikov\n, a Russian research ship. By the end of the three-month voyage, a total of some 150 researchers had carried out 22 projects, selected from 93 proposals.\nThe overall aim of the projects, which covered fields such as oceanography, climatology and biology, was to learn more about the Southern Ocean. This will help scientists predict how the climate will change in the coming years. The Antarctic region is crucial to the planet’s health for a number of reasons. First, it serves as a major carbon sink. And in addition to influencing weather conditions in the southern hemisphere, the Antarctic continent plays a key role in how the oceans circulate around the world.\n“This expedition is a first in several respects,” explained David Walton, the chief scientist on board. “Until now, no one had ever gathered data over an entire season on one expedition or simultaneously conducted land, ocean and atmospheric research. Taken together, these projects will give us a fuller picture of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.”\nLand and ocean research\n The researchers looked at a wide range of issues in their effort to identify the effects of climate change. For example, data on how air particles form (aerosols) will be used to study the interaction of the ocean and atmosphere in new ways. And the water-column readings that were taken regularly throughout the expedition will provide researchers with detailed information on chemical changes in the ocean, including salinity levels and whether certain metals are present in the water.\nSamples gathered during stops on a number of Sub-Antarctic islands – Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, Balleny, Scott, Peter I, Diego Ramirez, South Georgia, South Sandwich and Bouvet – will provide key insights into how plant and animal life there evolves and adapts to extreme environments. And data collected by sonars capable of detecting distant sounds will be used to estimate the blue whale population. The sonars showed that the ship was never far from these creatures.\nOther researchers observed the effect of waves on ice formation and the shape of island coastlines. This had never before been looked at in depth and will teach us more about the interplay between the islands and the ocean. Ice samples taken on the islands and on the mainland will enlighten us with valuable details on our climate’s history. And samples of phytoplankton, which are at the bottom of the food chain, will show how the various regions react to ocean warming.\nThe ubiquity of microplastics, even in the most remote locations, was a troubling discovery. “There was little in the way of plastic shards, but we found synthetic fibers – mainly the result of washing clothes – at all the sites we visited,” said Peter Ryan, the researcher in charge of this project. It is not yet known how this type of pollution will affect the food chain or, more specifically, large sea birds, which were also observed and counted during the expedition.\nAn ambitious international project\n The expedition provided an opportunity for researchers from 18 different countries to work together. They broke down cultural barriers and worked across fields in their quest for significant new knowledge. Their task was made easier by generally mild weather.\n“Running so many projects was very ambitious, and it wasn’t always easy to meet everyone’s needs,” said Frederik Paulsen, philanthropist, polar explorer, and the chairman of ACE Foundation. “Overall, it was a great success. But things are really only getting started: we have years of work ahead of us to analyze all the data that was collected.”\nThe researchers have two years to publish their findings. The data will then be made available to the wider scientific community. But several events are planned before then.

The related research paper has been published in .\nThe researchers showed that their method was effective by correctly identifying in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, single DNA strands coming from a mixture of two different chromosomes of Vibrio Harveyi, a known gut bacterium. It was a complex challenge. “Real-life samples contain millions of different bacterial species, and we are usually only interested in a dozen of them,” explains Raffaele Vitale, one of the study’s co-authors. “With our method, we considerably accelerate microbiome analysis in settings where single base level analysis is not required or would not be cost efficient.”\nIn DNA mapping, a microscope image is made from stretched DNA molecules that are specifically labeled with a fluorescent marker, resulting in sort of “DNA barcodes”. To identify where such DNA barcodes came from, they need to be compared to reference maps generated from the bacteria’s known genomic sequences. The analysis method then generates a score for every one of these comparisons and uses it to calculate an empirical \np\n-value for the reliability of each match.\nUntil now, the most common method for analyzing microbiota involved looking for the genes common to all life, such as ribosomal DNA. However, this method suffers from certain drawbacks, such as a potential bias in the readout and the inability to both differentiate between closely related species and to recognize species that do not have these genes (such as bacteriophages). Another option would be for researchers to sequence everything in the sample. But this approach is computationally very intensive, and it has troubles with closely related species.

Reducing this consumption, even by only a few percent, therefore represents an important economic and ecological factor. This is the objective of Kandou, the 1000th invention of EPFL.\nThe Service of Industrial Relations (SRI), responsible for the transfer of technologies to industry, has in fact just received its 1000th invention for evaluation. The first one managed by the SRI concerned the solar cells of Professor Grätzel, winner of the Millenium Technology Prize in 2010. “EPFL protects promising inventions above all with the goal of being useful to society” explains Gabriel Clerc, the person responsible at SRI.\nKandou, invented by Harm Cronie and Amin Shokrollahi of the Laboratoire d’algorithme de l’EPFL, enables processors to communicate more rapidly – while using less energy – with their peripherals (memory, printers, monitors). This represents a small revolution in the world of computing, with the solution coming from . . . mathematics!\nMost electronic appliances are nowadays equipped with ultra-rapid processors. These communicate with other processors or with other peripherals by using electronic buses, sort of “information highways”. The problem is that these devices, made up of tiny wires, interfere with each other, resulting in the signal transmission being parasited and limiting full use of the processors’ capacity. While the intensity of the signal can be amplified, these disturbances increase proportionally, like two couples chatting in a restaurant: their talking interferes with their neighbours, and their speech is barely audible. Chatting more loudly doesn’t help at all, as everyone has to increase the volume. You could build a wall between the couples, but that would take up space and would still not suppress the interference.\nOver the last 10 years, the buses have been modified by adopting differential signalling. The information is transmitted by pairs of wires. On one of them, the message is transmitted in “positive” and the other in “negative”. Each pair of wires received more or less the same interference from the environment. By substracting the “positive” information from the “negative” information, the disturbances are cancelled out, while the intensity of the signal is doubled. This solution is effective, but requires twice as many wires, which isn’t always feasible. So the amount of energy per wire has to be increased to obtain the desired speed. The result – though better than the first solution – is still not perfect.\nIn the near future, a new technology should be implanted in electronic systems – Kandou, which uses mathematics to solve these problems. A bus based on the Kandou system codes the signal using an astute algorithm, then transfers it over all the wires simultaneously. A decoder at the destination point allows the recovery of the data. Let’s return to the analogy of the two couples: instead of speaking the same language, one of the couples speaks French, and the other sign-language. In each couple, the two people understand each other perfectly. Kandou uses a similar system, thus eliminating interference and background noise.\nThis invention brings multiple benefits. On the one hand, fewer wires are required, and so devices can be smaller: on the other hand, the speed of transmission of the signal can be considerably increased. Lastly, the electric intensity in the wires can be significantly reduced, which enables energy savings. Depending on the applications, different benefits – sometimes combined – will be emphasized. For example, in mobile phones, manufacturers are looking to reduce energy consumption in order to increase autonomy. In a computer, the objective is to increase the speed of data transfer and therefore overall performance. The number of wires in DSL lines or ocean-crossing cables could also be reduced.\nThe largest multinationals are already interested in Kandou, which could equip most of our electronic systems within a few years.", "summary": "EPFL is celebrating its 1000th invention : Kandou.

{"id": 255, "text": "“I regard myself as a descendent of the true Modernists,” a young Rem Koolhaas told Dutch journal \nwonen-TA/BK\n in 1978. He also said he was not worried about his utilitarian approach to architecture not being fashionable at the time. \nHighly self-assured, even arrogant according to some, Rem Koolhaas was already actively creating his own myth. He would go on to become one of the key architects of the second half of the 20th century, a controversial “starchitect,” a provocateur, hated and admired in equal measure. Three years before that interview took place, he founded his own practice, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), in New York. His 1978 manifesto extolling the virtues of Manhattan, \nDelirious New York\n, has become a cult classic. From the United States to China, his designs have showcased his radical thinking for more than 40 years now. The same is true of his essays and Harvard lectures. \nHowever, his influence on contemporary architecture remains hard to pin down. To better understand how his work has been received around the world, Christophe van Gerrewey, a researcher and tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL in the theory and history of architecture, has put together an anthology of 150 texts from all corners of the globe and published between 1975 and 1995, some of which have been translated into English for the first time: “OMA/Rem Koolhaas, A Critical Reader from \nDelirious New York\n to \nS,M,L,XL\n” (Birkhäuser). The anthology represents a genuine salvage operation, to save texts that would otherwise have been consigned to history. The book is illustrated with dozens of magazine covers featuring the architect’s image – from the specialist press to \nVogue \n– both highlighting his global popularity and raising questions about it. \nThe anthology focuses on the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), from the time the practice was set up in 1975 to the publication of the book \nS,M,L,XL\n in 1995. During that period, you say that architecture sought to be on an equal footing with literature and the visual arts. Does the anthology shed light on Rem Koolhaas’s role in that process?\n During that period, architecture undeniably became a much more popular part of culture than before. Rem Koolhaas belonged to a generation of architects who attracted attention from the mainstream press because of his eloquence, his ability to pick up on trends and a certain sense of self-promotion. The texts collected in my book help us to understand him. He’s also someone who presented architecture as an intellectual activity and as something fun. His buildings are highly inventive and sometimes very unexpected. But we can’t really say that architecture has managed to attract the same kind of attention on the culture pages as literature, the movies or theater. \nIn your opinion, what is the influence, relevance and legacy of Rem Koolhaas’s work in 2019?\n It’s interesting to study his writings and designs, not just qualitatively, but also because they reflect their era. In 1978, \nDelirious New York \nwas a defense of Manhattan at a time when the city was regarded as a dangerous and unpleasant place to be. Instead, Koolhaas regarded it as an accumulation of original formal inventions, one example being Coney Island. We see here his tendency from the start to take an interest in unpopular subjects just before they became popular. The following decade, in 1989, he designed a terminal for the Sea Trade Center in Zeebrugge, which would become a symbol of open communication and European unification, embodying Europe’s optimism in the post-Cold War period. In some ways, the project also showed the drawbacks of the European project: it was overly focused on commerce and turned into a money pit. \nWhat about the 1990s? \n In the early 1980s, his firm was building low-cost housing, but we see those kinds of projects subsequently disappear from his practice. That reflected the shift in housing policies away from socialist ideals. In 1992, however, OMA built what critics regard as its most successful building: the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam. The building is perfectly balanced, capable of attracting the attention of its visitors while also being an ideal setting for the works of art it contains. But probably his most vital work during the period was his book \nS,M,L,XL\n, which any self-respecting architect should own. \nWhat makes the book so special?\n As things stand today, it is the most recent major book on architecture, the one that has had the most impact, attracting reviews all over the world even two years after it was published. There was also an exhibition dedicated to it, as my anthology shows. However, at 1,300 pages long, \nS,M,L,XL\n isn’t a book meant to be read, but to be browsed. Bruce Mau’s graphic design is a key feature of it, and it’s more of an object than a book. In that sense, you could say that it foreshadowed the culture of channel-hopping or even browsing the internet.\nThe Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam. © OMA", "summary": "Interviews, reviews, articles, essays, opinions and competition reports published all over the world in relation to Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas – some of which have been translated into English for the first time – have been collected in a new anthology.

{"id": 258, "text": "Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, after cataracts. It is characterized by the presence of too much liquidbetween the cornea and the iris. This leads to a build-up of pressure within the eye, a situation that can destroy the optic nerve if it is not handled correctly.\nProfessor Nikos Stergiopulos's team at the EPFL's Laboratory of Hemodynamics and Cardiovascular Technology (LHTC) has developed an adjustable implantable \"micro-tap\" that can drain surplus fluid in the eye. Clinical trials on this glaucoma drainage device should be starting before the end of the year and will be coordinated by Rheon Medical, an EPFL start-up. In addition to Prof. Stergiopulos, the project team is composed of LHTC members Stéphane Bigler, Adan Villamarin and Sylvain Roy.\nThe problems with current technology\t\n In a healthy human eye, a fluid known as the \"aqueous humor\" is continuously being produced at the ciliary body level in the anterior chamber which is situated between the iris and the cornea. The aqueous humor is then naturally drained out through fibrous tissue called the trabecular meshwork, which functions as a filter. In people with glaucoma, the filter becomes more resistant. The aqueous humor therefore can no longer drain as it should, and intraocular pressure increases. \"Glaucoma patients are at risk of losing peripheral vision initially, and ultimately of becoming completely blind,\" says Professor Stergiopulos.\nThere are several different approaches to lowering intraocular pressure. 90% of the time medicated eye drops are enough. For more serious cases, however, a tiny drain must be implanted in the affected eye through surgery to allow the liquid to flow out. However, there is a problem with the current drains: their diameter can't be adjusted. This means that sometimes the patient's intraocular pressure will shift from too high (ocular hypertony) to too low (ocular hypotony), which leads to post-operative complications. Often, a second operation is required.\nMagnetic disk\tand silicon tube\n Nikos Stergiopoulos and his team conceived of an entirely new type of mechanism to solve the pressure variation problems. The device contains a magnetic disk surrounded by a silicon tube that is designed to rotate around an eccentric axis. When the disk rotates it compresses the tube, to a greater or lesser extent. In this way the flow rate through the tube can be adjusted. \"There was no way of fitting electronics and motor-based devices into the space we had,\" says Professor Stergiopulos, \"so we invented a ½-millimeter thick device that functions like a tiny faucet.\"\nA simple \"pen-tool\" for pressure adjustments\t\n The prototype is called the Glafkos, which is the name of a river in Greece. It can be adjusted remotely with a small tool that is about the size of a pen with an embedded compass. To \"read\" the implant position and change the flow rate all one needs to do is to bring the \"pen-tool\" near to the implant and move it around. This makes the disk spin, changing the flow rate. \"Adjustments take only a few seconds. Clinicians are thus able to calibrate the implant and measure changes in pressure in real time and non-invasively, \"says the scientist.\nGlaucoma: an increasingly common medical condition\n If it works, the new technology could eliminate post-operative complications. But that is only part of the potential payoff for glaucoma patients: \"Since the device is smaller than current models, it might be possible to avoid cornea transplants in some patients who currently require them because their implants are larger,\" says Dr. André Mermoud, head of the Glaucoma Center at the Montchoisi Clinic in Lausanne.\nFor the moment, the device has been successfully tested only on rabbits. The next step is human clinical trials. The CHUV -Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudoisand- ethics Committee and SwissMedic should green-light this testing before the end of the year. \n Glaucoma currently affects 1-2% of people in Switzerland, mostly older people. This prevalence rate could well rise in the coming years as the population ages. \"In addition,\" says Dr. Mermoud, \"on a world-wide scale there are a great number of people who could benefit from this new technology.\"", "summary": "A tiny, EPFL-designed implantable device that can be positioned within the eye and controlled remotely may well revolutionize the treatment of glaucoma.

Some companies will surely come to rely on these drones. And engineers will be called on to develop ever more sophisticated models to keep pace with this new facet of e-commerce.\nThe drone, which has been designed in EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems with funding of NCCR Robotics, is equipped with several innovations that make it particularly safe, autonomous and easy to transport.\nThe unique idea here is that the drone becomes the package that wraps around the cargo before flight, just like a mail package. The foldable carbon-fiber cage protects the drone and the cargo in case of a collision or fall. What’s more, the recipient can catch the drone mid-flight without being injured by the propellers, which are located within the structure and have a safety system so that they stop when the cage is opened.\nThe origami-inspired design means that the frame can be folded and unfolded in a single movement. It can be flattened in just a few seconds, reducing the drone's volume by 92% so that it can easily be slipped inside a backpack.\n An accurate, self-flying drone\nThe drone – a multicopter with four propellers – can take off and land vertically, which enhances its accuracy. And it can carry a package weighing up to 500 grams over a distance of 2 kilometers.\nThe drone contains specially designed self-flying software to program the delivery. A flight plan is created to ensure it avoids obstacles such as trees and buildings. The drone can then be tracked in real time on a tablet or smartphone. And once the package has been delivered, the drone makes its way back on its own. The device also has a safety system to prevent it from being hacked.\n“This project is a work in progress - in addition to strengthening its ability to detect and avoid objects, we are exploring possibilities to increase the drone’s payload capacity and enhance its autonomy, ”says Przemyslaw Kornatowski, who developed the drone. \"Throughout the summer, we tested our human-friendly, drone-delivery system on the EPFL campus, delivering items to people over 150 test flights\".

Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide; according to World Health Organization statistics, it is responsible for 70,000 – 100,000 sudden deaths every year. In heart attack situations, time is of the essence in preventing death.\n This new tool is one of a new generation of embedded systems that are intelligent and autonomous; as they monitor human biological systems, these so-called “wireless body sensor networks,” (WBSN) consume very little electricity. They’re made up of high-precision body sensors applied to the skin, a ZigBee radio module and a chip that’s optimized for analyzing and processing biological signals. \n They’re miniaturized, so everything is light and non-invasive. Connected to a wireless network, they monitor users’ heart rates remotely and in real time. By means of complex algorithms, anomalies can be detected and analyzed. When a problem is detected, information is sent to the user’s smartphone, then by text message or e-mail to medical personnel, who can intervene if necessary. \n “This system collects very reliable and precise data, it’s equipped with a very effective noise filtering system, and it has batteries that can last for 3-4 weeks at a time,” notes EPFL professor David Atienza, head of EPFL’s Embedded Systems Lab. “Above all it provides an automatic analysis and immediate transmission of data in compressed format to the doctor, preventing him or her from having to work through hours of recorded data.”\n “Its size, its lightness, its ease of use, the fact that it measures continuously and remotely, which allows analysis to take place anywhere, makes this device very attractive to doctors,” says Etienne Pruvot, a cardiologist in the Lausanne University Hospitals (CHUV) Cardiology Service, who adds that the system still needs to be tested in real-life conditions. \n According to Atienza, other applications, such as monitoring athletic performance, are also possible. Researchers are looking into a project that would monitor diet and physical activity in obese patients (PRONAF: www.pronaf.es - in Spanish). \n Various collaborations with companies are underway, such as a European project named IcyHeart which has just begun.

{"id": 269, "text": "Raymond Bradley has seen his share of political intimidation. Several years after he co-authored  corroborating the hypothesis that global warming was caused by human carbon dioxide emissions, he was shoved into the limelight by politicians attempting to intimidate him and tarnish his reputation. Thankfully, he escaped unscathed and without losing his resolve to pursue his research into the causes of past and present climate fluctuations. On Tuesday, March 26, Bradley was invited to speak at EPFL by the . We met him for an interview.\nSeveral years ago, you were quite prominently confronted with high-profile climate change deniers. How do you deal with climate change skeptics today? \nI used to engage with them a lot, but I've given up because it’s a waste of time. There are a small percentage of people who will never be convinced, because they are philosophically unwilling to look at the same facts and see the same thing. Now I spend my time convincing the reasonable people in the middle who are concerned. I'm not going to waste my time with people who think they know better than I do. In the US, surveys have been done about people's understanding of climate change. They divided the population into Democrats, Republicans and members of the Tea Party. The Tea Party responders said they already had enough information to form their opinion. If you asked them whether they would like to know more, they said that they had all the information they needed...\nWhat is the main message that you would like to transmit to those that are willing to listen? \nI gave my talk the title “The Fierce Urgency of Now,” a phrase coined by Martin Luther King, about the urgent need for civil rights in the 1960s. I believe that in terms of the environmental problems that the world faces, we are under similar pressure and we need to act now. We cannot wait. But the real problems are not scientific or technological - they are political. We are confronted with environmental issues, the way in which the growth of the human population and consumption have impacted various aspects of the earth, ranging from the atmosphere to the realm of snow and ice, all the way to the acidity of the oceans. We have a good understanding of these issues, and we have a number of technological and scientific solutions. But we don't have any people with leadership. Or if they have leadership, they are stymied in the position that they are in.\nYou'd like to see the US take a leadership role in tackling climate change? \nIt has to. First of all, the US is responsible for much of the atmospheric pollution on a global scale, and we have much of the technology that can help resolve the problem. A lot of countries look to the US to lead. Many people say that Barak Obama is the leader of the free world, whatever that means. So he needs to be the leader of the environmental movement too.\nYour presentation is a call for immediate action. How long before we cross a threshold where change becomes irreversible? \nOh, I think we have already crossed a threshold to some extent. The warming that we have built into the system is already going to happen. The EU target of two to three degrees Celsius is happening - it can't be fixed. That means sea levels are going to rise, in a sort of relentless change. We’ve already made these commitments, so now we have to anticipate the changes and adapt. At the same time, we have to do our best to limit further damage.\nOn a political level, should we expect change to come from the government?\nIn the US, it is very much a bottom up movement. Individuals, small towns, and larger communities all have their climate action plans that focus on recycling, saving energy, and so on. Certain states such as Massachusetts and California are leaders in green energy strategies. Others have become leaders in wind energy. Ironically Texas is one of them, because in rural communities farmers can put up windmills and still farm, making money both ways. That bottom up movement will have an impact, because one thing industry hates is a patchwork of regulations. They don't want different states to have different standards. So at some point, the industry will put pressure on the political system requesting a national standard.\nIs that enough to rein in CO2 emissions? \nI'm a technological optimist. Just look at what is happening at EPFL, at the University of Massachusetts and elsewhere. People are working on all sorts of amazing ideas to create cars with a better gas mileage and new ways of generating solar power. I built a house five years ago and put six solar panels on my roof. Each one could generate 180 watts. If I did that today, each panel would generate around 320 watts. That's just in five years. Who knows what will happen in ten years - maybe it will be a kilowatt. The pace of technological change is amazing. In that sense, it is almost unimaginable what our energy picture will look like twenty years from now. It looks bleak now, but we have a lot of possibilities.\nSo you don’t think that it will take a change in consumption behavior? \nNo, I do think that consumption behavior is changing. For example, when you encourage people to have solar panels on their house, you empower them to think about energy use, whereas before, they just flicked a switch. And when people suddenly start making their own electricity, it encourages them to become more conscious about how they use it.\nWhat will it take to persuade people that the climate is changing?\nI think people are beginning to see that the climate is changing. There are consequences that are already pretty devastating. If you look at the Munich RE or Swiss RE reports, they see it in their bottom line - and they are not wild-eyed environmentalists, they’re businessmen. They can see that they have problem that is costing them money, and individuals can see that too. There have been a number of pretty disastrous weather events that I would not ascribe into global warming, but when these things happen frequently in places that haven’t experienced them, the general public is ahead of the scientific community. They’ve already connected the dots. They know, this isn’t right, something is happening. I think that that is how people are persuaded.\nWhat other tools are there to increase public awareness?\nOn an international level, I would say that the availability of mobile phones is a huge opportunity. Here's my thinking. For a long time, people in many countries had no voice. They were choking on pollution, but they had no way of developing a movement. We saw it with the Arab Spring. Suddenly they were able to connect with Facebook and Twitter and other mobile applications. So with six billion cell phones on the planet, people have a voice that they didn't have ten years ago, and that means that they can see not only what is happening in their own communities, but they can connect with other people. That changes everything. I think it’s a revolution.\nSo you are quite optimistic. \nYou've got to be optimistic. We have a lot of problems, but I think there is room for hope. We can't give up, and we have to keep up the pressure. We can't be the generation that screws it all up.", "summary": "Raymond Bradley is a distinguished climatologist who has travelled the globe to study climate and climate change for over four decades.

{"id": 272, "text": "Nowadays it is common for people to buy a book or other product that was recommended to them based on their online profile. But these recommendations, which are powered by past shopping behavior, raise a number of questions about data protection. The potential buyer often faces a dilemma: should I click without knowing exactly what I’m revealing about myself or how this information will be used? Or should I not click and forgo a useful product or service?\nMahsa Taziki, an EPFL researcher, has developed a system that makes this decision easy. Using an algorithm, she can determine in real time the amount of information revealed by clicking to rate an item. “80% of the clicks provide a utility-privacy tradeoff for the users,” she says. “Some clicks are very useful and don't compromise your privacy, while others are just the opposite. My objective is to compute accurately the utility and privacy effects of the user’s clicks. The users can decide what to click on, and the service providers can also use it to improve the experience of their users.”\nA fair trade-off?\nUnlike ad blockers, which are largely indiscriminate, Taziki's algorithm does not affect information or ads that users don’t mind seeing. The algorithm sizes up every potential click, assessing the quantity of data that will be sent, the potential effect on privacy and what the user stands to gain from clicking. The results are presented in a color-coded “click advisor” that the user can use to quickly decide whether or not to go ahead. Thanks to this little guide, users determine whether or not the trade-off is worth it.\nTaziki plans to continue developing her system, which is now patented.

Maurice was a great man who led a very full and inspirational life,” said Martin Vetterli with great sadness. \nIt is thanks to Maurice’s tireless efforts that the school became a federal institute. When he was appointed director of what was then EPUL, he was asked by Vaud State Councillor Pierre Oguey what his strategy would be. His reply left the politician skeptical: “All I can say is that I’ll do everything in my power to turn EPUL into a federal institute.”\nWhen he took over as director of EPUL in 1963, Maurice began realizing his vision of turning the school into a federal institute, much like ETH Zurich. With support from Vaud State Councillor Jean-Pierre Pradervand and Federal Councillor Hans-Peter Tschud, he was the driving force behind the school’s transformation into the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). In 1969 he became the school’s first president, a position he held until 1978.\nBack in May of this year, during an official photo session, Maurice reminisced about the first loan he had to request for the school, in order to build sports facilities. “It wasn’t easy. The politicians didn’t understand why sports facilities took precedence over teaching and research. We had to explain to them that young people needed to stay active. They eventually got it.” There was not even a hint of bragging in his words: he was a very modest, generous and down-to-earth man.\nIt was in 1977, during Maurice’s tenure as president, that EPFL left the city center for its current campus in order to make room for a growing number of departments: mathematics in 1969, materials science in 1974 and microengineering in 1978.\nThroughout his retirement, Maurice Cosandey remained a regular visitor to the campus and always stayed up to date on the latest developments at the school. This past October – just like every year – he attended the Magistrale, the school’s graduation ceremony.\nEPFL sends its sincerest condolences to Maurice’s friends and family.\nA career devoted to science\n Maurice Cosandey’s family was from Sassel, in the northern Vaud region of La Broye, but he was born in Lausanne. He went to the local scientific high school and then studied at Lausanne's polytechnic school, graduating with a degree in civil engineering in 1940. In 1944, he was hired by Zwahlen & Mayr, a metallic construction company, where he worked for 20 years. In 1963, he was appointed president of the Lausanne University Polytechnic School (EPUL), where he had been teaching as a professor of metallic and wood construction for the previous 12 years. Cosandey was the driving force behind the school’s transformation from a cantonal to a federal institute, as EPUL became EPFL on 1 January 1969. Also during his tenure, the campus was moved from the center of Lausanne to its current site in 1977, and several fields of study were added: mathematics (1969), materials science (1974) and microengineering (1978). When Cosandey left EPFL, it was to become the president of the ETH Board, a position he held from 1978 to 1987.", "summary": "Maurice Cosandey, EPFL’s founder and its president from 1963 to 1978, died on Tuesday in his 101st year.

{"id": 275, "text": "Genes in living cells are activated – or not – by proteins called transcription factors. The mechanisms by which these proteins activate certain genes and deactivate others play a fundamental role in many biological processes. However, these mechanisms are extremely complex and scientists have been spending years trying to unlock their secrets.\nScientists usually study gene expression by introducing specific DNA sequences into cells and observing how the cells react. But this labor-intensive method is complicated and can vary from one experiment to the next. In an important step forward, scientists at EPFL’s  (LBNC), headed by Sebastian Maerkl, have developed a quantitative, replicable method for studying and even predicting gene expression. It uses a cell-free system in combination with a high-throughput microfluidic device. Their work allowed them to build a synthetic biological logic gate that could one day be used to modify cellular functions. The research has been published in .\nMicrochannels and cell-free processes \nNadanai Laohakunakorn, a coauthor of the study, explains how the method works: “First we extract material from inside the cells. This ‘cell-free’ system consists of enzymes and chemicals that the cells use to carry out their normal biological processes. Interestingly, we can restart gene expression outside the cell by feeding the extract with fuel and information, in the form of high-energy phosphates and DNA. Because the process closely mimics what happens in living cells, we can use our platform to investigate a range of biological phenomena without having to modify living cells each time.”\nFor their quantitative study of gene expression, the scientists examined thousands of cell-free reactions on a microfluidic chip – that is, a device used to manipulate microscopic quantities of liquid. “We were able to test several different scenarios and build a quantitative library of synthetic transcription factors, which allowed us to predict the influence of a given protein on a gene,” says Zoe Swank, another coauthor of the study. “Our method can be extended to build fairly complicated systems.”\nThe scientists’ method has several advantages. First, cell-free systems can imitate systems within cells, yet they are much simpler, and their mechanisms can be modeled mathematically. This means that they can help contribute to understanding more complex biological phenomena by breaking them down into simpler pieces.\nSecond, cell-free systems are robust and remain stable after freezing (and even freeze-drying), which allows them to be produced on a large scale and deployed in applications from low-cost diagnostics to the on-demand production of biologics – such as vaccines – for personalized medicine. And third, because they are not alive, cell-free systems can be used to produce compounds that go beyond the scope of traditional biomanufacturing methods. And they pose no risk of self-replication or biocontamination outside the laboratory environment.\nA biological logic gate\nAs part of their study, the researchers assembled a number of genes from their library to construct a biological logic gate. In electronics, a logic gate takes an input of electronic signals, performs a computation, and generates a binary output: one or zero. Similarly, the scientists’ biological logic gate takes an input of transcription factors and generates a binary output: the gene is either on (activated) or off (repressed).\n“Numerous logic gates exist naturally within living cells, which use them to regulate normal biological function,” says Laohakunakorn. “By building artificial gates, we gain the ability to introduce new functions into cells for therapeutic purposes, for example. The cell-free system is a first step in this direction, and future work could involve optimizing the design of our transcription factors using the platform, before deploying them directly in a cell-free application, or reintroducing them back into living cells.”", "summary": "EPFL scientists have come up with a systematic method for studying and even predicting gene expression – without using cells.

{"id": 278, "text": "A building’s architecture should be designed to take advantage of the way natural light changes according to the season and time of day. While we can see daylight in a given space, the intensity, spectrum, and angle of sunlight can affect building occupants in ways that are hard to anticipate and that they may not even be aware of. For instance, the composition and intensity of light can sometimes have a calming effect, while other times it can have an alerting affect through the secretion of hormones triggered by the retina. OCULIGHT Dynamics, an upcoming EPFL spin-off, has drawn on the results of research completed at EPFL to quantify these effects and build up unique, in-depth expertise in this area. The company recently applied its know-how to develop a groundbreaking web visualization software that enables architects to predict how daylight will impact building occupants based on three criteria: comfort, in terms of glare avoidance; vitality, in terms of non-visual light exposure over the course of a day; and emotion, in terms of the spatial composition and fluctuations of light.\nSimulating natural light from the occupants’ perspective \nThe process begins with a 3D computer model of a planned building and its geographic position. From there, the architect can specify the ambient weather conditions and see how the resulting daylight would be perceived by building occupants at eye level from a variety of points within the building. Using OCUVIS to compute and visualize the results, an architect can then change settings related to the time of day or year, sky condition, and location in the building and see how the dynamics of sunlight, weather, and space impact occupant well-being across a handful of factors.\nAt each point within the building, a cluster of arrows – each representing a viewpoint direction from a given spot – appear in different colors indicating whether the light at that point is conducive to calm or excitement, if it poses a long-term health risk, or if there is a possibility of visual discomfort. The light at a given point could be vibrant, energetic and auspicious for an occupant’s health if he is looking towards a window, for example, but have the opposite effect if the occupant has his back to the window or if it’s a grey winter day. Architects can use such information to improve their building designs so as to enhance occupants’ visual comfort and well-being. Of course, the ideal daylight design for a given space also depends on how that space will be used by its inhabitants.\nA new type of receptor attuned to circadian rhythms\nThree researchers from EPFL’s Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Performance-Integrated Design (LIPID) teamed up to develop the visualization platform and computational models describing the underlying performance factors – and to set up their new business, OCULIGHT Dynamics. The budding company will offer highly specialized, pioneering consulting services provided by its three founders: Marilyne Andersen, an EPFL professor and head of LIPID; and Siobhan Rockcastle and Maria Amundadottir, who both completed their PhDs at LIPID. Rockcastle has since become a tenure-track professor in the US at the University of Oregon, while Amundadottir works as a research engineer in Iceland.\nThe models used to quantify the characteristics assessed by their software have been published in numerous journal articles and two dissertations. One journal paper described how humans perceive different lighting environments; the findings of this study were used “to determine what percentage of people would consider a given environment calm or exciting based on the lighting composition,” says Rockcastle. The responses of subjects participating in that study were used to develop an algorithm that is used as prediction model for the OCUVIS software.\nLight’s non-visual characteristics – still little-known by most people – has been found to have a measurable effect on many aspects of our health. “It wasn’t too long ago that scientists discovered a new type of photoreceptor, called ipRGCs, in the human eye. These receptors regulate our internal clock to the external light dark cycle and respond directly to bright light, impacting alertness and wellbeing,” says Amundadottir. Research has shown that characteristics having the greatest impact on our non-visual system include the intensity of light, the timing of exposure, and its spectral distribution (e.g., color, blue light is the most effective).\nThe three EPFL researchers obtained a Venture Grant from the InnoSeed ENAC program that together provided funding for the key development steps of their visualization software, which is already online. These steps included creating features that let architects interactively visualize the performance of light on human well-being in a given space, compare different design options and performance measures, and evaluate their designs against applicable lighting standards. More generally, it lets architects incorporate well-being-related factors like occupant health, comfort and emotion alongside conventional evaluation criteria.", "summary": "OCUVIS, a visualization software developed by a soon-to-be-launched EPFL spin-off, lets architects simulate 3D building models to assess the performance of natural light indoors.

{"id": 281, "text": "Perovskites are materials of immense interest in solar energy technology lately, as they promise to bring down the cost of solar cells to very low levels. Their efficiency heavily depends on our ability to control their deposition into films, but the factors that influence the synthesis of perovskites are not well understood. EPFL scientists have now shown that, in the two most common methods used today, light can greatly accelerate the formation of perovskite films and control the morphology of their crystals, thus influencing the efficiency of the resulting solar cell. The breakthrough study is .\nThe research was carried out by the lab of . Grätzel is world-renowned for inventing the first dye-sensitized solar cells (Grätzel cells) that revolutionized solar-energy science.\nIn this paper, PhD student Amita Ummadisingu and her colleagues at Grätzel’s lab used confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to examine how direct light affects the crystal formation when depositing perovskites in layers, as is usually done to build a solar cell. The goal is to ensure homogeneity across the perovskite film, as this is linked to superior photovoltaic performance.\nSo far, efforts have been focused on improving perovskite solar-cell efficiency by optimizing their architecture and the fabrication processes. But fundamental aspects of perovskite formation, such as the mechanism or the factors controlling the reaction are poorly understood, which results in batch-to-batch inconsistencies in performance. \nHowever, understanding the light effect can help reproducibility and scaling-up of perovskite photovoltaics to commercial production. Because of this, the EPFL scientists studied the effect of light on the two most common methods used today for perovskite film deposition. \nThe first method is called “sequential deposition”, and it involves depositing lead iodide onto a titanium dioxide scaffold, and then dipping them together in a methylammonium iodide solution to make the final methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. The second approach is the “anti-solvent method”. Here, a perovskite precursor solution is coated uniformly onto a spinning flat base to create a thin layer. An anti-solvent is then dripped on it and, finally, the whole sample is heated to form the perovskite.\nUsing both the microscopy techniques during the sequential deposition method, the scientists found that when light is present, it significantly accelerates the overall formation of the perovskite. The effect is enhanced when light intensity is increased to solar levels.\nThe morphological differences in the film are not the result of heating from the light; rather they are the product of a quantum effect: the lead iodide film crystallizes as the first step in perovskite formation, and it forms surface traps. These traps capture photo-generated holes, which lowers the surface tension. As a result, more lead iodide crystals grow in the film, ultimately producing more perovskite crystals.\nOn the other hand, the researchers found that the anti-solvent method actually benefits more from the absence of light, and it gives best results in the dark.\nThe study shows that controlling the light present during fabrication can help achieve the best performance from perovskite solar cells. “Surprisingly and strikingly we find that light strongly affects the rate of formation and the morphology of perovskites in conventional methods used where no light effects have been remarked before,” says Michael Grätzel.\n“Light is a major factor in the main deposition methods and for many perovskite compositions,” adds Amita Ummadisingu. “So awareness and control of the light effect is crucial when fabricating state-of-the-art perovskite devices, and should always be considered when preparing perovskite films for opto-electronic applications such as solar cells, LEDs, etc.”\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).\nReference\nAmita Ummadisingu, Ludmilla Steier, Ji-Youn Seo, Taisuke Matsui, Antonio Abate, Wolfgang Tress, Michael Grätzel. \nThe effect of illumination on the formation of metal halide perovskite films.\nNature\n 26 April 2017.

Therefore by continuously monitoring these biomarker concentrations on our skin’s surface, doctors can spot such turns for the worse and act immediately, preventing complications and saving lives. That’s the idea behind the latest development work being done at Xsensio, which has just been granted CHF 1.8 million by the European Innovation Council (EIC) to adapt its Lab-on-Skin™ technology so that it will detect biomarkers specific to viral inflammations.

The results are now available in Vol. 44, No. 3 of \nGeophysical Research Letters\n.\nDescriptions of wind or water transport already exist, but this is the first time that fundamental laws – Newton’s second law and energy conservation – are used to describe how particles are ejected from a bed of particles.\n“It is a milestone since it is astonishing that the particle ejection process has never been described thus far by using the fundamental conservation laws,” says Lehning, “at least not for a wide range of sediments from heterogeneous sand to snow.”\nThe new theory is powerful enough so that they can statistically predict the number of particles ejected from the surface of the particle bed and lifted into the flow, even for varying particle sizes and varying material or flow properties.\nThe theory can be seen as a generalization of how billiard balls are scattered by the white ball during that first hit. But in many ways, the billiard table is a trivial case compared to beds of particles in nature. Instead of having a bed of only 15 billiard balls, the model can handle large numbers of particles and therefore be applied to vast areas on Earth or other planets. Instead of having only one white ball, there can be many incident particles. Instead of having billiard balls all of the same shape and size, the particles can be a mix of shapes and sizes like what we see in a handful of sand or snow. Instead of billiard balls that neither attract nor repulse each other, the particles can be sticky due to cohesive forces, like wet sand or humid snow.\nThe scientists believe that their new model will advance the study of dune and ripple development, both in arid and polar regions. It will also contribute to improve predictions of dust emissions from deserts and snow transport in Antarctica, whose effects extend from global health to weather and climate change.

{"id": 297, "text": "Imagine taking pictures of thousands of snowflakes from three different angles with a specialized instrument installed at an altitude of 2,500 meters. Then imagine using 3,500 of these pictures to manually train an algorithm to recognize six different classes of snowflakes. And, finally, imagine using this algorithm to classify the snowflakes in the millions of remaining pictures into those six classes at breakneck speed. That’s exactly what researchers at EPFL’s Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (LTE) did, in a project spearheaded by Alexis Berne. Their pioneering approach was featured in the latest issue of \nAtmospheric Measurement Techniques\n.\n“The scientific community has been trying to improve precipitation measurement and forecast for over 50 years. We now have a pretty good understanding of the mechanisms involved in rain,” says Berne. “But snow is a lot more complicated. Many factors – like the shape, geometry and electromagnetic properties of individual snowflakes – affect how snow crystals reflect signals back to weather radars, making our task much harder. And we still don’t have a good grasp of the equivalent liquid water content of snowflakes. Our goal with this study was to better understand exactly what’s falling when it snows, so that we can eventually improve snowfall forecast at high altitudes.” Berne also sees other applications for the team’s findings, like a more accurate estimation of water equivalent stored in the snowpack for irrigation and hydropower.\nIdentifying snowflakes and their degree of riming\nTo reach their goal, the researchers acquired a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC, image 1) – a sophisticated instrument composed by three synchronized cameras that simultaneously take high resolution (up to 35-micron) pictures of snowflakes as they pass through a metallic ring.\nIn collaboration with the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss and the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, they installed the MASC at a site near Davos, at an altitude of 2,500 meters, where it took pictures for an entire winter and at a site in coastal Antarctica, where it took pictures for an entire austral summer. They then ran their algorithm to classify the snowflake images into six main classes based on existing classification: planar crystals, columnar crystals, graupels, aggregates, combination of column and planar crystals, and small particles (image 2).\nImage 1.

The six families of snowflakes used by the researchers © LTE/EPFL \nThe researchers used the pictures taken by the MASC to also determine the degree of riming of each snowflake based on its surface roughness (image 3). “Snowflakes change shape as they fall down the atmosphere – especially through clouds,” says Berne. “Some of them gather frost and become more or less rimed snow crystals [#3-5 in the image], while others remain pristin and have a very low riming index [#1-2 in the image].” Riming is important because it is the process that turns cloud water droplets into precipitation in the form of ice – in other words, snow.\nImage 3. Snowflakes with increasing degrees of riming from left to right © LTE/EPFL\nComparing Alpine and Antarctic snowflakes\nThe next step was to compare the results obtained from the pictures taken near Davos in the Swiss Alps with those taken in Adélie Land on the coast of Antarctica. That revealed significant differences in how often every snowflake family appeared. Most of the snowflakes in the Alps are aggregates (49%), followed by small particles and graupels. However, in Antarctica, the majority were small particles (54%), followed by aggregates and graupels.\nAccording to Berne, these differences can be explained. “The fierce Antarctic winds continually erode the snowpack and result in the formation of tiny snow particles. What’s more, Antarctic snowflakes have much less riming than Alpine snowflakes because the Antarctic air is a lot drier.” Another of the researchers’ findings that will perhaps disappoint purists is that the ‘stellar dendrite’ type of snowflake – the one we typically associate with the ‘ideal’ snowflake – turned out to be rare at both sites, making up only 10% of snowflakes in the Alps and 5% of snowflakes in Antarctica.\nMulti-instrumental approach To tackle the complexity of the multiple processes involved, scientists usually rely on several different instruments when making meteorological measurements and weather forecasts. The results obtained by Berne’s team will therefore provide even more insights when combined with other instruments, such as weather radars, which collect data on clouds and precipitation across all layers of the atmosphere.\nAs part of the international Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), MeteoSwiss set up a rain gauge next to the MASC at the Davos site. The data have not been yet fully analyzed, but by comparing the type of snowflakes photographed by the MASC with the amount of water collected over a given period, the team will be able to test various hypotheses on snowflake liquid water content, which remains an enigma for atmospheric scientists.\nA measurement campaign during the 2018 Winter Olympics\n To bolster their findings, Berne’s team needs to gather more data. They sent their MASC back to Antarctica for another data-collecting round this year; it will then head to the mountains of South Korea in 2018 for the Winter Olympics which will take place in Pyeongchang. “The more data we have, the more reliable our calculations will be,” says Berne.\nThis research project combines fundamental and applied research. It involves three scientists: Alexis Berne and Christophe Praz from EPFL’s Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory and Yves-Alain Roulet from MeteoSwiss (the Swiss Federal Meteorology and Climatology Office). MétéoSuisse has been working with EPFL for several years to improve its precipitation estimates and its numerical weather prediction model.\nReference", "summary": "Using a special multi-angle camera, EPFL researchers have gained important insights into the structure of snowflakes.

{"id": 299, "text": "Sunday, it was the grand departure for the 91 sailors taking part in the famous Route du Rhum. Swiss skipper Alan Roura is among them, taking up the challenge of this solo crossing from Brittany to Guadeloupe. Aboard his boat Exocet, a new device developed by an EPFL start-up gives him precise and real time information on his performance.\n“For example, if the device indicates 80%, I know that by pulling a little on the sails or varying the angle of the wind, I could go faster. The goal is to get close to 100%, a number that represents the maximum speed that I have achieved with the boat under the same meteorological conditions,” said the skipper when visiting Switzerland between two phases of training in Lorient, France. The system takes into account the strength of the wind, GPS data, the speed of the water flow and its direction, using a magnetic compass, and relates them to the boat’s speed. “It’s very easy to use,” says Roura, who used it during his preparation. “You turn it on, and it works.”\nThe instrument is small enough to fit in a 10-centimeter cube. It draws on GPS and environmental data specific to the boat. The device goes beyond simply determining how fast the boat is going: it compares the boat’s speed to historical data. Algorithms developed by Anemomind at EPFL automatically calculate, in real time, the boat’s speed as a percentage of the highest speed previously achieved under the same conditions. The calculations are made using data recorded during training sessions and previous races.\nSupport systems for optimizing navigation are currently reserved for advanced boats. The information is based on a theoretical calculation carried out by a dedicated team based on the technical characteristics of the vessel. “Our system is fully automated. It takes into account the human factor, and the parameters are constantly updated according to the evolution of the skippers and the boat,” said Julien Pilet, creator of Anemomind.\n“And when I explained to Alan during our first meeting that, in addition to helping the performance, the device corrects the data of onboard instruments automatically, I saw the smile on his face widen.” The daily observation of the proper functioning of each device on one or more benchmarks thus becomes useless. This marks a welcome gain in time, especially for a solo race which lasts several weeks.\nAnalyzing performance after the race \nClearly of use while navigating, this unit is equally helpful afterward for analyzing performance. The Anemomind system provides access to data via a specific and intuitive interface currently in development. Trajectories, instrument settings, speed – all data are visually represented. Zooming in on a specific segment of the race immediately shows performance at time T.\n“The web platform makes it a social tool as well,” explains Julien Pilet, who is a sailor since over 20 years. “After the races, navigators like to comment and analyze their performance. Our device allows overlapping trajectories, making it possible to compare decisions made while sailing and even share ‘exploits’ on social networks.”\nAn initial version of this device was developed already in 2007 by this sailing enthusiast and serial entrepreneur. But it was at the end of 2013 that the idea behind the start-up took off thanks to the support of EPFL. Currently, it is being tested on three boats. But Alan Roura still has a number of developments in mind for it. For example, by making it proactive, it could give advice on how to achieve maximum performance. A former PhD student at the Computer Vision Laboratory at EPFL, he would like to see his system perfected by incorporating technologies he contributed to while working on Alinghi and the Hydroptère.", "summary": "Can this boat go any faster?

{"id": 301, "text": "Glancing at one’s daily consumption of energy would lead to usage that is more reasonable and less greedy. Such a challenge gave birth to eSMART. This EPFL spin-off is in the process of installing its system of smart plugs in 450 apartments in the Eikenøtt neighborhood, developed by Losinger-Marazzi in Gland. Interconnected plugs transmit their data to software that displays real-time expenditures of water, heat, and electricity on a touch screen. An indicator turns red when consumption is abnormally high. The display responds as soon as a unit is turned off.\nWhat is the secret to this new energy management system? It is a small module that fits behind the outlets and enables them to communicate with each other through the power grid. “Other systems exist,” says Laurent Fabre, co-founder of the start-up, “but this technology from the Electronics Lab at EPFL has the advantage of ensuring implementation that is both simple and fast, all without creating additional electromagnetic waves.” If one of the modules were to stop working, the others would continue to function undisturbed.\nA Fun and Easy System \nWith the flick of a finger, the user can see consumption of hot water, heating, electricity, as well as overall expenditures of energy or water. Each selection can be viewed by day, week, or month. It is also possible to compare to the average consumption per capita of the district, the Swiss average, or even one’s own consumption from the previous week… This equals plenty of ways to become mindful of the use of resources. The device even announces the provisional amount of the monthly bill in pursuit of meeting a household-specific spending target. Fun to use, it offers several other attractive features that integrate its use into everyday life. The news, local events, bus timetables, weather, an intercom, and even customizable virtual post-it notes are integrated into the system.\nIn the Concept of the Eco-Neighborhood\nIntelligent energy management fits into the overall concept and trend of the eco-quarter. The term refers to housing that tries to balance, as much as possible, various environmental issues, with the goal of reducing a building’s impact on nature by controlling energy consumption, managing movement, and promoting social diversity. Construction materials and sites are closely monitored to minimize the impact on the environment.\nAs noted by Stéphane Montfort, project leader for Losinger-Marazzi, “the eSmart outlets are integrated into a broad concept and are intended to prove their effictiveness in the long term.” Training sessions and discussions with residents will be organized to follow the impact of the eSmart system on the energy behaviors of individuals. “If each person in Switzerland reduced energy usage by 15 to 20 percent, that would amount to an annual savings equal to the production of a nuclear facility such as Müleberg,” said Fabrizio Lo Conte.\nAn Extension of the Home Automation System\nA consumer version of the eSmart outlet system is about to be placed on the market. The interface can be accessed remotely from any media connected to the Internet. In the short term, the system will also integrate home automation functions. Each user can check power consumption, turn a lamp on or off, control blinds and remote devices, and even decide to dim the lights in certain rooms. In cases of the failure of one of the appliances, such as a fridge or heater, the user is notified via SMS.", "summary": "Residents of a new eco-development on the coast can better control and understand their energy usage, thanks to a system that allows outlets to communicate with each other through the power grid.", "claim": "Residents of a new eco-development on the coast can better control and understand your energy usage, thanks to a system that allows outlets to communicate with each other through the power grid.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [15, 15], "noise": false}

{"id": 306, "text": "Glucose is essential for the production of energy in our bodies, and its level in the blood must be maintained carefully, especially in sensitive organs like the brain. In our cells, glucose is stored in a molecule called glycogen. But despite the importance of glycogen in disorders like diabetes and hypoglycemia, its distribution and metabolism in the body has remained elusive. Using a novel imaging technology called NanoSIMS – previously used for example on meteorite samples – scientists at EPFL have been able to trace how glycogen is used in cells of the liver and the brain. Their work is being published in \nNanomedicine\n.\nUnderstanding how cells store, distribute and metabolize glycogen is central to the treatment of associated disorders like diabetes and hypoglycemia, both of which are characterized by a decreased breakdown of glycogen, resulting in less glucose being released in the blood and subsequent energy loss. Glycogen depletion also causes a common phenomenon called “hitting the wall” in long-distance athletes like marathon runners, cross-country skiers, and cyclists.\nDespite being of central importance to the proper function of our bodies, the distribution of glycogen over time is still unclear. One of the reasons is that the usual imaging technique used to trace it, magnetic resonance imaging or MRI, does not have the necessary sensitivity to achieve the required spatial resolution to image glycogen inside individual cells.\nLed by Arnaud Comment and Anders Meibom at EPFL, in a collaboration that includes colleagues from EPFL and UNIL, the scientists have used a new imaging technology to successfully trace the evolution of glycogen in the liver and brain of mice over time. NanoSIMS (SIMS stands for Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) is an ion microprobe that bombards a solid sample with a beam of “heavy” particles, such as cesium atoms. The bombardment forces ions from the sample to be ejected, and they are then identified with a mass spectrometer. The readout from individual ions is then used to identify the chemical components of the sample.\nNanoSIMS can exceed the resolution of conventional MRI systems, as it can scan a sample with ultra-high spatial resolution of 100 nanometers (about a 1/100 of a cell’s length). This means that NanoSIMS can track molecules inside a cell, something that Comment and his colleagues took advantage of. “The question was, can we actually detect where glucose is transformed into glycogen?” says Comment. “So one of our goals was to see how glycogen is distributed over time in liver cells and in the brain, and also to determine the rate at which glucose is incorporated into glycogen in these cells.”\nThe researchers used NanoSIMS on liver and brain tissue samples, which had previously been enriched with a type of glucose that can be traced in imaging. However, NanoSIMs images appear as colors and lines, and are not sufficient to localize molecules in a cell. For this reason, the samples were also photographed with an electron microscope, which provided an actual image of the tissue and cells. The team then superimposed the NanoSIMS image over the real photograph from the electron microscope, and could then obtain a complete picture of glycogen distribution in liver and brain cells.\nUsing this method at different time intervals, the researchers were able to track the how glycogen is formed over time, and in which parts of the cells. Their findings showed that liver cells store glucose into glycogen almost 25 times faster than brain cells (astrocytes). “This is the first time that this phenomenon is measured at such a small scale,” says Comment.\nThe method can be used for tracking other biological molecules, such as neurotransmitters in the brain. This is something that Comment’s team is planning to do next, aiming to use their novel approach to achieve high-resolution imaging of how signaling molecules are distributed and metabolized in different parts of the brain. The team is also working on improving the precision and accuracy of detection by combining it with fluorescence imaging.\nThis work represents a collaboration between EPFL (including SB, ENAC, and SV) and UNIL's Institute of Earth Sciences. \nReference\nTakado Y, Knott G, Humbel BM, Escrig S, Masoodi M, Meibom A, Comment A. \nImaging liver and brain glycogen metabolism at the nanometer scale.\nNanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine\n DOI: 10.1016/j.nano.2014.09.007", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have used a new imaging technique to monitor how glucose, our main energy source, is used in the body.

It provides bike repair services, sells new bikes and equipment, buys and sells used bikes, and offers free classes on bike mechanics. People can also go there to wash and even fix their own bikes.\nThe Bike Center’s new home is a simple and functional structure that came out of the “Sustainable is Beautiful\" architecture competition run by Professor Emmanuel Rey, the director of the Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST). Micael Lopes and Antoine Vauthey’s winning design, which beat some thirty other entries, was then developed under the guidance of the LAST with support from EPFL's Real Estate and Infrastructures Department. The new Bike Center was built by a local carpentry firm using Swiss-certified wood sourced exclusively in forests close to EPFL in the cantons of Vaud and Fribourg. Funding was provided by the Students Foundation (FEE), the Mobility Fund, and the Real Estate and Infrastructures Department.\nHuman-powered mobility on the rise\nEPFL, in conjunction with the municipal and cantonal authorities, has put in place a number of measures to encourage human-powered mobility – including cycling – as part of an effort to ensure long-term and eco-friendly access to the campus. The annual mobility study, which was first run in 2003, shows that the number of EPFL students and staff members riding their bikes to campus has risen over the past 15 years. The proportion of respondents who commute by bike rose by 8 percentage points to 24% in 2017, while the number of people driving fell by 12 percentage points to 18%. There are now more bikes than cars on the EPFL campus, and more bike parking spaces than car parking spaces as well.\nThis change is the result of a focused effort to encourage human-powered and shared transports and to discourage the use of individual motor vehicles. The various strategies and action plans were bolstered by the establishment in 2016 of EPFL’s Mobility Fund, which has been funded by the increase in parking fees, and the creation of the permanent position of sustainable mobility manager.\nThe new Bike Center represents an important step forward in the area of sustainability at a time when EPFL is aiming to become the first university campus in Switzerland to be carbon neutral by 2020.

{"id": 317, "text": "In summer 2011, two Russian submersibles explored the depths of Lake Geneva as part of the scientific observation program elemo. Preliminary results are just now coming in. At the same time, EPFL and Ferring Pharmaceuticals, sponsor of the elemo program, are announcing a new installment of the exploration. This time, the scientists will make their observations from the air. Starting in late November, they’ll fly aboard ultralight planes to measure phenomena occurring at the interface between the air and water. Federal authorities have given their authorization for the flights. This scientific mission will be repeated over Lake Baikal in Russia.\nOn board the submersibles: preliminary results\nThe elemo program has already delivered preliminary results that have been extremely useful for assessing the health of the lake and for better protecting its ecosytem. Research is currently being done on pollution, the flow dynamics of currents, the bacterial fauna in the lake and the geology of the lake bottom.\nSeveral scientific teams have already begun to publish research results; articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals should start to appear in the coming months and years. Data gathered from the MIR submersibles has enabled scientists to demonstrate a correlation between the presence of certain bacteria and heavy metals. They were also able to precisely measure how micropollutants – primarily pesticides or pharmaceuticals – spread throughout Lake Geneva from water treatment station outlets. (See press kit.)\nElemo takes to the air\nOn board their two ultralights, scientists from EPFL, Eawag and CEA (France) will study phenomena occurring near the surface of the lake, as well as the influence of air currents on the lake. Test flights will take place above the Lausanne and Nyon regions between November 26 and December 5, to test and calibrate the sensors. The official research campaign will begin in May 2013.\nThe scientists will use a “hyper-spectral” camera, a tool that allows them to decompose the light spectrum into hundreds of separate colors. From this, they can obtain an global image of certain elements close to the surface of the lake, such as bacteria, sediments, and dissolved gases. This kind of analysis is already done by satellites, but technical limitations (they can only separate a few parts of the light spectrum) and distance make many kinds of observations impossible.\nAt the same spot where the camera is pointed, a catamaran will simultaneously take water samples. By comparing the data taken from the air and from the water, the scientists hope to be able to develop new and better methods for analyzing the currents and the overall health of the lake.\nFor Michel Pettigrew, President of the Executive Board and Chief Operating Officer de Ferring Pharmaceuticals, a continuation of the company’s support of the program was self-evident. “Ferring has a keen interest in science and the environment and is especially committed to the Lake Geneva region. As a member of the local community, we are particularly proud to support the elemo project, which brings the best international scientific teams together with the objective of advancing our understanding the dynamics of Lake Geneva.”\nAs in the 2011 exploratory campaign on board the MIR submersibles, this extension of the elemo program will also continue in Russia, above the waters of Lake Baïkal – the world’s deepest lake – under the name “Project Léman-Baïkal.” By comparing results obtained in Switzerland and Russia, the scientists will be able to consolidate their knowledge and the methods they use to study lake environments.\n ---\n----\nPress kit\nElemo 2011 – some preliminary results from the MIR submersible campaign\nScientists on board MIR submersibles collected a huge amount of data on Lake Geneva, enough to keep their laboratories busy for many years to come. As we wait for the first scientific articles to be published, here is a brief overview of some preliminary results.\nAnalyzing pollution and micro-organisms\nTracing the path of pollutants and detecting them more easily\nPresent in tiny amounts in the waters of the lake, micropollutants still manage to evade most modern filtration systems. Tamar Kohn and her EPFL team have gotten a better understanding of substances emitted by the Vidy water streatment station, and how these pollutants spread through the lake. They observed significant evidence of pesticides and pharmaceuticals near the outlet of the water treatment station. They were also able to determine the presence of micropollutants by making simple measurements of the electrical conductivity of the water. This method could prove to be a simpler and more direct way of monitoring water quality.\nResistant bacteria point to pollution\nScientists from the University of Neuchâtel’s Microbiology Laboratory studied the impact of pollution, primarily heavy metals, on bacterial populations in the lake. Led by Pilar Junier, the research team concentrated on bacteria that form endospores, a dormant state that enables them to survive in a polluted area. The endospores make these bacteria excellent biological markers. Initial results indicate a correlation between the presence of endospores and heavy metal concentrations. New analyses should give further precision to this observation. This research also provides a better picture of which species survive best and will thus recolonize areas once the pollution disappears, and what to do to restore a healthy balance.\nBacteria play a role in depositing heavy metals on the lake bottom\nAssessing the ecological consequences of trace metal emissions in aquatic environments is very difficult. They are persistent; they don’t degrade over time and aren’t destroyed by human or biological processes. Once they have been introduced into aquatic ecosystems, they become involved in a number of chemical processes that are still not well understood. They take a number of different chemical forms. Mary-Lou Tercier-Waeber and Matthieu Masson from the University of Geneva’s CHIAM department took sediment samples from depths between 30m and 80m in the well-defined geographical zone of the Vidy bay, which is affected by micropollutants discharged by the Vidy water treatment station. The scientists observed that the concentrations of metals at the interface between the water and the bottom of the sediment is not correlated with the distance from the outlet of the treatment station, but rather to the bio-geochemical characteristics of the sediment. The highest concentrations were found in zones in which bacteria had colonized the sediment.\nGeology and environmental history\nConstantly changing canyons\nAs the Rhone river flows into the waters of Lake Geneva, it carves out incredible underwater structures. These so-called “canyons,” some of which are 100m deeper than the lake bottom, were extensively analyzed by the MIR submersibles. Research by University of Geneva and Eawag scientists Stéphanie Girardclos and Flavio Anselmetti has already shown that the canyons are constantly in the process of changing in response to geological and climatic events. In particular, a thick layer of sediment observed at the outlet of the main canyon is evidence of a recent underwater landslide, probably following a major flooding event in the Rhone river in 2000.\nCharacterizing the lakebed\nPillows, wavelets and plains; trenches, mattresses and depressions: for fifty years already, the landscapes on the bottom of Lake Geneva have been classified into these six categories. Nicolas Le Dantec, Yosef Akhtman, Ulrich Lemmin and D. Andrew Barry, scientists from EPFL’s Ecological Engineering and Topometry Laboratories, have refined these definitions as part of the elemo campaign. Cameras on board the MIR submersibles revealed intermediate variants. In addition, the large scope of the observations has made it possible to map the distribution of the various morphology types. These depend in part on the slope of the lakebed, and possibly also on other parameters such as the activity of certain fish and bacteria.\nBacteria tell a tale\nThe chemical and biological composition of the soil in a given ecosystem reveals much about its history. Starting from this principle, Pilar Junier and her team from the University of Neuchâtel’s Microbiology Laboratory conducted a study to explore Lake Geneva’s past. They painstakingly analyzed the genetic material in sediment samples taken from the Rhone delta. They specifically observed the evolution of the number and nature of bacteria that form endospores. These organisms can go into a dormant stage if environmental conditions are unfavorable. They thus make very interesting markers, because variations in their concentration and state at different depths reflect changes in the chemical or microbiological equilibrium that occurred over time.\nGeotechnical properties of lake sediments\nA team from EPFL and the University of Bremen looked at the geotechnical properties of the sediments on the bottom of Lake Geneva. Using Nimrod, a “dynamic penetrometer,” they developed a precise map of sediment transport in the lakebed at the Rhone delta and the Vidy bay. This device, piloted from inside the submersible, is a free-falling cylinder with pressure sensors on the bottom. These sensors measure the soil resistance along a vertical profile as the device penetrates the sediment. The team mapped the points measured and have already been able to observe that the sediment resistance is higher at the mouth of the Rhone and its channel into the lake than in other areas.\nMethane flows from the depths to the atmosphere\nMethane is a greenhouse gas produced by the fermentation of organic material. It has a larger impact on global warming than CO2. In lakes, methane is formed by bacterial fermentation in the sediment on the lake bottom, and when the soil on the lakebed can no longer resist the pressure of the gas, methane bubbles suddenly rise through the water and into the atmosphere. Preliminary studies have shown large methane emissions in the Rhone delta. During the elemo campaign’s underwater expeditions, researchers from EPFL, Eawag, ETH Zurich and other Swiss, German and Canadian universities probed the canyons of Lake Geneva, collecting sediment cores and water samples from the depths in order to determine the quantity of methane being produced on the lakebed and the amount that escapes into the atmosphere. Preliminary results show that methane emissions vary depending on the lakebed topography and the amount of sediment transported into the canyons by tributaries.", "summary": "One year after the MIR submersibles dove into the depths of Lake Geneva, the elemo program is delivering its first scientific results.

{"id": 319, "text": "Online discussions offer an extraordinary windfall of information. They are free and open to scientists studying ever more precise data. Extracting keywords from tweets, it is possible to reconstruct a particular event. On this basis, the team of Human Computer Interaction Group has decided to use the upcoming Winter Olympics to test emotion recognition software. What are the strongest emotions, and how do they evolve during the competition? Which athletes do the Internet users prefer?\nTo achieve this performance in real time, researchers have developed an application, called EmotionWatch, that displays the various emotions in the form of a colored pie chart. This virtual watch displays the strongest trends on the computer screen, and the disk then changes color depending on the intensity of emotion. Each of the 20 feelings considered has its own color – yellow for joy, red for anger, and blue for worry.\nA student project launches the concept\nIt all began with a semester project. The laboratory sought to use and develop the considerable windfall of conversations exchanged on the web at the Olympics in 2012. Student Renato Kempter was interested in human interactions on the Internet. During three months the young researcher and two PhD students set out to decrypt and codify some 50 million tweets posted at the London Olympics. “What was interesting is that we could perfectly follow the event just by reading the tweets. The reaction times were incredibly fast. People described their pride, their sadness .... There was even a scandal with badminton, and it was plain to see in the tweets.”\nEmotionWatch \nTo understand and classify the opinions of Internet users, Renato Kempter had to imagine how to interpret and represent them. “I relied on a wheel of emotions designed by psychology students at the University of Geneva.” Based on this work, the young researcher then enhanced this tool by adding an extra visual element: color. He developed a disk surrounded by 20 colored dots, each representing a particular emotion. Through keywords detected in the conversations, the software dispatches emotions and displays the color of the most intense feeling. “It became increasingly complex because I had to also consider the factor of time and the frequency of tweets.”\nThe language of Twitter and Chinese emoticons \nAlongside the development of the software, the researchers extracted the most significant words found in the sports vocabulary. They created a lexicon of 20 emotions and associated positive and negative values. Pearl Pu Faltings, who heads the project, also focused on exchanges conducted on Sina.com – China's Twitter. Computer scientists have thus added an additional challenge to deciphering opinions: “The Chinese love to punctuate their messages with emoticons. They use more than 70. We had to choose 20 which we associated with an emotion related to words already included in our software, such as pride, joy, sadness or disappointment.”\nThe challenge: capture live tweets \nUndoubtedly the major challenge will be the capture and storage of all these messages with the underlying fear of a crash, because with such an operation, there is no second chance. In the meantime, the accuracy of the software has been improved. It must be able to sort the tweets by keywords to recognize all sports. “The application must be more than just attractive or fun. For us scientists, it is important that our system is operational in other competitions and reliable in the recognition of Twitter vocabulary,” says Pearl Pu Faltings.\nPhD student Valentina Sintsova focuses on refining the data: “The program was designed to recognize English and Chinese emoticons, and now it must also accept the contractions and the specific vocabulary used on Twitter such as ‘love u’ or ‘4 you,’ etc., and even be able to separate emotions vis-à-vis two players in a game of tennis, for example.”\nAfter the live test at the Olympic Games in Sochi, the application could be used for commercial purposes or marketed to see consumers’ reactions to a new product, or those of voters during the presentation of candidates in a political election.\nTo follow emotion in tweets:", "summary": "EPFL researchers will track emotions of the viewing public during the Olympic Games in Sochi.

{"id": 320, "text": "Four teams of students from EPFL, ECAL and UNIL took part in the third  (CHIC), where they turned their bright ideas into functional prototypes. They met up one day a week for an entire year in order to pool their engineering, design and project-management know-how and develop blueprints for innovative devices. They then spent two weeks in Hong Kong and Shenzhen building the prototypes. Their inventions ranged from a connected watch for autistic children to a probe for measuring water levels – a sign of the participants’ strong social involvement. “By working with organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) to develop the prototypes, students got first-hand exposure to ethical issues,” says Marc Laperrouza, head of the CHIC program.\nConnected objects to solve concrete problems\nOne team developed the Livelo connected probe, for example, which can be used to measure underground water levels, meeting a genuine need. “One out of every ten people on the planet doesn’t have access to drinking water. Remedying that will require effective management of underground water reserves – but existing probes are too expensive,” says a student on the Livelo project team. The team worked with the ICRC to design a system that is five times cheaper; now the ICRC will test the device out in the field. Another team addressed the issue of children’s health, with a connected helmet that contains sensors to measure the amount of UV-ray exposure the child is getting, sending an alert to the parents if a safe limit is exceeded. The helmet works in conjunction with an app allowing parents to record their child’s skin type and receive a notification if the child takes off the helmet.\nA third team aimed to make life easier for autistic children and their parents. “When doing our research, we noticed that pictograms are often used to help these children in their daily tasks. So we devised a connected watch that displays images of the tasks they need to carry out and the time they have to do them,” says a student on the project team. Parents can program and manage the displayed images and times from an app on their smartphones. The fourth team came up with a system for making compost at home – without the unpleasant odor and other hassles of typical compost containers. The system also lets users track the compost production cycle. Through all these projects – whether they involved studying the way compost is made, understanding the specific needs of disabled children or meeting strict engineering requirements – the students had a unique opportunity to expand their horizons and acquire new skills.\nCultivating individuals’ ideas within a cross-disciplinary team\n“These cross-disciplinary projects exposed students to real-world constraints. They had to find a focus for their research that was both interesting and relevant to their studies, while respecting the needs of other team members,” says EPFL professor Denis Gillet, one of the students’ supervisors. This teamwork wasn’t always easy, but the students clearly enjoyed it. Now they’ll serve as mentors for the next lot of participants.

{"id": 321, "text": "“It was a risk to try living in my own architecture. But it turned out to be magnificent.” Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier, penned these words in a letter to his mother on 29 April 1934. The celebrated architect had just moved into the top floor of a building that he had designed at 24 Rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris, near the Bois de Boulogne park. This quote also opens one of the chapters of an EPFL book written about that apartment, which, from 1934 to 1965, served as Le Corbusier's painting studio and architecture lab.\nThe book’s authors, Giulia Marino and Franz Graf, are researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM). They were commissioned by the Fondation Le Corbusier, with funding from a Keeping it Modern Grant from the Getty Foundation, to come up with a list of guidelines for fully restoring this unique site so that it can be opened to the public. As part of their work, they had access to previously untapped sources of information, which they publish and cite in their book: these sources include photos, letters and first-hand accounts provided by people who were close to the architect.\nLe Corbusier tested out his architectural ideas in his apartment. As a result, it played host to a combination of styles dating from 1930 to the 1960s and ranging from a ‘purist’ interior to a ‘brutalist’ feel – Le Corbusier was constantly changing the apartment’s interior and trying out different materials as he experimented with architecture. So what should be considered the core period? What should be preserved? What can be done away with? What story should be told? The researchers came up against these and many other questions, always aware that they were dealing with a true legend – a legend they dented at times. We spoke with Giulia Marino in the run-up to the book launch on 7 May and the reopening of the apartment-studio to the public in June 2018.\nWhat sort of options does a restorer have in turning a famous architect’s apartment into a museum?\nThere are many examples of what can be done. You can, for example, recreate the interior, giving the impression that the architect has just stepped out. That’s how Ernö Goldfinger’s London apartment, which we visited, is set up. There, the concept is taken to the extreme, with cans of baked beans and a bottle of ketchup in the kitchen! But there’s a risk of giving the place the feel of a wax museum. At the other end of the spectrum, Milan architect Vico Magistretti’s former office has been turned into an exhibition space with offices for the foundation’s staff, although some original features have been kept. In other cases, the interior is left completely empty, like in Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye just west of Paris.\nWhat is it that stands out about Le Corbusier’s apartment-studio?\nIt’s a manifesto, a unique concentration of his inventions, such as the brise-soleil – which protects a building from sunlight – and indirect lighting. There is also Modulor Man, a human silhouette whose proportions served, among other things, to define the dimensions of his famous housing units. It is present in the form of stained glass in the dining room's bay window. In addition, we realized that the reason Le Corbusier covered some walls and ceilings with oak plywood was to hide water stains from leaks in the roof. This is rather ironic, since this type of paneling then became a fixture of modern architecture! From an ethical perspective, we found it impossible to favor one period over another. So we proposed to preserve the way Le Corbusier left his apartment – a palimpsest of eras.\nHow did the unpublished sources that you consulted help you develop your recommendations?\nA lot of photos were taken of the apartment, but many of them aren’t dated. So we had to come up with ways of putting them into chronological order, such as by carefully looking at the works of art in the images. By comparing hundreds of photos, we saw how the space changed over the decades, how furniture, materials and artwork came and went, and how certain aspects remained constant over the years, such as a red painted wall in the living room and the location of particular objects and paintings. Le Corbusier was a painter and a collector too. For us, placing carefully selected objects (paintings, rugs, sculptures) in strategic locations where they have always been is crucial if visitors are to truly understand the architecture and how the space was used. We also studied his correspondence, his bills and the impact of the countless – if not always felicitous – renovations that the apartment went through after his death. We also came up with recommendations on additional studies that are needed before any restoration work can begin, such as analyzing the layers of paint to identify all the colors used, since such things cannot be identified with any accuracy from the black and white photos. Now it’s up to the architect-restorers and exhibition specialists to review our guidelines and factor in the necessary security measures so that they can come up with a display approach that will be of interest to both researchers and the broader public.\nDoes the apartment-studio reflect Le Corbusier’s day-to-day existence?\n The apartment was indeed in keeping with how the architect and his wife lived. It was divided into two parts, separated by two pivot doors. Le Corbusier’s painting studio was on one side and the other side was where the couple, who didn’t have any children, lived – sitting room, bedrooms, kitchen and dining room. There is also a lovely terrace on top of the building. There are numerous stories about Le Corbusier’s wife Yvonne who, according to people who worked with Le Corbusier, was not allowed to enter his studio. Le Corbusier himself noted that, after his wife complained about 'living in a barrack' – an expression we find in his correspondence – he developed the principle of indirect lighting, in which artificial light is projected onto a colored wall. This invention became iconic both in his work and beyond it.\nVernissage and conference \"Les multiples vies de l'appartement-atelier de Le Corbusier\"\n Presentation of the 2nd edition of the ; Introduction with Christine Mengin, General Secretary of the Foundation Le Corbusier\n Moday 7 May 2018 - 6:30pm, Project Room, , EPFL.", "summary": "How should an iconic piece of modern architecture be restored?

{"id": 323, "text": "The H+ proton consists of a single ion of hydrogen, the smallest and lightest of all the chemical elements. These protons occur naturally in water where a tiny proportion of H2O molecules separate spontaneously. Their amount in a liquid determines whether the solution is acidic or basic. Protons are also extremely mobile, moving through water by jumping from one water molecule to another.\nProton transport at water-solid interfaces\nThe way this transport process works in a body of water is relatively well understood. But the presence of a solid surface can dramatically affect how protons behave, and scientists currently have very little in the way of tools to measure these movements at water-solid interfaces. In this new study, Jean Comtet, a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI), has provided the first-ever glimpse of the behavior of protons when water comes into contact with a solid surface, going down to the ultimate scale of single proton and single charge. His findings, published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, reveal that protons tend to move along the interface between these two mediums. The study benefited from the help of researchers from the Department of Chemistry at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris who carried out simulations.\nCrystalline defects\nComtet studied the interface between water and a crystal of boron nitride, an extremely smooth material. “The surface of the crystal can contain defects,” says Comtet. “We found that these imperfections act as markers, reemitting light when a proton binds to them.” Using a super-resolution microscope, he was able to observe these fluorescence signals and measure the position of the defects to within around 10 nanometers – an incredibly high degree of precision. More interesting still, the study revealed new insights in the way crystalline defects are activated. “We observed defects on the surface of the crystal lighting up one after another when they came into contact with water,” adds Comtet. “We realized that this lighting pattern was produced by a single proton jumping from defect to defect, generating an identifiable pathway.”\nA major experimental breakthrough\nOne of the key findings of the study is that protons tend to move along the water-solid interface. “The protons keep on moving, but hugging the surface of the solid,” explains Comtet. “That’s why we see these kinds of patterns.” Aleksandra Radenovic, professor at EPFL’s Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology (LBEN), adds: “This is a major experimental breakthrough that furthers our understanding of how charges in water interact with solid surfaces.”\n“Our observations, in this specific context, can easily be extrapolated to other materials and environments,” says Comtet. “These discoveries could have important implications in many other fields and disciplines, from understanding biological processes at the cell-membrane interface to designing more efficient filters and batteries.", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have been able to observe single protons moving at the interface between water and a solid surface.

{"id": 329, "text": "A genuine star of the laboratory, for several decades now the fruit fly has been the model organism for research, particularly in the field of genetics and development. But nothing looks more like a fly than another fly. When it comes to observing and quantifying their interactions, it’s enough to turn one’s hair gray. Researchers from EPFL and UNIL are making life easier for scientists all over the world with their system of monitoring and identification of these insects.\n“That will allow us to penetrate many mysteries in the social lives of insects: with whom they fight, eat, or mate. With this system we will be able to observe the influence of the group and the group size on individual behavior, as well as interactions between genetically different groups of flies,” explains Richard Benton, Professor at the Center for Integrative Genomics of UNIL.\nFBI for Flies\nThis device, named FBI (Fluorescent Behavioral Imaging) – that’s no joke – makes it possible to monitor, record, and analyze the behavior of fruit flies interacting with others. Pavan Ramdya, postdoc at EPFL and at UNIL, has devised a method to differentiate flies with different genetic profiles using cameras and making genetic modifications. Fruit flies have a vital asset: they are easily genetically manipulated. Researchers turned a muscle in the chest fluorescent in a line of insects. These flies can fly and reproduce. Everything indicates, therefore, that they behave like their unmodified counterparts.\nThe tracking device refined by the research group distinguishes between flies by their greenish thorax. In order to know in real time where a fly is and to which genetic group it belongs, two cameras simultaneously film insect behavior and changes in the fluorescence.\nSoftware developed by Thomas Schaffer, doctoral candidate at EPFL, correspondingly provides an intuitive interface to orchestrate a system of cameras and LEDs required for data acquisition. The different genetic profiles of the Diptera are automatically discriminated along with statistics on their movements to facilitate the analysis of their behavior.\nNew Behavioral Studies Made Possible\nAlthough it is a tiny insect (2.5 to 3 mm long), the fruit fly is an animal that can elucidate numerous biological questions on: behavior, reproduction, relationships with other species or adaptation to an environment. The device therefore fills an important gap in methodological studies of the behavior of flies as well as other insects, such as ants. Until now monitoring tools based on morphological characteristics could hardly discriminate.\nTo illustrate the importance and the reliability of this new method, researchers examined courtship of male flies genetically modified to court other males. The question was whether they preferred individuals of their own group or unmodified flies – generally attracted to females. The comparison of these two groups of externally identical flies would not have been possible before this new method.\nTwo distinct populations of insect can now be easily compared within the same experiment. “Of course it is possible to study multiple groups simultaneously using other types of fluorophores, that will give them a different intensity or color,” says Pavan Ramdya.\nVideos:\n-\n-", "summary": "FBI, a camera system to recognize the genetic identity of fruit flies and track their movements will revolutionize the study of their behavior.

{"id": 331, "text": "To generate electricity, Switzerland has been using nuclear energy for nearly 40 years, and its five nuclear power stations provide about 38% of the electricity required. It’s the second most important source of electricity in Switzerland after hydro-electricity. However, the Swiss government recently decided on a gradual phasing-out of atomic energy, and the existing nuclear power stations will be decommissioned over the next twenty years, with the last remaining installation scheduled to be closed down in 2034. The federal law on nuclear energy stipulates that nuclear waste must be managed in Switzerland: more specifically, it states that the waste should be stored in depots located in deep strata, which is considered to be the most appropriate solution for Switzerland. So how should we prepare for the safe and definitive storage of our nuclear waste? For several years, the Laboratory of Soil Mechanics (LMS) has been contributing to research into the identification of the best place for its storage. In parallel, the LMS is also researching into various tools for the evaluation of multi-barrier systems. We asked Professor Lyesse Laloui, the director of the LMS, about the current state of affairs from a scientific and critical viewpoint.\nHow does Switzerland currently handle its nuclear waste?\n Since the moratorium voted by the parliament in 2006, Swiss nuclear waste is no longer sent to France and Germany: instead, the 8000 m3 of waste is being cooled in enormous pools in Würenlingen in the canton of Aargau. This is only a temporary measure, since it is planned to bury the waste permanently in deep geological strata.\nAre there different types of waste?\n Yes, there are in fact two categories of waste:\n • Waste that is low- to medium-level radioactive, whose lifespan is short – from a few dozen years to 300 years maximum. It comes not only from nuclear power stations, but also from medical uses, industry and research establishments. We have a lot of expertise in handling this waste.\n • Highly radioactive waste, which will take several million or even billions of years to become inactive. We call this “final waste” – that which is at the end of the re-processing chain, and which is not possible to refine further. This is the type that we have to store definitively.\nWhich scenarios are favored in Switzerland?\nStorage in deep geological strata:\n Several sites are being evaluated in Switzerland. Once the location has been chosen, it will be necessary to create a network of tunnels one kilometer deep: the waste will then be stored there.\nVitrification of the waste:\n This means mixing the waste with a glass matrix. It’s estimated that glass can withstand heat, irradiation and degradation through contact with water for about 300,000 years. Each glass cylinder is placed in a steel container: this constitutes a kind of “package” of glass waste 8 meters long and weighing about two tons.\nThe fixing of vitrified waste in sodium bentonite:\n this clay expands in volume when it is exposed to moisture. It can absorb several times its mass in water, and – when injected in the storage tunnels – it expands and fills the spaces between the cylinder and the rock. Each country is carrying out research in different directions. The Swiss strategy is not to be able to access the waste once it has been sealed in the bentonite.\nWhat is the nature of your research work? Where is it carried out? And what are the risks?\nOur research is focused on the physical phenomena that interact in the course of the life of buried waste. We have to ensure a maximum level of security with regard to both natural and man-made barriers.\n In choosing the site, we’re evidently concerned with its stability.\nSpecifically, we concentrate on the connected thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes. Heat is an important factor: the waste generates temperature of the order of 150 degrees over hundreds of years. How do we ensure that the radio-necleotides won’t damage the vitrification?\n When we consider the environment below ground, water is everywhere: we regard it as the biggest threat. It can damage the steel lining by corrosion, which would have two consequences: the formation of gas – at the LMS we are trying to understand how this gas circulates in the tunnels – and the release of radioactive particles that could be transported by underground circulation.\nTo minimize risk, it’s therefore essential to develop performant evaluation tools for the various barriers designed to seal off the waste, and to test and improve the materials that would be used in the process. We are developing scientific research on materials and also scenarios for the optimization of technical solutions.\n We have analyzed the impact of environmental elements on the behavior of geo-structures. To do this, we worked with the Mont-Terri underground laboratory in the Jura region of Switzerland. The laboratory consists of a network of tunnels located 300 meters deep, that are cut into a type of rock that can be found just about everywhere in the country. Because of this, the data gathered can be extrapolated.\n We are also carrying out research on the enhancement of the properties of bentonite, which is the final protection and sealing barrier before the rock, and are currently in the middle of trials in the underground laboratory at Grimsel. We blasted bentonite on rock walls, and then after the drying process was completed, we took some samples, which are currently being analyzed at EPFL. We need to determine its level of hermeticity, its mechanical properties, its expansion potential and its density, and use this data to develop the best possible material. We’re testing various compositions of bentonite, subjected to heating at 120° in an underground laboratory in Sweden. Our own laboratory is involved in international research, and I’m currently coordinating a European proposal as part of the 7th framework program, as well as organizing an international conference on this subject, to be held at EPFL from February 1 to 3, 2012.", "summary": "If Switzerland does indeed abandon nuclear energy within the time-frame announced by the Swiss Confederation, the question of the burial and disposal of the accumulated waste needs to be addressed.

{"id": 337, "text": "Both of the EPFL projects that applied for the European Commission’s FET Flagship program have successfully cleared the first hurdle. These projects are the Time Machine, headed by Frédéric Kaplan at the Digital Humanities Laboratory, and Health EU, run by Adrian Ionescu at the Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab).\nA total of 33 projects from universities across Europe have applied for the program, which is intended to support future and emerging technologies (FET). Only 17 of them – just over half – were selected for the second round, scheduled to end on 18 September 2018.\nA huge historical database\nThe Time Machine is based on the Venice Time Machine (VTM), a project that started in 2012 and served as a proof of concept. The VTM aimed to build a multidimensional model of the city that spans the past millennium, using millions of historical documents stored in a variety of formats. After five years, the project team has scanned 190,000 records from the Venice State Archive along with 720,000 photographs and 3,000 books on Venice’s history.\nThe objective of the Time Machine is to replicate the VTM across Europe. It will create a large-scale simulator for mapping 2,000 years of European history and turning the huge archives and sizeable museum collections into one big digital information system.\nMany universities are already in the process of building their own Time Machine to bridge their cities’ past to the present and connect the paths of history. Amsterdam, Nuremberg, Paris, Jerusalem, Budapest and Naples have all decided to dig through their archives and create a huge linked database on a national and European level.\nTo date, 170 partner institutions from 32 countries have joined the Time Machine project and formed a consortium to develop new technology for digitizing, analyzing, accessing, preserving and sharing historical and cultural documents on a large scale.\n“Making it past the first round of the selection process was critical, not just for our consortium but also for our cultural heritage in general,” says Frédéric Kaplan. “This is the first time that a cultural project of this scope – one billion euros over ten years and supported by institutions from all European countries – has been proposed. Never before has a continent-wide initiative aimed at turning our historical heritage into a key resource for education, research and the economy ever been attempted. This latest news brings us one step closer to making our dream of creating a time machine a reality for all Europeans.”\nAn avatar for managing your health\nWith Health EU, everyone will one day have their own medical avatar – a virtual replica of themselves featuring their own personal data – that could improve the way their health is managed and the treatments they are given. This international project, led by a consortium headed by EPFL and the University of Twente, aims to achieve enhanced disease prevention, early diagnosis, more accurate monitoring and customized, targeted administration of medicines and treatments, especially for increasingly common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular, chronic and neurodegenerative disorders.\nThe project’s core idea is to combine customized medicine with digital technology, using the latest technological developments such as connected objects and artificial intelligence, as well as the novel concepts of digital twins and organs-on-chips. Digital twins are essentially computer models that enable doctors to test and measure the effect of variables, processes and scenarios that would be impossible to apply in the real world. Organs-on-chips let doctors observe the biological functions of an organ or the effect of a medicine – but outside the human body. That has the advantage of avoiding side effects that can sometimes be extremely harmful and allowing treatments to be tailored as closely as possible to a patient’s needs. \n“The Health EU project will lay the foundation for a bright future for European healthcare in the 21st century,” says Adrian Ionescu. “It represents a human avatar-based revolution, where personalized medicine and the early interception and prevention of diseases will create an economically sustainable approach and enhance everyone’s quality of life.”\nProfessor Ben Feringa, who won the 2016 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the development of molecular machines, adds: “This is a very ambitious program that combines modern science and technology to create new opportunities for the future of healthcare and keep it affordable.” Professor Feringa is a pioneer in the field of molecular engines, catalysis and smart medication. \nHealth EU is being coordinated by EPFL in association with the University of Twente and HDMT (Organ on Chip association), both based in the Netherlands, and represented in the coordination board by professor Albert van den Berg. More than 90 scientists from 47 leading-edge research groups at universities, institutes, clinics and companies in 16 European countries are directly involved in the project.

{"id": 338, "text": "Mankind first set foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969. Five decades on, thoughts have turned to establishing a permanent settlement there. Over 150 students have descended on the mountain village of Zermatt as part of IGLUNA, a project coordinated by EPFL’s Swiss Space Center under the European Space Agency’s  initiative. The multidisciplinary teams will all be working toward the same goal: building a “habitat in the ice” that might one day be deployed on the Moon.\nSupporting human life in an extreme environment is no easy task. The students spent the 2018/2019 academic year working on answers to some of the many challenging questions – both human and technological – that such an endeavor raises. How should the habitat be structured? Where will oxygen, food and power come from? How will settlers communicate and carry out research? What about their health and welfare?\nDestination: Zermatt\nThe students headed to Zermatt in the Swiss Alps on 17 June for their field work. “The students are very much working as one team, sharing their modules and concepts,” says Tatiana Benavides, who leads the project at the Swiss Space Center. “Put it all together and you can see how people might one day live on the Moon.”\nThe students’ work is on display in two separate locations: conceptual and design pieces at the Vernissage Art Gallery (Backstage Hotel), and scientific and technical pieces at the Glacier Palace – Klein Matterhorn. . “As well as presenting their work, the students are also testing out the habitat and robots, checking whether the plants grow and conducting scientific experiments,” adds Benavides. “They may not be sleeping under the ice, but they’re operating in real-world conditions all the same.”\nEPFL shoots for the moon \nAt EPFL, students from several schools have been busy working on the project since September. The team, led by architect and lecturer Pierre Zurbrügg, built an igloo-like habitat 15 meters below the surface of the Klein Matterhorn glacier, which stands 3,883 meters above sea level. The structure, made from load-bearing and insulating materials, was designed and built by students from the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) as part of the “Living on Mars” teaching unit. “We had to factor in the practical constraints of the IGLUNA field site,” explains Zurbrügg. “For instance, we needed to be able to transport the materials, assemble the habitat quickly, and work in temperatures of -4°C. We opted for a brick structure that’s relatively easy to assemble. It took just three days to build.”\nWhat would life be like inside the habitat? “Our team thought long and hard about life support,” adds Zurbrügg. “Simply surviving isn’t enough. We needed somewhere people could actually live.” The students’ idea was to harness the metabolic processes of the people and plants inside the habitat to create a life cycle and keep waste to a minimum. They also produced a complete 3D model of their habitat, with computer-generated images and an interactive animation showing what different parts of the environment would look like.\nA team from GrowbotHub – a joint initiative between EPFL, UNIL and urban farming non-profit Légumes Perchés – designed a fully automated food production system for growing and harvesting fruit and vegetables in extreme conditions. “Our job is to assemble the structure and install the robot inside the habitat,” explains Victoria Letertre, a robotics student at EPFL who was involved in programming the robot. “The SWAG team from Zürich is responsible for the aeroponics systems, and for growing and tending to crops in the lunar environment.”\nThe EPFL team considered various other aspects of life on the Moon. For instance, they used 3D laser shock peening – a technique developed at the Laboratory of Thermomechanical Metallurgy (LMTM) – to design a saw capable of cutting through the ice. In another collaboration, this time between the Swiss Space Center and EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB), cameras were installed to monitor human behavior inside the igloo. Motion-capture algorithms were used to analyze the footage and identify where habitat design and safety improvements could be made.\nAn ongoing human and scientific endeavor\n“Our fascination with space comes from our natural curiosity and our desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge,” says Benavides. “Living on the Moon is an immense challenge. Yet the technologies that the students have developed could have applications here on Earth, too – in extreme environments or in the aftermath of natural disasters, for example.”\nAs IGLUNA 2019 draws to a close, the Swiss Space Center is preparing to run the project again next year. “It’s been an incredible learning experience on both the human and technology fronts,” adds Benavides. “Some of the teams are planning to continue honing their prototypes next year. We’re also looking forward to receiving new proposals.” The  closes on 21 July 2019.\n“For me, IGLUNA is a dream come true. I never imagined I’d be working on a robot that could one day be sent to the Moon,” says Letertre. “And if an opportunity arose for me to go into space, I’d be there in a heartbeat!", "summary": "On 17 June, students from EPFL and 12 other European universities headed to Zermatt as part of the IGLUNA project.

{"id": 341, "text": "In the field of photovoltaic technologies, silicon-based solar cells make up 90% of the market. In terms of cost, stability and efficiency (20-22% for a typical solar cell on the market), they are well ahead of the competition.\nHowever, after decades of research and investment, silicon-based solar cells are now close to their maximum theoretical efficiency. As a result, new concepts are required to achieve a long-term reduction in solar electricity prices and allow photovoltaic technology to become a more widely adopted way of generating power.\nOne solution is to place two different types of solar cells on top of each other to maximize the conversion of light rays into electrical power. These “double-junction” cells are being widely researched in the scientific community, but are expensive to make. Now research teams in Neuchâtel – from EPFL’s Photovoltaics Laboratory and the CSEM PV-center – have developed an economically competitive solution. They have integrated a perovskite cell directly on top of a standard silicon-based cell, obtaining a record efficiency of 25.2%. Their production method is promising, because it would add only a few extra steps to the current silicon-cell production process, and the cost would be reasonable. Their research has been published in \nNature Materials\n.\nPerovskite-on-silicon: a nanometric sandwich\n Perovskite’s unique properties have prompted a great deal of research into its use in solar cells over the last few years. In the space of nine years, the efficiency of these cells has risen by a factor of six. Perovskite allows high conversion efficiency to be achieved at a potentially limited production cost.\nIn tandem cells, perovskite complements silicon: it converts blue and green light more efficiently, while silicon is better at converting red and infra-red light. “By combining the two materials, we can maximize the use of the solar spectrum and increase the amount of power generated. The calculations and work we have done show that a 30% efficiency should soon be possible,” say the study’s main authors Florent Sahli and Jérémie Werner.\nHowever, creating an effective tandem structure by superposing the two materials is no easy task. “Silicon’s surface consists of a series of pyramids measuring around 5 microns, which trap light and prevent it from being reflected. However, the surface texture makes it hard to deposit a homogeneous film of perovskite,” explains Quentin Jeangros, who co-authored the paper.\nWhen the perovskite is deposited in liquid form, as it usually is, it accumulates in the valleys between the pyramids while leaving the peaks uncovered, leading to short circuits.\nA key layer ensuring an optimal microstructure\n Scientists at EPFL and CSEM have gotten around that problem by using evaporation methods to form an inorganic base layer that fully covers the pyramids. That layer is porous, enabling it to retain the liquid organic solution that is then added using a thin-film deposition technique called spin-coating. The researchers subsequently heat the substrate to a relatively low temperature of 150°C to crystallize a homogeneous film of perovskite on top of the silicon pyramids.\n“Until now, the standard approach for making a perovskite/silicon tandem cell was to level off the pyramids of the silicon cell, which decreased its optical properties and therefore its performance, before depositing the perovskite cell on top of it. It also added steps to the manufacturing process,” says Florent Sahli.\nUpdating existing technologies\n The new type of tandem cell is highly efficient and directly compatible with monocrystalline silicon-based technologies, which benefit from long-standing industrial expertise and are already being produced profitably. “We are proposing to use equipment that is already in use, just adding a few specific stages. Manufacturers won’t be adopting a whole new solar technology, but simply updating the production lines they are already using for silicon-based cells,” explains Christophe Ballif, head of EPFL’s Photovoltaics Laboratory and CSEM’s PV-Center.\nAt the moment, research is continuing in order to increase efficiency further and give the perovskite film more long-term stability. Although the team has made a breakthrough, there is still work to be done before their technology can be adopted commercially.", "summary": "In Neuchâtel (Switzerland), researchers from EPFL and CSEM have combined silicon- and perovskite-based solar cells.

{"id": 343, "text": "Making a skateboard from fiberglass instead of wood makes sense: fiberglass is waterproof and more resilient than the materials used in commercially available boards, and it lends itself to new skateboard designs. This is the concept behind the Master’s project thought up by Anastasios Vassilopoulos – a senior scientist at EPFL’s Composite Construction Laboratory (CCLab), which is a hybrid civil engineering/architecture lab – and Jean-François Molinari, a full professor and head of the Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LSMS), part of EPFL’s Civil Engineering Institute. People attending Vivapoly on Thursday, 24 May will be able to try out the fiberglass skateboard at the Travel GC stand.\n“We wanted to come up with a project that was a little fancier than usual. So we asked a student not only to dimension a structural component, but also to make it himself and test it, to observe its strengths and weaknesses. We thought designing a skateboard would be a good idea as it was feasible to manufacture and validate the functionality of our product. In any case, the dimensioning method is similar for composite materials whether you’re making a skateboard, a bridge or an aircraft – apart from the proportions and the specifications of course,” says Vassilopoulos. For the professor, this approach has two advantages: it forced the student to go beyond the analytical level and gave him the satisfaction of making a finished product.\nDamien Sommer, a civil engineering student who is also an elite volleyball player and avid skateboarder, took up the challenge. Because he is six feet tall, he needed to make a board that would not flex too much under his weight. As a result, the first part of his project was to calculate how fiberglass would behave under various loads, based on the classical theory of laminated composite materials. To do that, he used quality standards regarding the flexural rigidity of a skateboard derived by the French engineer Anthony Bert, whom he contacted.\nOn that basis, he was adapt the flexural rigidity of the fiberglass skateboards to the usual values preferred for the conventional wooden skateboards. Sommer validated his design by making prototypes and performing several experimental investigations, using equipment from the Structural Engineering Group (GIS/ENAC) and the Laboratory of Applied Mechanics and Reliability Analysis, part of the School of Engineering (STI).\nLonger life\n These days, composite materials like glass or carbon fibers reinforced polymers are only used in certain parts of a skateboard, to strengthen the basic wooden structure. However, many skis, snowboards and bicycles are made entirely of fiber reinforced polymer materials, giving them unique mechanical properties. What is the reason for not having composite skateboards yet? “Maybe skateboard manufacturers just like to stick with what they know. Developing a 100%-fiberglass skateboard requires a little more technical knowledge. Nevertheless, materials and manufacturing are not much more expensive, and a fiberglass skateboard will have a much longer life than a wooden board that absorbs moisture and always ends up breaking,” notes Sommer.\nHe is well aware of this problem, since he has a whole collection of broken skateboard pieces in his attic, which he upcycles into frames for sunglasses. In terms of how they feel to ride, fiberglass skateboards initially take skaters by surprise, according to Sommer: “For the first few minutes, you really have to adjust your technique, because when you land a trick, you feel the board flexing under your feet. This is when traditional wooden skateboards normally break.”\nFuture developments\n Sommer first started working on this idea in a semester project in winter 2017, where he focused on a fiberglass-reinforced wooden skateboard. Then came his Master’s project. According to Sommer and the two professors who supervised his work, the fiberglass board could be made even more rigid, making it possible to perform more tricks. The time required to make the skateboard, its thickness and its cost could also be reduced.\n“The beauty of composite materials like fiberglass reinforced polymers is that they offer much more design possibilities than conventional materials. For example, we can decide how rigid and thick we want the board to be by adjusting the fiber architecture of the material, and therefore make more versatile skateboards,” says Vassilopoulos. As a result, the quest for the perfect skateboard is continuing this spring at EPFL: a new semester project is under way and a new Master’s project, this time focusing on design and on optimizing skateboard production process is offered to interested students of EPFL.\nPress kit (documents, images and videos): http://bit.ly/Skateboard_EPFL", "summary": "For his Master’s project, a civil engineering student at EPFL dimensioned and then made a fiberglass skateboard.

{"id": 344, "text": "Inspecting a damaged building after an earthquake or during a fire is exactly the kind of job that human rescuers would like drones to do for them. A flying robot could look for people trapped inside and guide the rescue team towards them. But the drone would often have to enter the building through a crack in a wall, a partially open window, or through bars – something the typical size of a drone does not allow.\nTo solve this problem, researchers from the and  at EPFL created a new kind of drone. Both groups are part of the  funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Inspired by birds that fold their wings in mid-air to cross narrow passages, the new drone can squeeze itself to pass through gaps and then go back to its previous shape, all the while continuing to fly. And it can even hold and transport objects along the way. \nMobile arms can fold around the main frame \n “Our solution is quite simple from a mechanical point of view, but it is very versatile and very autonomous, with onboard perception and control systems,” explains Davide Falanga, researcher at the University of Zurich and the paper’s first author. In comparison to other drones, this morphing drone can maneuver in tight spaces and guarantee a stable flight at all times.\nThe Zurich and Lausanne teams worked in collaboration and designed a quadrotor with four propellers that rotate independently, mounted on mobile arms that can fold around the main frame thanks to servo-motors. The ace in the hole is a control system that adapts in real time to any new position of the arms, adjusting the thrust of the propellers as the center of gravity shifts. \n“The morphing drone can adopt different configurations according to what is needed in the field,” adds Stefano Mintchev, co-author and researcher at the EPFL School of Engineering. The standard configuration is X-shaped, with the four arms stretched out and the propellers at the widest possible distance from each other. When faced with a narrow passage, the drone can switch to a “H” shape, with all arms lined up along one axis or to a “O” shape, with all arms folded as close as possible to the body. A “T” shape can be used to bring the onboard camera mounted on the central frame as close as possible to objects that the drone needs to inspect. \nFirst step to fully autonomous rescue searches\nIn the future, the researchers hope to further improve the drone structure so that it can fold in all three dimensions. Most importantly, they want to develop algorithms that will make the drone truly autonomous, allowing it to look for passages in a real disaster scenario and automatically choose the best way to pass through them. “The final goal is to give the drone a high-level instruction such as ‘enter that building, inspect every room and come back’ and let it figure out by itself how to do it,” says Falanga. \nContacts EPFL\nProf. Dario Floreano\n, EPFL, Laboratory of Intelligent Systems \nPhone: +41 21 693 52 30 / Email: \nStefano Mintchev\n, EPFL, Laboratory of Intelligent Systems\nPhone: +41 21 693 05 91 / Email: \nContacts University of Zurich\nProf. Dr. Davide Scaramuzza\n, University of Zurich, Director of the Robotics and Perception Group\nTel: +41 44 635 24 07 / E-Mail: \nMedia Relations\n, University of Zurich\nPhone. +41 44 634 44 67 / E-mail: \nPicture\n: © University of Zurich/Armasuisse", "summary": "A research team from the University of Zurich and EPFL have developed a new drone that can retract its propeller arms in flight and make itself small to fit through narrow gaps and holes.

{"id": 347, "text": "As one year ends and another begins, this is a good time to reflect on what has been a truly remarkable 12 months for EPFL. For starters, the School celebrated its  as a federal institute of technology with a year-long program of special events. Yet it’s been a busy year on other fronts, too: EPFL’s students and researchers have continued to push the boundaries of science; the School has launched a string of initiatives in teaching and research; startups and spin-offs have gone from strength to strength; and the awards and honors have come thick and fast. There have been so many highlights that it’s impossible to list them all. But here are some of the standout moments of 2019.\nTaking research as our starting point, robotics, artificial intelligence and energy technologies took center stage this year. The robot cast list reads like something from a science-fiction movie: biocompatible elastic microrobots, robots that recreate the gait of extinct animals, gummy-like robots that stimulate biological tissue, robots that enable bees and fish to talk to each other, robot-ants that can communicate, fly-like robots designed by artificial intelligence, and even a robotic insect that can survive being flattened by a fly swatter.\nTurning to energy technologies, the honor roll is no less impressive: photovoltaic panels that use snow to create more solar power in the winter, more energy-efficient cruise ships, energy-producing buildings, a device that generates hydrogen by concentrating sunlight, a system that turns wastewater sludge into energy and mineral salts, and perovskite solar cells tested for real-world performance.\nThe year’s breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have been just as remarkable: an AI-based app to save bees, another to predict when and where lightning will strike, an AI-driven system that uncovers security flaws, algorithms developed to study the dynamics of network structures using Wikipedia or to detect outside influences on the media, a solution for detecting deepfakes, and a big data toolkit for precision medicine.\nOther research highlights include a strong, lightweight concrete, a self-healing advanced composite, a photonic chip for at-home disease detection, a metal-organic framework that mimics DNA, a chip to measure vacuums, an important step towards understanding tumor biology, bioprinted living tissue, and a model of the flight of dandelion seeds.\nResearchers aside, students have played their part in raising EPFL’s profile on the international stage this year. In July, the EPFLoop team headed to Los Angeles for the Hyperloop Pod Competition, organized by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, where they secured an impressive third-place finish. In August, an EPFL team walked away with the energy efficiency award for their lightweight boat in the HydroContest challenge, held on Lake Neuchâtel in Yverdon-les-Bains. And in November, the EPFL bioengineering team won the grand prize of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition for their diagnostic test for grapevine disease. EPFL students will take part in no fewer than ten interdisciplinary challenges in 2020, as well as the international IGLUNA project.\nCollaborations with other institutions\nTeaming up with leading partners is yet another hallmark of EPFL’s performance – and it’s been a particularly busy year on this front as well. In 2019, the School joined forces with the Defitech Foundation, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL) to set up NeuroRestore, a new center aimed at restoring lost neurological function. Other highlights included a new joint Master’s degree in Cyber Security with ETH Zurich, a cooperation agreement with the Canton of Vaud for specific initiatives related to digitalization and innovative teaching methods in EPFL’s core subjects, and the Enterprise for Society Center (E4S), a joint initiative with UNIL and IMD to train future managers to meet the challenges of sustainability and social responsibility.\nThe year has also been a resounding success for EPFL’s startups. Two spin-offs, Flyability and Lunaphore, took first and second places in the 2019 TOP 100 Swiss Startup Awards, ClearSpace was selected to lead a major European Space Agency (ESA) space debris capture and deorbiting project, and Learn To Forecast (L2F) launched the Giotto project, an open-source, free-of-charge library that pushes AI forward by making it more reliable and intuitive.\nHonors and appointments\nAnd there’s more. EPFL appointed 37 new professors in 2019, including 15 women, and the School celebrated 1,028 new Master’s graduates in October. That same month, Claudia R. Binder – a professor at the Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS) – was named the new dean of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC); she will take up this position on 1 January 2020. Also in 2019, Michael Grätzel, who directs EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, claimed the number-one spot in a new ranking of the world’s top 100,000 scientists across all fields. The ranking method is based on new, more accurate standardized citation metrics developed by scientists led by Stanford University.", "summary": "EPFL held a series of events to mark its 50th anniversary throughout 2019.

{"id": 348, "text": "For months the 21 student teams selected for the fourth edition of the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition toiled away in secret, turning their bold ideas into unique solutions that could one day be the driving force behind a new means of transportation. Then came time to unveil their prototypes. It turns out that EPFL’s team, dubbed EPFLoop, and Swissloop, the team composed of students from ETH Zurich and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, settled on the same type of propulsion system, a linear induction motor. They were the only ones to choose this type of motor, and they made the right decision. The conventional motor used by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) may have been faster – it reached a speed of 463 km/h – but the Swiss teams’ pods proved more reliable. Unlike TUM’s pod, the Swiss teams’ machines remained physically intact after reaching speeds of 238km/h (for EPFLoop) and 259 km/h (for Swissloop).\n“We’re disappointed with the outcome, of course,” says Martin Seydoux, the EPFLoop captain. “But we're happy that our pod, \nBella Lui\n, functioned exactly as expected. In all the tests we ran over the past week, up to the very last minute, the performance indicators were right in line with our predictions.”\nSo what went wrong?\nAt 9am on Sunday morning, the four teams chosen to compete in the final race on the 1.6 km vacuum track were hard at work. EPFLoop went second – after the University of Delft – at 11:30am. The pod’s batteries were fully charged and even heated slightly in order to boost their power. The EPFL students carefully loaded their pod onto the track following very strict procedures, and then the door to the tube was sealed and the air removed. On a giant screen, eight video cameras positioned every 250 meters in the tunnel displayed the rail lit by a series of black and white neon lights. Just like at a rocket launch, the pod’s mission objectives were announced in a detailed protocol: maximum speed, distance and braking. The pod pilots handed control over to the autonomous system just prior to takeoff: “Ready to go! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, launch!”\nAs the seconds ticked by, the onlookers watched \nBella Lui\n approach and shoot past each video camera in turn. At the same time, a curve graph displayed the relationship between the pod’s speed and the distance covered. 100 km/h, 150 km/h, 200 km/h…the tension mounted as the pod neared the sixth camera – you could hear a pin drop. The pod was approaching the seventh camera when the compressed air brakes suddenly engaged, grinding the machine to a halt. For some reason, the communication link between the control post and the pod had broken. Even operating autonomously, the pod couldn’t continue on its own for safety reasons, and so it stopped in its tracks after recording a top speed of only 238 km/h. The team will need to figure out the source of the communications snafu.\n“The EPFLoop students possess values that will be critical for the future of our planet, dedicating themselves to developing systems meant to further reduce humankind’s environmental impact,” says Mario Paolone, the team’s main advisor. “And the team made enormous progress over the past year. For the first time we used a high-speed linear induction motor and high-temperature batteries, combined with a carbon fiber shell and a robust autopilot that can operate even if some of the sensors fail.”\nTUM’s victory nevertheless left the two Swiss teams with a sense of frustration and disbelief. Although the German team chalked up an impressive speed record, its pod began to self-destruct while braking. Shouldn’t the team be disqualified for this? After deliberating for more than an hour, the organizers decided against that.\nAs expected, Elon Musk, who owns SpaceX, came to congratulate the four finalist teams in person. EPFL’s Martin Seydoux asked him whether he would consider applying criteria other than just speed – such as reliability – to the competition. Although Musk did not answer this question directly, the billionaire entrepreneur mentioned his hope of using a longer tube, possibly in the shape of a tunnel, in the 2021 competition.\nMarc Gruber, EPFL’s vice president for innovation, was on hand to support the team: “By participating in this event, EPFL showed that it is a global leader in innovation. We faced off against nearly two dozen teams from all over the world and finished third. Just as publications are a measure of successful research, student competitions like this are proof of our ability to innovate alongside the best of them.”", "summary": "Using similar propulsion technology, the Hyperloop pods developed by EPFL and ETH Zurich turned in a solid performance in Los Angeles: EPFLoop topped out at 238 km/h in the airless tube set up by SpaceX, while Swissloop peaked at 259km/h.

{"id": 349, "text": "On May 4, the Médiathèque du Valais in Sion will host a panel discussion featuring professors from EPFL and the Polytechnic University of Turin, with Valais officials and local architects. The discussion will focus on ways to revitalize mountain villages. This event, the first of its kind, will be open to the public.\nAlpine hamlets, some of which have been left abandoned, have one thing in common: their granaries. These \nraccards\n, as they are known, are a valuable heritage that must be preserved, according to Nicola Braghieri, an associate professor in EPFL’s architecture section and co-organizer of the Sion event: “We need to take a scientific approach to this rural architecture. Not all of these buildings have been properly recorded, and unless they’re renovated or revitalized in some other way, they’ll end up being destroyed.” For Braghieri, the removal of these structures, some of which date back to the 16\nth\n century, would be a major loss for our global cultural heritage.\nBraghieri, who is the head of the Arts of Sciences Laboratory (LAPIS), has a particular fondness for alpine architecture. Drawing on his expertise, he has come up with a temporary solution to the problem of preserving the \nraccards\n. Last year, he took his undergrads to Isérables, a mountain village in the Valais, and got them to sketch the granaries there. Once back in Lausanne, the students built models based on their drawings (see pictures to download). At the same time, three scientists in Braghieri’s lab assembled and organized the students’ drawings.\nFor Braghieri, this is a win-win solution, both for EPFL and the canton of Valais: “Our students learn how to draw and understand the construction principles behind the \nraccards\n – ‘kilometer-zero’ buildings made from local rocks and wood. And the canton is happy to have a record of these buildings, from the perspective of standards, economics, and its local heritage.”\nOuting to Thur\nBraghieri is taking his students back into the mountains this year, but this time to Thur, a hamlet within the village of Isérables. They will be there from 1 to 5 May, as part of a week of cross-disciplinary classes organized by EPFL. This year the students have to come up with innovative ways of revitalizing these villages. Their ideas will be assessed at the May 4 panel discussion, where Braghieri will also present a publication that contains the work done by the students at Isérables last year. For Braghieri, the future of this unique heritage is far from certain: “When we first showed them the work the students did in the Valais last year, the \nraccard\n owners were really interested. Many of them don’t know what to do with these buildings, which have been passed down for several generations,” said Braghieri.

{"id": 354, "text": "Universally present in industry, the chemical phenomenon of catalysis is surprisingly poorly understood. Production of plastics, conversion of natural gas into hydrogen and even the synthesis of margarine… These are just a few examples of processes which require the use of a catalytic converter. However, the application which is best known to the general public remains the catalytic converter in the exhaust pipes fitted on our motor vehicles. Researchers from the EPFL have published an article in Science describing a discovery which should help to achieve a better understanding of the process. This study could pave the way for new techniques which ensure better performance and are less costly.\nOne of the most frequently used types of catalysis involves a gas and a solid – this is known as “heterogeneous catalysis”. For example, in the catalytic converters fitted in the exhaust pipes of our vehicles, the harmful emanations are converted on contact with a platinum or palladium surface. The process itself is well-known, but the molecular mechanism remains obscure.\nA laser makes it 10,000 times faster\nResearchers at the EPFL studied heterogeneous catalysis. Methane mixed with water vapour is converted into hydrogen and CO on contact with a nickel surface. Using a powerful laser, chemists have been able to excite the vibrations and to orientate the methane molecules – by a procedure which is rather like using a joystick. Surprisingly enough, this process increases the effectiveness of the reaction many times over. “The improvement is impressive”, in the words of Rainer Beck, who is in charge of the project at the EPFL. “The use of a laser speeds up the process by a factor of between 1000 and 10,000!”\nThis observation conflicts with the theory which is commonly used to describe the process. The generally held view in fact is that the reaction can only be speeded up by increasing the energy – i.e. the heat – of the gas. The new discovery shows that our understanding of the phenomenon is rather limited, according to Rainer Beck. “In order to find a good catalytic converters, trial and error methods are used rather than design because a detailed understanding of how they work is often missing.”\n Environmental and industrial stakes\nConversion of methane is of great environmental interest. This gas which is used massively as a fuel, and burning methane releases a substantial quantity of CO2. “We might imagine its conversion on the capture sites which would then enable to capture CO2 at source and use hydrogen instead as the fuel, which burns cleanly producing only water as exhaust”. Although the process developed at the EPFL cannot be used on an industrial scale, Rainer Beck’s work does hold out the prospect of future improvements.\nThe interest of the discovery does not stop there. A substantial number of catalyses might also be concerned. In the chemical industry, over 90% of all processes involve catalysis at one time or another. Rainer Beck returns to the example of motor vehicles: “At present, platinum or palladium which are rare and expensive metals are being used. By gaining a better understanding of what is involved, we might be able to find a solution which permits the use of less expensive materials”.", "summary": "Catalytic converters are encountered everywhere in our cars and in the chemical industry.

{"id": 356, "text": "Encouraging audiences to participate in evaluations in large enough numbers to provide useful data is notoriously difficult, and for good reason: respondents may find the process time-consuming or boring. But what if you were invited to communicate your experience at a museum exhibit by making drawings, leaving voice recordings, interacting with animated graphics, or taking photos? \nThis is the aim of muse: a design-led audience evaluation app that helps museums get to know their visitors better. In addition to geographic and demographic information, the tablet-based tool uses some 30 interactive elements to collect qualitative, subjective data about museum visitors’ experiences. \nCapturing experiences\nSarah Kenderdine leads the eM+ lab in EPFL’s College of Humanities. She explains that in Switzerland, as in many parts of the world, museums usually collect only basic demographic data from their visitors, such as number of entries and origin. The goal of muse is therefore to give museums access to data analytics tools that can help them focus on many visitors as individuals, and to use the quality of visitor engagement as a method to define, measure, and program for improved museum experiences. \n “It is the social, political, emotional, educational, and creative elements, in addition to how deeply people are participating in a museum’s programs and exhibitions, that should be the basis for measuring value,” Kenderdine says.\n Unlike a traditional audience evaluation or survey, visitors use muse to record their experiences as they pass through an exhibit, rather than afterward. \n “Muse is always meant to be deployed inside the space of experience, and not afterward, so people can reflect in real time on what their reactions to it really are. Simultaneously, museum staff can see aggregated results on a real-time dashboard,” says Kenderdine, who has been developing muse since 2012.\n She notes a recent example of the success of the muse model, when a previous version of the app was deployed for the Winter at Tantora arts festival in AlUla, Saudi Arabia. It engaged 6,000 respondents across five surveys with 120 data points, resulting in 1,200 pages of reports. \n “This data provided a phenomenal insight into customer loyalty, future planning, and creative responses to the cultural offering at this new world heritage destination.”\n With the support of Engagement Migros, and the participation of more than 20 museums across Switzerland, Kenderdine’s goal now is to bring muse to the next level, including more sophisticated analysis driving better public outcomes for museums and their audiences. The project will be officially launched on September 17th, 2020 at EPFL’s ArtLab.\nLooking ahead\n At first, the muse team will partner with eight ‘core’ museums and institutions for a three-year period, including: the Château de Morges (Morges), the Haus der Elektronischen Künste (Basel), the International Red Cross Museum (Geneva), the Musée d'Éthnographie (Geneva), the Museum für Gestaltung (Zürich), the Rietberg Museum (Zürich), and the Olympic Museum (Lausanne). Each institution will be supported by an administration portal for creating questions and surveys, an app for collecting data, and a dashboard for visualizing the data in real time. A further 16 museums will be invited to join the project through an open call starting in late 2020. \n Throughout the four-year funding period, the muse team will develop convincing case studies for the Swiss museum landscape. It will also explore options for commercializing the app and its licensing models, and for expanding to include all cultural offerings across Europe and beyond – all in close collaboration with its partners.\n “With its user-centric approach, muse supports museums in their efforts to continue being active places in society,” says Johanna Muther, Project Manager at Engagement Migros. \n Kenderdine adds that going forward, muse will also help museums to increasingly embrace their audiences with renewed attention as they adapt to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. “Visitors are active participants, and not just consumers, in helping to support museums as polyvocal places. Muse gives an amplifier to those voices,” she says.\nAbout muse\n Muse is the voice of the visitor. In addition to quantitative data, such as geographic and demographic information, the tool can also be used to collect qualitative findings on the direct impact of an exhibition visit. The focus of the app is on creating playful interactions, and on being easy to use – for museums and visitors alike. Museums can use the findings to take greater account of the perspective of visitors when curating and developing their exhibits, thus helping them to remain firmly established as active places in society, both now and in the future.\nAbout Engagement Migros\n The Engagement Migros development fund enables pioneering projects in the midst of social change, which break new ground and test solutions aimed at the future. This approach is oriented towards making a difference and combines financial support with coaching services in its Pioneerlab.

{"id": 357, "text": "As part of attempts to curtail the Covid-19 pandemic, paper masks are increasingly being made mandatory. Their relative effectiveness is no longer in question, but their widespread use has a number of drawbacks. These include the environmental impact of disposable masks made from layers of non-woven polypropylene plastic microfibres. Moreover, they merely trap pathogens instead of destroying them. “In a hospital setting, these masks are placed in special bins and handled appropriately,” says László Forró, head of EPFL’s . “However, their use in the wider world – where they are tossed into open waste bins and even left on the street – can turn them into new sources of contamination.”\nResearchers in Forró’s lab are working on a promising solution to this problem: a membrane made of titanium oxide nanowires, similar in appearance to filter paper but with antibacterial and antiviral properties.\nTheir material works by using the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide. When exposed to ultraviolet radiation, the fibers convert resident moisture into oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, which have the ability to destroy pathogens. “Since our filter is exceptionally good at absorbing moisture, it can trap droplets that carry viruses and bacteria,” says Forró. “This creates a favorable environment for the oxidation process, which is triggered by light.”\nThe researchers' work appears today in \nAdvanced Functional Materials\n, and includes experiments that demonstrate the membrane's ability to destroy \nE. coli\n, the reference bacterium in biomedical research, and DNA strands in a matter of seconds. Based on these results, the researchers assert – although this remains to be demonstrated experimentally – that the process would be equally successful on a wide range of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.\nTheir article also states that manufacturing such membranes would be feasible on a large scale: the laboratory’s equipment alone is capable of producing up to 200 m\n2\n of filter paper per week, or enough for up to 80,000 masks per month. Moreover, the masks could be sterilized and reused up a thousand times. This would alleviate shortages and substantially reduce the amount of waste created by disposable surgical masks. Finally, the manufacturing process, which involves calcining the titanite nanowires, makes them stable and prevents the risk of nanoparticles being inhaled by the user.\nA start-up named Swoxid is already preparing to move the technology out of the lab. “The membranes could also be used in air treatment applications such as ventilation and air conditioning systems as well as in personal protective equipment,” says Endre Horváth, the article's lead author and co-founder of Swoxid.", "summary": "Filter “paper” made from titanium oxide nanowires is capable of trapping pathogens and destroying them with light.

The building will generate more power than it uses (for heating and electricity) and will be carbon neutral or even carbon negative. Intended to be a combined working-living space, it has a bedroom with two separate beds, a kitchen and a living room. “By reducing the amount of commuter traffic from people going to and from work, we can make a substantial cut in carbon emissions. Two researchers will live and work at SolAce for two years to try out our idea of a dual-purpose building,” says Jean-Louis Scartezzini, head of EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) and the SolAce project leader.\n SolAce is the fifth pilot unit to open at NEST, which is a modular building where researchers work with construction-industry businesses on joint R&D projects through an initiative spearheaded by Swiss federal research institutes Empa and eawag. The building consists of a central tower or ‘backbone’ surrounded by three open platforms where pilot units equipped with the latest sustainable-living technology can be installed on a plug-and-play basis. Units already at the building include Urban Mining, which is built entirely from recycled materials, and Vision Wood, which is exploring revolutionary new ways of using wood. SolAce joins them as a 100 m² apartment-laboratory where LESO-PB researchers can test out sensors and other technology they have developed under real-world conditions.\nA façade that doubles as a solar power plant \nThe unit’s façade is designed to be energy positive all year long. It’s covered with a special colored glazing for photovoltaic (PV) sensors and thermal collectors. “Because the nano-coating is highly transparent, it allows for minimal absorption and very little energy loss,” says Andreas Schüler, head of the Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Conversion research group at LESO-PB. This technology was developed and patented at EPFL and is currently being marketed by EPFL spin-off SwissINSO. The large surplus in solar power that SolAce generates will be stored in NEST’s Energy Hub so that anyone at the building can use it, including researchers at other pilot units.\nSmart windows \nSolAce’s special triple-glazed windows have a selective coating that lets mobile-phone waves pass through. Their glazing also contains 3D microstructures that can redirect light to darker areas of the unit. These ‘micro mirrors’ are invisible to the naked eye; in the winter, they can reflect light up to the ceiling to create more uniform interior lighting and help distribute solar heat. In the summer, they can bounce sunlight back outside the unit to prevent it from getting uncomfortably hot.\nCameras that imitate the human eye\nAs another comfort-enhancing feature, the LESO-PB researchers have installed mini cameras that respond to light in the same way as the human eye. These prototype sensors continually measure the amount of lighting and glare that a building occupant experiences, and software linked to the sensors instantly adjusts the unit’s blinds and electric lighting accordingly – while taking into account the occupants’ circadian rhythms. “We plan to carry out further research to make interior lighting even more comfortable and distribute light exactly when and where it’s needed, in order to match users’ circadian rhythms.

The scientists measured the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric molecules and aerosol particles to better understand the conditions leading to cloud formation.\nHow aerosols are formed in the Arctic \n“One of our objectives was to investigate how new aerosol particles could form in the Arctic atmosphere,” says Andrea Baccarini, a PhD student at the Paul Scherrer Institute and now scientific collaborator in the extreme Environments research Laboratory. “Under the right conditions, gas molecules condense together into small clusters that can grow, eventually forming aerosols.” If these aerosols grow even just a small amount larger, they can function as cloud condensation nuclei, which are essential for cloud formation.\nIn the Arctic summer and fall, the concentration of aerosols is extremely low. “The contribution of newly formed aerosols can be extremely important and even a small change in aerosol concentration in the high Arctic could have a major impact on cloud formation or alter clouds’ radiative properties,” says Baccarini. It is also still not clear how important local aerosol processes are to cloud formation in comparison to regional or long-range transport, for example. “With this expedition, we could investigate the exact sources of aerosol particles that are needed to form clouds” adds Paul Zieger, an assistant professor at Stockholm University who led the research project on aerosol-cloud processes of the 2018 expedition.\nIodic acid appears in early fall \nThe research team found that iodic acid, a chemical compound which had not previously been observed in the region, triggers the formation of new aerosols between late summer and early fall. “There is less ice in the Arctic at the end of the summer, a lot of open water and the concentration of iodic acid is very low at that point,” says Schmale. “Towards the end of August the temperature drops and the water starts refreezing, marking the beginning of the so called \nfreeze-up\n period. This is when the iodic acid concentration sharply increases leading to frequent new aerosol particle formation events’’.\nThe team developed a simple model to explain the variability of iodic acid in the atmosphere, which largely depends on local meteorological conditions. They were also able to describe the full chain of events that leads all the way from new particle formation to clouds, from the gas molecule that initially creates a particle to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei. “Observing and describing this process under real-world conditions was an extremely rare opportunity”, says Schmale.\nTheir findings, recently  provide greater insight into the role of biogeochemical processes for cloud formation over the Arctic pack ice and potentially also for Arctic warming.\nResearch partners\n*Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen PSI, Switzerland\n*Department of Environmental Science & Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University, Sweden\n*Department of Physics & Atmospheric Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada\n*School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, UK\n*Department of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate, Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano, CSIC, Spain\n*Department of Meteorology & Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University, Sweden\n*School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, EPFL, Switzerland", "summary": "An international team of scientists from EPFL, the Paul Scherrer Institute and Stockholm University has identified a novel driver of new aerosol particle formation in the Arctic during the summer to fall transition.

{"id": 362, "text": "Scientists around the world are studying the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from many different perspectives in an effort to better understand how it infects the body and spreads from person to person. The goal is to find therapies for neutralizing and eliminating it. One approach being taken by researchers at EPFL and Eawag – until drug treatments and a vaccine are developed – is to analyze wastewater samples so that health officials can detect the virus before the disease is diagnosed clinically. “Our study looks at how we can detect the virus in wastewater and measure its concentration before people start developing clinical symptoms – and to determine how much time before,” says Tamar Kohn, head of EPFL’s Environmental Chemistry Laboratory (LCE).\nIn collaboration with Christoph Ort at Eawag’s Urban Water Management Department and Tim Julian at Eawag’s Environmental Microbiology Department, the researchers pulled off a major feat in showing that the novel coronavirus can be detected and measured in wastewater in a matter of weeks. The researchers analyzed samples from Lausanne, Zurich and Lugano – including samples from Zurich and Lugano that were collected in late February when the first cases were recorded in Switzerland. “As a specialist in environmental virology, I was ready to work on the pandemic when it first arrived in Italy,” says Xavier Fernandez Cassi at the LCE. “It was clear to me that the virus would spread to Switzerland. Given how interlinked countries are today, I would’ve been surprised if it didn’t.”\n© 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog / Xavier Fernandez Cassi took samples from the end of February\nThe researchers found traces of the virus in all the samples they collected. While concentrations in the more recent samples were so high that it was fairly easy to measure them, this was not true for the samples from February. “We were pleasantly surprised to find a signal in wastewater from Lugano – where only one case had been identified at that point – and from Zurich, where only six had been identified,” says Kohn. Working with colleagues at Eawag, they collected samples from nine wastewater treatment plants in Ticino, two in Zurich and one in Lausanne, corresponding to a total of around 800,000 city residents.\nThe potential ramifications of this study are so important that Cassi and Marie-Hélène Corre, another LCE biologist, received special authorization to work at their EPFL lab during the lockdown. They were particularly efficient in conducting their experiments since almost nobody else was using the testing equipment, as the campus was nearly deserted. But the researchers had to be extra careful because the novel coronavirus – even though it comes from a known viral family – is nevertheless a zoonotic virus. “The main characteristic of this virus is that it has envelope – its viral capsid is enveloped in a biological membrane,” says Corre. “The seasonal flu virus and HIV also have envelopes.”\n© 2020 Alain Herzog / Marie-Hélène Corre analyzes samples from Swiss wastewater treatment plants\nGoal: early warning system\nThe samples collected since the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in Switzerland are valuable archives. However, the main goal of this study is not to retrace the past but to develop an early warning system. Ort says: “With samples from 20 large treatment plants distributed across Switzerland, we could monitor wastewater from around 2.5 million people.” If the samples are analyzed rapidly, we could probably detect a resurgence of infections earlier than with diagnostic tests – about a week earlier – especially during the period when the lockdown is being lifted. Ort has long been concerned with wastewater-based epidemiology, previously focusing on comparisons of drug use across Europe. “Wastewater doesn’t lie – it reflects what has been excreted by a population within a few hours,” he says. The research team has drawn on their established contacts with local government agencies and wastewater treatment plants.\nTracking infection trends, not absolute case numbers\nSince the researchers were able to successfully detect low viral concentrations at the early stage of the Covid-19 outbreak in Switzerland, they should be able to reconstruct the infection curve. But it will still take a few weeks to analyze the over 300 samples currently in frozen storage at Eawag and EPFL. They won’t be able to calculate the exact number of infections using these data, since there is too much variation in how much of the virus each patient sheds. What will be important to track, however, is the trend. For example, using samples collected in Lausanne in March and April, the researchers were able to roughly trace the increase in the wastewater concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Kohn estimates that the concentration rose by a factor of between ten and a hundred.\n© 2020 Eawag, Andri Bryne / Tamar Kohn EPFL and Carola Bänziger Eawag (right)\n After careful preparation of the samples, a search is carried out to find information on the RNA of the new coronavirus.\nComplex method\nDespite the researchers’ initial success, they still need to further improve their method. For example, they don’t yet know what percentage of the wastewater's viral load is captured when the RNA is extracted after a number of other steps (filtration and centrifugation). There is also much uncertainty in the subsequent selective amplification process for the target sequence. Only when the amount of uncertainty is reduced will they be able to draw robust conclusions about viral concentrations in the original samples.\nCoronavirus unlikely to spread via water or wastewater\nWhile genetic material from the novel coronavirus can be detected in wastewater, there is no evidence at present to suggest that the pathogen spreads via water or wastewater. Drinking water in Switzerland is of excellent microbiological quality and remains fit for consumption even during the pandemic.\nContacts \nSandy Evangelista EPFL Mediacom\n +41 79 502 81 06\n Tamar Kohn Director of the Environmental chemistry laboratory (LCE)\n +41 21 693 08 91\n Xavier Fernandez Cassi Environmental Microbiologist LCE\n +41 21 693 0864\nMarie-Hélène Corre Biochemist LCE\n +41 21 693 8036\nAndri Bryner Medias manager Eawag\n +41 58 765 51 04", "summary": "EPFL researchers, working in association with the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), have developed a method for detecting the novel coronavirus in wastewater samples.

In order to accurately determine their toxicity, EPFL researchers have developed an analytical tool for measuring the oxidative stress that some of them provoke on cells. They used optical techniques, such as measuring the light absorbed by certain proteins. This research is being published today in Nature Scientific Reports.\nWhen a cell is exposed to a toxic product or a pathogen, this causes the internal equilibrium between the oxidants and antioxidants within the cell to break. Then the former, generally oxygen derivatives, are produced in excessive quantities and start to attack the cell’s proteins, sugars and its membrane. This brings about a faster cellular aging, causes certain diseases to the cell, and may even lead to its death.\nThus, the overproduction of such oxidants is a sign that the cell is stressed, and that is exactly what researchers wanted to measure. At the same time, they noticed that cytochrome c, a protein present in the cellular membrane, was a particularly interesting biosensor. They found that when it was exposed to certain wavelengths of light, this protein would absorb less light when in the presence of one of these oxidizing agents: hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, they developed a complex method for measuring the variations of light absorbed by cytochrome c. Finally, they tested and verified their method on small unicellular algae.\nMore or less harmful depending on the environment\nTo this day there were no truly reliable methods for measuring oxidative stress continuously and without damaging the cells. This new test has opened interesting possibilities for identifying not only the effect of nanomaterials, but also, on a wider perspective, the way cells react to an external perturbation. In addition, during their experiments researchers were able to observe that the toxicity of certain products could be conditioned and modulated by its surrounding environment. For example; a nanomaterial may be less dangerous under a laboratory microscope than within a river’s waters.\n\"The test that we propose is highly sensitive and able to indicate the concentration of oxygen derivatives in a thorough and detailed way, said Olivier Martin, director of the Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM). Since it is based in assessing a substance released outside the cells, it is also non-invasive. Therefore, it does not destroy the living organism and can be applied over a period of several hours making it possible to observe the evolution of the situation over time.\" Tests continue to be made on different types of materials\n\"Sensing the dynamics of oxidative stress using enhanced absorption in protein-loaded random media\", Guillaume Suarez, Christian Santschi, Vera I.

The website, which was developed by a start-up based at EPFL, is a way for property owners and managers, such as hotels, coworking spaces and companies, to reach out to potential users.\nBook it in 30 seconds\n Once the user enters the desired date and time, the website shows the available spaces along with a description and the price, all in real time. It only takes 30 seconds to make a booking. The website is initially being launched for the Motor Show, starting on 1 March, and will then be a permanent fixture. A life-size test for the start-up. And for Palexpo, who intends to use its services for other shows. \" The simplicity of use of this technology could be useful for the reservation of our rooms for other large-scale shows \", underlines Manuel Garcia, director of technology and finances at Palexpo.\nThe system is designed to be flexible and collaborative. People with space to rent propose time slots directly to the user. They set the price, which can change in real time in order to draw in users and maximize occupancy. Users can rate the spaces for such things as quality and confidentiality. “This latter point is very important for business meetings,” said Nicolas Fete, who heads the start-up. “For example, the highest level of confidentiality means that the room can be reached without walking through the main hallways.” This service indeed appears to fill a gap, since a variety of organizations, including the Geneva train station, are keen to use it.\nFête is full of ideas and ambition for developing the website further. To ensure his platform has a solid technological base to which these options can be easily added, Fete is working in collaboration with Christine Vanoirbeek, head of group at the MEDIA research lab. Solutions that were initially developed as part of a European project that she piloted will bring important new features to the platform alongside lower development and maintenance costs than those associated with current technologies.\nAn alternative to working at home\n A business trip to Singapore helped convince Fete to start his own company. He was looking for somewhere quiet to work in the Asian metropolis. No luck. “When you’re abroad, it’s even harder to find an office,” he said. “The advantage of GetYourDesk is that users don’t have to be familiar with the region to find an office, because the website guarantees the quality of the workspaces.” He also plans to expand his service beyond Switzerland’s borders in the near future. Isn’t there already something similar on the market? “Nothing as flexible and efficient.” Fête believes that his concept could change the way people work: “This platform could help reduce work-related travel by providing an alternative to working at home.

{"id": 369, "text": "Technology now allows us to read facial expressions and identify which of the seven universal emotions a person is feeling: fear, anger, joy, sadness, disgust, surprise, or suspicion. This is very useful in video game development, medicine, marketing, and, perhaps less obviously, in driver safety. We know that in addition to fatigue, the emotional state of the driver is a risk factor. Irritation, in particular, can make drivers more aggressive and less attentive. EPFL researchers, in collaboration with PSA Peugeot Citroën, have developed an on-board emotion detector based on the analysis of facial expressions. Tests carried out using a prototype indicate that the idea could have promising applications.\nIt’s not easy to measure emotions within the confines of a car, especially non-invasively. The solution explored by scientists in EPFL’s Signal Processing 5 Laboratory (LTS5), who specialize in facial detection, monitoring and analysis, is to get drivers’ faces to do the job. In collaboration with PSA Peugeot Citroën, LTS5 adapted a facial detection device for use in a car, using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel.\nThe problem was to get the device to recognize irritation on the face of a driver. Everyone expresses this state somewhat differently – a kick, an epithet, a nervous tic or an impassive face. To simplify the task at this stage of the project, Hua Gao and Anil Yüce, who spearheaded the research, chose to track only two expressions: anger and disgust, whose manifestations are similar to those of anger.\nTwo phases of tests were carried out. First, the system “learned” to identify the two emotions using a series of photos of subjects expressing them. Then the same exercise was carried out using videos. The images were taken both in an office setting as well as in real life situations, in a car that was made available for the project.\nThe rapidity with which the comparison between filmed images and thus detection could be carried out depended on the analysis methods used. But overall, the system worked well and irritation could be accurately detected in the majority of cases. When the test failed, it was usually because this state is very variable from individual to individual. This is where the difficulty will always lie, given the diversity of how we express anger. Additional research aims to explore updating the system in real-time – to complement the static database – a self-taught human-machine interface, or a more advanced facial monitoring algorithm, says Hua Gao.\nDetecting emotions is only one indicator for improving driver safety and comfort. In this project, it was coupled with a fatigue detector that measures the percentage of eyelid closure. The LTS5 is also working on detecting other states on drivers’ faces such as distraction, and on lip reading for use in vocal recognition. These projects are coordinated by EPFL’s Transportation Center and carried out in collaboration with PSA Peugeot Citroën.", "summary": "EPFL scientists are studying how to identify drivers’ emotions using embedded cameras that film their faces.", "claim": "EPFL scientists are studying how to identify drivers’ emotions using embedded cameras that film his faces.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [15, 15], "noise": false}
{"id": 371, "text": "On 4 October 2016, Hurricane Matthew wrought havoc in southwestern Haiti. The cholera outbreak that it triggered, coming in the middle of the rainy season, simply added to the prevailing chaos in that country.\nResearchers at EPFL were soon contacted by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and asked for their help in predicting the number of new cases of cholera in real time. What for? To provide organizations battling the epidemic on the ground with the information they need to make the right decisions at the right time.\nThis is the first time that EPFL and MSF have teamed up to fight an epidemic. Their approach is based on a mathematical model that EPFL built in 2010; the researchers simply had to redesign it so that it would provide real-time projections. The model factors in a broad range of data associated with the spread of cholera, including the latest recorded cases, people flows, and rain forecasts.\n“When Hurricane Matthew hit, MSF saw a need for EPFL's model, which is widely recognized in this field. We were familiar with the model and asked the researchers to apply it to the current epidemic,” says Anton Camacho, who specializes in modeling infectious diseases. Camacho works for Epicentre, an association that conducts epidemiological research for MSF.\nIn mid-October, two researchers in EPFL's Laboratory of Ecohydrology (ECHO) took up the challenge: Flavio Finger, a PhD student in environmental engineering who specializes in modeling cholera epidemics, and Damiano Pasetto, a mathematician doing a postdoc at EPFL with expertise in real-time projections. The researchers turn their projections into best- and worst-case epidemic scenarios, and the information is then sent to Camacho at Epicentre, who includes them in the reports provided to the specialists working to contain the outbreak.\nObjective and non-political data\nThe scenarios that the researchers predict add a scientific component to the information gathered on the ground. Their projections supported the World Health Organization's (WHO) decision to run a vaccination campaign in departments in southern Haiti in November: “The researchers’ objective and non-political data proved crucial when the World Health Organization decided to deliver a million vaccine doses this past fall during the rainy season,” says Camacho. “Their model is very flexible. We can factor in ongoing vaccination efforts, predict how the epidemic will develop over time and plan future vaccination campaigns.” Flavio Finger adds: “That said, we must bear in mind that our projections always include a margin of error. For example, the rain forecasts provided by NASA are accurate in the short term but less so over longer periods. It can also be hard to predict where people will go, especially in the midst of an outbreak.”\nFinger had already worked on this model in 2013 in Haiti and this past spring in Senegal (see article links below). In both cases, however, modeling was carried out after the cholera epidemics had ended. That back-testing approach – mapping out how those epidemics spread – was used to refine the existing model, and in Haiti’s current crisis, the model’s real-time capability is crucial. This is where Pasetto’s math skills and Finger’s in-depth knowledge of the subject come into play.\nWorking together seamlessly\n“Working together and seeing the impact immediately adds a whole new dimension and sense of urgency to our research,” said Finger. Camacho notes: “This initiative is a good example of how an NGO and the academic world can work together effectively. We were able to act quickly in response to an evolving epidemic. Analyzing data in real time forced us to work differently – this included automating our processes in order to save time.”\nMSF decided to publish the researchers’ data on an  throughout the process. Both MSF and the EPFL team say that this model could be applied to cholera outbreaks in other regions. Their results will also be included in official MSF reports and in future scientific publications.\nSince the cholera epidemic first struck Haiti in 2010, it has killed nearly 10,000 people and infected 800,000 more. With the rainy season now coming to an end, new cases are on the decline, but the EPFL researchers and MSF will nevertheless set up a system for monitoring the epidemic in the medium term.\nThis project is being overseen by Professor Andrea Rinaldo, director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Ecohydrology (ECHO), and Enrico Bertuzzo, a former EPFL researcher who is now an associate professor at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice.", "summary": "In October, EPFL and Médecins Sans Frontières joined forces in an unprecedented effort to predict how the cholera epidemic in Haiti will spread.

{"id": 376, "text": "The great Lake Kariba, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, is contained by an imposing 128-meter-high arch dam, built between 1955 and 1959. The lake is twice the volume of Lake Geneva, and drains a basin equivalent to 16 times the surface area of Switzerland.\nThe nature of the climate of this tropical zone obliges the owner of the dam, the Zambezi River Authority, to regularly open the enormous spillway gates during floods. This operation, however, has consequences: in the bed of the Zambezi river, a huge scour hole has been eroded by high-velocity jets leaving the six spillway openings – each 9 meters by 9 – with a rate of 9 million liters per second. “This scour hole is now 70 to 80 meters deeper than the river bed”, explains Anton Schleiss, Director of EPFL’s Hydraulic Constructions Laboratory. \nWorld-renowned for its competence in the study of the erosion of rock formations by high-velocity jets, the laboratory was commissioned by the Zambezi River Authority to assess the gravity of the situation. “However, no sensor would be able to resist the violence of the water flowing into this river”, explains Michael Pfister, scientific employee at the LCH. “This is why it was necessary to proceed with creating a model of the dam and the river below it.”\nThe physical model was designed and developed in about three months by teams from EPFL and some external providers. It’s 65 times smaller than the actual dam. “Mathematical similarity laws enable us to extrapolate the measurements that we take on our physical model, to determine what happens under real conditions”, explains Anton Schleiss. And this, “even though certain parameters such as the viscosity of the water don’t change with respect to the scale”, adds Michael Pfister. “This is the essence of the art of modeling: to choose the right scale in order to get usable results, while keeping the hydraulic model to a reasonable size.”\nThe systematic measurements, taken using pressure sensors installed in the bottom of the model, were began last week. The model dam is powered by the laboratory pumps, working in a closed circuit, that enable the circulation of more than 300 liters per second.\nThe scientists will now try to modify certain parameters, in order to identify practical solutions and mitigation measures which should avoid the problems that the owners of the dam will certainly face if the erosion continues at the same rate. “It will probably mean enlarging the scour hole in downstream direction, using underwater mining methods, to allow a more efficient dissipation of these enormous amount of energy”, believes Anton Schleiss.

Wearing TWIICE, Pan started by learning all the gestures of the circuit with slow and deliberate movements. As the training sessions continued, Pan progressively stepped up the intensity and tempo of her movements to increase her speed. During the race, she was followed by two scientists to ensure her safety.\nImprovement of the exoskeleton \n “Since the beginning of the training sessions, the exoskeleton has been in constant improvement thanks to Silke's input and her drive to win,” explains Tristan Vouga. “We gained 4 minutes in the last month and 45 seconds during the last training session alone. Our latest upgrade consists of a more flexible foot that can conform to the terrain. More generally, the latest version of the exoskeleton is much more ergonomic and provides more autonomy for its pilot, so Silke for instance can now go directly from her wheelchair into the exoskeleton by herself.\"\n The current version of the exoskeleton, called TWIICE One, is more compact due to improved design of the motors, thanks to a collaboration with Swiss industry partner Sonceboz SA, specialized in electrical motor manufacturing. According to Vouga, TWIICE One is therefore easier to use than the 2016 model: it is closer to the body because the motors are two times more compact and two times stronger. Other strategic partnerships include a collaboration with the local company Fischer Connectors for improving the ergonomics and usability of cables.\nOnline race\n The latest coronavirus sanitary measures prevented the Cybathlon from happening live in Zürich. Silke Pan's participation in the exoskeleton race was therefore organized and pre-recorded at EPFL. The winner was determined based on three rounds of the race. The performances of each athlete was recorded in the presence of a referee from the Cybathlon committee, in their country of residence.\nA fundamental right to mobility\n “An exoskeleton to assist a person affected by paraplegia does not only concern mobility. It also concerns basic human rights, the right to live as others, the right to share social spaces, the right to walk and to own vertical space,” says Bouri. “Alongside our colleagues in Zürich, our participation via EPFL at the Cybathlon promotes an attitude in favor of increasing access to exoskeleton technology for providing daily assistance to a wider audience.”\n The development of TWIICE first began in 2015. The exoskeleton team has won 3 years in a row the \"Cybathlon experience\", a European exoskeleton competition also organized by the Cybathlon committee. The Cybathlon is a Swiss-organized competition that happens every 4 years to promote\n technologies that assist people with impairments in their daily activities.\nThe EPFL Vice-Presidency for Innovation supports the Cybathlon , which consists of around forty laboratories at the service of sports for the physically challenged, for health and for performance. The initiative is part of , which brings together 9 regional academic players and contributes to making the Lake Geneva region a prime place for developing projects related to sports and health. The Cybathlon demonstrates how a sporting event can stimulate research and development, can drive knowledge creation for society, and open up economic prospects by fostering an entrepreneurial spirit.\nEPFL’s participation at the Cybathlon is possible thanks to the generous support from EPFL's Vice Presidency for Innovation and its initiative Smart Move, the Fondation Avenir Plus, the Bâloise Group, Fischer Connectors SA, Sonceboz SA, NCCR Robotics and EPFL’s Center for Intelligent Systems.\nContact for the media:", "summary": "Paraplegic athlete Silke Pan brilliantly represented EPFL at the 2020 Cybathlon this weekend.

{"id": 382, "text": "Luzzone, located some 2,150 meters high in Ticino’s Malvaglia valley, was a small hamlet used by mountain herders and their livestock. It was abandoned in the 1950s and today lies mostly in ruins. But this past weekend, the workshop’s 120 participants teamed up to restore and remodel the ancient structures.\nOf the hamlet’s original ten buildings, one is still being used, one is falling down and six others are in ruins. “These functional buildings were made entirely of stone and measured just four meters long by four meters wide. They served as stables and as mountain huts for herders during the summer and were typical of life in the Alps, and especially Ticino, at the time,” says Patrick Giromini, a PhD student in architecture and assistant at EPFL’s Arts of Sciences Laboratory (LAPIS) and one of the workshop organizers.\nRemodeling, not rebuilding \nThe students first identified the original layout of the buildings’ walls – which are now nothing more than piles of stones. Any stones sitting outside the perimeter of the hamlet were carried back to their original structures and used to rebuild some of the walls. This helped restore the volumes of the original buildings. Rather than reconstructing the buildings, however, the students put their creative juices to work in order to remodel them.\nTicino architect and EPFL graduate Martino Pedrozzi () came up with the idea for the project. Currently a guest lecturer at the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture at the Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI), he has been involved in this kind of remodeling work for over 20 years. “There are many examples of this rural heritage scattered throughout the Alps, not just in Ticino. The question is, what should we do with these ruins? Given their remote locations, they are virtually useless. But by remodeling them, we can give them a purpose: to serve as landmarks. That is a function they once had but have since lost,” he says.\nThe students’ project therefore aimed not just at preserving the region’s heritage, but also at bringing it to people’s attention and underscoring the importance of our rural memory. “It also introduced the students to the rigors of rural life. Every summer, for example, the farmers had to repair snow damage,” says Giromini.\nSurprisingly popular \nThe workshop was run jointly by three Swiss architecture schools: the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture at USI, EPFL’s architecture department and ETH Zurich’s Institute for Spatial and Landscape Development. This was the first time these three schools teamed up for a workshop. The project also received support from the municipality of Serravalle, where the ruins are located.\n“We expected around 30 students to sign up – ten from each school. But we ended up with 120 people on the registration list. We never thought our workshop would be so popular!” says Nicola Braghieri, head of EPFL’s architecture department and of LAPIS.\nAn unforgettable experience \nThe workshop also gave the students a chance to team up with peers from a variety of backgrounds. They travelled from Mendrisio, Lausanne and Zurich to the foot of Mount Luzzone, which they hiked up for 90 minutes to reach the ruins. After spending the day remodeling the hamlet, they camped out there for the night. “A workshop like this is always a unique experience and I enjoy them every time,” says Agathe Loeb, a Master’s student in architecture at EPFL and program participant. “You usually meet people from different schools and even different countries, who bring an entirely different perspective on architecture. Speaking with them can be really interesting – it opens your mind and breaks you out of your routine ways of thinking.” Not to mention that the entire experience – from performing back-breaking work to camping out in rustic conditions – is bound to leave a lasting impression.\nWhile this particular workshop involved remodeling stone structures in Ticino, the same format could be used for just about any kind of abandoned heritage site in the Alps. “At LAPIS, we have been studying the preservation of mountain huts and pastures for five years now, mainly in the canton of Valais. But since many of those structures are made from wood in addition to stone, we would have to adapt the workshop format slightly. It’s definitely something worth considering,” says Braghieri.", "summary": "Around 120 architecture students, including some from EPFL, took part in a unique workshop on Mount Luzzone in Ticino on 6–7 July 2019.

{"id": 384, "text": "Unlike electronic circuits, optical, or “photonic”, circuits work with light rather than electricity, which makes them 10 to 100 times faster. They are also more energy-efficient because they show lower heat loss, better signal-to-noise ratios and are less susceptible to interference. Used especially for communications (e.g. fiber optics), optical circuits may use tiny optical cavities as ‘switches’ that can block or allow the flow of light, similarly to transistors in electronics. EPFL scientists have now fabricated and experimentally tested a silicon-based ‘photonic crystal nanocavity’ (PCN) that requires an unprecedentedly low amount of energy to operate as a switch. The findings, which have significant implications for the future of optical technologies, are published in a paper that features on the cover of \nApplied Physics Letters\n.\nOptical circuits and optical cavities\nOptical circuits control light the way an electrical circuit controls the flow of electricity. Compared to electrical circuits, optical systems show superior speed, energy-efficiency and stability. Already used in fiber optic communications, the field of applied photonics is making steady progress in developing optical circuits, which use nanoscale ‘optical cavities’ as switches or ‘transistors’ for controlling the flow of light.\nOptical cavities confine light in a tiny space of a few nanometers. ‘Squeezed’ in such a small volume, a tiny amount of incoming light is enough to cause a small change in the wavelength of the trapped light, because of the optical properties of the material from which the cavity is made. These properties are referred to as “non-linear”, meaning that if a small amount of light can make the optical cavity resonate, a higher light intensity can cause it to actually switch between two different states. This effect, called “optical bi-stability” is ultimately what makes the optical cavity to act as a switch for light.\nOne of the challenges in the design and development of optical circuits is their efficiency in terms of speed and energy consumption. These two features are linked together, as an optical circuit’s total absorbed power depends on the energy required by a single ‘switch’ operation multiplied by the number of operations per second. Consequently, the most likely cavities to be implemented in an optical circuit must be designed for minimal switching energy.\nA new, low-energy transistor for light\nThe groups of Romuald Houdré and Vincenzo Savona at EPFL have now designed, fabricated and successfully tested an optical cavity based on a ‘photonic crystal nanostructure’ (PCN), which requires a record-low energy to switch on and off. The PCN is made from a silicon slab, and combines a record-small size with a very high quality, or “Q”, factor, which is a measurement of how long the PCN can retain light. The measured Q factor of the new PCN device is 500,000, meaning that an incoming photon will bounce back and forth inside the optical cavity five hundred thousand times before escaping.\nA high Q factor means that photons spend more time inside the cavity. The new PCN also has a very small size, which produces a higher light intensity for the same energy. “The nonlinearity is proportional to the intensity and the effect is stronger if you allow for longer buildup times,” explains Savona. “This is because light interacts longer with the material that provides the nonlinearity.” The combination of a high Q factor with a small size is why the new PCN requires very low energy for acting as a switch.\n“In this work we have achieved non-linear effects at a record-low intensity of light,” says Romuald Houdré. “Our structure is also one of the smallest ever designed to show such record nonlinear properties, and it may be built using standard nanofabrication technology. This is a very important step along the road to optical circuits, as small size, speed and low power consumption are key requirements for the realization of an efficient optical switching nano-device.”\nReference\nDharanipathy UP, Minkov M, Tonin M, Savona V, Houdré R. \nHigh-Q silicon photonic crystal cavity for enhanced optical nonlinearities.\nApplied Physics Letters\n 08 September 2014.

{"id": 385, "text": "The giant planets in our solar system are made mainly of hydrogen, mostly in a liquid state. Near the planets’ surface, hydrogen exists in an insulating, molecular form – H\n2\n – but closer to the center, it takes on a metallic form where individual atoms can move around freely. Professor Michele Ceriotti, who heads the Laboratory of Computational Science and Modelling (COSMO) within EPFL’s School of Engineering, along with colleagues from the University of Cambridge and IBM Zurich, have used computer simulations to understand the nature of this elusive transition. “Hydrogen is the simplest element on the periodic table: it’s made of one proton and one electron. That’s one reason why scientists study it so much. What makes this phenomenon on giant planets fairly unique – and interesting – is that the transition is between two forms of a liquid state, and not from a liquid to a gaseous or solid state,” says Ceriotti.\nAn extremely complicated system to model\nThis transition has been the focus of an intense research effort – many research groups have tried to gain a better understanding by replicating it in a laboratory. “But that’s really difficult because you have to create the same conditions here on Earth as those on Saturn and Jupiter, which means achieving pressures that are around a million times greater than that of the Earth’s atmosphere, and then analyzing samples that have been exposed to those pressures. As you can imagine, examining compounds under those conditions isn’t easy. Various studies have been conducted, but their findings are often controversial because they differ substantially from each other,” says Ceriotti. So rather than trying to recreate giant planets’ atmospheric conditions in a lab, his team used highly precise computer models to simulate them digitally. Previous attempts to do so involved solving on the fly equations describing the quantum mechanical behavior of fluid hydrogen. The complexity of such equations limited the scope of such simulations to just a few atoms at a time and the time scale to less than one billionth of a second.\nSaving time\nUsing their expertise in computer simulation and machine-learning-based models, the team was able to expand the scope and time scale of their simulations and gain insight into the mechanisms at work in the hydrogen transition. That required using very powerful computers. “It was a considerable investment in terms of time and energy. Running our models – which we developed using machine learning – took several weeks on EPFL’s supercomputers. But if we’d tried to run models developed the conventional way, it would’ve taken hundreds of millions of years,” says Ceriotti.\nA smooth transition\nBased on their results, the research team came up with a possible explanation for why previous studies produced such different results, which might be traced to the interpretation of experimental observations, and the nature of the liquid-liquid transition. “Until now, all the studies that tried to model hydrogen’s behavior on giant planets assumed that the transition from an insulating to a metallic form was clear-cut. But our simulations indicate that the transition takes place gradually. As a consequence, the exact moment where the transition occurs depends on the choice of criteria, and the observable being monitored – which could explain the dependence on the details of the experiments.” says Ceriotti. “Now that we’ve modeled the ‘ideal’ system, our next step will be to study more realistic – and therefore more complex – conditions, where hydrogen is mixed with helium and other compounds in the planets’ atmospheres.” Thanks to computer simulations and machine learning we’re now one step closer to unlocking the mystery of the giant gaseous planets in our solar system, and potentially of exoplanets as well.", "summary": "Using computer simulations powered by machine-learning algorithms EPFL scientists have made an important breakthrough in understanding how hydrogen behaves on Saturn and Jupiter. Their research has just been published in Nature.", "claim": "Using computer simulations powered by machine-learning algorithms EPFL scientists have made an important breakthrough in understanding how hydrogen behaves on Saturn and Jupiter. Your research has just been published in Nature.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [27, 27], "noise": false}
{"id": 387, "text": "Why are so few young people, particularly women, currently attracted to degree courses in ICT? \n The world is changing rapidly, as is the way in which the sciences are perceived. By the end of the eighties, everyone wanted to study ICT. In the collective imagination, it was something new and full of prospects for the future. At that time, women already had a very strong presence in the industry. Now, the computer has become such an everyday item, and so easy to use, that its many facets are overlooked. Most people think that being an IT engineer means becoming a programmer or developing websites. Of the algorithms that enable us to solve a problem, some are indeed highly abstract and unknown to the general public. The other image that does our industry no favours and is highly prevalent at the moment is that of the “geek”. You envisage a long-haired loner spending all his time in front of a screen – not a very attractive idea for young people, especially girls. Actually, I believe that women often have an educational advantage that helps them to become even better engineers than men. They are given responsibility at a much younger age, particularly in traditional societies where they look after the home, their brothers and sisters, etc. The ability to do several things at once, and make sure that everything is going well becomes second nature. Being an engineer is not a matter of performing tasks, but rather of being versatile: knowing how to find information, resolve problems and ensure that everything goes smoothly.\nWhat do you think can be done to encourage girls to follow in your footsteps and change this image?\n The key to changing the collective imagination is education. For example, the timetable in the first year of an ICT degree is filled with courses in maths, physics, programming languages and other technical subjects. There are no courses that focus on what makes ICT a science. To remedy this problem, we are working with the new Dean of the faculty and the other professors to prepare a special module that addresses this issue. Most universities worldwide are thinking along the same lines at the moment. Feedback by word of mouth will of course help some years from now in changing more widely the popular perception of computer engineering. Yet it might also be a good idea for experts to set up this kind of course for secondary school students. We could easily imagine the same sort of content for young people of 15 years of age. \nWhy did you do your degree in this field, and what advice would you give to young people who are currently making their choices?\n I chose to study ICT because it’s difficult! It’s a very personal matter, but I’ve always loved a challenge. I wanted to become a chemical engineer at first, but then someone told me about the new IT department that was opening at the University of Patra in Greece. That was in 1985, and I had never seen a computer before. The prospect of a new challenge then prompted me to make it my first choice. I then became caught up in it – I was captivated by its air of mystery. At EPFL, working with young people, as well as my highly qualified colleagues, enables me to reassess myself every day: it’s what makes me move forward. How many people can say that they are still learning every day after working in the same field for 25 years? I think that young people should be advised by those who love what they do, instead of listening to people who talk to them about their profession in a negative way. This will enable them to see the full potential of the career that is opening up to them.", "summary": "The UN agency for information and communication technologies (ITU) has organized a debate on the low level of female participation in this discipline.

This is the case particularly at night, when it comes to changing lanes in the middle of motorists. Based on this reality, five doctoral students of the Electronics Laboratory (ELab) at EPFL have developed a smart illuminating wristband for added safety when riding in traffic. Equipped with LED and other electronics, the bracelet flashes when the cyclist reaches out to indicate a lane change. Called \"Intelligent Blinker,\" the project was recognized at the Texas Instruments Analog Design Contest, a European competition held in Munich.\nRunning on Solar Energy\n The principle of the bracelet is relatively simple. The device consists of an accelerometer and a magnetometer - a kind of compass - that can detect the position of the user's arm. When the rider reaches out laterally, the accelerometer and magnetometer provide data to a microcontroller, which directs the LED to engage. \"According to the habits of the rider, it's possible to adjust the angle at which the LED starts flashing,\" says Pietro Buccella, one of the students participating in the project. The bracelet is also equipped with small solar panels connected to a battery. It is therefore possible to run it only on solar energy. \"We still equipped it with a USB port to enable recharging with a computer, if necessary,\" says the student.\nTowards a multi-function wristband\n At a size of about five square centimeters, the circuit controlling the operation of the wristband is too bulky to be worn comfortably.

{"id": 394, "text": "If there was ever life on Mars, its traces are most likely to be found at the planet’s poles. Or more specifically, in its polar layered deposits, which are layers of ice and dust that have built up over thousands of years. So, according to a team of EPFL scientists, the poles would be the most logical place to set up a research base and, potentially, colonies. This team has mapped out a step-by-step strategy along with the required technology to build a research base on Mars that would be self-sustaining and that could accommodate a long-term manned presence. The results of their work will soon be published in \nActa Astronautica\n and is being presented today at the Entretiens Internationaux du Tourisme du Futur conference in Vixouze, France.\n“The poles may pose more challenges in the beginning, but they are the best location for the long term since they harbor natural resources that we may be able to use,” says Anne-Marlene Rüede, lead author of the study and a student minoring in Space Technology at EPFL’s Space Engineering Center (eSpace). And even though the scientists are thinking well into the future – colonies that would be developed over several generations – they still went into great detail in their design. “We wanted to develop a strategy based on technologies that have been selected accordingly and outline a test scenario so that 20 years from now, astronauts will be able to carry out this kind of space mission,” she adds.\nFirst the base, then the crew\nThe EPFL scientists’ strategy involves sending a six-person crew to Mars’ north pole during the polar summer, to take advantage of the 288 days of continuous light, and then return them safely to Earth. The first novel element of their strategy is that it would take place in two phases. First, robots would be sent up to build a minimal living space for the crew and to test the natural resources available on site. Then the crew would be brought in. This approach would minimize the payload that space shuttles would have to carry and make the mission as safe as possible for the crew members. However, engineers have yet to develop rockets that can handle 110 metric tons of equipment.\nSo that the research base can sustain a manned presence for nine months – and eventually even longer – the plan is to make maximum use of the natural resources found on Mars, first and foremost water. The discovery of ice at the poles means the base could theoretically produce water, oxygen and nitrogen – compounds essential for human life. Other chemicals in Mars’ air (especially CO\n2\n) and soil (like silicon, iron, aluminum and sulfur) could potentially be used to make materials such as bricks, glass and plastic, or even fuels like hydrogen and methanol. All that would make the research base self-sustaining for the long haul.\nBut initially, vital resources like food and energy will have to be shuttled up from Earth. These might include freeze-dried food, a thorium reactor and batteries.\nA 3-meter-thick igloo\nThe research base would consist of three modules: a central core, capsules and a dome. The central core would be 12.5 meters high and 5 meters in diameter, and would house the minimal living space as well as everything the crew needed to live. The three capsules would be built around the minimal living space and serve as airlocks between that space and the exterior. Robots would set up these structures during the first phase of the mission. The dome would cover the entire base and would be made of polyethylene fiber covered with a three-meter thick layer of ice – creating a kind of igloo. The dome would also represent an additional living space, provide a second barrier to protect the crew against radiation and micrometeoroids, and help keep the pressure constant inside the base.\nAn orbit crane system \nAnother innovation in the scientists’ plan is to create a crane system that would orbit around Mars and be launched during the second mission. This system would serve as a transfer point between space shuttles coming up from Earth and the research base on Mars. A special crane vehicle designed by the scientists would offload equipment from space shuttles onto Mars’ surface. “The crane vehicle could be reused several times and would be powered by fuel produced on Mars. It would reduce the payload that space shuttles would have to carry up to the research base,” says Claudio Leonardi, another scientist involved in the study. “The vehicle’s docking system would be similar to that used on the International Space Station: once a shuttle was docked, the vehicle would unload the cargo and crew and set them down on Mars.” What makes their vehicle design unique is that the engines are located above the vehicle’s center of gravity and that the vehicle can be used for six missions. The fuel for the ascent would be made \nin situ\n and that for the descent would come from Earth.\n“We would need to conduct an initial mission to try everything out for the first time. And the better that initial mission is thought out, the faster we will be able to get things going and move on to colonization,” says Anne-Marlene Rüede. In reality, the scientists have not taken a stance on the prospect of colonizing Mars. But one of the key benefits of this research is that the systems it envisions could be used for robotic missions in general, whether Martian, lunar, terrestrial or otherwise.\nMore info\n:", "summary": "EPFL scientists have mapped out the steps required to build a self-sustaining research base on Mars that would be habitable for the long term.

{"id": 396, "text": "Blind people sometimes develop the amazing ability to perceive the contours of the room they’re in based only on auditory information. Bats and dolphins use the same echolocation technique for navigating in their environment.\nAt EPFL, a team from the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory (LCAV), under the direction of Professor Martin Vetterli, has developed a computer algorithm that can accomplish this from a sound that’s picked up by four microphones. Their experiment is being published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). “Our software can build a 3D map of a simple, convex room with a precision of a few millimeters,” explains PhD student Ivan Dokmanić.\nRandomly placed microphones\n As incredible as it may seem, the microphones don’t need to be carefully placed. “Each microphone picks up the direct sound from the source, as well as the echoes arriving from various walls,” Dokmanić continues. “The algorithm then compares the signal from each microphone. The infinitesimal lags that appear in the signals are used to calculate not only the distance between the microphones, but also the distance from each microphone to the walls and the sound source.”\nThis ability to “sort out” the various echoes picked up by the microphones is in itself a first. By analyzing each echo’s signal using “Euclidean distance matrices,” the system can tell whether the echo is rebounding for the first or second time, and determine the unique “signature” of each of the walls.\nThe researchers tested the algorithm at EPFL using a “clean” sound source in an empty room in which they changed the position of a movable wall. Their results confirmed the validity of the approach. A second experiment carried out in a much more complex environment – an alcove in the Lausanne Cathedral – gave good partial results. New tests using more microphones are very likely to yield improved results.\nMobile localization in buildings\n The team’s initial conclusions already point to interesting potential applications. “Architects could use this to design rooms – for example concert halls or auditoriums – based upon the specific acoustics they would like to create,” says Dokmanić.\nApplications in forensic science are also on the horizon: based on several recordings of the same setup, audio waves could yield information on elements in the room that cannot be seen. In the same vein, analyzing a telephone call from a person who is moving around a room could allow investigators to identify where the person is calling from.\nFinally, it might be possible to implement this algorithm in mobile devices and use them to deduce location information inside buildings – a place where GPS signals do not penetrate well. “There are already many applications, and we foresee many more.

{"id": 398, "text": "High-frequency electromagnetic waves are used to transmit and process information in microelectronic devices such as smartphones. It’s already appreciated that these waves can be compressed using magnetic oscillations known as spin waves or magnons. This compression could pave the way for the design of nanoscale, multifunctional microwave devices with a considerably reduced footprint. But first, scientists need to gain a better understanding of spin waves – or precisely how magnons behave and propagate in different structures.\nLearning more about aperiodic structures\nIn a study conducted by the doctoral assistant Sho Watanabe, postdoctoral researcher Dr. Vinayak Bhat, and further team members, the scientists from EPFL’s (LMGN) examined how electromagnetic waves propagate, and how they could be manipulated, in precisely engineered nanostructures known as artificial ferromagnetic quasicrystals. The quasicrystals have a unique property: their structure is aperiodic, meaning that their constituent atoms or tailor-made elements do not follow a regular, repeating pattern but are still arranged deterministically. Although this characteristic makes materials especially useful for the design of everyday and high-tech devices, it remains poorly understood.\nFaster, easier transmission of information\nThe LMGN team found that, under controlled conditions, a single electromagnetic wave coupled to an artificial quasicrystal splits into several spin waves, which then propagate within the structure. Each of these spin waves represents a different phase of the original electromagnetic wave, carrying different information. “It’s a very interesting discovery, because existing information-transmission methods follow the same principle,” says Dirk Grundler, an associate professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI). “Except you need an extra device, a multiplexer, to split the input signal because – unlike in our study – it doesn’t divide on its own.”\nGrundler also explains that, in conventional systems, the information contained in each wave can only be read at different frequencies – another inconvenience that the EPFL team overcame in their study. “In our two-dimensional quasicrystals, all the waves can be read at the same frequency,” he adds. The findings have been published in the journal \n.\nWaves that spread like worms\nThe researchers also observed that, rather than propagating randomly, the waves often moved like so-called Conway worms, named after a well-known mathematician John Horton Conway who also developed a model to describe the behavior and feeding patterns of prehistoric worms. Conway discovered that, within two-dimensional quasicrystals, constituent elements arrange like meandering worms following a Fibonacci sequence. Thereby they form selected one-dimensional quasicrystals. “Our study represents the first practical demonstration of this theoretical concept, proving that the sequences induce interesting functional properties of waves in a quasicrystal,” says Grundler.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have shown that electromagnetic waves coupled to precisely engineered structures known as artificial ferromagnetic quasicrystals allow for more efficient information transmission and processing at the nanoscale.

{"id": 399, "text": "At EPFL, researchers challenge a fundamental law and discover that more electromagnetic energy can be stored in wave-guiding systems than previously thought. The discovery has implications in telecommunications. Working around the fundamental law, they conceived resonant and wave-guiding systems capable of storing energy over a prolonged period while keeping a broad bandwidth. Their trick was to create asymmetric resonant or wave-guiding systems using magnetic fields.\nThe study, which has just been published in \nScience\n, was led by Kosmas Tsakmakidis, first at the University of Ottawa and then at EPFL’s  run by Hatice Altug, where the researcher is now doing post-doctoral research.\nThis breakthrough could have a major impact on many fields in engineering and physics. The number of potential applications is close to infinite, with telecommunications, optical detection systems and broadband energy harvesting representing just a few examples.\nCasting aside reciprocity\n Resonant and wave-guiding systems are present in the vast majority of optical and electronic systems. Their role is to temporarily store energy in the form of electromagnetic waves and then release them. For more than 100 hundred years, these systems were held back by a limitation that was considered to be fundamental: the length of time a wave could be stored was inversely proportional to its bandwidth. This relationship was interpreted to mean that it was impossible to store large amounts of data in resonant or wave-guiding systems over a long period of time because increasing the bandwidth meant decreasing the storage time and quality of storage.\nThis law was first formulated by K. S. Johnson in 1914, at Western Electric Company (the forerunner of Bell Telephone Laboratories). He introduced the concept of the \nQ\n factor, according to which a resonator can either store energy for a long time or have a broad bandwidth, but not both at the same time. Increasing the storage time meant decreasing the bandwidth, and vice versa. A small bandwidth means a limited range of frequencies (or ‘colors’) and therefore a limited amount of data.\nUntil now, this concept had never been challenged. Physicists and engineers had always built resonant systems – like those to produce lasers, make electronic circuits and conduct medical diagnoses – with this constraint in mind.\nBut that limitation is now a thing of the past. The researchers came up with a hybrid resonant / wave-guiding system made of a magneto-optic material that, when a magnetic field is applied, is able to stop the wave and store it for a prolonged period, thereby accumulating large amounts of energy. Then when the magnetic field is switched off, the trapped pulse is released.\nWith such asymmetric and non-reciprocal systems, it was possible to store a wave for a very long period of time while also maintaining a large bandwidth. The conventional time-bandwidth limit was even beaten by a factor of 1,000. The scientists further showed that, theoretically, there is no upper ceiling to this limit at all in these asymmetric (non-reciprocal) systems.\n“It was a moment of revelation when we discovered that these new structures did not feature any time-bandwidth restriction at all. These systems are unlike what we have all been accustomed to for decades, and possibly hundreds of years», says Tsakmakidis, the study’s lead author. \"Their superior wave-storage capacity performance could really be an enabler for a range of exciting applications in diverse contemporary and more traditional fields of research.” Hatice Altug adds. \nMedicine, the environment and telecommunications\n One possible application is in the design of extremely quick and efficient all-optical buffers in telecommunication networks. The role of the buffers is to temporarily store data arriving in the form of light through optical fibers. By slowing the mass of data, it is easier to process. Up to now, the storage quality had been limited.+\nWith this new technique, it should be possible to improve the process and store large bandwidths of data for prolonged times. Other potential applications include on-chip spectroscopy, broadband light harvesting and energy storage, and broadband optical camouflaging (“invisibility cloaking”). “The reported breakthrough is completely fundamental – we’re giving researchers a new tool. And the number of applications is limited only by one’s imagination,” sums up Tsakmakidis.\n-----\nSource: \nCover image capture: \nGeneric image illustrating wave-interference and resonant energy transfer from\n one source to another distant source or object, pertaining to the fundamental concept of\n resonances.\nStudy conducted by:\nKosmas Tsakmakidis, lead author, former researcher at the University of Ottawa and currently an EPFL Fellow in EPFL's \n Linfang Shen and collaborators, Institute of Space Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China and State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China\n Prof. Robert Boyd and collaborators, University of Ottawa\n Prof. Hatice Altug, director of EPFL's \n Prof. Alexandre Vakakis, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "summary": "EPFL researchers have found a way around what was considered a fundamental limitation of physics for over 100 years.

EPFL researchers have developed a way to control the texture of a screen so that the “feeling” of specific areas can be modified underneath a user’s fingertips. This technology, developed by EPFL’s Integrated Actuators Laboratory (LAI) in Neuchâtel, is being designed for smartphones, tablets, computers, and vending machines.\n“We’re adding the sense of touch to tactile surfaces,” says Christophe Winter, a PhD student in the LAI who is writing his thesis on the subject. “The term ‘touch screen’ that’s used to describe current technology is really a misnomer, because they only provide visual and auditory feedback.”\nBy adding another layer of information to devices, this invention will improve their usability and thus improve the user experience.

{"id": 402, "text": "A biomolecule that gained considerable attention over the past few years is cGAS, a \"DNA sensor\" that is involved in kickstarting immune responses in the body. Specifically, when a pathogen is infecting a cell, cGAS senses its DNA and begins a cascade of biochemical reactions that activate the body's so-called \"innate\" immune system – the first-line-of-defense part of our immune system.\nOne of the main scientific mysteries surrounding cGAS has been how it can distinguish self- from non-self DNA. But even more perplexing is the fact that cGAS also exists inside the cell's nucleus, where all the genetic material is stored.\nNow, scientists at EPFL and the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Switzerland have revealed an intriguing mechanism on how nucleosomes – the building units that package DNA inside the nucleus – bind and inactivate cGAS. Published in \nNature\n, the collaborative work was led by EPFL Professor Andrea Ablasser and FMI scientist Nicolas Thomä, and provides new insights into the biology of this immunity-crucial molecule.\nA nucleosome consists of a string of DNA wrapped around pairs, or “dimers”, of proteins called histones, like a thread around a spool. The mix of histones and DNA is referred to as “chromatin”.\nPrevious studies have found that when cells are treated with the anti-cancer drug aclarubicin, certain histones are “mobilized” from chromatin. At the same time, cGAS also becomes mobilized, which made the researchers in this study conclude that cGAS might somehow associate with the nucleosome in the cell. The idea was finally confirmed with biochemical assays that showed that the two can indeed interact.\nTo further understand this phenomenon, the scientists used cryo-electron microscopy to see, on a structural level, how nucleosomes bind to cGAS. Studying the complex formed by cGAS and nucleosomes at a resolution of 3.1 Ångstroms (0.31 nm), they found that cGAS binds to the so-called “acidic patch” of the nucleosome; a negatively charged platform that commonly binds proteins. Once bound there, both histones and the nucleosome DNA “trap” cGAS in a state in which it is unable to engage or sense DNA, and is therefore functionally inactivated.\nBottom: DNA (dark blue) wrapped around a nucleosome (green) to which cGAS (yellow) is tethered: this is the “inhibited” state of cGAS. On the upper part, cGAS is bound on free/naked DNA: in this configuration, the enzyme is active and produces a messenger molecule cGAMP (in red). Credit: Digizyme\nTo validate their findings, the scientists introduced mutations to the cGAS-acidic patch interface, which effectively prevented cGAS from binding the nucleosome. This was enough to remove the blocking effect of the nucleosome on cGAS, and unleashed a strong immune response in living cells.\nThe work offers the first structural clue to how chromatin interferes with the activity of cGAS. It reveals the structural basis of cGAS interaction with chromatin provides scientists with a mechanism of how cGAS can discriminate between its own cell’s DNA and that of foreign pathogens.\nOther contributors\nUniversity of Basel\nEPFL Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering (ISIC)", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL and the Friedrich Miescher Institute have used cryo-electron microscopy to explain how a DNA-sensing biomolecule that is key to our innate immunity response is inactivated when it comes in contact with the cell’s own DNA.", "claim": "Scientists at EPFL and the Friedrich Miescher Institute have used cryo-electron microscopy to explain how a DNA-sensing biomolecule that is key to my innate immunity response is inactivated when it comes in contact with the cell’s own DNA.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [26, 26], "noise": false}
{"id": 403, "text": "Biology is swaddled in lipids: fats, oils, and even waxes envelop cells and their organelles, mediate the flow of vast biological information networks, protect fragile tissues, and store essential energy across multiple organisms.\nBut despite their importance, lipids have traditionally been among the hardest biomolecules to study because of the diversity of their molecular structures, which are not determined by the well-defined building blocks and simple rules that govern DNA, RNA, and proteins. And this diversity means that, unlike building and analyzing genome and transcriptome databases, lipids require more customized analytic procedures.\nBecause of this, it is very difficult to study either the physiological function of a vast majority of lipid species or the way they are so precisely regulated in cells. But while lipidomics technologies are progressing, translating their findings into medical applications and introducing them into clinical laboratories is still a considerable challenge.\nThis is the challenge that , in collaboration with  at the University of Wisconsin-Madison took on by measuring almost 150 lipid species in the blood and liver of mice. They also followed this up by identifying the genetic regulators of each lipid species as well as their physiological functions.\nThe researchers used systems genetics approaches to combine the lipidomics data with other “omics” datasets (phenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) from this population of mice (so-called BXD). The approach identified plasma and blood lipid species from different lipid classes as signatures of healthy or unhealthy metabolic states.\nFor example, the scientists demonstrated seven plasma triglyceride species as signatures of healthy or fatty liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Their observation was validated in an independent dietary and therapeutic model of NAFLD in mice and in plasma from patients with NAFLD.\n“This finding fuels optimism that lipid species could serve as signatures or biomarkers that will replace the invasive tissue biopsies currently used to diagnose diseases such as NAFLD – simply by measuring specific lipid species in the blood,” says Johan Auwerx.\nIn a companion paper published at the same time, the authors identify as signatures of healthy or fatty liver a subset of the cardiolipin lipids, which are the essential phospholipids in the inner membrane of mitochondria.\nIn both papers, the researchers pinpoint several genetic locations that may regulate the production of lipid species. By comparing the genetic data from the BXD mouse population to data from so-called genome-wide association studies of lipid-related disorders in humans, they were able to identify common genes between mice and humans that regulate lipids.\n“Analyzing lipids and finding their physiological role may never be as straightforward as studying nucleic acids or proteins,” says Auwerx. “But these companion studies provide a foundation for understanding the genetic regulation and physiological significance of lipid species, while yet again demonstrating the potential of Big Data mining to address biological and clinical questions.”", "summary": "Scientists from EPFL and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have carried out one of the most extensive lipidomics studies to date, connecting almost 150 different lipid species to their respective genetic regulators, revealing signatures of metabolic health and disease.

{"id": 404, "text": "“We want to show that solar panels can be harmoniously integrated into their urban setting, even in fragile environments, as long as the necessary effort is made in terms of design and cost. 'If this effort falls short, it may be better to just postpone the work,” says Maria Cristina Munari Probst, an architect in EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB). “Inelegant solar installations end up turning away potential solar-power users. If done properly, however, they can further spur the growth of solar energy, and this will easily make up for their slightly higher cost.”\nTogether with engineer Christian Roecker, Probst designed an easy-to-use method for cantonal and municipal authorities in charge of planning and approving solar installations. How does it work? It allows the authorities to take local architectural constraints, such as historical districts, into account when analyzing where to install solar panels on existing buildings. This method should ultimately help reconcile heritage advocates and renewable energy supporters. On 16 November, the authors won the Innovator of the Year award in Sweden for their work.\n“These days, people tend to put up solar panels without thinking about the aesthetic impact on existing buildings,” says Probst. “We presented our method to representatives of both the French-speaking cantons’ energy services and heritage associations in French- and Italian-speaking Switzerland in April and October. Thanks to these discussions, we were able to refine our method and ensure that concerns on both sides were properly taken into account.” The consultations have paid off: according to the researchers, several municipalities have already expressed interest in the method, which they may apply as early as next year.\nArchitectural “criticity”\nProbst and Roecker call their method LESO-QSV (QSV refers to Quality-Site-Visibility). It is based on the new concept of “architectural “criticity”” in urban areas. Under this concept, the acceptability of solar panels is assessed against the sensitivity of the \nsite\n and the \nvisibility\n of the panels from the public space.\nThe higher the degree of “criticity” – such as the facade of a highly visible historical building – the more emphasis will be placed on harmoniously integrating the solar panels. On the other hand, a flat roof on a factory in an industrial zone will be given a much lower “criticity” rating, and, consequently, be subject to lower integration standards. \nThe researchers say that solar installations should always respect the surrounding environment. But it’s not always critical. “In the effort to promote the use of solar energy, expectations can be scaled back in certain cases, such as in industrial or commercial zones where the architectural quality is lower, or on surfaces with low public visibility, such as flat or slightly angled roofs,” adds Probst.\nObjective criteria\nBefore aesthetic standards can be established, objective criteria need to be developed. While it is often thought that aesthetics is a matter of taste, the researchers’ recent studies confirm the existence of clear criteria against which the appropriateness of solar power installations can be judged.\nThe LESO-QSV method can be used to evaluate solar installations through three simple and objective criteria: the project’s geometry, materiality, and modular pattern. These criteria provide a framework for assessing how harmoniously an installation fits into the surrounding urban environment. The results of the evaluations are expressed with colored circles. A “criticity” grid identifies nine different situations (see Figure 1) for which the municipal authorities will set quality standards in view of local considerations.\nInstructional software\nTo help the authorities set quality standards, the LESO-QSV method comes with software (\nQSV grid)\n that shows the impact of different acceptability grids on more than 100 existing buildings. These solar installations, many of which are in Europe, also serve as models for objectively evaluating quality. This database provides a large number of examples that can inspire architects, installers and building owners. More examples will continue to be added, including the most prominent cases handled by the municipalities and commissions that will use the method.\nFuture planning \nThe method also helps the authorities get ahead of the problem. It can map out the architectural “criticity” of a given city, identifying the most visible and sensitive sites. This map can then be laid over a map of the city's solar exposure, which shows which of its parts get the most sunlight. This approach makes it easier for the authorities to set their priorities in siting future solar power installations and to plan subsidies intelligently. The researchers call this system QSV Crossmapping.\nThe method is currently being used for the purposes of the International Energy Agency's Task 51 (“Solar Energy in Urban Planning”) and as core resources in three courses currently taught at EPFL and Università IUAV in Venice. In addition, extensive discussions among the three entities and the researchers now focus on an innovative solar planning project currently under consideration for the city of Carouge, led by the Swiss Federal Culture Office together with the Canton of Geneva.\nStarting in 2020, all new buildings in Europe will have to run mainly on renewable energy. This means that municipalities must now urgently come up with a strategic energy plan. With this new method, the researchers hope that municipalities will use solar power more wisely and efficiently in the future.\nMaria Cristina Munari Probst will discuss her research at the LESO Lunchtime on 2 December 2016, from 12:15pm to 1pm, SG building (EPFL), room 0213. The presentation is free of charge and open to the public and will be followed by an aperitif.\nReferences:\nM. C. Munari Probst and C. Roecker.

{"id": 410, "text": "This summer some of the Arctic’s permanent ice caps began breaking up for the first time. This worrying news came just as the EPFL-based Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) began preparing for a major research expedition to Greenland. The aim of this expedition – known as the GreenLAnd Circumnavigation Expedition (GLACE) – is to gather as much data as possible about how the ice cap covering the island is melting, how this process interacts with the surrounding ocean, and how climate change is more broadly affecting the region. The expedition will run for some 60 days, from late July to the end of September 2019. A  has been announced, so it’s time for any polar experts out there to put pen to paper – you have until 10 September!\nThe expedition, which is being supported by grants from Dr. Frederik Paulsen, is the second of its kind. From December 2016 to March 2017, the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) took about 150 researchers involved in 22 projects around the Antarctic.\nAlthough GLACE will involve just ten research projects, it is no less ambitious than its predecessor. The projects will cover fields as varied as climatology, oceanography, marine biology, microbiology, hydrology, and chemistry, to name a few. And during the expedition, samples will be taken from the air, as well as \nfrom the ocean and the ground. As with ACE, the aim is to create synergies between the various research projects and obtain a holistic view of the environmental issues affecting the polar regions, which are key to regulating the earth’s climate and have been hit particularly hard by climate change.\nThe \nAkademik Treshnikov\n – the Russian research ship that transported ACE – will also carry the GLACE researchers. It will be refitted and new equipment added for the expedition. For part of the journey, the Treshnikov will be escorted by a second Russian vessel – the \n50 Let Pobedy\n – which is the world’s largest nuclear-powered icebreaker.\nUnchartered territory\n“Even if it is starting to break up, the North Greenland ice sheet is still among the thickest in the entire Arctic,” says Danièle Rod, the executor director of SPI. “The north winds mean that the ice accumulates along the coast. The Treshnikov won’t be able to get through those areas on its own. We’re going to try and get as close to the coast as possible – it will be the first time an expedition has taken such a difficult course.”\nThe journey - a 13’500 km round trip - will take place in two main stages. The first will focus on southern Greenland (SG). Setting off from Reykjavik in Iceland, the ship will sail all the way to Ilulisat, a town with almost 5,000 inhabitants on Greenland’s western coast. So far, three stops are scheduled along the way – at the Kangerlussuaq (SG1) and Helheim (SG2) fjords and the Prince Christian Sound, the southernmost tip of the island (SG3). These locations were chosen primarily because they are home to lakes and ice tongues that have a major influence on the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and because they provide access to some of the highest mountains in Greenland, where samples of older ice will be taken. These sites also offer rich biodiversity.\n700 kilometers from the North Pole\nFor the second leg, the ship will head north (NG), making its way back to Reykjavik via the Nares Straits, which separate Greenland from the northernmost island in Canada. Four key stop-off locations have been identified along the way, including one alternative in case it’s not possible to land at one of the other three sites or in case of severe ice conditions.\nTwo of these locations are outlets for meltwater from the large Ryder, Ostenfeld (NG1) and Zachariae (NG4) glaciers. For the first time, researchers will be able to study in depth the impact that this meltwater has on the marine environment. The ship will also stop to allow researchers to gather data at Independence Fjord (NG3), which is 200 kilometers long, 30 kilometers wide and an ecosystem in and of itself. Finally, a landing is scheduled at Cape Morris Jesup (NG2), which is the northernmost tip of Greenland and just 700 kilometers from the North Pole. Samples taken there will be compared with those collected in the very south of Greenland.\nContact\n: Danièle Rod, Swiss Polar Institute Executive Director, , tel: +41 21 693 76 29.\nPicture: The Akademik Treshnikov.

{"id": 411, "text": "Neurologists often use electrical impulses to stimulate and read brain signals. But the chemicals that neurons produce in response to these impulses are poorly understand at this point, even though they can provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms behind neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. “Neurons can be read two ways: electrically or chemically,” says Guillaume Petit-Pierre, a post-doc researcher at LMIS4 and one of the study’s authors. “Reading their electrical behavior can provide some limited information, such as the frequency and pace at which neurons communicate. However, reading their neurochemistry gives insight into the proteins, ions and neurotransmitters in a patient’s cerebral fluid.” By analyzing this fluid, doctors can obtain additional information – beyond that provided by neurons – and get a complete picture of a patient’s brain tissue metabolism.\nCollecting information through microchannels \nThe EPFL researchers developed a system that can both collect a patient’s neurochemical feedback and form electrical connections with brain tissue. Their device is made up of electrodes and microchannels that are about half a hair in diameter. Once the device is placed inside brain tissue, the microchannels draw in cerebral fluid while the electrodes, which are located right at the fluid-collection interface, make sure that the measurements are taken at very precise locations. The microchannels subsequently create highly concentrated microdroplets of cerebral fluid. “The microdroplets form directly at the tip of the device, giving us a very high temporal resolution, which is essential if we want to accurately analyze the data,” says Petit-Pierre. The microdroplets are then placed on an analytical instrument that was also developed by scientists at the LMIS4 and the nearby University Centre of Legal Medicine which has expertise in this type of complex analysis. As a last step, the microdroplets are vaporized with a laser and the gas residue is analyzed. Both the researchers’ device and their analysis method are totally new. “Today there is only one method for performing neurochemical analyses: microdialysis. But it isn’t very effective in terms of either speed or resolution,” says Petit-Pierre. Another advantage of the researchers’ method is that it is a minimally invasive way to collect data. Currently scientists have to work directly on the brains of rats afflicted with neurodegenerative diseases, meaning the rats must be sacrificed to take the measurements. Their research was published in Nature Communications. \nDirect applications\nFor this study, the researchers focused primarily on the calcium, sodium, potassium and other ions in cerebral fluid. They worked with EPFL’s  to compare the measurements they took on rats with those reported in the literature – and found that the results were well correlated. The next step will be to develop a method for analyzing the proteins and neurotransmitters in cerebral fluid, so that their implications in neurodegenerative diseases can be further studied. “Doctors could measure neurochemical responses to help them make diagnoses, such as for epilepsy, when they use electricity to measure signals from a patient’s cortex,” says Guillaume, “or to improve the efficiency of treatments like deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson’s disease.” Their research could also soon find direct applications in other medical fields. Guillaume currently works on a start-up project to develop a catheter for patients affected by hemorrhagic stroke. Based on a similar technology, his catheter would let doctors treat a common yet serious complication of this condition and thereby reduce the risk of death.\nThis research was carried out jointly by EPFL’s \nLaboratory of Microsystems\n 4 (LMIS4), EPFL’s Neurodegenerative Disease Laboratory (LEN), the Unit of Toxicology at the University Centre of Legal Medicine (CURML, CHUV and HUG) and the University of Lausanne’s Faculty of Biology and Medicine (FBM, UNIL).\n“In vivo neurochemical measurements in cerebral tissues using a droplet-based monitoring system”\nGuillaume Petit-Pierre, Philippe Colin, Estelle Laurer, Julien Déglon, Arnaud Bertsch, Aurélien Thomas, Bernard L.

{"id": 412, "text": "Biofuels still have a long way to go to become sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels. A number of social and environmental hurdles have to be overcome, and crucially, their price has to come down to make them competitive. One way to make the overall process economically viable would be to process the biomass in biorefineries and transform it into additional high value chemicals for the chemical industry. Publishing in the journal \nIndustrial Crops and Products\n, researchers from EPFL present how one such source of biomass, agricultural residues from Brazilian oil palm plantations, can be used to produce bioethanol and two additional end products: furfural, a much-used industrial compound, and lignin, a solid fuel that can be used in the biorefinery.\nOil palm dates grow in bunches, which are harvested and pressed to extract oil, which is currently used for cooking, cosmetics, and the production of biodiesel, among others. The left over fibrous residues are typically discarded as waste. But as Edgard Gnansounou and Jegannathan Kenthorai Raman from EPFL’s Bioenergy and Energy Planning Research Group (BPE) explain, the empty fruit bunches are far from worthless. “You can make at least 30 valuable biochemical compounds using residues from palm oil production,” they say.\nSo are empty palm oil fruit bunches a sustainable source of biomass? And if so, what types of compounds should they be transformed into? These are the kinds of questions that Gnansounou and Kenthorai seek to address in their research. For this particular study, they characterized the composition of the empty fruit bunches and optimized the chemical processes for their transformation. These data will feed into an assessment of the environmental impact and economic cost that such a biorefinery would have.\nFrom oil refineries to biorefineries\n“If all you do with the empty fruit bunches is produce bioethanol, it will be too expensive to compete with fossil fuels,” they say. “But adopt a biorefinery approach to produce additional compounds that you can sell for a profit, such as furfural, which has many applications in the chemical industry, such as fungicides, special adhesives, flavor compounds and solvents, and you can lower the price of biofuel.” But even this, they warn, may not be enough to compete economically with today’s cheap fossil fuels.\nFor now, biorefineries exist as blueprints and computer models. Once mature, they will be capable of process and add value to most forms of agricultural wastes – rice husks, corn stalks and leaves, wheat straw, and green wastes, such as forest and garden residues. Because they all share the same basic make-up, long and shorter chain sugar polymers (cellulose and hemicellulose), and tough, hard to digest lignin, they can all be processed similarly.\nTowards sustainable biofuels\nBiofuel production has not been free of controversy, as the feedstock can potentially come into direct competition with food crops. But, say the researchers, second generation biofuels can avoid the first issue by only using biomass from non-arable crops or agricultural residues that are commonly incinerated or left on the field. And while in many countries palm oil production has been associated to deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats, policy in place in Brazil specifically promotes the use of degraded land for oil palm plantations.\n“There is huge potential for commercial scale biorefineries in the future,” the researchers say, citing the European Union’s target of having at least 10% transportation fuels from renewable energy sources by 2020 and increased support for bio-based chemicals as positive developments. Scaling up production will involve developing sustainable solutions to round up biomass from farms, plantations, and agricultural processing sites, and improving the efficiency of the biotechnological processes used in the biorefineries.\n“As the son of a farmer myself, I am excited about this work, as it adds economic value to something that farmers have a lot of: plant residues,” says Kenthorai. The development of biorefineries, he says, has the potential to stimulate the economy of rural societies, creating jobs in the collection, transportation, and processing of agricultural residues, and these new opportunities could potentially counteract rural exodus in certain communities.", "summary": "To cut the cost of biofuels, their production-process can be enhanced to include additional valuable biochemical compounds.

The RESSlab team developed the most accurate numerical model, as measured by 11 criteria, predicting the deformation of three steel columns subjected to earthquake loading. The researchers will receive their prize and present their work on 13 April at a special session dedicated to the blind analysis prediction contest as part of the AISC Steel Conference (NASCC) in Baltimore.\nThese contests are blind because the researchers receive only partial information on a structure or component. Using just the geometry and the imposed load conditions, the EPFL researchers were able to demonstrate with a high level of accuracy that it is possible to simulate material and geometric instabilities in steel components undergoing cyclic loading similar to that of an earthquake.\n“We used simulation models and a methodology that we developed in the scope of a research project financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),” says Dimitrios Lignos, an associate professor and director of RESSlab. “The aim of this project is to use computer simulations validated by carefully designed physical experiments to deepen our understanding of the complex deterioration processes associated with geometric instabilities observed in steel structures as a result of earthquake-induced loading. We plan to share these tools with the scientific community.” For Lignos, the results of this competition also serve to highlight EPFL’s internationally recognized expertise in computer modeling across scales.\nThanks to RESSlab’s models, researchers can also forecast the dynamic behavior of steel buildings subjected to earthquakes of different magnitudes and predict if these buildings would suffer major deterioration in strength and stiffness.

{"id": 418, "text": "Go to the train station to take the plane. Board on a capsule to reach the airport by rail, and then - without leaving your seat - fly to another city. The Clip-Air project, being developed at EPFL since 2009, envisions a modular aircraft consisting of a flying wing onto which it is possible to attach one, two or three capsules as required. Its concept allows us to take a glimpse at the air transportation of tomorrow, which is meant to be more flexible, closer to our needs, more efficient and less energy-consuming. For the first time, a model of the Clip-Air plane will be presented at the Paris Air Show from 17 to 19 June 2013.\nDespite its being a very futuristic project, the scientists behind it work under rigorous constraints to maintain its technical feasibility. \"We still have to break down several barriers but we do believe that it is worth to work in such a concept, at odds with current aircraft technology and which can have a huge impact on society,\" said Claudio Leonardi, in charge of the Clip-Air project.\n The Clip-Air project’s main contribution would be to provide rail transport’s flexibility to air transport. On the one hand, the Clip-Air plane includes a support structure made up by the wing, engines, cockpit, fuel and landing gear. On the other hand, there is the load to be carried: passengers and/or freight. Hence, the capsule would be equivalent to a real airplane’s fuselage, but without its usual attributes. The flying wing can accommodate up to three capsules with a capacity of 150 passengers each.\nNew generation fuel\n Theoretical studies show Clip-Air’s potential in terms of transportation capacity thanks to a more efficient and flexible fleet management, a more efficient loading rate, increased flexibility of supply and the possibility of no more empty flights. Further advantages would come from savings in maintenance, storage and management.\nClip-Air also aims to address current environmental concerns as wells as the objectives set by the ACARE (Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe) to reduce by 50% CO2 emissions by the year 2020. Clip-Air aircrafts’ conventional fuel consumption would be reduced since they can carry as many passengers as three A320 with half the engines. In other words, flying with three modules under the same wing in a 4000 km flight would be cheaper - in terms of fuel consumption - than three aircrafts of the same capacity flying independently and with equal speed and altitude.\nThen again, Clip-Air’s ambition also envisages other types of fuels, less polluting than the ones currently consumed. Several possibilities (liquid hydrogen, biofuels and conventional fuel) have been studied and have demonstrated the relevance of modular structures in terms of overall consumption.\nA revolution in mobility\n A Clip-Air aircraft could fit in an airport as it is conceived today. With its autonomous capsule, the size of a railroad car - about 30 meters long and 30 tons heavy - its design is compatible with rail tracks. Therefore, it could eventually revolutionize airport configuration and multimodal mobility. The boarding of either cargo or passengers in the capsule could be done not only at airports but also directly in rail stations or production sites.\nIn technical terms, initial studies have shown that the project is feasible, even though there are still many challenges ahead. “The development of the concept requires performing more advanced aerodynamic simulations and testing a 6 meters long flying model powered by mini-reactors in order to continue to explore the concept’s flight performance and to demonstrate its overall feasibility”, added Claudio Leonardi.\nFor now, a 1.20 meters long model of the Clip-Air plane will be presented at the Normandy Aerospace stand at the Paris Air Show, from 17 to 19 June 2013. At the moment the project involves researchers from three EPFL laboratories (TRANSP-OR, LIV and ICOM).

{"id": 421, "text": "In the world of the infinitely small, unexpected phenomena can occur at the interface between two materials when they are artificially combined. At EPFL scientists have shown that it is possible to generate a conducting channel with a width of a few atoms in the contact zone between different sheets of insulating materials. This work, just published in Nature Communications, could enable the creation not only of new micro- and nanoelectronic devices but also of a new kind of solar cell.\nTwo-dimensional materials\n To generate these tiny conducting channels, researchers studied two-dimensional materials, that is to say sheets of material a few atoms thick, sometimes only consisting of a single layer of atoms. \n Like graphene, these materials are composed of atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure, similar to the cells found in beehives. The difference is that while graphene is conductive and only composed of carbon atoms, the two-dimensional materials mentioned in the study are insulating and are composed of different elements.\nAmong many possibilities, researchers considered boron nitride (BN), which is composed of two kinds of atoms. In its natural state, a “sheet” of boron nitride acts as an insulator and therefore cannot conduct electric current. However, the technique, after a slight chemical modification, allows researchers to develop “leads” for conductive electrons.\nA proton sandwich \n The fabrication of the electrical channel is a two-step operation. It is made by fixing a proton (i.e., an hydrogen atom) on a sheet of boron nitride above each boron atom (B) and one below each nitrogen atom (N). Thus sandwiched between the hydrogen atoms, the “decorated” boron nitride sheet generates a conductive channel a few atoms wide when it is placed in contact with a “pristine” sheet of BN. The new “wire” located at the interface between the two sheets enables precise control of the circulation of the electrons when tension is applied. “Taken separately, the chemically modified sheet and the blank sheet are not conductive,” says Giovanni Pizzi, co-author of the study. “It is only by combining one with the other that the channel appears.”\nPotential applications associated with these simulations are numerous. The new conductive “wires” could particularly serve to develop more compact and powerful micro- and nanoelectronic devices. “The ‘wires’ produced by traditional lithography don’t fall below twenty nanometers, which means at least one hundred atoms,” says Giovanni Pizzi. “A few atoms wide, our wire could connect the different processors of a nanochip by taking far less space than current wires.”\nA new model of solar cell \n Applications related to these tiny conductive channels could also include the creation of a new kind of ultra-thin and flexible solar cell.\n When the material patterned with channels is subjected to sunlight, electrons present in the insulating part move toward the conductive pathways. “To obtain an electric current, it then suffices simply to connect the channels,” explains Marco Gibertini, who also co-authored the study.\nTowards experimental tests\n EPFL researchers now hope their simulation work attracts the attention of specialists in the experimental area to conduct tests in real-life settings. “In our study we provide a simple calculation that researchers can perform to see if a given material, after chemical modification, will form these tiny wires,” says Marco Gibertini. “Our idea relies on previous results on 3D materials. We have also intentionally investigated existing experimental materials and techniques. This should facilitate experimental tests,” he adds.", "summary": "EPFL researchers showed it is possible to create an electrical channel a few atoms wide within two-dimensional insulating materials.

{"id": 425, "text": "Cubosomes are small biological “capsules” that can deliver molecules of nutrients or drugs with high efficiency. They have a highly symmetrical interior made of tiny cubes of assembled fat molecules similar to the ones in cell membranes. This also means that cubosomes are safe to use in living organisms. Such features have triggered great interest in the pharmaceutical and food industry, who seek to exploit the structure of cubosomes for the controlled release of molecules, improving the delivery of nutrients and drugs. EPFL scientists, working with Nestlé, have now been able to study the 3D structure of cubosomes in detail for the first time. , the breakthrough can help and promote the use of cubosomes in medicine and food science.\nMolecules of a drug or a nutrient contained inside a cubosome can move by using the numerous tiny channels that make up its structure’s interior. The pharmaceutical industry already uses a similar system for drug delivery: the liposomes, which are also made of fats but in the shape of a sphere. Their intricate internal channels give cubosomes a very high internal surface, which offers great potential for the controlled delivery of nutrients and drugs.\nIn short, the properties of cubosomes, like other lipid-based delivery vessels, depend on their particular structures. The problem is that cubosomes are self-assembled, occurring “spontaneously” after putting together the right ingredients (generally fats and a detergent) under the right conditions. This means that scientists have limited control over their final structure, which makes it hard to optimize their design. In addition, it is very difficult to “see” the interior of a cubosome and map out the various arrangements of its channels.\nDavide Demurtas and Cécile Hébert from EPFL’s , working with Laurent Sagalowicz at the , have now uncovered the interior 3D structure of cubosomes, and have successfully matched their real-life findings to computer simulations.\nThe researchers used a microscopy technique called “cryo-electron tomography” (CET). Their method involves embedding cubosomes in a type of “glass” ice that does not form crystals, which would damage the cubosomes. The samples are kept at -170\no\nC. The microscope then takes photographs while tilting the cubosome at different angles. The technique, which was carried out at CIME, can reconstruct the three-dimensional information to create images of the cubosomes in their native state and with unprecedented detail.\n“This method allows us to get information about everything, both the inside and outside of the cubosomes,” says Cécile Hébert. “Because the CET microscope distinguishes the different densities between cubosome and ice, it is very sensitive and precise.”\nThe CET images clearly showed the internal cubic structure, as well as the internal 3D organization of the channels. The researchers also compared the images to the prevailing mathematical models used to make computer simulations of the interface between the interior and exterior. The real-life data successfully matched the theory.\n“With this approach we can now forge a new understanding of the structure of the cubosomes’ interior,” says Davide Demurtas. The success is expected to make the study and design of cubosomes with controlled macroscopic properties (e.g. controlled release) easier.\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Electron Microscopy (CIME) with the Nestlé Research Center Lausanne, EPFL’s Institute of Cancer Research, and the Department of Health Science & Technology of ETH Zurich.\nReference\nDemurtas D, Guichard P, Martiel I, Mezzenga R, Hébert C, Sagalowicz L. \nDirect visualization of dispersed lipid bicontinuous cubic phases by cryo-electron tomography.\nNature Communications\n 17 November 2015.

{"id": 428, "text": "A major challenge in renewable energy is storage. A common approach is a reaction that splits water into oxygen and hydrogen, and uses the hydrogen as a fuel to store energy. The efficiency of ‘water splitting’ depends heavily on a solid substance called a catalyst. However, only the surface of the catalyst acts on the reaction, while its bulk is inactive. This restricts how much catalyst can be used, and limits the efficiency of water splitting in energy systems. Publishing in \nNature Communications\n, EPFL scientists have developed a new method for maximizing the catalyst’s contribution by chemically ‘peeling off’ only its active surface and excluding its bulk from the reaction. Their data, which show 2.6- to 4.5-fold increase in water-splitting efficiency, pave the way for cheaper and more efficient renewable energy storage.\nBecause of the natural inconsistency of sunlight and wind, using them for energy purposes requires devices that can store that energy in the form of hydrogen for later use. These devices are based on a reaction called ‘photoelectrochemical water-splitting’, because it uses solar or wind energy to break water into molecular oxygen (O\n2\n) and hydrogen (Η\n2\n), the latter of which can be stored away as fuel for later use. But even though it is currently impossible to retrieve 100% of collected solar or wind energy, there are certain parts of the water-splitting reaction that can be improved to achieve much higher sustainable rates of storage.\nThe efficiency of water splitting depends on a component called the ‘catalyst’, which is a solid compound, typically a metal oxide, that greatly improves the speed and efficiency of the reaction. The problem is that current water-splitting catalysts add significantly to the cost of renewable energy because only the outer surface of the catalyst acts on the reaction, while its bulk does not contribute. As this restricts the amount of catalyst that can be used for water splitting, it also limits the amount of hydrogen fuel that can be produced over time per energy device, making renewable energy storage financially unviable.\nFang Song and Xile Hu at EPFL have developed a novel method to increase the accessible active sites of the catalyst by literally peeling it off its bulk. This is referred to as ‘exfoliation’ and is similar in principle to the method for obtaining graphene from graphite: wrap scotch tape around a piece of graphite, pull it off, and graphene from its outermost surface will stick to it. Exfoliation of metal oxides has already been used in electrochemical applications, e.g. batteries, chemical sensors and electrodes for supercapacitors, but this is the first time it has been implemented in the context of water splitting.\nThe exfoliating method developed by the EPFL scientists uses an organic solvent. Conventional metal oxide catalysts were incubated into it, and a thin layer from its outer surface, 3 atoms-thick, peeled off. The single-layer surfaces retained their original structure, but when tested in the lab they showed increased catalytic properties.\nThe researchers tested seven common metal oxide catalysts, including iridium oxide, which is an expensive material considered to be one of the most state-of-the-art catalysts for water splitting. Other catalysts included cheaper metal oxides based on iron, cobalt, and nickel. The data showed that exfoliated metal oxides increased the reaction rate by 2.6- to 4.5-fold compared to reactions containing the entire catalyst, meaning that if the exfoliation method is implemented in renewable energy systems, it could greatly increase energy storage. A few exfoliated cheaper catalysts even showed better efficiency than iridium oxide. The authors suggest that the enhancement of the reaction rate is mainly due to an increased number of the ‘hotspots’ on the catalyst where water molecules – in this case water – fit and undergo reactions.\nThe authors state that the new method represents a “‘top-down’ approach in the development of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts”, with a significant impact on energy research. The relatively simple exfoliation method and the increased catalytic properties of low-cost, abundant materials can open the way for cheaper and more efficient storage of energy obtained from renewable sources.\nReference\n Song F, Hu X.

{"id": 429, "text": "Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is pretty amazing. It has already been shown in several studies to be effective in boosting metabolism. And now a team of researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Integrated Systems Physiology (LISP), headed by Johan Auwerx, has unveiled even more of its secrets. An article written by Hongbo Zhang, a PhD student on the team, was published today in \nScience\n and describes the positive effects of NR on the functioning of stem cells. These effects can only be described as restorative.\nAs mice, like all mammals, age, the regenerative capacity of certain organs (such as the liver and kidneys) and muscles (including the heart) diminishes. Their ability to repair them following an injury is also affected. This leads to many of the disorders typical of aging.\nMitochondria: also useful in stem cells\nHongbo Zhang wanted to understand how the regeneration process deteriorated with age. To do so, he teamed up with colleagues from ETH Zurich, the University of Zurich and universities in Canada and Brazil. Through the use of several markers, he was able to identify the molecular chain that regulates how mitochondria – the “powerhouse” of the cell – function and how they change with age. The role that mitochondria play in metabolism has already been amply demonstrated, “but we were able to show for the first time that their ability to function properly was important for stem cells,” said Auwerx.\nUnder normal conditions, these stem cells, reacting to signals sent by the body, regenerate damaged organs by producing new specific cells. At least in young bodies. “We demonstrated that fatigue in stem cells was one of the main causes of poor regeneration or even degeneration in certain tissues or organs,” said Hongbo Zhang.\nThis is why the researchers wanted to “revitalize” stem cells in the muscles of elderly mice. And they did so by precisely targeting the molecules that help the mitochondria to function properly. “We gave nicotinamide riboside to 2-year-old mice, which is an advanced age for them,” said the researcher. “This substance, which is close to vitamin B3, is a precursor of NAD+, a molecule that plays a key role in mitochondrial activity. And our results are extremely promising: muscular regeneration is much better in mice that received NR, and they lived longer than the mice that didn’t get it.”\nA breakthrough for regenerative medicine\nParallel studies have revealed a comparable effect on stem cells of the brain and skin. “This work could have very important implications in the field of regenerative medicine,” said Auwerx. “We are not talking about introducing foreign substances into the body but rather restoring the body’s ability to repair itself with a product that can be taken with food.” This work on the aging process also has potential for treating diseases that can affect – and be fatal – in young people, like muscular dystrophy (myopathy).\nSo far, no negative side effects have been observed following the use of NR, even at high doses. But caution remains the byword when it comes to this elixir of youth: it appears to boost the functioning of all cells, which could include pathological ones. Further in-depth studies are required.\nNote: this article will be published on-line by the journal \nScience\n on Thursday, 28\nth\n April 2016 at 2.00 pm (ET) and entitled: “Improving mitochondrial function by NAD+ repletion rejuvenates adult stem cells and enhances lifespan”, Zhang et. al.", "summary": "By administering nicotinamide riboside to elderly mice, EPFL researchers restored their organs’ ability to regenerate and prolonged their lives.

{"id": 432, "text": "“Collective creation: improv-arts & engineering” was developed by Professor Simon Henein in cooperation with the Arsenic Theater (Centre d’art scénique contemporain) in Lausanne. The year-long course, which was launched in September 2017, is part of EPFL’s Social and Human Sciences (SHS) program. It introduces Master’s students from all sections to improv techniques used in the performing arts (theater, music and dance) and explores how these techniques can be applied to engineering design. The 24 students taking the class will stage their final project on 16 May in a dress rehearsal and on 23 May in their final presentation before a board of examiners. Both events are open to the public.\nEach improv performance will feature technical artifacts made ahead of time by the students. “This requirement creates tension between the creative processes involved in engineering and those inherent in improv,” says Professor Henein. “The aim is to highlight where they overlap and how they differ.” One example is the “stage machine” that one group of students came up with. Drawing on artificial intelligence and deep learning, the machine picks up sounds produced during the performance and turns them into images, and vice versa. The resulting layers of real-time visual and sound effects are part of the improv performance and evolve in step with it.\nTeaming up with the Arsenic\nProfessor Henein worked with the Arsenic Theater in Lausanne to develop this course. Around a dozen scheduled artists and artists in residence supervised the students and provided them with creative support. The Arsenic also gave Henein and his class access to its studios throughout the course, which meant that the students could truly immerse themselves in the theater.\nEngineering and improv\n“Beyond engineering, I get the sense that people have a pressing need to understand their place in the world,” says Patrick de Rham, director of the Arsenic. “And with the emergence of artificial intelligence – machines that perform as well as or better than humans – I think we have to reconnect with our typically human trait of intuition, that part of ourselves that is subjective and sensitive rather than mechanical. It’s what makes two people come up with two different ideas and lets them think outside the box, and this is what drives society forward.”\nProfessor Henein adds: “Collectively, our creative potential is huge – much greater than that of each one of us individually – but to fully tap into it, we have to be able to create together. That's why this class delves so deeply into this skill, which will be crucial in the students’ future careers. We look at intuition, expression, listening, trust and self-reflection. The students are exposed to a wide range of approaches to the creative process, from the hard sciences to engineering and stage performance. All these influences will play a part in their professional work.”\nCourse description\n“Collective creation: improv-arts & engineering” combines workshops, which explore improvisation through the theater, music, dance and performance art, and lectures, which address the history of creativity in the sciences, approaches to collective engineering design, dramaturgy and the sociology of improvisation. The course is the brainchild of Professor Henein, who runs the Instant-Lab at Microcity, EPFL’s Microengineering Institute, and has practiced improv for the past 15 years. It is open to all first-year Master’s students at EPFL. The classes are run in three-period blocks every week throughout the school year. The course will run again in September 2018.\nA booklet of proceedings documenting the course’s first year is currently being prepared. Excerpts can be viewed here: instantlab.epfl.ch/improgineering.\nPractical information\nPublic presentations: Improgineering\nDress rehearsal on 16 May 2018 at 7:30pm and final presentation on 23 May at 7:30pm, at the Arsenic Theater, Rue de Genève 57, Lausanne.

{"id": 437, "text": "When we listen to music, different parts of our brain process different information – such as high and low frequencies – so that our auditory perception of the sounds matches what we hear. It’s easy to study the brain activity of someone who is listening to a song, for instance, as we have the technology to record and analyze the neural responses that each sound produces as it is heard. It’s much more complicated, however, to try and understand what happens in our brain when we hear music in our heads without any auditory stimulation. As with analyzing real music, the brain’s responses have to be linked to a given sound. But when the music is in our heads, that sound doesn’t actually exist – or at least our ears don’t hear it. Using a novel approach, researchers with EPFL’s  (CNBI) were able to analyze what happens in our brains when we hum in our heads.\nRecording an imaginary sound\nEPFL researchers, in cooperation with a team from the University of California, Berkeley, worked with an epileptic patient who is also an experienced pianist. Initially, the patient was asked to play a piece of music on an electric piano with the sound turned on. The music and the corresponding brain activity were recorded. The patient then replayed the same piece, but this time the researchers asked him to imagine hearing the music in his head with the sound on the piano turned off. Once again, the brain activity and the music were recorded. The difference this second time around was that the music came from the mental representation made by the patient – the notes themselves were inaudible. By gathering information in these two different ways, the researchers were able to determine the brain activity produced for each sound, and then compare the data.\nA totally new experiment\nThe experiment may seem simple, but in fact it’s truly one of a kind. “The technique used – electrocorticography – is extremely invasive. It involves implanting electrodes quite deep inside the patient’s brain,” explains Stéphanie Martin, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the CNBI. “The technique is normally used to treat people with epilepsy who cannot take medication.” That’s why the researchers worked with this patient in particular. The electrodes, in addition to being used for treatment purposes, can measure brain activity with a very high spatial and temporal resolution – a necessity given just how rapid neuron responses are.\nExperimental task design. (A) The participant played an electronic piano with the sound of the digital keyboard turned on (perception condition). (B) In the second condition, the participant played the piano with the sound turned off and instead imagined the corresponding music in his mind (imagery condition). In both conditions, the sound output of keyboard was recorded in synchrony with the neural signals. \nPossible future language-related applications\nThis is the first time a study has demonstrated that when we imagine music in our heads, the auditory cortex and other parts of the brain process auditory information, such as high and low frequencies, in the same way as they do when stimulated by real sound. The findings have been published in the journal . The researchers mapped out the parts of the brain covered by the electrodes based on their function in this process and their reactions to both audible and imaginary sounds. The scientists’ aim is to one day apply these findings to language, such as for people who have lost their ability to speak. “We are at the very early stages of this research. Language is a much more complicated system than music: linguistic information is non-universal, which means it is processed by the brain in a number of stages,” explains Martin. “This recording technique is invasive, and the technology needs to be more advanced for us to be able measure brain activity with greater accuracy.” While more research needs to be done, a first step for researchers will be to replicate these results with aphasia patients – people who have lost the ability to speak – and determine whether the sounds they imagine can be recreated. The researchers hope their findings will eventually help such individuals speak again by ‘reading’ their internal speech and reproducing it vocally\n.\n“Neural Encoding of Auditory Features during Music Perception and Imagery.” Stephanie Martin, Christian Mikutta, Matthew K.

{"id": 438, "text": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can offer high light-conversion efficiency with low manufacturing costs. But to be commercially viable, perovskite films must also be durable and not degrade under solar light over time. EPFL scientists have now greatly improved the operational stability of PSCs, retaining more than 95% of their initial efficiencies of over 20 % under full sunlight illumination at 60\no\nC for more than 1000 hours. The breakthrough, which marks the highest stability for perovskite solar cells, .\nChallenges of stability \nConventional silicon solar cells have reached a point of maturation, with efficiencies plateauing around 25% and problems of high-cost manufacturing, heavyweight, and rigidity has remained largely unresolved. On the contrary, a relatively new photovoltaic technology based on perovskite solar cells has already achieved more than 22% efficiency.\nGiven the vast chemical versatility, and the low-cost processability of perovskite materials, the PSCs hold the promise to lead the future of photovoltaic technology by offering cheap, light weight and highly efficient solar cells. But until now, only highly expensive, prototype organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs,selectively transporting positive charges in a solar cell) have been able to achieve power-conversion efficiencies over 20%. And by virtue of their ingredients, these hole-transporting materials adversely affect the long-term operational stability of the PSC.\nTherefore, investigating cheap and stable hole transporters that produce equally high efficiencies is in great demand to enable large-scale deployment of perovskite solar cells. Among various inorganic HTMs, cuprous thiocyanate (CuSCN) stands out as a stable, efficient and cheap candidate ($0.5/gr versus $500 /gr for the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD). But previous attempts to use CuSCN as a hole transporter in perovskite solar cells have yielded only moderately stabilized efficiencies and poor device stability, due to problems associated with depositing a high-quality CuSCN layer atop of the perovskite film, as wells as the chemical instability of the CuSCN layer when integrated into a perovskite solar cell.\nA stable solution\nNow, researchers at , in a project led by postdocs Neha Arora and M. Ibrahim Dar, have introduced two new concepts that overcome the major shortcomings of CuSCN-based perovskite solar cells. First, they developed a simple dynamic solution-based method for depositing highly conformal, 60-nm thick CuSCN layers that allows the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with stabilized power-conversion efficiencies exceeding 20%. This is comparable to the efficiencies of the best performing, state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD-based perovskite solar cells.\nSecond, the scientists introduced a thin spacer layer of reduced graphene oxide between the CuSCN and a gold layer. This innovation allowed the perovskite solar cells to achieve excellent operational stability, retaining over 95% of their initial efficiency while operating at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full-sun illumination at 60 °C. This surpasses even the stability of organic HTM-based perovskite solar cells that are heavily researched and have recently dominated the field.\nStructure of β-CuSCN and cross-sectional SEM micrograph of a complete solar cell (credit: M. Ibrahim Dar/EPFL)\nThe researchers also discovered that the instability of the perovskite devices originates from the degradation of CuSCN/gold contact during the solar cell’s operation.\n“This is a major breakthrough in perovskite solar-cell research and will pave the way for large-scale commercial deployment of this very promising new photovoltaic technology,” says Michael Grätzel. “It will benefit the numerous scientists in the field that have been intensively searching for a material that could replace the currently used, prohibitively expensive organic hole-transporters,” adds M.

{"id": 441, "text": "“In my study, I wanted to show that calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels tells just half of the story. What we really need to do is quantify the emissions of each product coming out of biorefineries,” says Edgard Gnansounou, professor at EPFL and head of the school’s Bioenergy and Energy Planning Research Group. To that end, Gnansounou has developed a sophisticated computer model described in an article appearing in \nBioresource Technology\n.\nBiofuels and other biomass-derived products have become viable options for replacing fossil fuels. But they have to meet certain environmental standards if they are to genuinely help cut carbon emissions. Under a new EU directive, bioethanol-based fuels – which are made by fermenting biomass – must save 70% greenhouse gas emissions compared to their fossil-fuel counterparts starting in 2021. In Switzerland, the government passed a law requiring that from 1 August 2016, biofuels must cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% relative to fossil-fuel equivalents. However, calculating the total greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels is no mean feat. The entire processing chain – not just the production of the biofuel itself – must be taken into account. For sugar cane, that would include emissions from growing and harvesting the plant, transporting it to a biorefinery, turning it into biofuel, and producing the other compounds and animals feed supplements that are generally made as coproducts. The hitch is that until now, no computer model existed for analyzing the entire life cycle of each product and coming up with a single emissions figure subject to environmental requirements.\nMany different variables involved\n One major challenge is the many different variables involved in calculating the emissions of biofuels and their various coproducts. But after five years of research, Gnansounou has come up with a model that incorporates all the various data. “I tackled the problem of allocating greenhouse gas emissions among the different coproducts by specifying an environmental requirement for each one. That lets plant engineers compare those emissions with their fossil-fuel equivalents and set up the right incentives to make their biorefineries economically viable.”\nGnansounou’s model is intended for second-generation biorefineries, which are still relatively new – only five currently exist around the world. The advantage of these biorefineries is that instead of processing crops that are also used as food, they use debris from farming (like wheat straw) and foresting. Wheat straw is the crop that Gnansounou looked at specifically, taking into account the wheat ears, which are used for food, and the stems, which are used by biorefineries to produce bioethanol for fuel, biogas for heating and electricity and phenol for the chemical industry. He also factored emissions from the fertilizer and farming machines used to grow and harvest the wheat, and whether the field had previously been used for other crops. Once he calculated a total greenhouse gas emissions figure, he used his model to divide the total up among the various coproducts.\nA scientific perspective\n With his research, Gnansounou hopes to bring a scientific perspective to the political and economic debate on biofuels. “Second-generation biorefineries should replace some oil refineries, but engineers still don’t have a clear method for calculating emissions across a biofuel’s life cycle,” he says. “What’s more, biorefineries have trouble competing with low oil prices” – since biofuels are two to three times more expensive than fossil fuels. He concludes: “Policymakers still haven’t fully grasped the emissions challenge, which is why it’s a good area for research.” Gnansounou believes that the renewable energy industry is too focused on the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels alone, whereas it should be looking more closely at the emissions of each coproduct from biorefineries, subject to climate policy constraints. That would also give consumers more information about the sustainability of biomass-derived products. Gnansounou plans to continue his research on other types of crops and publish his findings in a second article.\nReference", "summary": "A new EU regulation aims to shrink the environmental footprint of biofuels starting in 2021.

This French archipelago lies directly east of Australia and is surrounded by the second largest coral reef in the world after the Great Barrier Reef. Like so many other coral reefs, this precious ecosystem – which is a UNESCO World Heritage site – is under threat. On 20 February, Selmoni will join a research initiative launched by EPFL into how corals adapt to global warming, pollution and the anthropization of coastal areas. The project is being carried out in conjunction with the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD – UMR ENTROPIE). He will post updates, photos and videos to the EPFL Out There blog and Instagram up until the end of May.\nSelmoni’s research project combines genetics and geography: he will apply a new scientific method known as seascape genomics to coral reefs. This approach uses DNA samples from coral to identify potential correlations between genetic variation and a particular environmental condition. By sampling individual specimens that may have been affected by the bleaching of two species of coral (\nAcropora millepora\n and \nPocillopora damicornis\n), Selmoni hopes to discover genetic mutations that could enable coral to withstand global warming and ocean acidification. Coral specimens with this mutation could then be raised in a nursery and used to repopulate the damaged parts of reefs. By cross-referencing DNA and geographical data, Selmoni will also be able to map out the reefs surrounding the island, which is 300 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide. This map will support the effort to develop conservation strategies and help identify where the super coral that Selmoni hopes to discover will be most effective when replanted. This project is one of six – chosen from among 230 proposals – to be supported by the International Coral Reef Initiative, a United Nations partner.\nDiving to extract DNA \n Selmoni will spend the next three months diving for coral samples at around 20 sites. He will be assisted by a boat pilot and two professional divers. His research will take him to New Caledonia’s “customary” district, where the indigenous tribes will expect him to pay a traditional customs duty in the form of food and other goods in order to enter their territory. Between dives, the researcher will extract DNA in the lab, using equipment provided by the IRD’s center in the capital Nouméa. His work in New Caledonia will be overseen by Véronique Berteaux-Lecellier, a researcher in coral genetics at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) who is also his thesis co-director.\nSelmoni completed a Master’s degree in bioinformatics at the University of Lausanne before embarking on his PhD research at EPFL in the Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG), which is headed by research and teaching associate Stéphane Joost.

EPFL scientists have found a way to miniaturize frequency combs, realizing a new step toward miniaturization of such tools. Their device was capable of measuring light oscillations with a precision of 12 digits. The work is .\nThe lab of , in a project led by Victor Brasch and Erwan Lucas, created what is called a “self-referenced optical frequency comb”. This is essentially a series of densely-spaced spectral lines whose spacing is identical and known. Because they are so well defined, optical frequency combs can be used as a “ruler” for measuring the frequency – or color – of any laser beam. By comparing an unknown color to this ruler, it is possible to calculate its frequency. However, this implies a critical step called “self-referencing”, a method that exactly determines the position of each individual tick of the frequency ruler, but demands a very long ruler – a broad spectral range, as scientists say – which is challenging to obtain.\nAlthough optical frequency combs earned their inventors the Nobel prize in Physics in 2005, they still required bulky optical setups. Prof. Kippenberg’s lab showed in 2007 that optical frequency combs could be created using tiny devices called “optical microresonators”: microscopic ring-shaped structures made from very fine silicon nitride measuring a few millimeters to a few tens of microns in diameter. These structures can trap a continuous laser light and convert it into ultra-short pulses – solitons – thanks to the special nonlinear properties of the device. The solitons travel around the microresonator 200 billion times per second and the pulsed output from the microresonator creates the optical frequency comb.\nLast year, the group solved an outstanding challenge, demonstrating that a careful control of the microresonator parameters, enabled to generate a very broad frequency spectrum directly on-chip. At this point, the frequencies generated extend over two thirds of an octave compared with the frequency of the incoming laser (an octave refers to either double or half the frequency). When combined with a laser transfer system, based on non-linear crystals, the team’s approach enabled self-referencing, while eliminating the need for bulky, external systems traditionally used for frequency broadening.\nWith this, the researchers could prove that their optical frequency comb can be used for the most precise measurement applications: they measured the frequency of a laser using their technique as well as a traditional frequency comb system and showed that the two results agreed over 12 digits.\nThe technology is amenable to integration with both photonic elements and silicon microchips. Establishing devices that provide a RF to optical link on a chip may catalyze a wide variety of applications such as integrated, atomic clocks and on-chip, and could contribute to making optical frequency metrology ubiquitous.\nThis work was supported by a Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship and Intra-European Fellowship, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Space Agency, and the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency QuASAR program. \nReference\nVictor Brasch, Erwan Lucas, John D Jost, Michael Geiselmann, Tobias J Kippenberg. \nSelf-referenced photonic chip soliton Kerr frequency comb.\nLight: Science & Applications \n(2017) \n6\n, e16202; 13 January 2017.\nDOI:10.1038/lsa.2016.202", "summary": "EPFL scientists have found a way to miniaturize frequency combs, realizing a new step toward miniaturization of such tools.

She's just received one of these ultra-competitive European research grants. \"It's a real boost to my career, and it means I can work right at the interface between two fields, which is uncommon.\"\nLaunched ten years ago, the European Research Council (ERC) initiative has really transformed the landscape of European research.

Each year, the ERC pays out close to two billion Swiss francs.\nA 30% success rate\nSwitzerland ranks fifth in terms of recipient countries, with nearly 500 ERC grants awarded to researchers in Switzerland over the last ten years. And EPFL, which has been awarded 116,* comes in fourth among Europe's higher education institutions, behind three UK universities. It is closely followed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (110 grants). For Switzerland's two institutes of technology, this achievement is even more impressive given that they missed out on two application rounds in 2014 as a result of the referendum on mass immigration, which took place on 9 February of that year. Beyond these absolute figures, the recent success rate of EPFL applicants is impressive: more than 30% of applicants have been awarded a grant, compared with the average of around 10%.\n\"That illustrates just how good our researchers are,\" stated Michele De Palma, who has just been awarded a Consolidator Grant, after first receiving a Starting Grant. \"The Research Office and the central services also provide significant support when it comes to the applications and the selection interviews.\" The grants are awarded to individuals, which gives researchers more freedom to carry out their projects. Like De Palma, several researchers arrive at EPFL with their ERC grant already in hand, which means even more funds for the university.\nOnly high-risk and groundbreaking projects are successful, in recognition of their pursuit of scientific excellence. \"For a researcher, applying for an ERC grant is also a time to reflect on what you want to do for the next five years,\" commented Denis Duboule, a professor in the Laboratory of Developmental Genomics, who has already received two Advanced Grants.\n\"In five years, you have time to get some interesting findings and publish them,\" said De Palma.

{"id": 446, "text": "What is the WCSJ and why was it created?\nThe WCSJ was set up by the World Federation of Science Journalists (WFSJ) to provide a forum for science journalists to discuss the state of their profession, share best practices and outline new goals to aspire to. It’s held every two years and attracts over a thousand science journalists from around the world. The conference – which is run by science journalists for their peers – also aims to enable science journalists from different continents to meet each other and therefore start working together more efficiently. The conference is a hotbed of ideas! But more generally, it’s an opportunity for our industry to show that we strive for independent, fact-based science journalism through a healthy critical eye, in both the specialist and mainstream press. The hope is that by sharing best practices, we can raise the overall level of our profession.\nWhat is science journalism?\nIt’s a specific branch of journalism, although it has the same fundamental role: to investigate important issues, uncover the facts, compare different points of view, go behind the scenes, interview key people and get the background story. The main objective is to provide information to our readers. But since that information is scientific, we also have to explain complicated concepts in a simple way. So our job is to make science easy to understand, yet through a critical approach so that we are sure to describe it accurately and objectively. We step into laymen’s shoes, and we enter into a kind of tacit agreement with the scientists whose findings we report so that we can explain their research clearly and stay true to the scientific facts.\nBut science journalists aren’t the only people whose job it is to explain high-tech concepts in laymen’s terms?\nNo, of course not. That’s also the job of communications officers working in the science world, for example. These professionals – some of whom are attending our conference – play an important role in the information chain. But unlike science journalists, they are not independent; they usually work for a research institution. One of the talks at our conference will be on the role that YouTubers can play in disseminating scientific knowledge. Personally I believe social media is a vector we mustn’t ignore, provided that the science is described as accurately as possible. And social media can let us reach people – especially today’s youth – who don’t necessarily read magazines or newspapers.\nWhat does the WCSJ offer to partner organizations like EPFL?\nThis year’s event is bringing some 1,200 science journalists and communications officers from 83 different countries to the EPFL campus, as well as to the campuses of other partner organizations like UNIL, CHUV, CERN and the University of Geneva. Attendees will visit these organizations’ research labs and meet the researchers during the  tours we are holding every day during the week of the conference. These tours will give researchers a unique opportunity to speak with journalists who would have never come to the school otherwise, and to build an international network.\nWhat do you hope will be the long-term impact of the conference?\nThe WCSJ offers huge networking potential. Journalists get to speak directly with researchers and vice versa, meaning that partner organizations can forge lasting ties with science journalists the world over. And for science journalists, the WCSJ enables them to build a peer network that helps them do their jobs faster and more efficiently. I’m still in touch with researchers I met at previous editions of the WCSJ – and with journalists from other countries, whom I sometimes ask for assistance when writing an article about something related to their country.\nAs the head of the organizing committee, you’ve been able to step behind the scenes. What has that taught you?\nIt definitely pulled me out of my comfort zone! I had to don the hat of a professional conference organizer – but fortunately I had a team of 45 talented people behind me, based in France, Switzerland, Italy and even Montreal where the WFSJ headquarters is located. Working with them was a fantastic experience and I’d like to thank them personally. The process also forced me to take a deep look at our profession and think about what’s important to us and our community. The answers to those questions are what informed the conference program. I learned more about the field of science communications by working with the WCSJ’s partner businesses, research institutes and philanthropic organizations. It’s gratifying to put on an event that’s useful for so many people and that adheres to its founders’ original vision of a global conference that’s independent, open-minded and innovative, and that encourages journalists to think critically yet positively.\nA competitive process for selecting the conference organizers \nAt each WCSJ, the WFSJ selects a national association of science journalists to organize the following conference. The process is similar to the one for selecting the host city for the Olympic Games: candidates must submit a bid that meets several criteria. At the last WCSJ, held in San Francisco in October 2017, the Alpine Consortium – made up of the Swiss, Italian and French science journalist associations – was selected to run the 2019 edition. This is the first time a consortium of associations was selected. The winning bid was presented by representatives from those associations and EPFL.", "summary": "The 11\nth\n World Conference of Science Journalists (WCSJ) is being held in Lausanne this week, attracting some 1,200 visitors to our city.

{"id": 448, "text": "When it came time to pick a career, Simone Deparis didn’t hesitate for a second. He had known he wanted to be a math teacher ever since he was a teenager. Today a senior scientist and linear algebra professor at EPFL, he enjoys everything about math – its beauty, its contradictions and especially its complexity. “In this field you have to be tenacious, because you’ll inevitably come across times when you’re frustrated. You have to hang in there so you can eventually savor the victories,” says Professor Deparis. Originally from the Canton of Ticino, Deparis holds a mathematics degree from ETH Zurich and a PhD from EPFL; he started teaching at EPFL ten years ago. Never one to shy away from a challenge, he even seeks them out – in the 2017–2018 school year he tested . Students were responsible for learning the theory at home, and the class time was spent doing exercises. In recognition of his bold initiative in the field of mathematics and the quality of his teaching, Deparis has been given the 2018 Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.\nFlipped classrooms are being used increasingly at universities worldwide, including EPFL. But the challenge for teacher Deparis was to use the approach in a linear algebra class for first-year students who may not be particularly motivated about math. (The class is for students of all sections except architecture, math and physics.) “I completely revolutionized my class. It was a lot of work but at the same time very stimulating,” he says. And that wasn’t the first risk he’s taken. While at EPFL, he also developed a ; some 40,000 people have signed up for the English version.\nA knack for improvisation\nSimone Deparis tried out the flipped classroom with 100 linear algebra students over five weeks in the middle of the term. “Studies have shown that students learn better in flipped classrooms. And the mathematics section also wanted to see if this new approach would help motivate students who didn’t choose to study math.” For this trial run, he let students decide whether they wanted to participate and used it for only a third of the total course. “We wanted to make sure that students who volunteered to try the flipped classroom weren’t placed at a disadvantage.” \nTo develop his approach, the mathematician Deparis worked closely with Cécile Hardebolle, a teaching advisor at , and based it on . “The first lesson was a disaster because I didn’t coordinate it with the MOOC. But I quickly fixed the problem, and then the students were really enthusiastic. The experience taught me a lot. With flipped classrooms, you have to be able to respond to questions and comments that might not come up in a conventional classroom. You have to be able to improvise while remaining clear and methodical.”\nTeacher Deparis’s students enjoyed this new way of learning, even though it meant they had to do more work at home. The initial feedback indicates that by working on exercises in the classroom, students were able to better assess their level, discuss problems and help each other out. In fact, once the five weeks of the flipped classroom were over, the students didn’t want to return to the conventional approach. Deparis is repeating the experiment this fall but extending it to cover most of the course. And once again, hundreds of students have signed up. Apparently the teacher’s bet was right on the mark.", "summary": "Simone Deparis, an EPFL senior scientist and teacher in the mathematics section, has been awarded the 2018 Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.

{"id": 450, "text": "Mountains are home to many living species, with biodiversity typically peaking at mid-altitudes. Scientists have long struggled to explain why this is the case, invoking factors such as low temperatures at high elevations or human disturbance further down. According to new research, mid-altitudes host the largest number of species because the size and the connectedness of similar habitats are greatest there. One implication of their findings, presented in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is that moving to higher elevations to adapt to a warming climate could drive species into habitats with a whole different set of spatial properties.\nMany factors determine the number species that can co-exist on a patch of land. Large areas with similar properties typically host more species than small ones. And their biodiversity can be increased further if many similar habitats are connected. In mountainous terrain, other factors come into play, such as temperature, biological productivity, and exposition. By transposing the findings from flat land to mountainous terrain, a team of researchers from across Switzerland has found a new way to explain the observation that biodiversity in mountainous terrain tends to peak at mid-altitudes.\n“In mountainous terrain, peaks and valleys are isolated habitats, like islands in the ocean, whereas mid-elevation sites form well-connected patches,” explains Enrico Bertuzzo, a researcher at the Ecohydrology Lab at EPFL and first author of the study. “Given that habitat area and connectivity foster biodiversity, whereas isolation favors the dominance of few species, we hypothesized that topography itself could be playing a key role in regulating how biodiversity varies with elevation.”\nBiodiversity is often studied on idealized cone-shaped mountains, where similar habitats are assumed to be found at similar altitudes. In this case, habitats get smaller with increasing altitude, and their species richness is predicted to decrease, leading biodiversity to peak at foot of the cone and steadily decrease with elevation. Instead, Bertuzzo and his coauthors took a more laborious approach. “Rather than simplifying mountainous terrain to perfect cones or regular hills, our starting point was to consider it in all of its complexity,” explains Florian Altermatt from the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich.\nTo test their intuition that the very structure a landscape can shape biodiversity patterns, Bertuzzo and his coauthors let loose a large number of virtual species on a mountainous terrain in a computer simulation. Each virtual species was assigned an optimal altitude at which it could thrive, and these altitudes were distributed uniformly across all the elevations considered. When the researchers let the virtual species compete for habitats on landscapes modeled on real-life ones, their simulations confirmed their intuition: topography alone was enough to explain biodiversity patterns observed in nature.\n“Other factors, like temperature, productivity, etc., are obviously also important, but they inevitably act on top of the unavoidable effect provided by the landscape structure,“ says Altermatt.\nThese findings are of particular relevance in a warming world. “Understanding the relation between elevation and biodiversity is crucial to predict how the distribution of species will change in response to climate change,” says Bertuzzo. “Warmer temperatures will cause species' niches to shift upwards. The same ecological community will therefore move up the mountain, where it will find a different spatial composition, both in terms of available area and connectivity. Our findings underscore the importance of considering these factors to predict future changes.”\nThis study was carried out by researchers from the Laboratory for Ecohydrology at the EPFL, the Department of Aquatic Ecology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zürich, and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University.\nReference:\n Enrico Bertuzzo, Francesco Carrara, Lorenzo Maric, Florian Altermatt, Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe, and Andrea Rinaldo.

This is plasma, a substance that could be used in the future to control the movement of small satellites and space probes.\n This machine is part of Félicien Filleul’s Master’s project. A 26-year-old physics student at EPFL, Filleul also did a Minor in Space Technologies. Through this project, which he did at the Swiss Plasma Center in collaboration with the Space Engineering Center (eSpace), Filleul contributed to the effort to develop plasma-fueled satellite propulsion engines. Research on this groundbreaking technology has been ongoing for around 10 years.\n “Plasma engines could work really well with small satellites like Cubsats, which are sent into orbit without any way to control or adjust how they move,” said Filleul. So the objective is to develop a system of low-power but steady thrusters that are highly precise and consume little energy. Scientists could use them to maintain or correct the satellites’ orbit or orientation, or to set up a constellation of Cubsats, in which several of these small satellites are networked for the needs of individual missions.\nParticle soup\n “Plasma is perfect for this type of propulsion,” said Filleul. “We make it out of xenon gas, a single gram of which provides 10 times more acceleration than the same quantity of traditional fuels.”\n Plasma is neither solid, liquid nor gas – it is the fourth state of matter. While less familiar than the other three states of matter, plasma is used in everyday items such as neon signs and television screens. It is very common in the universe and can be found in the sun and other stars.\n Plasma is made by heating xenon in a vacuum at temperatures so high that the electrons are pulled out of their orbit around the nucleus. They come to form a ‘soup’ of highly charged particles. More plasma can be generated by sending a helicon-type electromagnetic wave – which spreads as it turns like a corkscrew – through the soup. Scientists can freely adjust the substance’s density by controlling the wave’s intensity.\nHeading for Mercury\n Filleul’s project focused on the antenna used to generate the helicon wave. The antenna, designed and developed at EPFL by the startup Helyssen, lends itself to plasma engines that are both small and light. And those are two major concerns in the area of space technology. “My job was to test the antenna with different densities and qualities of plasma, in order to find the ones that will work best in space,” said Filleul.\n But the fun doesn’t stop there for Filleul.

The scientists’ research has just been published in \nScientific Reports\n. \n In Europe, China, Japan and North America, the main way people catch HEV is by eating undercooked pork, and the resulting disease is generally not fatal. However, in Mexico, India, Africa and most Asian countries, HEV is contracted by coming into contact with water from a river or well contaminated with fecal matter. According to the World Health Organization, there are around 20 million HEV infections worldwide every year and some 50,000 deaths from the disease. Hepatitis E epidemics are particularly deadly for pregnant women and generally occur after heavy rains and floods or after months-long droughts. \nMachine learning\n To build their map, the EPFL scientists compiled data on all Hepatitis E epidemics recorded worldwide since 1980 and on environmental statistics like temperature, soil wetness and rainfall over the same period. They also factored in geographical location, population density and the rate of evapotranspiration, or how much river water evaporates during a drought. Evapotranspiration is important because the more that occurs, the more highly concentrated the intestinal pathogens are in the contaminated water that remains – water that is often used for cooking, washing or even religious ceremonies. \n Thanks to machine learning, the scientists were able to crunch through all the data and come up with actionable results. “Our study confirmed that the areas most at risk are those with a high population density, heavy seasonal rainfall and high evapotranspiration rates,” says Anna Carratalà, a scientist at EPFL’s Environmental Chemistry Laboratory and the study’s lead author.

{"id": 453, "text": "Africa’s increasingly urban populations are expected to double by 2050. This is leading to cities' exponential growth, something that is exceptionally difficult for many countries to manage. Most of these urban areas, such as the sprawling city of Lagos in Nigeria, are so vast that their boundaries are hard to identify. Africa’s new cities are being built in peri-urban areas that are able to absorb population growth. However, few countries have urban planning strategies that address this reality. Taken aback by how little these areas have been studied, Kemajou – a PhD in architecture student – decided to focus his thesis on them, and more specifically on the cities of Lomé in Togo and Yaoundé in Cameroon. On 8 December, Kemajou defended his thesis, carried at EPFL as part of the Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT), under the supervision of Jérôme Chenal. We sat down with Kemajou to talk about his work.\nWhen studying the outlying areas of Lomé and Yaoundé, you found that a harmonious urban fabric existed, albeit one that has developed outside of legal frameworks.\nThere is a considerable gap between designed cities – as established in legislation and by urban planning policies – and a “lived” city that was built up by its residents day after day. This large disconnect means that there is no oversight regarding what is being built – and that’s mainly because existing urban planning instruments and legislation are basically holdovers from the colonial era, which, until now, were modelled on urban practices from Europe. But European cities are constructed differently, and their technical, human and financial resources are totally different. This means that these instruments are not realistic for Africa and thus inapplicable. The reality on the ground is more local and more socially complex than in Europe, and this needs to be taken into account.\nThere is a collective intelligence underlying how a city is constructed\nArmel Kemajou\nAre you saying that current urban planning strategies won’t be able to meet the needs of a population that will double in 20 years?\nIn Yaoundé, the city's circumference has tripled over the last three decades. In Lomé, it has increased by a factor of 4.5. It’s clear that the resources to halt this urbanization are lacking, so a line must be drawn under what has been done. City officials can’t act as if everything that has been created by existing residents doesn’t exist. More robust and scalable plans that address this rapid urban expansion are needed.\nDevelopment of the city of Yaoundé, Cameroon, from 1984 to 2016. © Public thesis defense of Armel Kemajou\nSo, city officials should factor in building methods that residents have already been using?\nYes, exactly. There is a collective intelligence underlying how a city is constructed. For my thesis, we interviewed about a hundred residents of Lomé and Yaoundé. We wanted to find out what kind of strategies they used to achieve home ownership, and how these strategies interconnect. We found an underlying wisdom and intelligent choices. When you come in with rigid assessment methods, you get the impression that it’s all very informal, place-specific and even incomprehensible. But underneath there are very clear rationales.\nYou can’t force people to adhere to a 1960s urban planning model that hasn’t changed since independence.\nArmel Kemajou\nYou’re saying that the built environment in these two cities' peri-urban areas is not informal?\nAbsolutely not. Very few people we spoke with moved to the outskirts out of frustration, or because they had no other choice. These are people who think things through, who make plans and carry them out. This produces something that urban theorists are not accustomed to, but it is nevertheless a valid way of constructing a city. Besides, if most of a city is “informal,” how do we determine what constitutes the “real” city? If we want to design an efficient model that is in line with reality on the ground, we should take as our starting point what the majority of people are actually doing.\nA residence in the Nkozoa neighborhood in Yaounde © 2018 Armel Kemajou\nTherefore, the new cities that are being designed and built on urban outskirts are the result of local construction strategies?\nThey’re the result of collective thinking, of know-how that people draw on to construct their own living space, one that suits their needs. They build their space on the scale of a home, but they also know how to make it part of their district, in association with their neighbors – an area where families can thrive, with collective social facilities, markets, children’s playgrounds, and so on. All of this takes place outside of any urban planning framework, because that framework can’t keep pace with these collective strategies.\nBut without a comprehensive approach to urban planning, won’t the limits of this strategy eventually become clear, given Togo and Cameroon’s rapid population growth?\nIn my thesis, I don’t advocate a \nlaissez-faire\n approach – that would end in chaos. But the way urban construction is being addressed today is also not the right one. I recommend a collective urban planning method, one that can establish a dialogue among local governments, city planners, and the hundreds of thousands of “individual urban developers.” It’s at the intersection of these two ways of thinking that we will find the most appropriate form of urban planning. You can’t force people to adhere to a 1960s urban planning model that hasn’t changed since independence.\nTrès heureux de remettre le titre de Dr a Armel KEMJOU pour son superbe travail de recherche sur la construction des périphéries des  à  et \n — Jerome CHENAL (@jchenal) \nYour interdisciplinary work lies at the crossroads of urban planning, social science and economics. It also includes research in law and engineering. How did you carry out your study?\nTo take an example, let’s say you want to study Geneva. All you need to do is submit a request to the canton and you have all the data you need in digital format. But when it comes to the very local reality of these two cities in Africa, where there is a dearth of basic data, we had to be creative in our methodology. Central to the study was a qualitative analysis of those hundred or so interviews we conducted with city residents, which we cross-referenced with more rigorous methods. To understand how people get around, we attached GPS devices to about fifty motorized cabs that serve the peri-urban areas. By combining this travel data with the interviews, we were able to measure the impact of transportation methods on the development of outlying areas. We rounded this out with interviews with experts, cartographic analyses of land values, and finally an assessment of the existing legal framework.\nCould your thesis findings be immediately implemented by Togolese and Cameroonian city officials?\nStudies like this one are, in my view, essential to achieving effective urban planning. I’m very happy that colleagues who are employed by these two cities attended my online defense. I was able to immediately share my recommendations with them. I will make my thesis findings available and I hope that they will eventually translate into policies consistent with my recommendations.\nSpatial development of Lomé, Togo.

{"id": 454, "text": "Navigating in an unfamiliar setting is a major challenge for people with a visual impairment. To make it easier for them to find their way, EPFL researchers have developed a lightweight and reconfigurable touchscreen tablet capable of generating shapes and maps. Users can then “read” the graphic data on the screen with their fingers. The research is part of the European project .\nMeasuring 12 by 15 centimeters, the tablet comprises 192 tiny buttons that can move up and down in just a few milliseconds, almost instantaneously creating patterns such as the layout of a building, street or conference room. Users can also zoom in on a specific part of the map. The actuators are fast enough to make individual buttons vibrate. The technology has already been tested by several visually impaired people and will be presented at the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems () in Denver on 6 May.\nUsing magnets to save energy\n The underlying mechanism is straightforward. Each button contains a tiny magnet placed between two coils and two thin layers of steel. Any given button can be moved up or down by generating a local magnetic field by driving current through one of the coils for five milliseconds. The magnetized buttons then remain in the up or down position because they attach to one the two steel plates. “The system requires no power to keep the button in place,” said Herbert Shea, director of EPFL’s Microsystems for Space Technologies Laboratory, which is located in Microcity, Neuchatel (CH). “This keeps energy consumption to a minimum.” The tablet also comes equipped with Bluetooth, so it can connect to computers and tablet PCs.\nThe perfect complement to Braille or a white cane\n For Herbert Shea, this tablet fills a gap in the market. “People can read with a Braille display, and detect nearby obstacles with a white cane. Our tablet, which will not cost much to produce, will provide graphic information in real time, so the user can check out the layout of a room or street before venturing into it.”\nDenis Maret visited EPFL to test a prototype of the new tablet and was impressed. “Those of us who are visually impaired currently have to use a white cane with an audio GPS when we go to new places,” he explained. “Like in a vehicle, the GPS tells us when to turn. But we have no way of checking that information, or of making a mental map of the place. This technology will make us more independent.”\nA support for schoolchildren\n In addition to helping guide people around, the tablet could also be used to help visually impaired schoolchildren. “In geometry class, the tablet could be connected to the board to instantly reproduce all the shapes and graphics drawn by the teacher,” said Shea. In cooperation with the BlindPad project partners, visually impaired children in Poland and Italy are currently testing the tablet with learning exercises.\n-----\nEuropean project: \nProject partners :\n-  Herbert Shea, Juan Zarate, Nadine Besse, Olexandr Gudozhnik and Anthony Ruch\n -  (coordinator)\n - \n - \n -\n -", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a tablet to help people with a visual impairment find their way around unfamiliar places.

{"id": 459, "text": "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that occur in our body, in plants or bacteria to control diverse functions. Several peptides are used as drugs such as insulin, which controls the metabolism of sugar, and cyclosporine, which suppresses organ rejection after transplants. More than 40 peptides are already approved as drugs, generating revenues in the billions. There are several hundreds of peptide-based medications currently in clinical trials.\nBut almost none of these drug-peptides can be taken orally. Since peptides are an important part of food, the stomach and intestines harbor countless enzymes that can degrade them, meaning that most peptide-based medication do not survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract.\nHope to generate more stable peptides came from “cyclic” peptides, whose ends are joined together by chemical bridges making them more stable than linear ones because their backbones are less flexible and thus harder to attack by enzymes. In 2018, the research group of Christian Heinis at EPFL developed a peptide format termed double-bridged peptides, where peptides are cyclized by two chemical bridges that provide even higher stability. Despite its success, most such peptides were not sufficiently stable to survive the enormous enzymatic pressure found in the gastrointestinal tract.\nNow, Heinis’s group has developed a new method that identifies among billions of double-bridged peptides those that bind a disease target of interest and survive enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract. The method is published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, and involves three steps.\nFirst, billions of genetically encoded random peptide sequences are cyclized by two chemical bridges that impose conformational constraints onto the peptides' backbones so that they are more difficult to attack by enzymes.\nSecond, this library of peptides is exposed to enzymes from cow intestine to eliminate all those peptides that are not stable.\nIn the third and last step, the scientist dip target proteins into the pool of surviving peptides to fish out those that bind to the wanted disease target. “It’s a bit like searching a needle in a haystack, and this method makes this easy,” says Heinis.\nWith this method, the researchers have succeeded for the first time in evolving target-specific peptides that can resist breakdown in the gastrointestinal tract. For example, they gave mice a lead peptide that inhibits thrombin – an important anti-thrombosis target – in the form of a pill. The peptide remained intact in the stomach and intestines, and even though it reached the blood stream in rather small quantities, most of it remained fully intact across the entire gastrointestinal tract. This is a key step towards engineering oral peptide drugs.\nHeinis’s group is now applying the new method to develop oral peptides that act directly on gastrointestinal targets, meaning that they don’t need to travel into the blood stream. “We are focusing on chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as bacterial infections,” says Heinis. “We have already succeeded in generating enzyme-resistant peptides against the interleukin-23 receptor, an important target of these diseases, which affect millions of patients worldwide without any oral drug available.”\nOther contributors\nEPFL Protein Production and Structure Core Facility\nEPFL Laboratory for Biomolecular Modeling\nSwiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "summary": "Peptides represent a billion-dollar market in the pharmaceutical industry, but they can generally only be taken as injections to avoid degradation by stomach enzymes.

{"id": 462, "text": "“When I was little, I clearly remember reading an article on carbon nanotubes in a kids’ science magazine. And that’s what I ended up doing my thesis on!” Christophe Galland, who’s now specialized in optical spectroscopy and quantum optics, can’t pinpoint exactly when science became part of his life, although he’s always been a bit of a math geek. “I think my teachers really had a decisive influence later on,” says Galland. “I had a physics teacher who was really good at explaining the link between equations and daily phenomena.” In the battle between math and physics, physics came out on top – it’s more concrete and more tangible.\nSo it wasn’t fate that got him where he is, although there were times as a student when he wasn’t sure where his path would take him. After studying at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, he learned about the realities of working in a lab when he joined ETH in Zurich for his thesis in quantum optics. “When I completed my thesis, I thought about leaving research to focus on teaching.” But what really fascinated him was the dual role of the professors who trained him: “They were world-renowned researchers and also very good teachers and instructors.”\nLife in the academic world\nResearchers commonly spend some time abroad developing their career – and Galland was keen on delving deeper into his field – so as a post-doc he headed to the Los Alamos National Lab and then the University of Delaware.\nHe landed at EPFL in 2013, thanks to an Ambizione grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation. He’s been running EPFL’s Laboratory of Quantum and Nano-Optics since 2017. With his ten-strong team, he continues to seek out the secrets that can be revealed by light.\nA pinch of philosophy\nWhen you ask Galland whether he knew as a student how his career would play out, it becomes clear that he’s simply guided by his passion. “There are so many uncertainties in an academic career that I just took things one step at a time,” he says. “Even now, I don’t know what will be my position in two years’ time. If you work hard, doors open for you, but you have to be ready to seize opportunities that weren’t necessarily part of your plan.”\nThe lab work is also unpredictable on a daily basis. Each experiment brings its own surprises. And he’s constantly challenging himself. “In quantum physics, we’re dealing with really counter-intuitive phenomena,” explains Galland. “We have to ask ourselves quite philosophical questions when we’re interpreting some of our results.”\nAnd what’s more philosophical than light, a word that can be interpreted in so many ways? This budding philosopher’s lab is filled with lasers, home-built microscopes and single-photon counters for studying the interaction between light and matter. Applying a range of optical techniques, Galland and his colleagues use it to detect and measure molecule vibrations and other phenomena taking place at the atomic level.\nA thirst for knowledge\n“My work makes me even more curious,” says Galland. “It makes me want to explain things and be as rational as possible.” He’s honest with himself and recognizes that he finds it hard to draw a line between his professional and private life, although he does enjoy hiking, cycling and playing the piano. “I’m always thinking about work to some extent,” he says. “My wife’s a medical doctor, and she’s continued to do research after her PhD, so we talk a lot about our day-to-day professional experiences. That helps me a lot, especially on the human side of things, because doctors and academics don’t think and act in the same way.”\nFor Galland, research isn’t just about deciphering the world around us and driving innovation. More than anything, it’s a training tool: “I think that the greatest impact of research on society is that we’re passing on our passion and our knowledge to our Bachelor’s, Master’s and PhD students.” For now, Galland is happy to keep probing the laws of quantum mechanics and nanomaterials at EPFL.\nBiography\n1983\n: born in Valence, in the Drôme (France)\n2001-2006\n: studied in Grenoble (preparatory studies) and then at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris\n2010\n: completed his PhD at ETH Zurich\n2010\n: worked as a postdoc at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, then at the University of Delaware\n2013\n: worked as a postdoc at EPFL’s Laboratory of Quantum and Nano-Optics\n2015\n: served as a technical consultant for Gamaya and as a member of LakeDiamond’s scientific advisory board\n2017\n: became an SNSF-funded professor and the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Quantum and Nano-Optics", "summary": "Summer Series: A calling for research.\n Christophe Galland, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Quantum and Nano-Optics, believes that teaching and research are inextricably linked.

But how these changes trickle down to impact trees that grow on the riverbanks is still unclear. Now, researchers have shown how the roots of certain tree species are shaped by fluctuations in the depth of the water table that they draw their water from. Their work could help predict the ecological impact of changes to river flow regimes and contribute to improving the success of river restoration projects. They  their work in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n“It is one thing to estimate how changing rainfall patterns, a warmer climate, or hydropower production change the depth of the water table around a river,” says Stefania Tron, the lead author of the study and model developer. “But to date it is difficult to predict the repercussions of these changes on plants that grow on riverbeds and banks,” she says. And that despite the fact that trees play a fundamental role in river ecosystems by stabilizing riverbeds and providing habitats for animals.\n“Our goal was to develop a way to predict how the roots of certain types of trees, such as birches, willows and poplars that draw most of the water from ground water, respond to changes in the depth of the water table,” she explains. “Just above the water table, there is a layer of soil that is kept humid by capillary forces. When the depth of the water table fluctuates, roots that are within this humid layer grow, while those in the dry soil above it and those immersed in ground water below it may die off.”\nThe researchers developed a mathematical model that combines information on plant species, soil properties, and water table fluctuations to estimate the distribution of their roots underground. They validated their model against the roots of actual trees that they dug out from the banks of the Rhone River in Valais and the Thur River in St. Gallen, and with trees grown in an outdoor laboratory.\nA case study close to home\nUsing her model, Tron studied how a 70-centimeter drop of the water table would impact the roots of on birches and poplars growing on the banks of the Rhone River. Her results showed how deep soil layers impact the trees’ resilience. When, for example, they grow above a draining soil layer at a shallow depth, a drop in the water table can be detrimental by cutting them from their deep groundwater source.\nBesides studying the effect of natural and manmade changes to river flow rate on tree root density, Paolo Perona, the project’s supervisor, says that it could also provide valuable information for river restoration projects. “If you know the depth of the water table and the type of soil, our model can provide information on how deep the roots will grow, allowing to quantify to what extent they reinforce they soil of the riverbanks,” he says.\nThis research was carried by the Applied Hydroeconomics and Alpine Environmental Dynamics at EPFL in collaboration with the Politecnico di Torino and the Bern University of Applied Sciences (HAFL) and supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.", "summary": "Changing flow rates in rivers can be disruptive to bushes and trees that grow on riverbanks.

{"id": 465, "text": "For their semester project, Océane Hames and Lucas Ott, two Master’s students in Environmental Engineering at EPFL, chose to focus on the Yverdon-les-Bains wastewater treatment plant. This plant is known as a pioneer in Switzerland because in 2016 it became the country’s first to install a stripping membrane system for nitrogen recovery. These systems work by using a polypropylene membrane to filter the nitrogen from the rest of the wastewater, after the effluent has gone through some initial processing. By stripping out the nitrogen in this way, plants can both reduce their nitrogen emissions into nearby streams and produce a high-quality liquid fertilizer. The fertilizer made at Yverdon-les-Bains has been certified by the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture; some 140 m\n3\n are generated each year and sold to a local farmer who spreads it on his crops, thus completing the nitrogen cycle. \n But Hames and Ott wanted to make the nitrogen recovery process more efficient by increasing the fertilizer’s nitrogen concentration to above 40 g/L, as that would cut the cost of storing and transporting the fluid. Taking inspiration from the osmotic distillation technique commonly used to concentrate fruit juice, the students developed a method specifically for nitrogen that could be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment processes. They conducted lab experiments over several days to bring the nitrogen concentration close to its saturation point. They also measured the flow rate of steam through the membrane so that engineers can later size the equipment needed to implement the technology on a large scale. \nWorking hand in hand with industry\n The students tested their new osmotic distillation method at a pilot unit provided by Membratec, a Sierre-based firm that develops membrane technology for wastewater treatment. The unit consisted of two 25 L wastewater reservoirs, pumps and two metallic cylinders containing a stripping membrane. They ran tests on the closed-loop system using a fluid with the same composition as the fertilizer supplied to the Vaud farmer. \n “Osmotic distillation has the advantage of being able to concentrate fruit juice at room temperature, meaning the juice’s taste and nutritional properties remain intact,” says Hames. Ott adds: “In osmotic distillation systems, a hydrophobic porous membrane lets gas compounds like steam pass through but not liquids. The driving force is generated by a partial vapor-pressure difference between the two fluids separated by the membrane. That’s the same mechanism we used to concentrate the nitrogen in the liquid fertilizer.”\nSupplementing the theory learned in class\n These types of semester projects, called Design Projects, are required of all Master’s level environmental engineering students at EPFL. They are intended to give students first-hand experience with the R&D carried out in industry. “I really liked the trial-and-error aspect of the project and the opportunity to discuss our progress week by week with a Membratec engineer,” says Ott. And according to Hames: “It was nice to take a break from the classroom and spend the day running lab experiments. And it was really motivating to know that there could be a concrete application for the work we were doing.” The students’ project was supervised by Christof Holliger, a full professor at EPFL and head of the School’s Laboratory for Environmental Biotechnology (LBE). \n The students weren’t the only ones to gain from the project.

{"id": 469, "text": "Oceans are a bellwether for the planet’s health, absorbing over 90% of the sun’s energy. They demonstrate the extent to which rising temperatures are threatening coral reefs and other vital ecosystems that support biodiversity. In 2016 and 2017, an abrupt rise in surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean caused mass bleaching on an unprecedented scale. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was especially hard-hit. \nBleaching occurs when heat stress disrupts the symbiotic relationship between corals and the tiny algae that live inside them, providing a source of nutrients for coral and giving them their color. Persistent bleaching can lead to coral death. In the past two decades, abnormal heatwaves caused entire sections of reef off the coast of Australia – measuring several kilometers in length – to turn white.\nCoral bleaching can lead to their death. © 2020 Istock\nScientists have already found that some reefs are better equipped to cope with recurring heat stress than others. For his thesis research, Oliver Selmoni, a doctoral assistant at EPFL’s , applied the principles of environmental genomics to characterize this ability to adapt. Selmoni cross-referenced the results of genetic analyses of coral samples with ocean temperature data captured by satellites to determine what made some corals better able to withstand rising temperatures.\nBuilding a study from the ground up\n on a coral species in Japan, Selmoni travelled to New Caledonia to build a new study from the ground up. He collected his own coral samples with the help of the IRD scientists based in Nouméa.  on 12 November. \nNew Caledonia is home to the world’s second-longest coral reef, expanding to over 1,000 km. This relatively compact ecosystem is exposed to dramatic contrasts in environmental conditions, which makes it an ideal candidate for studying climate adaptation.\nOliver Selmoni\nThe study aimed to test two hypotheses. The first is that coral populations learn to adapt to warmer seas after experiencing prolonged heat stress over many years. “The longer higher temperatures persist, the more likely it is that climate-resilient traits will develop and be passed down from generation to generation,” explains Selmoni. The second hypothesis relates to connectivity: corals reproduce by releasing larvae into the water, which are then carried in ocean currents. “Corals rely on nearby populations for survival. When a reef is destroyed by environmental stressors or human activity, larvae from elsewhere are needed to kick-start repopulation,” he adds.\nEstablishing marine protected areas\nSelmoni’s first task was to assess the composition of the marine environment in New Caledonia, using satellite data stretching back 30 years. After selecting 20 sites with the greatest temperature contrasts, he headed into the field to collect samples. “We focused on three flagship Pacific coral species that are susceptible to bleaching and relatively easy to find,” he recalls. “It was a huge undertaking: 3,000 km by road and another 1,000 km by boat!” Selmoni shared details of his experience on the \n, he found that the field observations supported his connectivity and adaptation hypotheses. “As expected, we observed a correlation between likelihood of adaptation and prolonged exposure to high heat stress. Conversely, corals in locations that had never experienced heat stress showed no climate-adaptive traits,” explains Selmoni.\n© 2020 LASIG\nLooking ahead, the maps developed in the study could be used to establish new marine protected areas (MPAs) – zones where fishing, tourism, industry and other human activities are restricted – in places where, through connectivity, heat-resistant coral strains could populate reefs around the archipelago. Another option could be to select and grow climate-adaptive corals, then transplant them into nearby reefs that are less able to withstand rising temperatures, thereby accelerating the process of natural selection. “Over time, these hardier strains can help rebuild damaged reefs or make existing coral populations more resilient to bleaching,” adds Selmoni. \nConnect scientists and authorities managing marine protected areas \nThe ManaCo consortium was founded in Nouméa in 2019 by a group of coral-reef scientists and authorities managing MPAs in the Pacific. The aim is to further reef-conservation efforts by bridging the divide and fostering communication between research and practice. Its members include representatives of various countries, including a number of island states in the region.

{"id": 473, "text": "Weeds have started to grow in the Place Nord since EPFL went into lockdown on Friday, 13 March. The air inside the campus buildings smells like it’s been trapped in there for a while. And for seven weeks, coffee cups have been waiting on people’s desks to be washed, and prototypes and pipettes have idled in the labs. Around 1,200 staff members are now authorized to return to campus. While many are eager to get back to work, there’s also – understandably – some apprehension. But there will be no shortage of measures to protect people from the invisible coronavirus.\nThroughout the lockdown, the Security, Prevention and Health Domain (DSPS) team – keeping one eye on the changing cantonal and federal directives – has been working hard to get the campus . The restart plan sets out the measures that have been or will be taken at all levels, down to the very last detail. It also allows for the measures to be adjusted as the public-health situation evolves. “We want people to feel confident about coming back to campus, but we also want to take things step by step so that we can assess whether the measures are the right ones, whether any changes need to be made and, ultimately, whether we can ease the restrictions,” sums up Eric Du Pasquier, who heads up the DSPS team.\nA gradual return to campus\nDuring this , only research teams needing access to lab facilities will be able to come back. They’ve had to draw up shift plans, since only around 35% of each team will be allowed on site at any one time. Starting now, there will be between 1,200 and 1,500 people on campus every day. And if all goes well, that number will increase to around 2,500 at the end of June. However, the School’s 9,000 Bachelor’s and Master’s students are still not allowed back on campus.\nFor those who will be coming back to their labs and desks, the message is clear: “Keep your distance and wash your hands regularly.” To make things easier, the DSPS team spent all of last week putting together welcome kits composed of eight face masks and one small bottle of hand sanitizer for each staff member. They also put up signs on every door to remind people of the public-health measures, provided catering outlets with floor-marking materials, and made sure that all buildings are thoroughly cleaned and all door handles, ramps, rails and Camipro booths disinfected. “That way, we know we’re starting off on the right foot,” says Du Pasquier.\nDrastic hygiene measures\nThe DSPS team isn’t compromising when it comes to staff members’ health. Early on in the lockdown, EPFL donated some 60,000 surgical masks to health care workers. But it has now acquired a further 150,000 and is expecting another 100,000 to be delivered this week – all of them made in China. Around 80 hand sanitizer dispensers have been set up at strategic locations across campus. “As staff members gradually return to campus, we’ll get a better idea of the logistics in terms of cleaning facilities and providing disinfectant, soap, paper, etc.” says Du Pasquier.\nRunning catering points like clockwork\nThe aim is to reassure people by providing facemasks without making them compulsory. But drastic hygiene measures will be needed to safeguard people’s health. These measures have had the biggest impact on the School’s catering points – they’ve had to be totally reorganized, just like airport security was after 9/11. Providing food is an essential task, so some ten catering points will reopen on the Lausanne campus and one at EPFL’s site in Geneva. But lunch breaks won’t be the same as they were before March 2020. Priority will be given to takeout food, there’ll be no buffet service, and choice will be limited. There won’t be many places for people to sit, there’ll be markings on the floor, and payments will be by card or Camipro only. Catering staff will wear gloves and facemasks and be separated from their customers by a Plexiglas screen and a visor. Customers will be asked to keep their distance, to not touch anything, and to follow the one-way system. “We’re going further than the federal guidelines,” says Loic Sauzeau, regional head of Compass Group, which is reopening the Giacometti, Le Corbusier and PUUR catering outlets. “In addition to safeguarding our staff, we want to provide people with impeccable service.”\nCatering points will be open in various buildings in order to limit people’s movement. And to prevent bottlenecks, hot dishes will be served on one side and sandwiches and salads on the other. In the early days, it’ll be a matter of just seeing how things go. “We want to meet our customers’ needs as best we can,” says Sophie Vuetaz, head of operations at Novae, which is reopening the Ornithorynque, Cybercafé and Epicure outlets. “But getting the quantity of food that we produce right will also be a challenge – we don’t yet know how much demand there will be, and we want to keep waste to a minimum. We’ll have to take it one day at a time.”", "summary": "Starting today, Monday, 4 May, research activities will gradually resume on EPFL’s Lausanne campus and at its other sites across French-speaking Switzerland.", "claim": "Starting today, Monday, 4 May, research activities will gradually resume on EPFL’s Lausanne campus and at our other sites across French-speaking Switzerland.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [20, 20], "noise": false}

The huge mass of the cluster acts as a cosmic magnifying glass and enlarges even more distant galaxies, so they become bright enough for Hubble to see. \nCredit: \nNASA, ESA, and J. Lotz (STScI)\nGalaxy clusters are the largest known structures in the Universe, containing thousands of galaxies and hot gas. But more importantly, they contain the mysterious dark matter, which accounts for 27 percent of all matter and energy. Current models of dark matter predict that galaxy clusters have very dense cores, and those cores contain a very massive galaxy that never moves from the cluster’s center. \nBut after studying ten galaxy clusters, David Harvey at  and his colleagues in France and the UK have discovered that the density is much smaller than predicted, and that the galaxy at the center actually moves.\nEvery galaxy cluster contains a galaxy that is brighter than the others, aptly named “brightest cluster galaxy” or BCG. Recent evidence from simulations of exotic, non-standard dark matter shows that BCGs actually wobble long after the galaxy cluster has relaxed. This is residual wobbling caused by massive merging of galaxy clusters. \nThe researchers compared their observations to the predictions from the  suite of cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations finding that the two did not match. According to the Standard Model of dark matter (called “cold dark matter”), this wobbling doesn’t exist because the enormous density of dark matter keeps it tightly bound at the center of the galaxy cluster. Therefore, this mismatch suggests the existence of yet-unknown physics that have not been accounted for.\nThe galaxy clusters that the astronomers studied also act as strong gravitational lenses: they are so massive that they warp spacetime enough to distort light passing through them, like a lens. As a result, they can be used to make a map of dark matter, working out where the center is and then observing how the BCG wobbles around this center.\n“We found that that the BCGs ‘slosh’ around at the bottom of the halos,” says David Harvey. “This indicates that, instead of a dense region in the center of the galaxy cluster, there is a much shallower central density — a striking signal of exotic forms of dark matter right at the heart of galaxy clusters.” The wobbling also shows that BCGs cannot coincide exactly with the cluster’s halo, meaning that certain models of galaxy clusters have to be adjusted.\nThe scientists will extend their research with larger surveys of galaxy clusters such as . They hope that this will allow them to confirm their findings, but to also determine if BCG wobbling originates in new fundamental physics or a novel astrophysical phenomenon.\nContributors\nCNRS (Aix-Marseille Université)\nLiverpool John Moores University\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)\nMerac foundation\nReference\nDavid Harvey, F.

{"id": 479, "text": "Deciding when it’s safe for a building’s residents to move back in after an earthquake is a major challenge and responsibility for civil engineers. Not only do they have to evaluate whether the building could collapse, but also whether it could withstand aftershocks of the same magnitude. The good news is, some promising research is being carried out in this field.\nScientists at EPFL’s Applied Computing and Mechanics Laboratory (IMAC) have come up with a new method that can increase the accuracy of these types of assessments. It is based on taking measurements of a building’s ambient vibrations, and can be used to enhance existing methods and speed the process for determining which structures are too fragile to live in. The study – by Yves Reuland (lead author), Pierino Lestuzzi and Ian F.C. Smith – appears in the January issue of \nSoil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering\n.\n“Our article shows that we can leverage existing technology in new ways. We took systems that are already used to measure the condition of bridges, and applied them to the assessment of buildings damaged by an earthquake,” says Lestuzzi, a senior scientist at IMAC. “The other novel aspect of our method is that we don’t need to know the baseline – that is, pre-earthquake – condition of a building to perform the assessment.” That’s important because buildings generally aren’t equipped with sensors that continually measure their structural behavior. After an earthquake, engineers have to diagnose a building’s condition much like a doctor who has to diagnose a patient without knowing the patient’s medical history.\nVisual assessment\nEngineers currently perform this diagnosis using a visual assessment carried out according to an appraisal form developed by Italian researchers. This approach proved highly effective after the two major earthquakes in central Italy in 2009 and 2016. But even though a visual assessment is essential for spotting the damage caused to a building, it takes a long time to complete – some 2–3 hours per building – and is fairly complicated and subjective. And it does not eliminate the uncertainty about whether a building could withstand aftershocks. Hence the new method developed at IMAC.\nWith the new method, engineers record a building’s ambient vibrations (such as those created by wind or by human activity, like road traffic) with a portable seismograph; this involves placing three or four sensors at different points in the building and measuring the vibrations for half an hour – much like a doctor listens to a patient’s heartbeat with a stethoscope.\nYves Reuland monitors recordings taken by a seismograph. © A. Herzog, EPFL\nQuantitative data for fast decisions\nThe recordings are then processed to separate out signals resulting from changes in the building’s structure from signals due to weather conditions, ambient noise or the building’s age. The results are entered into a computer model in order to predict the building’s ability to withstand another earthquake. The IMAC scientists estimate that their model’s predictions are 50–100% accurate. Engineers can then combine these quantitative data with the results of their visual assessment. “Combining these two approaches reduces the amount of uncertainty as to whether a building can be occupied. But our model needs to be developed further before it can be adopted on a large scale,” says Reuland, a post-doc researcher at IMAC.\nAccording to Lestuzzi, the IMAC method could already be used to evaluate buildings on the outer rim of earthquake-affected areas, so that residents can quickly know when it’s safe to return to their homes.\nThe IMAC scientists performed their research by studying the demolition of the Villa Marguerite building on the EPFL campus and analyzing the results of experiments carried out by EPFL’s Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics Laboratory (EESD), headed by Katrin Beyer, on a pilot building constructed on a shake table.\nSharing knowledge on a regular basis \nIMAC scientists regularly deliver training courses based on their research to engineers from the cantons of Valais and Basel, which are the Swiss regions most susceptible to earthquakes. The findings of this study will also be shared with the engineers. Reuland is currently investigating how the IMAC models could be applied on an urban scale, through experiments in the towns of Sion and Martigny, and is developing scenarios for predicting building behavior during earthquakes and aftershocks. Meanwhile, the Canton of Valais has taken the appraisal form developed in Italy and adapted it to the particular features of Swiss buildings, and now offers training on that approach.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a new method for evaluating building safety after an earthquake, helping residents return to their homes more quickly.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have developed a new method for evaluating building safety after an earthquake, helping residents return to our homes more quickly.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [19, 19], "noise": false}
{"id": 481, "text": "On 27 July, around 20 architectural, civil engineering and environmental engineering students from EPFL and ETH Zurich will fly to Valparaíso, Chile, where they will spend three weeks helping to construct the Pórtico de los Huéspedes (“Guests’ Portico”), in association with students from Chile’s Escuela de Arquitectura y Diseño de la Pontificia Universidad Católica Valparaíso (e[ad] PUCV). The Portico is located at Ciudad Abierta (“Open City”), some 16 kilometers north of Valparaíso on the Pacific Coast. You can follow the students’ progress on EPFL Out There, the blog covering EPFL research expeditions and projects abroad. \n - \nA supplement to classroom learning \n Before heading to Chile, the students spend the week of 8 July getting ready for their trip at EPFL. The goal of the program is to expose them to rudimentary building methods and an approach to architecture that is focused more on the humanistic aspects. “EPFL began working with Ciudad Abierta six years ago, after we put together an exhibition about this pilot site,” says Patricia Guaita, an architect and scientist at EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE). Since then, she has been taking a small group of EPFL students to the site every summer so they can pitch in with the construction work. The students are selected through an interview process and obtain credits they can use towards their Master’s degree. \n “This ‘summer school’ is intended to supplement what the students learn in class by giving them hands-on experience with concepts related to construction and the use of space,” says Guaita. “The Portico is being built through a cross-disciplinary team project, and we hope that through our program, students will see how its construction is the tangible result of knowledge built up over the years. That will give them a fresh perspective on the construction process.” This year students will be testing out a new method for concrete form work.\n Accommodations at the site will be basic, with little or no internet access. Does that worry the students? “Not at all! It’ll give us a chance to get back in touch with the real world, after spending years behind a computer,” says Annabelle Thuring, a Master’s student in architecture. Pablo Grunig, a first-year architecture student, adds: “I immediately liked the idea of building something on the other side of the planet, in the middle of sand dunes, and being completely immersed in the project.”\nA once-in-a-lifetime experience\n “This program, with its unique living and working conditions, will show the students that construction work must not be limited to technical considerations but should also take into account the human and material experience associated with the site and its occupants,” says Guaita. David Jolly, the e[ad] PUCV professor who supervises the EPFL students every year, agrees. “The timeline for building the Portico is not dictated by school calendars. Students have been building a section of it every year for the past five years. The central role in this project is thus not played by students but by Ciudad Abierta. This workshop offers a unique platform where the students’ work, education and daily life meld. In working on this project, EPFL students don’t just help build a portion of the City, they also build up a part of themselves. What they are constructing today will last, in terms of both the building they construct and the unique experience they gain.” \nAn avant-garde artistic approach \n Ciudad Abierta was created in 1970 by a group of architects, poets, philosophers, sculptors and painters including Chilean architect Alberto Cruz and Argentinian poet Godofredo Iommi. Little known by the general public, the City has always fostered avant-garde thinking in a variety of arts and disciplines.\nThis year, the Open City Research Platform is sponsored by the EPFL Institute of Architecture, the EPFL Architecture Section, the Design Together program and the ETH Board. The IKEA Foundation also came onboard, as an external sponsor. \n The EPFL Institute of Architecture has been leading the Open City Research Platform for six years.

{"id": 483, "text": "It’s not just mycologists who are interested in the physical properties of mushrooms. Today a growing community of environmentally conscious consumers is looking more closely at mycelium, or the part of mushrooms that grows underground. This thread-like substance can bind together various substrates, such as woodchips, and the resulting mixture can be molded into things like bricks, panels, packing chips, furniture and a host of other objects. Eight students at ENAC are studying how mycelium – which individuals can grow themselves – could potentially be used to replace plastic.\n“This idea came up when we met with architecture students at our school to develop an original, innovative alternative to existing building materials, which generate a lot of pollution,” says Gaël Packer, an environmental engineering student at ENAC. Inspired by a TED talk, he and his classmates decided to lend their support to this groundbreaking community concerned about the future of the earth. As future architects and construction engineers, they realize that, as a result of resource depletion, some of today’s building materials won’t be around forever, and that existing materials generate a lot of emissions throughout their life cycle, from production to disposal.\nPromising results\nMycelium-based materials offer a promising alternative because not only are they light, cheap and easy to make, but they also provide a way to recycle waste products and can be biodegraded in just three months. Today a number of grow-it-yourself kits are available online; all you need is mycelium, a substrate and a bit of patience (not included in the kit). The first step is to grow the “mushroom roots” in a sterile or pasteurized environment together with the substrate and some flour and water. The resulting mixture is then poured into a mold. Once it has set – which takes about a week – it needs to be baked at a low temperature to stop any further growth and consolidate the object’s shape. The result is a light, low-density, solid, and resistant object – much as if it had been produced using 3D printing.\nRather than use a grow-it-yourself kit, the students made their own version of the mixture using mycelium from local oyster mushrooms and fibers from hemp grown in the Jura region. Then, armed with a healthy dose of scientific skepticism veiled in optimism, the students tested out their mushroom-derived material. “We worked with several EPFL labs to test the material’s key properties: thermal insulation, acoustic absorption, compressive strength, and water- and fire-resistance,” says Packer. They found that its thermal insulation capacity was on par with other insulating materials, that it could easily withstand the weight of a human body, that it floats and is watertight, and that it is fairly fire-resistant. Acoustic absorption tests are still under way.\nA recipe that can be improved\n“Although further testing is needed, the results so far are highly promising and show that the material’s properties are similar to those of expanded polystyrene. We can certainly improve those properties further by adjusting the composition of our mixture, whether in terms of the substrate or the mushroom feed,” says Packer.\nThe success of this project owes in part to ENAC’s Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory (SKIL), an open-space workshop where students can work on class projects and receive technical and practical support as well as assistance from teachers.\nThe Mycelium, Design and Architecture (MD&A) team members are: Kimberley Berney, Adrien Berteaux, Aurélien Brun, Mathias Helfenstein, Thomas Läng, Enrico Margaroli, Leily Moser and Gaël Packer.\nContact:", "summary": "Summer series.

{"id": 484, "text": "The total length of DNA inside a cell is between 2-3 meters. In order to fit inside cells, DNA is wrapped around small protein spindles, forming strings of molecules called nucleosomes. The nucleosomes then coil up to form intertwined fibers. This complex is called chromatin and it organizes and compacts DNA inside the cell’s nucleus, but it also makes it hard for the cellular machinery to access DNA.\nStructural studies of chromatin so far have only given us a static view of how DNA is organized in cells. But how can the gene-expression machinery access the DNA buried in chromatin? Answering this requires a more dynamic view of genetic material.\nThe , in collaboration with the group of , was now able to observe actual chromatin motions, using a unique combination of protein and DNA chemistry, along with two complementary single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy approaches. The work reveals, for the first time, the internal structure and movements of chromatin, thereby addressing an unsolved question in chromatin research.\nThe researchers found that the nucleosomes within chromatin fibers form short stacks that quickly fall apart and reform within a matter of milliseconds. These short nucleosome packages contain four nucleosomes and about 800 base pairs of DNA, thus forming the basic unit of chromatin organization. A protein that is responsible for gene silencing (heterochromatin protein 1α), can lock nucleosome interactions and compact chromatin even more, thereby preventing the gene expression machinery to access the DNA.\nTogether, the discovery of such rapid dynamic modes within chromatin fibers provides new insight how processes can gain access to the DNA (or are prevented to do so), such as transcription factors, or the machinery for transcription, replication or DNA repair.\nFunding\nSandoz Family Foundation\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nEuropean Research Council (Consolidator Grant 2017, chromo-SUMMIT )\nEPFL\nBoehringer Ingelheim Foundation\nEuropean Research Council (Advanced Grant 2015, hybridFRET)\nReference\nSinan Kilic, Suren Felekyan, Olga Doroshenko, Iuliia Boichenko, Mykola Dimura, Hayk Vardanyan, Louise C.

{"id": 485, "text": "A team of researchers presented a breakthrough device for eye surgery at EPFL Neuchâtel’s Research Day on 11 September. The device – called SPOT-RVC, which is short for Safe Puncture Optimized Tool for Retinal Vein Cannulation – was developed through an Innosuisse sponsored R&D project involving two EPFL Neuchâtel labs (\n and \n), the \n in Lausanne and Ticino-based \n as implementation partner. The team’s findings has been the subject of several publications, including one recently in the \nJournal of Medical Devices\n.\nSPOT-RVC is a high-precision, miniaturized medical device made entirely of glass. It’s just 6 cm long and 1 mm thick, and it contains a tiny fluidic channel no wider than a strand of hair as well as a sophisticated mechanism of flexible blades. Doctors can use the device to inject medicine directly into a patient’s retinal veins – something that has never before been possible.\nThe high-precision miniaturized medical device, SPOT-RVC © Instant-Lab\n“We wanted to develop a surgical method for treating retinal vein occlusion, which occurs when the main vein carrying blood away from the eye is blocked. There is currently no way to treat this condition – we can only treat the resulting complications,” says Professor Thomas J. Wolfensberger, the chief physician at Jules-Gonin Hospital. And those complications can be severe. When the retinal vein is blocked by a blood clot, this reduces the amount of oxygen carried to the retina and can trigger sudden vision loss. Over 16 million people around the world suffer from this condition, which mostly afflicts the elderly.\nCombining microengineering and microfluid mechanics\nThanks to SPOT-RVC, doctors will be able to inject blood-clot-dissolving compounds directly into patients’ retinal veins safely, without damaging the surrounding tissue. “One of the biggest problems we faced is that because veins are so small and their walls so thin, it’s hard to get the needle into the vein without overpuncturing. It’s like if you want to drill a hole into a plank of wood but don’t want the hole to go all the way through,” says Dr. Charles Baur, a senior scientist at Instant-Lab who imagined this novel concept of surgical instruments.\nThe researchers therefore drew on Instant-Lab’s expertise in flexible microstructures and multistable systems to engineer a microscopic device (< 1 mm in diameter) that can transition from one stable state to another very quickly – in around a millisecond – and in a controlled manner. “With this dynamic perforation mechanism that controls both the penetration force and direction of the needle, retinal veins don’t have time to deform. In addition, the penetration force is independent of the force exerted by the surgeon’s hand, which limits the risk of overpuncturing,” says Dr. Baur.\nAnother innovative feature of SPOT-RVC is its microscopic, flexible channel that extends all the way down to the needle tip, enabling doctors to inject the medicine. The channel was developed using an innovative process developed by scientists at Galatea, that allows for fabricating, arbitrarily long and shaped, sealed cavities.\nAnd finally, the device is made of a single piece of fused silica (SiO\n2\n), thanks to the unique expertise of FEMTOprint for integrating multiple functions in a same substrate. “Since it’s monolithic, there’s no assembly required – a step that would be nearly impossible and would make it very difficult to sterilize the instrument,” says Dr. Baur.

{"id": 492, "text": "Getting food from the farm to our plate involves complicated supply chains. Agricultural products are frequently processed in several stages and shipped through one or more countries. No surprise, then, that today’s consumers are looking more closely at what’s really in their food – especially given the numerous scandals that have come to light, such as the one in 2013 where food producers were caught substituting horse meat for beef.\nTo address this problem, scientists at  launched the  initiative to develop a system that would enable consumers to sequence the DNA in processed foods and identify every single ingredient. The initiative will entail adding DNA data to the , an open-source repository of nutritional information on 45,000 bar-coded food products in Switzerland. The Open Food Repo was also created by the Digital Epidemiology Lab.\nRecipes for gene sequencing\nAll organisms – from onions to human beings – are built from DNA. These are the molecules that contain the information necessary for organisms to live and grow. DNA sequencing is the process of determining the sequence of this genetic information so that it can be analyzed and interpreted. However, DNA sequencing is very expensive and requires specialized people and equipment.\nSequencing the DNA in food was something that, until recently, could be done only by university researchers and certain high-tech companies. But modern advancements in sequencing technology have made it both technically and financially feasible for smaller organizations like community laboratories. That’s where the Open Food Repo DNA initiative comes in: since last fall, scientists have been working on a new method that spells out DNA sequencing instructions like the steps in a recipe, employing techniques like high-throughput sequencing and DNA barcoding – which is the process of examining just a small section of an organism’s DNA. Capable of being read like a barcode, these sections are similar enough across all organisms to be easily extracted from an entire DNA chain, yet different enough that they can be used to identify individual plants and animals.\n“The first step is to mix all the food ingredients together thoroughly with a mixer. Then we extract a section of DNA using specific chemical compounds at high temperatures,” says Pietro Cattaneo, Product Development Scientist at SwissDeCode. The extracted DNA section is amplified to make numerous copies and then sequenced by converting the individual molecules into electric signals, which are translated into a DNA code.\nUsing citizen science to get better information about our food \nAs a citizen-science initiative, Open Food Repo DNA aims to allow consumers to one day analyze the food they buy and determine precisely what it contains. A group of consumers tested the system at a workshop held in the Hackuarium community laboratory last Saturday, 4 May. Participants included both scientists and open-science advocates, and they spent the day extracting and amplifying the DNA from food products ranging from paprika-flavored potato chips and tuna sandwiches to falafel and pesto sauce. The food’s DNA sequences will be sent to the participants in the upcoming days.\n“A growing number of products in supermarkets today are processed, and consumers want to know exactly what they’re eating. What’s great about this initiative is that it will empower people to analyze their food themselves,” says Barbara Pfenniger, the head of the food department of the Fédération Romande des Consommateurs (a consumer watchdog group for French-speaking Switzerland), who participated in the workshop. “Open-science projects also have a snowball effect – the more participants they have, the more people get interested in them. And in this case, we are encouraging people to look more critically at the food everyone eats.”\nAt the end of the workshop, participants discussed the system’s advantages and how it could be improved. “We plan to hold more workshops at the Hackuarium in order to test and improve our system, and make it easier to use. Then we will roll out the workshops at other community labs in Switzerland and abroad,” says Talia Salzmann, who is heading up the initiative at the Digital Epidemiology Lab.\nBy making it possible for consumers to perform genetic analyses of the food sold in Switzerland, the project team hopes to foster dialogue on how new technology can be leveraged to help people eat healthier, improve transparency in the food industry, and make a positive contribution to the health of our society as a whole.\nProject external partners\n is a company that develops solutions for authenticity and food safety certification (Open Food Repo DNA protocol development).\n is a community and citizen laboratory that allows everyone to explore new ways to imagine and design research and innovation (the place where the workshop was held).\n is a Swiss charitable foundation supporting, among others, better health through good nutrition.

{"id": 493, "text": "Can you analyze the internal structure of a piece of concrete without damaging it? Yes! With a micro Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. This is a special type of x-ray machine that delivers images with a resolution going down to several microns for small objects. Switzerland now has its first such CT scanner, and it’s at EPFL.\nMicro CT scanners are similar to medical CT scanners, but they're designed to work on materials rather than living organisms. “With a medical scanner, the patient must hold perfectly still, while the micro scanner irradiates the object as it turns,” said Pascal Turberg, a scientist with the Civil Engineering Institute and the Ecological Systems Laboratory. “The machine collects thousands of images of the material and recreates its internal structure in three dimensions, layer by layer, with great precision.”\nSeeing how a material deforms\nCT scanners provide a remarkably detailed snapshot of a given material’s components, imperfections and overall quality. For example, when a concrete cylinder is scanned, the images include many shades of gray (see video). The black spots correspond to gaps within the material – its natural porosity and any cracks – while the lightest spots show the aggregates and intermediate hues indicate the cement. Nothing is left to the imagination.\nThe images produced could find applications in many fields. Engineers, for example, could run “coupled experiments” to test how materials perform under stress: they could scan a piece of metal, wood or concrete, deform it in various ways and then scan it again to see how it behaves up to the fracture point. They could even watch how the material deforms in real time. Used in this way, the images could validate the engineers’ theoretical computer models.\nNumerous applications\nThe micro CT scanner acquired by EPFL will not sit idle. ENAC was behind the initiative and hosts the machine, but other schools intend to get in on the action too, including the School of Engineering, and Life Sciences. “The CT scanner can test the quality of materials and electronically check for manufacturing soundness, such as in a welded joint,” said Turberg. “In the field of environmental sciences, the machine could be used to scan things like rocks, plants and river sediment. It could also test the resilience of new composite materials designed for construction work or medical prosthetics.”\nTurberg also hopes that EPFL’s new scanner will lead to joint initiatives with outside entities. He says that it could appeal to archeologists, art historians and art restorers: “We’ve already been in contact with a number of individuals who would like to try out the machine. As far as micro CT scanners go, this is the top model in its category. It’s a perfect addition to the other scanners we have access to for our research, including those at the university teaching hospitals and the Paul Scherrer Institute. What’s new and exciting about our scanner is that it delivers very high resolution images and is designed specifically for engineering research.”", "summary": "Micro computed tomography scanners deliver very high-resolution images of the internal structure of materials.

{"id": 496, "text": "Do young people drink more out on the town or at a friend’s place? In small groups or at large parties? Do they drink more if they stay at a single bar or go bar hopping? And among all these factors, which are the most influential in whether or not they drink? Researchers at Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have set out to answer these questions through a study based on factual information – i.e., smartphone data collected on weekend nights – to characterize the drinking habits of young people. A model they developed from the data can estimate\nthe nights when someone is likely to drink with over 75% accuracy. \nSpecific applications\nThe researchers developed two apps that the study participants installed on their smartphones. Participants used the first to photograph and record all the beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) they drank during a weekend night, along with the type of drink, the volume, the number and where they drank them. The app sent a reminder to participants every hour in case they forgot to enter any drinks. This data indicated whether a participant drank alcohol on a given night, and was used to classify participants as either “with alcohol” or “without alcohol” for each night in the study. \nA model that estimates alcohol consumption\nThe second application activated sensors that continuously collected data on each participant’s location, activity level, apps used, battery level, screen usage and nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi spots. The researchers compiled the data from the two apps and matched up the contextual data with the sensor data, giving them a comprehensive picture for each participant and each night. That showed them under what conditions – alone or in a group, at home or in a bar, at one or several different locations – participants consumed higher amounts of alcohol. Then they developed a machine-learning algorithm to crunch through the data. It can estimate whether an individual drank alcohol on a given night with over 75% accuracy. The researchers were also able to determine which factors were most significant in estimating behavior; these include the activity level, the number of different locations where beverages are drunk, and how many other people are around. Their findings have just been published in .\nIncreasingly rich data\nThe data was collected anonymously from 241 participants between the ages of 16 and 25 over 10 weekends – Friday and Saturday nights from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am – in Lausanne and Zurich. This is the first study that uses rich data collected by smartphones to understand the drinking habits of Swiss youth. What’s more, because it is based on factual information and not perceptions, it marks a novel approach to research on public health and prevention. “Most studies of alcohol consumption by young people are based on questionnaires that participants fill out the following morning, for example. But we know that people typically forget to note down much of what they drink,” says Daniel Gatica-Perez, adjunct professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering and Digital Humanities Institute, and head of Idiap’s Social Computing Group. The same holds true for the situations in which we drink – it can be rather subjective. But for this study, researchers used data collected by sensors: activity level, the extent to which people moved around, the number of other people present, the type of apps they used during the night, and how often they used their smartphone. \nA starting point for future alcohol-consumption research\nThis study shows that smartphone data provided voluntarily in the interest of public health can be used to estimate alcohol consumption on a given night with promising results. That opens the door to investigating related topics, such as drinking at home and the role of the time factor in drinking. However, the researchers stress the importance of including interviews in such studies; for this study, interviews were carried out by a partner scientist at the University of Zurich. “Data don’t tell the whole story,” says Gatica-Perez. “Interviews help us understand the nuances and many factors involved when people go out at night, and validate our findings.”", "summary": "Researchers from Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have carried out a study using smartphone data from young Swiss people to better understand the circumstances in which they are most likely to drink. A computer model developed from the data can estimate, with over 75% accuracy, whether alcohol was consumed on a given weekend night.", "claim": "Researchers from Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have carried out a study using smartphone data from young Swiss people to better understand the circumstances in which he are most likely to drink. A computer model developed from the data can estimate, with over 75% accuracy, whether alcohol was consumed on a given weekend night.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [27, 27], "noise": false}
{"id": 497, "text": "Our heart is constantly beating yet we normally do not feel it. It turns out that our brain is capable of filtering out the cardiac sensation so that it doesn’t interfere with the brain’s ability to perceive external sensations. For the first time, researchers from the Center for Neuroprosthetics at EPFL have identified this mechanism. They discovered that a certain region in the brain determines where internal and external sensations interact. Their work appears in \nThe Journal of Neuroscience\n.\nEPFL's neuroscientists noted that the brain perceives visual stimuli less effectively if they occur in time with the heartbeat. It seems as if the brain wants to avoid processing information that is synchronized with the body’s heartbeat.\n“We don’t see the same way as a video camera does”\n“We are not objective, and we don’t see everything that hits our retina like a video camera does,” said Roy Salomon from the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, one of the study’s co-authors. “The brain itself decides which information to bring to awareness. But what's surprising is that our heart also affects what we see!”\nThe researchers carried out an initial series of experiments with more than 150 volunteers. The volunteers were subjected to a visual stimulus – an octagonal shape flashing on a screen. When this geometric shape flashed in sync with the subject’s heartbeat, the subject had more difficulties perceiving it.\nWhat’s happening in the brain - a first insight\nThe researchers just needed to figure out what was happening in the brain. They were able to show that a specific region, the insular cortex, acts as a filter and intercepts the sensations coming from the body’s beating heart.\nThey did this by running the experiment again in an MRI scanner. When the visual stimuli were not in sync with the subject’s heartbeat, the insular cortex functioned normally and the subject perceived the flashing octagon easily. But when the stimuli occurred in time with the heart rate, the level of activity in the insular cortex dropped noticeably: the subject was less aware – or totally unaware – of the flashing shape being shown.\nIt did not take long for Roy to get over his initial surprise at his discovery. “You don’t want your internal sensations to interfere with your external ones. It’s in your interest to be aware of what’s outside you. Since our heart was already beating while our brain was still forming, we’ve been exposed to it since the very start of our existence. So it’s not surprising that the brain acts to suppress it and make it less apparent.”\nIs feeling one’s heartbeat realted to anxiety?\nAwareness of one’s heartbeat is known to be correlated with a number of psychological problems, including anxiety disorders. Patients typically perceive their heart rate more clearly than most people. “But someone who does not suffer from this type of disorder can also be aware of their heartbeat,” said Roy. “This can happen at times of intense excitement or fear, for example.”\nCould anxiety disorders be, at least in part, the cause or effect of someone’s inability to silence their heartbeat? “We don’t know that yet. What we do know now is that, under most conditions, we are not aware of our own heartbeat and that there is a specific region of the brain whose task is to suppress it.”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have discovered that the human brain suppresses the sensory effects of the heartbeat.

{"id": 500, "text": "Cable cars are one of the hallmarks of Switzerland, along with funiculars and paddlewheel boats. They adorn the country’s mountaintops like garlands. While cable cars are most often associated with leisure activities in the winter and summer, Fernando Simas has looked at how they could become a common mode of urban transportation. Simas, a researcher at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR), recently defended his thesis on this topic, explaining that urban cable cars could become popular among city residents and provide much more than just a means of getting around. Paradoxically, even though the technology is fairly simple, incorporating cable cars into urban landscapes poses its own set of challenges and would require making some complicated decisions.\nThe first part of Simas’ thesis explores how city residents generally use public transportation, in order to determine how urban cable cars could fit into commuters’ existing habits. He studied two regions in particular: Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, and the Lake Geneva region, in Switzerland. In the Lake Geneva region, Simas compared five different transportation lines: the M2 subway line in Lausanne; city bus #5 in Geneva; the cable car connecting Le Châble and Verbier; the Mont-Salève cable car near Geneva; and the N1 commuter ferry connecting Lausanne and Thonon. In Brazil, he analyzed public transportation lines similar to those selected in Switzerland. To conduct the research, Simas and his team followed around a dozen people on each of the ten lines for two days and evaluated the participants’ experience according to thirteen criteria.\nA more comfortable commute\n“Cable cars seem to be really popular. They are perceived as being more comfortable than city buses and similar to boats in the way they break with the monotony of public transportation,” says Simas. “Cable cars form a kind of cocoon for passengers, as do automobiles. But whereas automobiles create a semi-private space, cable cars create a semi-public space that is physically removed from the confines of the surrounding urban environment. That helps passengers relax and makes their commute more enjoyable.”\nIn comparing the different forms of transportation, Simas found that today’s commuters expect more from transportation systems than merely a way of getting from point A to point B. They also expect a certain level of service, comfort, efficiency and even enjoyment. The LASUR team introduce the concept of commuting-time comfort, which covers all of these aspects. “A public transportation system is essentially a human-machine interaction. In our study of this interaction, we used the notion of continuance: how long can a passenger stay in the same position interacting with the machine? A passenger who is comfortable in a given form of public transportation will be able to travel longer distances, several times a week,” says Simas. And just as mountain cable cars help vacationers better understand the rugged terrain, urban cable cars can give commuters a different perspective on their cities.\nImpact on the neighborhood\nThe second part of Simas’ thesis looked at how effective urban cable cars would be in various urban settings. A handful of Swiss cities, including Sion, Fribourg, Morges, Zurich and Geneva, are considering such plans. The LASUR team, in association with scientists at EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Mobility (LAMU), investigated several of them and found that “urban cable cars can be a catalyst for regional development.” That’s because they create 3D spaces, and the height of the cable-car line affects not only where stations are located but also how they relate to surrounding areas, both nearby and further away. Erecting a cable-car station is a much more intricate affair than building a bus stop. It can have an impact on several facets of a neighborhood, beyond just transportation.\n“Urban cable cars are just one of several transportation options, and city officials should think carefully before making a decision. This option should be considered only if it can bring something to a city that buses and trains can’t,” says Simas. “Many places have had a positive experience with cable cars, and cities in Switzerland could draw on that to try something radical – something that would only work with this particular form of public transportation.”", "summary": "For his thesis at EPFL, Fernando Simas studied how cable cars could be an appealing transportation option for city commuters, and how they could be incorporated into tomorrow’s urban landscapes.", "claim": "For our thesis at EPFL, Fernando Simas studied how cable cars could be an appealing transportation option for city commuters, and how they could be incorporated into tomorrow’s urban landscapes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 1], "noise": false}
{"id": 504, "text": "Dark matter is one of science’s great mysteries. It makes up an enormous amount matter in the universe, it is invisible, and it does not correspond to anything in the realm of our experience. Different theories compete for an explanation, but so far none of them has prevailed. In a collaborative study between École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the University of Edinburgh, scientists have studied how dark matter behaves when galaxy clusters collide with each other over billions of years. Published in \nScience\n, their findings challenge at least one major theory on dark matter.\nDark matter and galaxy clusters\nAlthough it accounts for 90% of all matter in the universe and more than a quarter of its energy, we know very little about dark matter. One major idea among astronomers is that dark matter consists of a new subatomic particle that we haven’t discovered yet. More exotic theories want dark matter to be a quantum defect from the birth of the universe, extra-dimensional mass, and even a modified form of gravity.\nWhat we do know is that dark matter interacts with cosmic structures through gravity, shaping and molding them. For example, dark matter bends light that passes through it, distorting images of distant space objects. In addition, dark matter speeds up the motion of galaxies inside galaxy clusters, which are collections of hundreds of galaxies, containing literally astronomical amounts of stars, planets, and gases. Galaxy clusters are also 90% dark matter, which makes them ideal for studying it, especially when they collide into each other and force their respective dark matters to interact.\nPeering into the dark\nDavid Harvey at EPFL’s Laboratory of Astrophysics studies galaxy cluster collisions to find clues about the nature of dark matter. Continuing his PhD work from the Royal Observatory at Edinburgh, he and his colleagues studied data from 72 galaxy cluster collisions. These cosmic crashes happen over the course of billions of years when galaxy clusters attract each other because of their gargantuan masses. When this happens, the dark matter in each galaxy cluster interacts with that of the other, offering a unique opportunity to study it.\nHarvey’s data came from the Chandra X-ray Space Observatory and the Hubble telescope, and included the famous Bullet Cluster collision, a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet. This particular collision is actually the best current evidence for the existence of dark matter.\nThe researchers analyzed the collision data to measure the change in momentum of dark matter when two galaxy clusters crashed into each other. Experiments on Earth, e.g. in the Large Hadron Collider, show us that when subatomic particles interact, they exchange momentum. Therefore, depending on what happened to the dark matter after the collision, the researchers could draw conclusions about its nature.\nTo test the theory that dark matter consists of particles, the study worked with two possible scenarios: Either the particles of the dark matter interacted frequently but exchanged little momentum, or they interacted rarely but exchanged a lot of momentum. In the first case, dark matter would slow down after the collision, because the frequent particle interactions would cause an additional “drag”. In the second scenario, dark matter would tend to be scattered away and lost into space.\nNo interaction\nSurprisingly, the study discovered that dark matters in galaxy cluster collisions simply pass through each other. This implies that dark matter particles do not interact with themselves, which would have caused dark matter to slow down. Instead, it appears that while dark matter could interact “non-gravitationally” with visible matter, this is not the case when it interacts with itself.\nMore importantly, the study challenges the view that dark matter consists of proton-like particles – or perhaps any particles whatsoever. “We have now pushed the probability of two ‘dark matter particles’ interacting below the probability of two actual protons interacting, which means that dark matter is unlikely to consist of just ‘dark-protons’,” says David Harvey. “If it did, we would expect to see them ‘bounce’ off each other”.\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Laboratory of Astrophysics with the Royal Observatory at the University of Edinburgh, the Institute for Computational Cosmology at Durham University, and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London.\nReference\nHarvey D, Massey R, Kitching T, Taylor A, Tittley E. \nThe non-gravitational interactions of dark matter in colliding galaxy clusters.\nScience\n 27 March 2015.

{"id": 505, "text": "It’s a major breakthrough in the field of electronics. Engineers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES) have developed a next-generation circuit that allows for smaller, faster and more energy-efficient devices – which would have major benefits for artificial-intelligence systems. Their revolutionary technology is the first to use a 2D material for what’s called a logic-in-memory architecture, or a single architecture that combines logic operations with a memory function. The research team’s findings appear today in \nNature\n.\nUntil now, the energy efficiency of computer chips has been limited by the von Neumann architecture they currently use, where data processing and data storage take place in two separate units. That means data must constantly be transferred between the two units, using up a considerable amount of time and energy.\nBy combining the two units into a single structure, engineers can reduce these losses. That’s the idea behind the new chip developed at EPFL, although it goes one step beyond existing logic-in-memory devices. The EPFL chip is made from MoS\n2\n, which is a 2D material consisting of a single layer that’s only three atoms thick. It’s also an excellent semi-conductor. LANES engineers had already studied  a few years ago, finding that it is particularly well-suited to electronics applications. Now the team has taken that initial research further to create their next-generation technology.\nThe EPFL chip is based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). The advantage of these transistors is that they can hold electric charges for long periods; they are typically used in flash memory systems for cameras, smartphones and computers. The unique electrical proprieties of MoS\n2\n make it particularly sensitive to charges stored in FGFETs, which is what enabled the LANES engineers to develop circuits that work as both memory storage units and programmable transistors. By using MoS\n2\n, they were able to incorporate numerous processing functions into a single circuit and then change them as desired.\nIn-depth expertise \n“This ability for circuits to perform two functions is similar to how the human brain works, where neurons are involved in both storing memories and conducting mental calculations,” says Andras Kis, the head of LANES. “Our circuit design has several advantages. It can reduce the energy loss associated with transferring data between memory units and processors, cut the amount of time needed for computing operations and shrink the amount of space required. That opens the door to devices that are smaller, more powerful and more energy efficient.”\nThe LANES research team has also acquired in-depth expertise in fabricating circuits out of 2D materials. “We made our first chip ten years ago by hand,” says Kis. “But we have since developed an advanced fabrication process that lets us make 80 or more chips in a single run, with well-controlled properties.”\nFull scientific article:", "summary": "EPFL engineers have developed a computer chip that combines two functions – logic operations and data storage – into a single architecture, paving the way to more efficient devices.

{"id": 507, "text": "What does this COVID-19 crises teach us about pandemics? An EPFL professor, Melanie Blokesch heads the Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology. Blokesch and her team study the environmental lifestyle of pathogenic bacteria and their evolvability, focusing primarily on \nVibrio cholerae\n, the bacterium that causes cholera. In this interview, she reflects on what the COVID-19 crisis can teach us about pandemics and reminds us why we need to take infectious diseases more seriously – and be better prepared for future outbreaks.\nWhat has surprised you most about this crisis?\nWe haven’t seen a sudden respiratory disease pandemic like this for a long time. The last comparable outbreak was the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which killed almost 50 million people worldwide. It’s always revealing when I show my students how life expectancy curves changed dramatically in 1918. And although experts anticipated a new pandemic to hit at some point, most countries weren’t ready for it. What I find most surprising is how some countries have taken sharp, decisive action whereas others seem reluctant to adopt strong intervention strategies. It’s also interesting to observe how individuals have reacted. Some people are determined to stay at home while others are still venturing outside with little concern about whether they’ll get infected or infect others. These differences will, of course, strongly influence the course of the pandemic going forward.\nCan we accurately predict how a pandemic like this will evolve?\nYes, to a certain extent. Epidemiologists have a range of tools they can use to make predictions and guide intervention strategies. For instance, they can analyze people’s movements using gravity models or by tracking cell phone data anonymously. Once you feed the data into the models and estimate other parameters such as contagiousness and length of infection, you can predict how the disease will spread from person to person or, in the case of cholera, from person to water to person. Epidemiological models always have some degree of inaccuracy, especially for a disease like COVID-19, where our understanding of transmission and infectivity is still patchy. But they can still provide useful estimates, such as telling us whether infection numbers will continue rising, stabilize or decline, or suggesting where outbreaks might emerge and spread. Plus, here in Switzerland, we have the advantage – if I dare say so – of learning from how the virus has spread in Italy.\nWhen will it be safe to venture outside again?\nThe answer really depends on how we all act, as individuals. First, we have to get the number of cases down. Then we’ll need to start going out again, in a slow and controlled way. Ramping up our testing facilities is an absolute priority, so we can quickly identify new cases, and so we can trace and isolate contacts. We’ll need to keep the outbreak in check until we have treatment options available, especially for the most severe cases. Clinical trials have already begun on a number of potential therapeutics. Ultimately, the hope is that we’ll have a vaccine. But the hard truth is that it takes time to develop a vaccine and test it to make sure it’s safe.\nCOVID-19 is understandably at the forefront of everyone’s minds right now, but are there any other ongoing global pandemics?\nCOVID-19 isn’t the only pandemic sweeping the world as we speak, but we don’t necessarily hear much about the other ones in Europe. For instance, the seventh cholera pandemic began in the 1960s and is still with us now. Every year, the cholera bacterium infects around 5 million people globally and the disease claims around 100,000 lives. Cholera gets limited press in the developed world because it doesn’t affect people directly. Personally, I think it deserves a lot more attention. That’s one of the reasons why my group is studying the evolution of this pathogen, and its transmission from water to humans.\nWhat are you learning from this new coronavirus outbreak, as an infection biologist?\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic teaches us anything, it’s that when it comes to infectious diseases, we’re still vulnerable. We tend to focus on noncommunicable diseases like cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and heart failure. But we show only limited concern for infectious diseases because, in recent decades, the developed world has seen remarkable advances in sanitation, extensive vaccination strategies and efficient bacterial treatment through antibiotics – although the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses another threat in the coming years. From a more general standpoint, this outbreak teaches us a lot about human migration, urbanization and deforestation, and about how these factors contribute to the transmission of emerging pathogens from natural habitats and wild animals to humans. This is clearly not the last time this type of thing will happen. We need to be better prepared next time around.", "summary": "An EPFL professor of Microbiology, Melanie Blokesch reminds us why we need to take infectious diseases more seriously – and be better prepared for future outbreaks.", "claim": "An EPFL professor of Microbiology, Melanie Blokesch reminds them why we need to take infectious diseases more seriously – and be better prepared for future outbreaks.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [9, 9], "noise": false}
{"id": 511, "text": "For reasons you can imagine, much of what we used to do in the physical world is now being done virtually. That’s having an effect on energy-related pollution – CO\n2\n emissions from manufacturing and transportation have fallen drastically, for example. But there has been a concomitant increase in energy use for digital services. Exact numbers aren’t yet available, but according to Babak Falsafi, the director of , the trend is clear. “Behind every digital service we use lies a data center. And we’re heading towards a world where everything is done digitally, across all markets and industries.”\nFalsafi continues: “A lot of business activities have been shifted online because of the pandemic, causing a huge surge in demand, mainly for video. Non-work-related demand for streaming has also exploded. What’s more, today’s ultra-high-resolution screens use up a lot of energy. People don’t understand everything that’s involved in watching a movie in 8k – a lot of power is needed for all that data processing and transfer. You put that all together and it’s huge!”\nRelentless rise in demand\nThe current situation is set to last for a while longer: it’ll be weeks, or probably months, before a vaccine is ready – and that’s without factoring in a second wave. Many organizations, including schools and universities, have announced that they will keep holding classes online, at least partly. But the issue of data-center-related emissions was already a pressing one before the pandemic. “New technology like the internet of things, artificial intelligence, 5G and 4k televisions – which are now going to 8k – has pumped up demand, and therefore energy use,” says Falsafi. According to an article appearing in \nMIT Technology Review\n last year, training a single Transformer artificial intelligence model can generate as much carbon emissions as five American cars throughout their useful life. In another example, Netflix announced that its electricity use jumped 84% in 2019 to 451,000 megawatt-hours, or enough to power 40,000 homes in the United States for a year.\nSome studies predict that digital technology will account for 8% of global electricity use by 2030 – up from 3–5% today – and 4% of CO\n2\n emissions. This includes data centers, those huge buildings that house the servers we use to store, process, analyze and transfer data on the cloud (the biggest data centers already consume hundreds of megawatts). It also includes, in an equal measure, the telecommunication systems that transport those data. Consumer electronics and the energy used to build computing facilities also play a role, albeit smaller.\nThe end of Moore’s law\nWhile demand is skyrocketing, supply is bumping up against a ceiling. Moore’s law, which states that the number of transistors contained on a silicon chip doubles every year, has pretty much expired. We can’t keep packing more computing power onto chips like we’ve been doing over the past 50 years. The two options currently available are to build new data centers or expand existing ones. The data-center construction market is expected to swell to 57 billion dollars over the next five years.\nWho’s responsible for keeping a lid on digital-related emissions? “Nobody!” replies Falsafi. “Nobody is being held accountable for those emissions. We pay telecom operators for our internet connections, for example, but the services we use on the internet – like Google and Facebook – are free. And those service providers aim to collect as much data about us as possible to improve their services. At no point in this arrangement are carbon emissions taken into account, since power use is measured at data centers and not on telecom networks.” Edouard Bugnion, EPFL’s Vice President for Information Systems, adds: “Data centers are basically technological advancement wrapped up in a consumable format. They are the vector by which cyberspace can develop. Google wouldn’t exist without data centers. Neither would much of the research conducted at EPFL.”\nTowards more sustainable data centers \nEngineers at EPFL’s EcoCloud have been working since 2011 to find a way around the supply ceiling. Their approach involves not only making data centers more efficient, but also reducing their carbon footprint. Nobody cared much about this latter aspect when the centers were first being built – but times have changed. “There are three things that need to be factored into the equation. First, the energy efficiency of data centers, which needs to be improved. Second, the CO\n2\n that’s emitted to run them, which can be reduced by switching to renewable energy. And third, the energy the servers give off in the form of heat – can’t we do more with that heat than open a window and warm up the parking lot?” says Bugnion.\nEcoCloud, along with the other members of the Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association (SDEA), introduced an energy-efficiency certification system in early 2020. Their program – called the SDEA Label (see \"\") – quantifies how much CO\n2\n per kWh data centers emit, with the goal of encouraging operators to use renewable energy. EcoCloud also scouts opportunities for EPFL labs to work with businesses to develop advanced systems for cooling, energy management, energy storage and power generation – all within a local innovation ecosystem designed to help data center operators shrink their carbon footprint.\nNEW CERTIFICATION SYSTEM ENCOURAGES GREENER DATA CENTERS\n© 2020 EPFL\nEPFL, along with other members of a tech-industry consortium, introduced the world’s first energy-efficiency certification system for data centers in January.\n“When we created  in 2011,” says director Babak Falsafi, “the goal was to cut data centers’ energy use and CO\n2\n emissions – at the time, IT industry heavyweights cared only about the financial and business aspects. We developed pioneering technology that brought renewable energy into the data center ecosystem.” His research center aims to spur innovation across the ICT sector – from algorithms to infrastructure – to help meet today’s major challenges.\nAnd data centers will play a growing role in those challenges as people rely more and more on digital technology. The amount of power consumed by data centers is set to expand rapidly, and by 2030 could account for 8% of global electricity use.\nMaking data centers carbon-free \nTo help keep that electricity use in check, a consortium of Swiss tech-industry organizations created the Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association (SDEA). The initiative was spearheaded by digitalswitzerland and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE); members include EcoCloud, HPE, Green IT Switzerland, the Luzern University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU), the Swiss datacenter association (Vigiswiss) and the Swiss telecom industry association (ASUT). The initiative is also being supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) through its SwissEnergy program.\nIn January, the SDEA introduced a green certification system specifically for data centers. The system involves calculating data centers’ carbon footprint based on the energy efficiency of the building and IT equipment, as well as the IT equipment’s power load. “Until now, there was no way to measure data centers’ impact on CO\n2\n emissions,” says Falsafi. “Our certification system is unique because it also factors in the source of the power used and how well heat is recovered. Everything is connected – if a data center uses renewable energy, its performance improves.”\nThe SDEA uses three certification levels (bronze, silver and gold) to encourage data center operators to cut their power consumption. Pilot tests at ten sites in Switzerland show that the SDEA’s “toolkit” effectively takes into account their efforts to shift in full or in part to renewable energy.\nArriving at just the right time\nSince computer processors are reaching their maximum physical capacity, the only solution for managing the surging amount of data is to build more data centers. “Our certification system comes at just the right time,” says Falsafi. “We hope that it will encourage data center operators to build facilities that run on renewable energy, and stimulate innovation and investment in this field.”\nUSING MATHEMATICS TO MANAGE BIG DATA\n© 2020 EPFL\nMost organizations run a huge variety of computer software and hardware, which bogs down their IT systems and wastes energy. But Anastasia Ailamaki has a found a solution that works by giving all the different system components a common language.\n“Sustainability means coming up with solutions for problems as efficiently as possible while using fewer resources,” says Anastasia Ailamaki, a professor at  and founder of local startup RAW Labs SA. “And so we can say that our research is directly related to sustainability.” The engineers at DIAS are developing a data management system that makes as much use as possible of an organization’s existing hardware and software – a real challenge given the wide variety of hardware and software out there.\n“Hardware that’s turned on but not used is a waste of energy,” says Ailamaki. In the same way that our bodies burn calories even when we’re just sitting there, computers burn up a considerable amount energy even when they’re idling. “Most computers are used to only 20% of their potential. It’s like if you filled up your fridge with food, let it sit there until it goes bad, and then complained that you don’t have anything to eat,” says Ailamaki. The same holds true for software. She explains: “Today most people use only 10% of the data they store. But before data can be stored, they have to be saved onto a server and standardized – and you generally need to know what you want to do with them afterwards.” She offers this example: “Suppose you have a series of interviews saved in different Word files, along with an Excel file listing all the companies that invest in EPFL startups. Imagine you wanted to search all the files and find the names of people who mention sustainability in their interview \nand\n who have invested in an EPFL startup. You couldn’t do it. The data would have to be stored in a database for that kind of query. And because the data are stored in two different formats – text and table – you’d have to standardize them before you could save them in the database.”\nOrdering data à la carte \nAilamaki’s approach involves formatting the data even before this process begins. “Instead of standardizing the data, our system recognizes what kind they are and gives them a mathematical format based on how they will be searched. Then when it comes time to search the data, our program generates the exact code needed to execute the query – one query at a time,” she says. However, one potential drawback to this approach is that it’s significantly slower than conventional methods where data are already saved in a database and searches are done directly. But Ailamaki’s team found a solution for that, too. “Our system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remember the kinds of queries performed. It stores all the work done previously – much like a cache that lets programs respond much more quickly to queries of the same dataset,” she says.\nThe system, with its just-in-time approach, allows users to search any type of data in any way, combine data from any source and create a cache of the most frequently used data. It’s similar to ordering à la carte. And the system can be used with any kind of data, hardware or application since it doesn’t rely on code, but mathematics. RAW Labs used this approach to develop its RAW technology for combining different types of data on the fly and generating important information in a ready-to-use format for both businesses and consumers.\nWhen it comes to hardware, the DIAS engineers are taking the same approach. Their just-in-time code-generation method can develop a program for mapping out hardware’s properties on the fly and helping organizations run their IT equipment more efficiently. “With our system, organizations can use their computers at up to 80% of their potential,” says Ailamaki.\nSERVERS DESIGNED TO WORK LIKE HUMANS\n© 2020 EPFL\nDavid Atienza believes that when it comes to IT systems, everything that can be done locally, should be. That includes processing data where they are generated – thereby substantially reducing the amount of power required.\n is studying two major energy-related problems with servers. The first is that they aren’t being used anywhere near their maximum capacity. Actual use is closer to 60%, according to ESL head David Atienza. “Servers are designed for tasks that require a lot of processing power – such as running neural networks – but they’re being used mainly for watching movies or sending pictures via chat,” he says. As a result, they overheat. “It’s like driving a Ferrari at 40 km/h – it would burn up a lot more energy at that speed than a Twingo would,” he adds.\nThe problem is that even if the servers are the only equipment that overheats in a data center, operators still have to cool the whole center. To help find a solution, Atienza is working on the Compusapien research project, for which he received an ERC Consolidator Grant in 2016. His team found that cooling servers locally can cut a data center’s power requirement by 40%. They worked with engineers from IBM to develop a system where cooling water is used to lower the temperature of individual servers, as opposed to running fans to cool the entire room. With this system, heat is recovered in the cooling water and reused. The water runs through microfluidic channels that are just 50–100 µm high and sandwiched between two layers on a cooling plate. As the water absorbs heat from the servers, it transfers it to microfluidic fuel cells where it’s converted into electricity. The electricity can then be fed back to the servers as power, reducing the amount of power that the data center draws from the grid.\nProcessing data locally\n“The human brain works the same way. Blood carries nutrients to the brain and cools it. It’s just that with servers, the process is a little more complicated!” says Atienza. While a lot of data centers already use cooling water, his is the first system to use microfluidic fuel cells to recover heat and turn it into electricity. The technology – nicknamed “electronic blood” – was tested in a 3D prototype developed in association with IBM, and proved to be feasible from a technical point of view. Now ESL engineers are building a 3D version of the integrated system and plan to develop a full server through a joint project with another company.\nThe second component of Atienza’s approach is to process data as locally as possible since transmitting them takes up a lot of energy. One example of this approach is a next-generation Nespresso machine that the ESL team developed. Their machine uses an embedded artificial intelligence system to manage maintenance and restocking completely on its own. “More and more applications – especially those for smartphones – operate locally and don’t go through data centers,” says Atienza. “That’s a lot like the human body. Our bodies have lots of tiny modules that can carry out two or three simple functions; the brain gets involved only when important decisions need to be made. That’s a lot more efficient than today’s data centers where everything runs all the time.”\nINFRASTRUCTURES\nEPFL gets a new data center\nEPFL is building a new data center as part of the upgrade to its thermal power station. The high-density center, which will eventually have 3 megawatts of capacity, will be used to store, manage and process data collected by EPFL scientists during their lab experiments. Its sides and roof will be covered entirely in solar panels, and the heat generated by its servers will be recovered and used in the new power station. It’s scheduled to go into service in the second half of 2021.\n© 2020 EPFL", "summary": "Digital technology is running up against its physical limits.

There are other trips planned, especially in July in São Paulo for the CAAD Futures conference (computer-aided architectural design future). However, during these conferences it is impossible to carry out the performances conducted at Sinlab. For instance, creating foam columns requires fairly substantial equipment; apart from the computer controller, the equipment consists of a compressor and a gas cylinder since the foam is in fact produced using helium.\nEven though Shih-Yuan Wang is an architect, his experiments with living materials have forced him to become a jack-of-all-trades and to study information technology in particular to develop the controllers of the machines they produce.

But we would never make a diagnosis.”\nThis is just one of the workshops held this year during EPFL Information Days, a three-day event organized every fall by the school’s Study Programs Promotion Service and various sections. The goal of the event is to show high-school students what goes on in research labs, illustrate the sometimes-surprising links among different disciplines and describe the school’s 13 Bachelor’s programs. The event has become increasingly popular – over 3,000 students signed up this year.\nParticipating students can attend a host of talks and presentations and take part in a hands-on workshop, where they spend a full day visiting labs in the section of their choice. Researchers at the labs demonstrate the technology they’re developing as well as potential applications. “The Information Days are really important for our section because students don’t necessarily have a good sense of what electrical engineering is.

However, she does know she wants to study at EPFL. “We’re really lucky to have a world-renowned engineering school nearby that’s also affordable,” she says.\nAll the high-school students we spoke with on Thursday were “impressed” by the campus and excited to see what goes on behind the scenes. “The Information Days are essential for introducing our section to high-school students,” says Jérôme Waser, head of the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering section. “On the first day we show them the learning side of our degree programs, and on the second, the more tangible, research-oriented side – which is great to be able to do. And the feedback we’ve gotten has been excellent.” The other sections also value the event and spend a lot of time and energy getting ready.\nThe students especially enjoyed visiting out-of-the-ordinary places like the reverberation chamber and the anechoic chamber, whose walls fully absorb sound waves – making the room so quiet you can hear your eyes blink. “The campus’ facilities are really impressive, and it’s great to be able to see exactly what goes on in research labs,” says Antoine Hirt, a high-school junior in Burier.\nThe students also got to work behind a lab bench, watching chemists make Bakelite (the world’s first plastic), viewing fluorescent cells under a microscope, comparing chemical reactors and learning about recent advancements in computational chemistry, where computers can now simulate 1,000–2,000 heavy atoms. “I’m still deciding between chemistry and physics.

{"id": 522, "text": "Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n and it affects over 12 million people globally. When the bacterium infects a person, the body’s immune response is critical to how the disease will progress; either helping the body fight the bacterium or, if certain key molecules become involved, actually exacerbating the infection. EPFL scientists now show how the tuberculosis bacterium co-opts mechanisms of the immune system to its own advantage. The study is published in \nCell Host & Microbe\n.\nThe body fights tuberculosis: Inflammasome, interleukins, interferons \nWhen \nM. tuberculosis\n infects a person, it attacks the lungs’ first-response immune cells, the macrophages. The immune response by the macrophages involves a complex of four different proteins called the “inflammasome”. The main role of the inflammasome is to prepare certain immunity proteins in the macrophages, which are called “interleukins”. When \nM. tuberculosis\n infects the lungs, interleukins from the macrophages are in the first line of defense.\nBut if it is left uncontrolled, this defense can also cause serious damage to the patient. To prevent this, macrophages also release another group of proteins called “type I interferons”. While interferons are important for defending the body against viruses, when it comes to tuberculosis they actually help the bacterium, thereby exacerbating the disease. And although the interleukin-inflammation part of the immune response is rather well understood, the part involving interferons has been elusive.\nDNA trickery\nThe lab of Andrea Ablasser at EPFL, in collaboration with the lab of Stewart Cole, has now discovered how \nM. tuberculosis\n carries out a subtle assault on our immune defenses. The key is a molecule called cGAS, which is found in the lung’s macrophages, and is part of a group of DNA-sensor molecules; in short, cGAS patrols the inside of macrophages, and when it detects unidentified pieces of DNA, such as those released by \nM. tuberculosis\n, it triggers an immune response from the macrophages.\nThe tuberculosis bacterium uses a specialized secretion system to release its array of toxic proteins into macrophages. But, strangely, it also releases small bits of DNA, which are detected by sensing systems inside the macrophages, namely the inflammasome and cGAS. This causes macrophages to release two types of proteins: interleukin-1, which fights the bacterium, and type I interferons, which end up helping it.\nAblasser’s group used human and animal macrophages to study what happens when they are infected by \nM. tuberculosis\n. What they found was that the bacterium passes DNA bits into the macrophages, thereby tricking cGAS to signal the production of interferons, which reduce the immune response. In other words, the bacterium tricks the macrophages to cut back on their defense against it.\nBut the researchers did not stop there. They also showed that it is possible to manipulate \nM. tuberculosis\n in such a way that it can no longer activate the production of interferons through cGAS, while still keeping the production of interleukin-1 – and thus the body’s immune response – intact.\nThe study is the first to identify cGAS as a sensor for \nM. tuberculosis\n DNA, and also suggests that this method of molecular manipulation applies to other bacteria that use specialized secretion systems to infect cells. “Our work shows that tuberculosis is a far more sophisticated disease than previously thought,” says Andrea Ablasser, who is now working, among other projects, to identify the DNA pieces that \nM. tuberculosis\n uses to trick macrophages.\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Global Health Institute with the Universities of Bonn and Cologne, and was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nReference\nWassermann R, Gulen MF, Sala C, Garcia Perin S, Lou Y, Rybniker J, Schmid-Burgk JL, Schmidt T, Hornung V, Cole ST, Ablasser A. \nThe ESX-1 secretion system of \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n differentially regulates cGAS- and inflammasome-dependent intracellular immune responses.\nCell Host & Microbe\n 17, 1–12, 10 June 2015.

{"id": 523, "text": "Hikers setting out on one of Switzerland's many walking trails often bring back beautiful photos, the occasional cramp and – quite unintentionally – ticks. These tiny acarids, which are present in dense undergrowth and at the edges of forests, are particularly active in hot weather and attach themselves to human and animal hosts passing nearby. Despite their small size, they can transmit potentially serious diseases such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Recent research by the Institute of Microbiology at CHUV has shown that ticks are often carriers of large amounts of chlamydia, a still poorly-understood bacteria that can be passed to humans and cause secondary disease. \nScientists are aware that tick proliferation and activity are influenced by numerous environmental factors, including temperature and humidity. However, data are still lacking on their regional distribution over time in Switzerland, which has been classified as a tick risk area. At EPFL's Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG), Estelle Rochat's thesis project set out to address this lacuna and to identify areas where ticks carry chlamydia. Her extensive mapping work has been published in the prestigious .\nTop collaboration with  and his team at , as well as with , great work by Estelle Rochat  - another  contribution to \n — Stéphane Joost @HOME (@stephanejoost) \nThree data sources\nAfter identifying the environmental conditions that are conducive to the presence of the castor bean tick (\nIxodes ricinus\n), Switzerland's most prevalent tick species, Rochat generated maps of their geographical distribution between 2008 and 2018. She drew on three databases: a 2009 field campaign carried out by the Swiss Army, during which more than 60,000 ticks were collected and analyzed; thousands of entries into a  that allows users to indicate where they observed ticks; and a tick collection project led by Rochat in 2018.\nShe then used machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence) to predict the probability of ticks and bacteria being present based on values taken from a set of environmental data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, etc.) in the vicinity of collection points.\n© LASIG\nThe machine learning program allowed Rochat to estimate the ticks’ locations, and revealed that the surface area of zones propitious for tick propagation grew from 16% of Switzerland’s land mass in 2008 to 25% in 2018. \nStatistically, the model works well. Using the rules of probability, we can tell if a given location is tick-friendly, or if, conversely, ticks are unlikely to be present. Using the distribution model, we then estimated the prevalence of bacteria within those locations. This in turn allowed us to identify sub-zones where areas that are favorable for ticks are also favorable for chlamydia.\nEstelle Rochat\n“A landmark project”\nThe scope, originality and fresh approach of Rochat’s research drew praise from Gilbert Greub, a world-renowned expert in chlamydia and ticks and Director of the CHUV’s Institute of Microbiology. “This is a landmark project, and contains sufficient detail at national level to allow us to draw conclusions. We can clearly see that between 2008 and 2018, there was an increase in high-risk tick exposure areas, which I believe is a reflection of global warming. It shows that ticks have migrated 300–400 meters higher up in subalpine zones.”\nFor Greub, the study is a valuable tool for prevention purposes, as well as for awareness-raising. In addition, it will be useful at the Institute, which is conducting clinical studies on the impact of tick-borne chlamydia on humans.\nRochat’s model is now available in open access and can be used in future research on other tick-borne pathogens. “It’s extremely interesting to see how ecological niches overlap. We used chlamydia in this case because we were working with Gilbert Greub, a global expert, but our approach can also be applied to tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. The algorithms needed to crunch through environmental data are freely available and can be applied to other datasets,” says Stéphane Joost, who supervised Rochat's thesis at LASIG.\nJoost sees an opportunity for the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health to fine-tune its risk maps for ticks – which will be increasingly present in Switzerland as a result of global warming.\nMore ticks? Remain calm.\nAccording to Gilbert Greub, Director of the CHUV’s Institute of Microbiology, the presence of more ticks in certain zones increases the chance of exposure to certain diseases. For the past three years, patient consultations for tick bites, Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis have . Greub reiterates the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health’s recommendations. \"Summer is beautiful here and people enjoy cycling and walking. The most important thing is to get vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis. Secondly, avoid hiking in high-risk areas that are off the beaten track – or if you do, wear long pants that can be tucked into your socks. Also, you should examine yourself carefully in the evening when you come back from a hike, including your back and any hidden areas. There's no need to panic or check every half hour. If you do find a tick however, use a pair of tick tweezers to remove it.\"", "summary": "A comprehensive study by EPFL and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) has enabled researchers to map the geographical distribution of ticks in Switzerland for the first time, as well as to determine whether they are carriers of chlamydia.

This is a natural area of interest for EPFL, a leader in innovation, which is launching the Social Impact Initiative (SII). The aim of the SII is seeks to bridge the gap between technology and innovation to maximize social impact and involve all stakeholder groups, from academia to businesses and start-ups, by bringing them together on a common theme of social impact. The SII is built on three pillars: education, innovation and awareness-raising. In the area of education, the SII is preparing to offer a new course on social impact and social entrepreneurship, including a MOOC called Social Venture. On the innovation front, last week the SII entered into its first partnership. It will team up with Buhler, which has offices at EPFL Innovation Park, to develop an innovative and low-cost crop storage facility for small farmers. Other pioneering projects are in the works as well.\nYunus Social Business Center\n EPFL will also house Switzerland’s only Yunus Social Business Center.

{"id": 527, "text": "Surface wear describes the process of material loss when two surfaces come into contact with each other. It has significant economic, social and health consequences – just think of the fine particles emitted by moving vehicles. What’s more, it can be observed at all levels, from the nanoscale up to the scale of tectonic faults, with the formation of gouge. There are several wear mechanisms, yet the adhesive type is most common. It takes place when two surfaces – such as two pieces of the same metal – rub against one another and adhere.\nOne of the parameters that influence the wear mechanism is surface roughness. A better understanding of how surface roughness changes during the wear process would improve our control over this mechanism. This could lead to significant reductions in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and costs.\nUnprecedented simulation\nResearchers at EPFL’s Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LSMS) have taken an important step in this direction. They have numerically simulated how surface roughness changes over time, and their results are in line with experimental results. What sets their simulations apart is their duration: using a method developed at EPFL, the LSMS researchers were able to simulate these mechanisms over an extended period of time. In other words, they managed to capture the entire process – from the initial geometry to the final fractal geometry. Their findings were published on 8 March in \nNature Communications\n.\nThis study is the LSMS researchers’ third on adhesive wear. Their first study – published in 2016 in \nNature Communications\n – used numerical simulations to describe how the process of adhesive wear produced fine particles. In 2017, taking their simulations further, they came out with a second study, appearing this time in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Science\n, demonstrating that it was possible to predict the volume, shape and size of these particles.\nImage of the computer simulation showing adhesive wear on a self-affine surface. © LSMS / EPFL\nIncomplete picture\nScientists are still far from fully understanding the physics underlying wear, and engineers must still carry out ad hoc experiments for each situation. What is known, however, is that worn surfaces often display a characteristic fractal morphology, called self-affine, that has some fundamental properties regardless of the material and the scale. The origins of this self-affine morphology are still unknown.\nLittle work has been done on how surface roughness changes over time – and it has been mostly experimental. One limitation of experiments is that, because of the debris that forms, it is not easy to monitor how surface morphology changes during the rubbing process. The researchers overcame this problem through their numerical simulations, which provide a constant stream of data.\nPowerful numerical simulations\n“We used high-performance computer simulations to track the change in surface morphology in 2D materials,” says Enrico Milanese, a PhD student at the LSMS. “In our simulations, we observed that contact between two surfaces always generates a wear debris particle. That particle is then forced to roll between the two surfaces, wearing them down. This led us to conclude that wear debris must be present for the surfaces to develop their characteristic self-affine roughness.”\nIn the future, the LSMS researchers hope to explore the origins of adhesive wear by applying their simulation approach to 3D models of materials that are of interest to industry.", "summary": "Using high-performance computer simulations, EPFL researchers were able to observe how surface roughness changes when two materials rub together.

{"id": 529, "text": "Winter is still with us, and an efficient central heating system is essential. However, most of the existing installations only react to one single parameter – the outside temperature – in regulating their output. Researchers at EPFL have developed a system that manages multiple parameters and learns what is best for your house by imitating the most complex computer in the world – your brain. The technology has spun off into a new start-up called Neurobat (for Neuron and Batiment, the word for building in French).\nEach building reacts differently to changes in temperature. If you put 20 people together in a room, it soon becomes stifling. Let a fierce winter sun come in through wide bay windows and fill your living room, and the temperature jumps several degrees while the radiators continue full blast.\n “If we can manage to better take into account the properties of each building in terms of the habits of its users and its position with regard to the sun, it’s possible to make big energy savings,” notes David Lindelöf, technical director of Neurobat SA.\nFrom the lab to the markets\n The company is a spin-off of work performed in the EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB), where David Lindelöf and his associate Antoine Guillemin, scientific director, obtained their PhDs.

Moreover, a presence sensor enables an automatic lowering of the heating output when there is no-one at home.\n“Neuronal” Intelligence\n All the resulting data are integrated in a regulator that can be adapted to most existing installations. However, the engineers responsible for the development of Neurobat wanted to add a layer of “intelligence” based on an artificial neuronal network. “The system records these various parameters and links them together,” adds the technical director. “The more the system ‘learns,’ the more precise the adjustments can be. Eventually, it becomes capable of establishing predictive meteorological models that are specific to a given dwelling, and therefore more precise – and less expensive – than those provided by meteorological offices.”", "summary": "A start-up from EPFL and CSEM is putting on the market a thermal regulator that uses neural networks to learn about your house as the seasons change, allowing for savings of up to 65% on fuel.", "claim": "A start-up from EPFL and CSEM is putting on the market a thermal regulator that uses neural networks to learn about our house as the seasons change, allowing for savings of up to 65% on fuel.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [23, 23], "noise": false}
{"id": 534, "text": "Ask most scientists what matters to them, and they’ll tell you they strive for perfection, set exacting quality standards and reject rough-and-ready solutions. But Andreas Burg, an associate professor of electrical and electronic engineering, doesn’t fit the mold. For Burg, “good enough” will do. His attitude is perhaps surprising, though not necessarily in a bad way, given that he works on error-prone chips – the most delicate components of modern-day electronic devices. His stance is at odds with conventional thinking in electronics, a discipline normally associated with precision. But over his ten-year career at EPFL, he’s built up solid expertise and become a go-to expert in the fast-growing field of approximate computing.\n“Like every scientist, I was taught to assume the worst and to strive for consistent quality,” says Burg. “But I chose a different path. For me, things don’t have to be perfect every time. There has to be a trade-off between perfection and other aspects like energy efficiency.” Imagine you’re parking your car and you set about making detailed calculations, trying to work out which trajectory will make best use of the available space. It would be a time-consuming process. Now imagine how much time you’d save by just driving into the space without over-thinking it.\nThe same principle applies in electronics. “Sometimes, good enough is all we need,” says Burg. Imagine you’re watching a video on your smartphone but your battery is low. You’d be perfectly happy sacrificing streaming quality if it meant saving energy and preserving your battery life.” Embracing imperfection also means accepting minor errors, delays and malfunctions as long as the device does the job it’s designed for.\nMakeshift TVs\nBurg may accept errors as part of his work, but he doesn’t seem to have made many of them in his career. Growing up in Germany, he was fascinated by electronics from a young age. A confident free-thinker, he moved to Zurich at the tender age of 16. And he’s seized every opportunity that’s come his way ever since. “I’ve always loved playing with circuits,” he says. “I remember finding two old TV sets, taking them apart and trying to rebuild them.” When the time came to go to college, he couldn’t decide between electrical engineering and physics. So he signed up for both at ETH Zurich. “On my first day, I decided to attend my electrical engineering class,” he recalls. “I found it more hands-on than physics, so I stuck with it.”\nThat decision shaped the direction of his career, but it hasn’t always been smooth sailing. “I took six years to finish my thesis,” he explains. “Not because I was lazy, but because I was working on so many things at once – communications, cryptography, image and video processing, and other things. Most of that research didn’t make its way into my thesis, but it was fascinating all the same. I knew at that point that I wanted to stay at the university and retain the freedom to explore other aspects of my chosen discipline.”\nAfter completing his postdoc, Burg faced another decision: remain in academia or pursue a career in industry. He founded a startup with two colleagues and gave himself two years to make a success of it. “It didn’t work out,” he explains. “After two years, we ran out of money. We founded the company to develop WiFi chips. We were pioneers, but we faced stiff competition. We realized that you need more than a chip to build a successful business. It was still a worthwhile experience. I learned a huge amount, and I have no regrets.”\nUndeterred by the setback, Burg applied for and was awarded a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) professorship in 2009. Two years later, EPFL published a vacancy for a tenure-track professor in telecommunications circuits. “Things were going well at my lab, but I’d been at ETH Zurich for 15 years,” he says. “I would’ve been happy to move to the US, but I was lucky enough to land the job at EPFL.”\nTaking research in radical new directions\nBurg is known for his radical thinking, and for having several projects on the go at once. He’s keen to share new ideas and put them to the test in his lab. But he’s equally keen not to waste resources. Ideas with a slim chance of success are quickly abandoned, with only promising concepts getting extra time. He takes a steady, iterative approach to his research, including publishing papers. He developed his main research interest, integrated circuits, during his tenure-track years. But he still retains a passion for other, related subjects. Outside the lab, the concept of approximate computing is gaining ground in industry. “There was a lot of pushback against the concept to begin with,” says Burg. “Over time, we’ve learned a lot about industry concerns. Sometimes it’s a case of two steps forward and one step backward, but we’re moving in the right direction.”\nBurg’s appointment as associate professor has given him greater freedom. “I can be more radical and take more risks in my research,” he says. His ambition is to combine communications and artificial intelligence. “Communications is all about equations and mathematical problem-solving,” he explains. “Once you introduce AI into the mix, you can start to solve those problems also intuitively.”\nBurg is also planning to take his research into imperfect chips to the next level. “We’ve developed concepts and predicted how the chips will work,” he explains. “The next step is to take these ideas from the drawing board and actually build our own chips. Our initial designs were relatively straightforward. Now we can afford to be more adventurous. EPFL is the perfect place to push the boundaries.”\nBio\n1975\n: born in Munich\n2000\n: completes engineering degree at ETH Zurich\n2006\n: completes PhD at ETH Zurich\n2007\n: co-founds ETH Zurich spin-off Celestrius\n2009\n: obtains SNSF assistant professorship\n2011\n: appointed tenure-track professor at EPFL\n2018\n: appointed associate professor at EPFL", "summary": "Summer Series: A calling for research.

Bhutan, which sits in the Himalayan foothills, wants to expand its production of hydropower, one of the country’s only indigenous resources, in part to sell it to neighboring India. Only 5% of this resource has been exploited, meaning there is enormous untapped potential.\nYet Bhutan – a country known for its Gross National Happiness Index, age-old traditions and resistance to globalization – is in no hurry. It wants to be sure it has all the skills and knowledge needed to develop, operate and maintain its new dams without foreign assistance. It has only called on outside experts to help it set up its Hydropower Research and Development Center.

EPFL submitted its roadmap to the procuring agency at the end of 2016. \"The Research and Development Center will include nine centers of excellence that cover the entire hydropower production value chain. It will handle all domestic needs, from planning to operations, from training to construction and maintenance, and from safety to cost optimization,” said Mélanie Guittet, the project coordinator at EPFL’s Energy Center.\nThe procuring agency was particularly impressed with the ’s work on modeling hydropower installations. The models are designed to both understand and predict how facilities will interact with water. “The new center will also be equipped with a similar hydraulic laboratory for analyzing existing and future installations,” said Guittet.

{"id": 540, "text": "Some theories are widely used even though they have never been experimentally validated. One example is the so-called narrow groove theory, or NGT, which explains how air-lubricated bearings work in mechanical systems.\nThe theory was proposed in 1965 but, until recently, it had only been tested partially or indirectly. Researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory for Applied Mechanical Design (LAMD), based at Microcity in Neuchâtel, have now closed a gap that has persisted in the scientific literature for over 50 years. The team has published its findings in the journal \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing\n.\nWhy did it take so long to validate the theory? “At the time, engineers were content to observe that the theory worked,” says Eliott Guenat, a doctoral assistant at EPFL and the paper’s lead author. “But that’s all changed, because the mechanical parts we’re developing today are much more advanced and intricate.”\nJürg Schiffmann and Eliott Guenat © EPFL 2020 \nThe narrow groove theory was , two engineers at New York-based Mechanical Technology, Inc. The theory explains the working of herringbone grooved journal bearings, or HGJBs – a type of air-lubricated bearing that supports rotating parts in mechanical systems. Many different types of bearings exist, but HGJBs hold the most promise for developing ultrahigh-speed rotating machines because the rotor is supported on a cushion of air generated by the rotating shaft. “What makes HGJBs special is that they don’t cause wear and tear because there’s no contact,” explains Jürg Schiffmann, who heads the LAMD. “In my lab, we’re using this design to develop the energy systems of the future.”\nValidating the theory\nTo validate the narrow groove theory, the researchers mounted a rotor supported by several HGJBs on a test rig, setting it spinning at 100,000 rotations per minute. Next, they used a shaker system to vibrate the rotor and watched how it reacted. The observations allowed them to calculate the bearings’ stiffness and damping coefficients, which they compared against the theory’s predictions. They found that NGT tended to marginally overestimate both values.\n“We were able to quantify the extent to which the theory holds,” says Guenat. “Now that we’ve shored up our understanding, we can take the theory and apply it in industry and research in new ways.”\nGuenat plans to conduct more experiments to take further measurements. “Instead of using air-lubricated bearings, we’ll run the experiment again with refrigerant, a gas used in heat pumps,” he explains. “The idea is to confirm that the theory holds not just in air, but also in a medium with markedly different chemical and physical properties.”\nElegant in its simplicity \nNGT is a mathematically elegant theory that would likely never have seen the light of day had engineers only now taken an interest in air-lubricated bearings. “These days, we feed our data into a computer and let the processor do the heavy lifting,” explains Guenat. “But even with modern processing power, arriving at the result would take several minutes. With NGT, we can do the same in just a few seconds.” The fully validated theory could have innovative applications in energy system design.", "summary": "An experiment by EPFL researchers has confirmed a theory that has been used in mechanics for over half a century – despite never having been fully validated.

{"id": 541, "text": "Dwarf galaxies don’t emit much light and are therefore hard to observe, but they have a lot to teach us about how the universe was created. A team of scientists from EPFL’s Laboratory of Astrophysics (LASTRO) meticulously studied 27 such galaxies and found a surprising degree of variation in the mechanisms by which their stars were formed. The results of their painstaking work was published in \nAstronomy & Astrophysics\n.\n“Dwarf galaxies are the smallest and probably the oldest galaxies in the universe. Under standard cosmology theory, larger galaxies are formed by the merger of these smaller ones,” says Yves Revaz, a galaxy dynamics expert at LASTRO.\nWhile they may be called “dwarves,” they are in fact huge and can weigh anywhere between hundreds of thousands and several million times as much as the sun. They are also the galaxies with the most dark matter. The LASTRO team therefore had to develop highly sophisticated computer models to study these galaxies’ properties, size and temporality – all of which go well beyond our basic understanding.\nTheir models take into account each of the galaxies’ components – gases, stars and dark matter – as well as the relationship between dark matter and visible matter (called “baryonic matter” in astrophysics). The models also factor in the conditions under which matter was formed when the universe was first created some 14 billion years ago – conditions that are now known thanks to recent space missions carried out to discover the signatures of the Big Bang.\nStep by step\nTo analyze the dwarf galaxies, the scientists first took each model and went step by step through the galaxies’ key characteristics like how much gas (mainly hydrogen) they contain, the heating and cooling of their interstellar mediums, their compression and expansion processes, the successive generations of their stars, those stars’ supernovae, and the resulting release of an array of chemicals. The scientists then compared the results of their models with data that had been obtained by observing dwarf galaxies – more specifically, those orbiting our galaxy, the Milky Way, and its neighboring galaxy, Andromeda (M31) – using eight-meter optical telescopes, the biggest that are currently out there. These dwarf galaxies form part of what is called the Local Group and are close enough for astrophysicists to be able to obtain accurate information on the ages and chemical components of individual stars.\nMaking sure that the models’ results match empirical data is essential if the scientists want to use them to test their theories about dark matter, the kinds of objects responsible for the reionization of the universe, and the conditions and time periods for new star formation.\nThis is the first time that dwarf galaxies have been examined in such detail and under cosmologic conditions – that is, not by considering them as isolated systems but rather by taking into account all the interactions among the very first galactical systems.\nExcellent guinea pigs \n“The advantage of dwarf galaxies is that they respond very well to even minor changes in conditions, making them excellent guinea pigs for studying galaxies in general,” says Pascale Jablonka, a LASTRO researcher specialized in spectroscopy and galaxies’ chemical development and co-author of the study. For instance, by analyzing the light that stars emit, she was able to determine their chemical composition and how long it took them to form.\n“Our models enabled us to create a database of many different types of stellar activity and gave us valuable insight into the factors that can cause star formation to speed up, slow down or even stop altogether,” says Revaz.\nBased on the data they collected – which include an impressive number of different star-formation mechanisms given how “small” dwarf galaxies are – the LASTRO team found that the specific mechanism used depends on the density of the galaxy’s dark and baryonic matter. That density determines whether a galaxy will keep on making stars or suddenly stop. If a dwarf galaxy’s matter is too dispersed, then its hydrogen will get too hot and evaporate, meaning it can no longer form stars. If on the other hand a dwarf galaxy has a dense halo of dark matter protecting it, then star formation will continue apace.\nScientific article: \nMore simulations:", "summary": "EPFL scientists have completed the fastidious task of analyzing 27 dwarf galaxies in detail, identifying the conditions under which they were formed and how they’ve since evolved.

{"id": 542, "text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a powerful instrument to crash protons. Although minute in size, these subatomic particles have huge power as they rush close to the speed of light through the 27 kilometer-long underground circular tunnel. If they went the slightest bit off course, they could cause serious damage to the collider. This is why scientists must precisely anticipate the movements of these unpredictable particles. EPFL physicists Leonid Rivkin and Igor Zacharov have developed a project enabling any volunteer to contribute to this challenge.\nIt is press release, CERN notes that beams of protons are subject to the chaos principle. As with the “butterfly effect”, according to which the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Japan can set off a tornado in Texas, this means that even the slightest change in the conditions around the bunch of protons could throw it off course, particularly after several hundred thousand revolutions.\nPredicting the protons’ motion requires huge computing power. Scientists simulate collisions over and over again. In particular, they take into account the slightest flaw in any of the 1,232 magnets, weighing 35 tons each, down to a fraction of a millimeter. The challenge has been successfully met so far, as no proton has smashed against the accelerator’s wall to date.\nStronger magnets are to be fitted in 2020 to reduce the beam size ever further, in order to increase the chance of collisions. From the simulation point of view, this is essentially a new machine. This is why Igor Zacharov has revived the  program.

{"id": 544, "text": "This week, every two hours, a humming noise can be heard at CES in Las Vegas – that’s when the drones come out at the Swiss Pavilion. Some onlookers are intrigued by the noise, while others have come specifically to see the 15-minute demonstrations, which are introduced by Nicolas Bideau, head of Presence Switzerland. The 200m² area around the stand is not large enough to accommodate all the spectators, some of whom stand on their tiptoes in the aisles to catch a glimpse of the action. In each demonstration and subsequent Q&A session, it’s clear that these aircraft – most of which were developed at EPFL – are attracting interest from professionals looking for potential collaborations or investment opportunities.\nFor US specialists, Switzerland – with its “Drone Valley” – is not necessarily a country they associate with aerial technology. However, as Romeo Durscher, the director of Public Safety Integration at multinational drone specialist DJI, says: “The real experts know what’s happening, and they like the positive, professional and visionary approach emerging in Switzerland, in particular around its elite universities.” Some Swiss startups are meeting with success in the US, like Flyability -which comes from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and supported by the NCCR Robotics, as Dronistics and FlyJaket- and Pix4D, two EPFL spin-offs that have forged strong positions in the American market. Flyability’s drones, in their protective frames, can bounce off obstacles and continue on their way, while Pix4D’s mapping and measurement software is widely used by industry professionals.\nIntuitive piloting\nWhile EPFL has spun off around 12 drone-related startups so far, a number of other aerial technologies are currently being honed in its laboratories. If they can be turned into practical solutions, they may one day be turned into business ventures as well – a good example of this is Flyjacket, which came out of EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems. Flyjacket’s Carine Rognon says that “events like CES not only raise our profile but also allow us to bounce our technology off a large number of specialists, so that we can position ourselves more effectively in the market.”\nTimothée Peter and Arthur Gay, who founded the startup MotionPilot before they had even completed their studies, are visiting the stands of potential partners at CES and presenting their joystick, which makes piloting a drone more intuitive. “For the 60 years that drones have existed, the market has been dominated by conventional remote controls,” says DJI’s Durscher, a Swiss native who has been living in the US for 20 years. “The new applications we are seeing, along with the foldable, haptic-feedback joystick that could work with drones, are in keeping with the market trend towards more intuitive ways to fly drones, particularly for rescue missions.”\nDurscher is also enthusiastic about Dronistics, which is developing drones that fly inside a light, foldable cage. They could become the standard solution for traditional, short-distance parcel deliveries, just as email has replaced letters.\nGetting to the starting blocks at the right time\nBy attending CES – with the help of Presence Switzerland and Switzerland Global Enterprise – and taking part in other programs set up by both public- and private-sector organizations, Swiss startups can learn more about the US market and start meeting people. But this second phase needs to happen very quickly: speed is of the essence in the US, even more than in Switzerland.\nAccording to Durscher, however, the race should not start too early in a company’s life cycle: “It’s better to take full advantage of all available financial assistance and build a solid project before going to market. It’s not easy to convince investors, including in Silicon Valley, and it’s best to arrive with a well-developed technology and a clear message.” As soon as a company hits the starting blocks, the race begins. For Christian Simm, who served as CEO of Swissnex San Francisco for a decade and is now CEO of Swissnex Boston, companies shouldn’t be afraid to knock on doors and get back in touch with the contacts they have made. “After a meeting, it’s almost standard practice in the US – and particularly in Silicon Valley – to get a follow-up email before you’ve even made it back to the office,” he says with a smile.\nThe element of surprise\nFinally, the fact that the US does not regard Switzerland as a leading player in drone technology – at least, not yet – can sometimes be an advantage. The element of surprise can make a crucial difference according to Simm, who often hears comments like: “Why didn’t we know that you had this level of technology in Switzerland?” Maybe one day Switzerland will be more famous for its drones than for its chocolate and watches.", "summary": "This week, four EPFL-designed drones are being shown in the Swiss Pavilion at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Though the title of his talk was “Surveillance in the age of AI”, his moving discourse addressed freedom of speech, human rights, and democracy in addition to online privacy.\nA data collection problem\nSnowden began with an excerpt from his memoir, Permanent Record (Metropolitan Books, 2019), describing the explosion of data collection and “surveillance capitalism” that upended the “pioneering spirit” of the early internet, ultimately driving him to come forward. He argued that today, legal instruments like the  (General Data Protection Regulation) are largely toothless, giving examples of how companies like Facebook are circumventing them without penalty.\n\"The problem with the GDPR is in the name: we don’t have a data protection problem, but a data collection problem. Consent is one of the problems we're struggling with the most.” In addition to the challenges of anonymization, he added that the permanence of digital data is in itself a threat to free society: “We're too afraid to speak up for fear of a permanent record.”\nIn a Q&A with  co-organizer Marcel Salathé, a professor in the EPFL School of Computer and Communication Sciences and School of Life Sciences, Snowden answered the million-dollar question: what can we do to protect our privacy in an age of surveillance?\n“Anyone who uses technology needs to understand basic principles of how a network operates,” Snowden answered. “How does your smartphone make a call?

{"id": 548, "text": "The monetary value of students’ prizes varies between 200 and 2500 Swiss francs, but the real value of these awards is without doubt the value-added in the curriculum vitae of the student who is completing his  or even his. They are valuable assets that enable him or her to stand out in a job market that’s becoming more and more competitive. As Etienne Dufey, former student in civil engineering and winner of the Stucky and IM Maggia prize, remarks: “It’s certainly a ‘plus’ for anyone’s CV. And what seems to me to be even more important is the chance to meet with professionals in the field, to whom the student must present his work in order to obtain the prize, as this creates contacts that can be very important in furthering a career.” \nThe prizes are divided into two categories: \n- Two-thirds of them are jury prizes. In these cases, the student must register, write a letter of motivation showing that his chosen diploma subject corresponds to the prize he or she is in competition for, and submit a given number of copies of this work. A supporting letter from his teacher is also a valuable advantage. No other work needs to be provided, apart from that already done by the student for his/her diploma. \n- A third of them are prizes given for marks, related to the results obtained by the student during his/her bachelor, master or foundation course study program. These are automatically awarded.\nThese awards can be funded by EPFL teachers and their family, public institutions, such as the Commune of Ecublens or Chavannes-près-Renens, or companies that reward work related to their activities – . Bombardier Transportation will award prizes for work in Mechanical Engineering whereas the BCV will award prizes for architectural work. Not all domains receive an award at present, for example Life Sciences. It’s important to note that EPFL also gives prizes to reward the best bachelor, master or foundation course study programs. A novelty for 2011: , the Association of EPFL graduates, will present a prize for the best master study program. The award ceremony takes place every year during the Magistrale – Graduation Day – which is held in a marquee with over 3000 parents, professors and guests present, or in the departments of the winner, on the same day.\nSurprisingly, for some years there are no candidates for the prizes. Students don’t always realize the opportunity that these awards represent, and often only take part after their teachers have suggested that they should! In addition, the cost of printing the number of copies requested by the companies can be dissuasive, since it can sometimes amount to more than the award itself. In Civil Engineering, for example, printing the blueprints is often very expensive. Since they are not guaranteed to get the prize, they prefer not to take part. What’s more, the jury doesn’t always manage to decide between the candidates, so sometimes the prize money is shared out between several winners. “I’ve tried to suggest to companies that they could allow students to deliver their work on a CD, but most of them insist on having printed copies”, explains Maureen Coleman, responsible for the students’ awards (prizes) at EPFL Academic Affairs. It also happens that when they have finished their master, the graduates-to-be forget to apply: “Even if the deadline for entering is 19 August 2011 at 12:00 noon, I encourage the students not to wait, and to already give me the necessary documents”, adds Maureen Coleman.\nSo we would like to remind all the EPFL students who wish to take part in a jury award that they can register until 19 August 2011 at 12:00 noon, but the sooner the better, in order to have enough time to complete all the steps, and if necessary get support from their teachers.

Politicians and companies are particularly interested in the results.\nThe Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), with the support of the Avril Group, is developing a new form of journalism that is based on direct use of data published on social networks. It will be tested during the upcoming international climate conference in Paris. The conference organizers’ marked interest in this tool made it possible for Horizon to obtain the official COP21 label for it.\n“By analyzing discussions on social media, the platform that we’ve developed allows us to monitor in real time what the public thinks of the issues at stake and the decisions taken or under consideration, to display statistical trends and classify the various arguments that are shaping the public debate,” explains Jean-Luc Jaquier, head of the project in the Social Media Lab. “This will allow us to highlight the discussions taking place between opinion leaders and the public.”\nThe platform takes the form of an interactive website . The goal is to give the media, scientists, experts, negotiators, politicians, NGOs, and companies a new means of accessing raw information.\nHorizon will gather, analyze and publish in real time the evolution of debates by collecting information and data on social media networks and establishing a synthesis of opinions. It will also play the role of decoding the negotiations: the platform will identify and transmit – live – the positions held by negotiators, opinion leaders, NGOs, and media representatives, along with the respective weights of the arguments being put forward.\nAlgorithms to the rescue\n Horizon makes it possible to monitor and deconstruct the discussions taking place on social networks with an unprecedented level of detail. It also pulls back the curtain on the positions and emotions of the principal actors involved, along with their credibility, their influences, and direction in which each of them is leaning as a function of the argument being discussed.\nThe platform models the movement of public opinion on an image of a globe, making it easy to follow how opinions are changing over time. The results will be presented live, country by country and community by community. This visualization will be the digital tool of choice for clarifying the major climate issues at stake at COP21.\nDuring the conference, the Horizon platform will be testing the Social Media Index (SMI), an indicator that measures the intensity of discussions and debates as well as the level of emotional engagement on social media. ISM will categorize each debate and controversy using two key indicators: one will evaluate the level of mobilization, and the other the emotional intensity of discussions. The ISM test will also involve recognizing the primary emotions associated with the debates in order to improve Horizon’s accuracy and results, optimizing the algorithms involved.\nAll the data exchanged and recorded by Horizon as part of COP21 will be immediately available to the media in the form of widgets that can be used for their various editorial needs. The service provides content in real time to analysts and the media.\nThe platform opens up a new avenue for understanding and analyzing major debates and public opinion surrounding them. It will be a valuable tool for politicians, companies, the media and many other end-users. It is supported by the Avril group, a leading industrial and financial player in the oils and proteins sector.

{"id": 550, "text": "With the race for renewable energy sources in full swing, plants offer one of the most promising candidates for replacing crude oil. Lignocellulose in particular – biomass from non-edible plants like grass, leaves, and wood that don’t compete with food crops – is abundant and renewable and offers a great alternative source to petroleum for a whole range of chemicals.\nIn order to extract useful chemicals from it, lignocellulose is first pretreated to “break it up” and make it easier to further process. Then it’s exposed to enzymes that solubilize cellulose, which is a chain of linked up sugars (glucose). This step can be done by adding to the pre-treated lignocellulose a microorganism that naturally produces the necessary, cellulose-cleaving enzymes, e.g. a fungus.\nThe enzymes “crack” the cellulose and turn it into its individual sugars, which can be further processed to produce a key chemical: lactic acid. This second step is also accomplished with a microorganism, a bacterium that “eats” the sugars and produces lactic acid when there’s no oxygen around.\nIn the final step of this microbial assembly line, the lactic acid can then be processed to make a whole host of useful chemicals.\nA team of scientists from the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH), the University of Cambridge, and EPFL have made this assembly chain possible in a single setup and demonstrated this conversion can be made more versatile and modular. By easily swapping out the microorganisms in the final, lactic-acid processing, step, they can produce a whole range of useful chemicals.\nThe breakthrough study is published in \nScience\n, and was carried out by Robert Shahab, an EPFL PhD student in Professor Jeremy Luterbacher’s lab, while working at the lab of Professor Michael Studer at the BFH, who led the study.\nThe researchers present what they refer to as a “lactate platform”, which is essentially a spatially segregated bioreactor that allows multiple different microorganisms to co-exist, each performing one of the three steps of lignocellulose processing.\nThe platform consists of a tubular membrane that lets a defined amount of oxygen to go through it. On the tube’s surface can be grown the fungus that consumes all oxygen that passes through the membrane, and provides the enzymes that will break up cellulose into sugars. Further away from the membrane, and therefore in an atmosphere without oxygen, grow the bacteria that will “eat” the sugars and turn them into lactic acid.\nFungal biofilm growing on an oxygen permeable, helically coiled tubular membrane in an otherwise anaerobic bioreactor.

By using different lactic acid-fermenting microorganisms, he was able to produce different useful chemicals. One example was butyric acid, which can be used in bioplastics, while Luterbacher’s lab recently showed that it can even be turned into a jet fuel.\nThe work demonstrates the benefits of mixed microbial cultures in lignocellulose biomass processing: modularity and the ability to convert complex substrates to valuable platform chemicals.\n“The results achieved with the lactate platform nicely show the advantages of artificial microbial consortia to form new products from lignocellulose,” says Michael Studer. “The creation of niches in otherwise homogeneous bioreactors is a valuable tool to co-cultivate different microorganisms.”\n“Fermenting lignocellulose to a lot of different products was a significant amount of work but it was important to show how versatile the lactate platform is,” says Robert Shahab. “To see the formation of lactate and the conversion into target products was a great experience as it showed that the concept of the lactate platform worked in practice.”\nJeremy Luterbacher adds: “The ultimate goal is to rebuild a green manufacturing sector to replace one that produces many products from crude oil.

And securing a spot at this event can pay off handsomely: according to CES organizers, startups that have gotten in have raised some $1.5 billion in funding since 2012. But the entry ticket to expos like this can run in the tens of thousands of dollars, quite a tidy sum for companies still trying to find their feet. This year, Presence Switzerland, which promotes Swiss interests abroad, has teamed up with Switzerland Global Enterprises and other organizations – such as Innosuisse, digitalswitzerland and swissnex – to put together a special pavilion for around 30 Swiss startups. “Globally, Switzerland still isn't recognized enough for its tech and digital industries, even though we’re one of the pioneers in drone technology and our companies are some of the most innovative in this field,” writes Nicolas Bideau, the head of Presence Switzerland, in a communiqué.\nThe Swiss pavilion is hosting most of the EPFL startups at CES. The 200m\n2\n space includes a stage for drone shows and pitch decks. Visitors to the pavilion can also have some fun at the gaming corner, designed to highlight Swiss companies’ latest advances in this field.\nEPFL’s eleven startups and their technologies\n: A new generation of sensors that, among other things, extend the battery life of electronic devices such as smart watches.\n is building a network of leading-edge nanosatellites in Low Earth Orbit to provide cost-effective access to IoT (Internet of Things). It will offer a global coverage including remote areas on land, oceans and mountains.\n: A mobile app called inCORPUS that uses a non-invasive approach to assess people’s physical health and suggest personalized remediations; it initially targeted elite athletes but is now available for the general public.\n: A platform for operating a highly efficient fleet of autonomous vehicles.\n: Special glasses that get around the problem of a fixed focal distance with existing virtual- or augmented- reality headsets. With Creal 3D’s glasses, wearers perceive virtual objects in accordance with their optical depth (so that closer objects appear sharper than distant ones, for example).\n: A foldable drone for delivering packages weighing up to 500 grams; it is programmed to avoid obstacles and can reach places on steep or uneven terrain.\nAn upper-body exoskeleton for piloting a drone; according to an EPFL study, this control method is more accurate and intuitive than a joystick.\n: A pocket-sized, fold-up joystick for controlling portable devices and drones with the help of haptic feedback.\n: Recently released software that works like a photo editor for creating and modifying a virtual reality environment; its secret is a 3D rendering engine that uses voxels – or 3D pixels – that can be employed in other applications, such as representing real people.\n: A joystick for piloting a drone intuitively, with one hand; one version of this device uses haptic feedback to provide users with information on the drone’s aerial position.\n: Portable, next-generation sensors that monitor biochemical levels on the skin’s surface; they provide real-time information on the wearer’s health and well-being, simply and non-invasively.", "summary": "This week, eleven EPFL startups are in Las Vegas to tout their technologies at the Consumer Electronics Show, one of the largest events of its kind.

So how can a smartphone app detect the new coronavirus? “According to the World Health Organization, 67.7% of people who have the virus present with a dry cough – producing no mucus – as opposed to the wet cough typical of a cold or allergy,” says David Atienza, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering who is also the head of ESL and a member of the Coughvid development team. The app is still being developed and will be released in the next few weeks.\nFree and anonymous\nOnce the app is available, users will simply need to install it and record their cough – the results will appear immediately. “We wanted to develop a reliable, easy-to-use system that could be deployed for large-scale testing,” says Atienza. “It’s an alternative to conventional tests.” In addition to being easy to use, the app has the advantage of being non-invasive, free and anonymous. “The app targets to reach a 70% accuracy rate when enough data from a broad spectrum of patients is collected and used for testing,” he adds. “That said, people who think they may have the disease should still go see their doctor. Coughvid is not a substitute for a medical exam.”\nUsing artificial intelligence to help patients\n Coughvid uses artificial intelligence to distinguish between different types of coughs based on their sound. “The idea is not new. Doctors already listen to their patients’ coughs to diagnose whooping cough, asthma and pneumonia,” says Atienza.\nRight now his team is collecting as much data as possible to train the app to distinguish between the coughs of people with COVID-19, healthy people, and people with other kinds of respiratory ailments. “We’ll release the app once we’ve accumulated enough data. It could take a few more weeks,” says Atienza. In the meantime, COVID-19 patients who would like to contribute to the development work can record their cough at  or on the Coughvid mobile app.\nHelpfulETH: an initiative bringing engineers together to fight the pandemic\nCoughvid is one of around a dozen projects being carried out under HelpfulETH, a joint initiative of EPFL and ETH Zurich aimed at developing solutions to help hospitals and other health-care providers fight COVID-19.

{"id": 558, "text": "It’s not unusual for scientists to compare experimental results with the predictions made by theoretical models. And nowadays, generating these predictions usually involves digital methods. For physicists, these methods sometimes require them to work in what they call imaginary time, where their results must be translated before they can be compared to laboratory data. This translation process is referred to as analytic continuation.\nAs part of his semester project, which he did in the lab of EPFL’s Chair of Computational Condensed Matter Physics (C3MP), Romain Fournier applied machine learning to the problem of analytic continuation. His findings were just published in the leading physics journal \nPhysical Review Letters\n – which is highly unusual for an undergraduate project.\nPrior knowledge\n“The main challenge in the translation process is that there’s an unlimited number of mathematical solutions to a given problem,” says Fournier, who recently began his doctoral studies in statistics at the University of Oxford. “It's a little like, instead of being asked what 2+2 equals, you were asked what math operation gives an answer of 4. Among the many possible answers, we’re obviously only interested in the one that makes sense in the physical world. So we're talking about an ill-defined problem, which is a very common situation in science.” And the only way to solve this problem is to bring in prior knowledge.\nFournier’s approach consisted of teaching a neural network to run the translation process by feeding it examples of data simulations that could be obtained experimentally. “It's very easy to go from experimental data to imaginary-time data, and so we were able to quickly build up a big database that we could use to train our model,” says Fournier. This approach was suggested to him by Quansheng Wu, a postdoc at the C3MP lab who supervised Fournier with the support of NCCR MARVEL, a research center created to design and discover new materials through supercomputer-powered simulations.\nAnd so while conventional methods factor in prior knowledge indirectly, this new method does it in a more straightforward way by generating results that are similar to those that would be achieved experimentally. The neural network, once it has been fed these results, provides more reliable answers than conventional methods and does so more quickly.\nGrowing influence \nFor Oleg Yazyev, an assistant professor and head of the C3MP, machine-learning tools will have a growing influence on the field of physics in the coming years. “The fact that an ordinary semester project can turn into a scientific advancement worthy of being published in a leading journal is a real source of motivation for our students,” says Yazyev. “That doesn’t happen every day, of course. But when it does, it provides our up-and-coming researchers with a real career boost.

{"id": 560, "text": "A video posted on the internet might be watched by thousands of different people, each with his own device, internet connection and viewing environment. But that doesn’t mean the streaming service will be personalized for each user. “Platforms like YouTube or Netflix use two systems, both of which are inefficient,” says Marina Zapater Sancho, post-doctoral researcher at ESL. She is one of the authors of the study being carried out under the  project, which has received funding from the EU Horizon 2020 program and will be presented at the  in Seoul on 15 October 2017. “They store either one copy of a video in the highest-quality format possible, or dozens of copies in different formats.” The former can result in slow and choppy streaming, while the latter takes up huge amounts of server storage and consequently eats up lots of power. \nBetter resource allocation\nThe researchers developed a way to reduce the power requirement by nearly 20% while improving the user experience by 37%. Their method involves machine learning, an approach identified by Arman Iranfar, a PhD student at ESL and co-author of the study. “Computers learn from experience,” he says. “We exposed them to many different scenarios, such as 1,000 people playing a video, each from a different device. The computers remembered the series of actions that led to positive outcomes and reproduced them.” By the same token, the applications that encode videos (so they can be streamed) can learn to better allocate resources while simultaneously optimizing factors like compression, quality, performance and power consumption. Considering that video streaming makes up 80% of internet traffic worldwide and is still expanding, such an improvement can have a major impact.\nNext up: real-time streaming\nBut this is just a stepping stone. The researchers’ ultimate aim is to enable real-time streaming. That refers to a system where streaming platforms store just one copy of a video, and when someone clicks on the video to watch it, the platform immediately adjusts the format, compression and quality to that particular viewer. “Today that would require ten servers for each unique viewer. That’s not feasible,” says Marina Zapater Sancho, because the performance/power tradeoff is a challenge faced not just by YouTube. “Take magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To effectively diagnose as many patients as possible, the scanners would have to operate 24/7 and produce very high-quality images that would be stored for at least the duration of the patients’ lives,” she says. But today, patients who go in for an MRI come out with their images on a CD. No internet platform currently exits that can store these images and allow doctors to view and use them in real time.\nThe Embedded Systems Laboratory is also working on space-related applications in the  project, which aims to develop the world’s largest radio telescope. The hope is that the vast images of the sky taken by the telescope can be used to study tiny celestial objects. “The streaming is extremely complicated from a computing standpoint,” says Marina Zapater Sancho. “We are trying to find the best architecture for the servers, bearing in mind that these servers may not exist yet.” \nThis research is being carried out at the Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), ,headed by Professor David Atienza Alonso, part of the Institute of Electrical Engineering (IEL) at EPFL, under the\nproject (an EU Horizon 2020 project) in association with companies and other universities\n.", "summary": "Given the growing number of users and the widening range of devices, streaming is no longer viable in its current form owing to the substantial amount of power and storage capacity it requires.

{"id": 562, "text": "When cells divide, they pack up all of their genetic material in the tightly wrapped chromosomes. The ends of our chromosomes have a unique structure, named a telomere. Replication of telomeres requires specialized mechanisms, which adult organisms only have in a small number of cells. This means that chromosomes become shorter over time, limiting the lifespan of cells and contributing to aging. Telomeres are also very sensitive to oxidative damage, which affects their ability to replicate. EPFL scientists have now discovered a protein that associates with chromosomes during cell division and protects their tips from oxidative damage. The discovery, published in \nCell Reports\n, could have significant implications for how we could treat cancer and other age-related diseases in the future.\nDivision, damage, and shortening\nPrecise transmission of the genome from a cell to its progeny is vital to maintain its characteristics and for the health of the entire organism. Our genome is constantly subjected to damage from environmental factors such as sunlight and oxygen radicals, which are by-products of our normal metabolic functions. As such, oxidative damage is a constant threat to all life on Earth. \nCells have evolved numerous antioxidative defenses, but some parts of the cell, like the chromosome tips, the telomeres, are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Telomeres are sequences of repetitive nucleotides at each end of a chromosome. Their role is to protect that end from damage or from fusing with other chromosomes, which would be catastrophic for the cell. In most adult tissues, every time it divides, its chromosomes shorten a little in length; eventually, the telomeres shorten so much that the end of the chromosome becomes exposed, which causes either the death of the cell or an irreversible block to further divisions. This process is accelerated by oxidative damage. The prevailing theory of aging, as well as cancer, cites a central role for oxidative damage of the telomeres in these processes.\nAn enzyme that protects telomeres\nChromosomes are made up of DNA that is tightly wound up around specialized proteins. The labs of  and  at EPFL analyzed the protein make-up of telomeres across the entire cell cycle to better understand how oxidative damage affects telomeres during division. \nThe researchers used a number of molecular biology techniques, including a relatively new one called QTIP, which labels various proteins in chromosomes so that researchers can compare and identify quantitative differences between the protein composition of telomeres in various phases of the life cycle.\nThe study identified an enzyme called Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1). It functions as an antioxidant enzyme, meaning that it is used by cells to mitigate the effects of oxidative damage. \nUsing QTIP, the researchers found large amounts of PRDX1 on telomeres during two phases of the cell cycle: the phase when the cells synthesizes new DNA and duplicates its genetic material (S-phase), and during the immediately following phase (G2), when the cell grows in size just before it begins dividing.\nUsing genetic techniques, the scientist removed PRDX1 from the cells, and found that the telomeres were even more susceptible to oxidative damage. This means that PRDX1 plays an antioxidative role that protects telomeres.\nIn addition, the researchers were able to shed some light onto how oxidative damage affects telomeres. When they incorporated an oxidatively damaged nucleotide into telomeres, they found that the chromosome stopped growing. The reason is that the enzyme called telomerase that builds chromosomes by elongating them abruptly abandoned the process when it encountered the damaged nucleotide. As cancer cells require telomerase for survival this finding may open up novel avenues for attacking this enzyme in cancer.\n“Our study links oxidative damage and telomeres, both of which have been previously linked to aging and cancer,” says Joachim Lingner. In addition to these, oxidative damage of telomeres is also connected to cardiac failure and muscular dystrophy. Having identified PRDX1, Lingner’s lab will now try to determine if there are other antioxidant enzymes that can protect telomeres: “We expect that further studies of this problem will provide insights that help us understand mechanisms of cancer development, aging and inherited disease.”\nThis study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the NCCR RNA and disease network, the European Commission’s Seventh Framework Programme (CodeAge), the Swiss Cancer League and EPFL.\nReference\nEric Aeby, Wareed Ahmed, Sophie Redon, Viesturs Simanis, Joachim Lingner. \nPeroxiredoxin 1 protects telomeres from oxidative damage and preserves telomeric DNA for extension by telomerase. \nCell Reports\n 17, 1­-8.

{"id": 564, "text": "Over the past decade, there has been a remarkable change in transportation options for residents of the Canton of Vaud. Whereas the population has grown by more than 15%, the supply of public transport has grown by over 30%. In parallel, information and communication methods have increased dramatically, and the role of cars and clean transportation methods in large conurbations has been rethought. What impact do these transformations have on people's commuting habits? An EPFL survey reveals that the quality of time spent in transit has also become a factor in selecting a means of transport. Moreover, although cars still hold pride of place when it comes to transportation options, public transport and walking are now very much a part of people’s mindsets – Vaud residents are now truly multimodal.\nDownload the graphic with the link on the rigth.​​​\nEPFL's Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR), headed by Vincent Kaufmann, surveyed a representative sample of the workforce in Vaud’s various regions. These included Lausanne and its suburbs, the mid-sized municipalities of Morges, Nyon and Yverdon, the peri-urban zones around Yverdon and Nyon, smaller communities (Aigle and Rolle) and small peri-urban areas outside urban areas. Originally conducted in 2018–2019, the survey was updated in 2020 to include a pandemic-related supplement. All together, the survey has yielded a detailed picture of how workers’ commuting habits vary depending on such factors as place of residence, age and level of education.\nPrivate cars: still useful, but less loved\nSimilar surveys conducted in 1994 and 2011 for the Lausanne area serve as benchmarks. The main finding is that cars continue to play a central role in Vaud residents’ commuting choices. In regions where public transport is sparser and in city centers, nine out of ten working households use a car. In Lausanne, three out of four working adults have a car in their household. The city’s extremely convenient parking conditions keep car ownership appealing: more than half of all working people who drive to work have parking spaces, a figure that increases to three out of four in other parts of Vaud. It’s also worth noting that fewer than 35% of those who take public transport receive a contribution towards their travel passes from their employer.\nWhile the car's reputation remains mostly positive, it is nevertheless in decline. In 1994, criticism of automobiles centered mainly around their cost. Now, however, they are taken to task for their negative impact on the environment. A quarter of a century ago, only one person in ten held a negative view of cars; today it is one out of four. Public transport’s image, however, is very much a work in progress. In 1994, more than one out of two Vaud residents (53%) had a negative view of it and only 30% a positive perception – a trend that resurfaced during the current pandemic. In 2011, the opposite was true: 61% of working adults had a positive image of public transport against 26% with a negative view. By 2018, this perception had changed – only one out of every two Vaud residents had a positive image. In 1994, public transport was criticized for being slow and limited; now it’s ticket prices that are seen as problematic, especially among occasional users and those travelling with families.\nClean transportation methods, conversely, reap accolades among users, who see them as sporty, ecological, practical, inexpensive and comfortable. Cycling continues to be perceived as dangerous, however, especially in Lausanne and its suburbs, while walking is deemed too slow, particularly for longer trips outside urban centers.\nA multimodal world\nWhat can we conclude from all this? Commuting habits are shifting. Automobile use is decreasing, while walking and the use of public transport are on the rise, except in suburban areas. These trends are even more marked among the under-35s, who are less likely to always have a car at their disposal. Overall, Vaud has become a multimodal world: 40% of its residents regularly use several means of transport and a third do so occasionally. Bicycles and e-bikes continue to enjoy considerable potential, according to the researchers. Based on this, they recommend introducing continuous cycle paths in urban areas and pedestrian travel routes that are linked to public transport. In 2020, this trend continued throughout the pandemic.\nAnother finding is that how people can use their commuting time also plays an important role in their transportation choices. With regard to public transport, the research team recommends improving user comfort, augmenting the frequency of trains and increasing average speeds to be more competitive. They also recommend more efficient feeder services in the Canton’s peri-urban and rural areas, as well as more appealing fares for occasional travelers.", "summary": "EPFL has established a comprehensive overview of commuting practices by Vaud residents and their views on available means of transport.", "claim": "EPFL has established a comprehensive overview of commuting practices by Vaud residents and her views on available means of transport.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [13, 13], "noise": false}
{"id": 565, "text": "Once mastered, nuclear fusion will be able to produce enough energy – clean, reliable energy – to meet the needs of mankind for centuries to come. Unlike fission, fusion does not create radioactive waste with a long lifespan, and it is based on abundant materials that are easier to extract than uranium.\nNumerous international research projects are under way, and one of the most crucial challenges they face is plasma confinement. This refers to confining a gas that is heated to more than a hundred million degrees – considerably hotter than the core of the sun – so that the component hydrogen atoms will fuse and release huge amounts of energy. But these extreme temperatures must not damage the reactor, which means the plasma must be kept away from the walls. This is done using a magnetic field that is contained inside a ring-shaped chamber called a tokamak.\nOne-of-a-kind research facility\nThe Variable Configuration Tokamak, which was built in 1992 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland), has always been on the leading edge among research facilities in this field. The TCV tokamak, as it is known, is operated by the Center for Research in Plasma Physics (CRPP) and is unique because – as its name indicates – it can produce plasma in various shapes. This feature allows scientists to determine the most appropriate configuration for use in an energy-producing reactor. And it was thanks to this feature that in late 2013 the TCV tokamak was selected by the EUROfusion consortium as one of three national facilities on the European continent to be used to help design the international power plant ITER, currently being built in the south of France, and develop its successor, DEMO, a prototype commercial reactor.\nThe Swiss government, via the ETH Board, recently decided to grant the Lausanne-based lab 10 million francs over 4 years (2017-2020), to upgrade certain aspects of its facility. Thanks to these funds, the Center will soon be equipped to carry out new experiments on the TCV tokamak, particularly in relation to extracting energy and particles from the plasma. New mechanisms for heating the plasma with microwaves and with the injection of neutral particles may also be installed. At the same time, the Center is expanding its sector for lower density and lower temperature plasmas in order to explore new applications for plasma, such as in the medical field, the food industry and astrophysics. These improvements will encourage many Swiss and European researchers to visit Lausanne and conduct new experiments.\nThe “Swiss Plasma Center”, a new international reference\nAlongside these developments, the Lausanne-based lab is changing its name. It is now the Swiss Plasma Center that will impress its credentials on Switzerland, Europe and the rest of the world as a leading institution in this field. The renamed Center was officially inaugurated today in Lausanne. Attendees included Bernard Bigot, Director-General of ITER, along with officials from the EUROfusion consortium, who emphasized the importance of the research being carried out in Switzerland in support of the objective of the reactor being built in Cadarache.

That’s not something you can do with a simulator,” he adds. That competition – like EPFL’s  contest – has been postponed until the fall semester. Students seem to be on board with this decision, as they’ve all re-upped.\nRobotics competition, 2019 edition © Alain Herzog / EPFL\n“In the meantime, the project coordinators have been giving online workshops so that students can acquire the necessary skills to meet challenges they will face in their professional careers,” says Julien Delisle, the interdisciplinary project coordinator.\nRemote design presentations\nSeveral student events scheduled for this summer have been shifted online, including the  competition. This year’s challenge for the student teams is to develop biosensors for treating epilepsy. Members of EPFL’s team, named Helvet’Sens, have been working remotely on theoretical design aspects – and some are even running tests at home. “We’re kind of in DIY mode,” says Aurélie Ducrot, a life sciences engineering student. In response to current events, the team is hard at work on a biosensor that can be applied to other molecules. “For example, we could conduct serological testing to detect the presence of coronavirus antibodies in blood,” says Maxime Marchionno, a microengineering student. He adds: “It’s a big engineering challenge that requires other skills as well. Still, there’s a lot of value in what we’re doing – we’ve been able to move forward on the business aspect through research and discussions with industry professionals. But for the physical part of the design work, which was supposed to take place this summer, things are a little less clear-cut, but we’re really hoping to return to campus.”\nIn 2018, eight EPFL students were awarded the technical prize at the international SensUs competition.\nHelvet’Sens will therefore present its project from Switzerland, as will bioengineering students taking part in the  worldwide synthetic biology competition. “It was a challenge to stay fully motivated during lockdown,” says Laura Iacobucci, a chemistry and chemical engineering student, and Harshdeep Harshdeep, who is studying communications systems. “But we supported each other and got through it.” Even though they weren’t able to use the lab to pursue their project and learn the basics of synthetic biology, they kept their spirits up. She adds: “Lockdown forced us to probe all aspects of our proposed solution, including some that were still changing and that could be tested at home.”\nCompetitions provide opportunities for students to speak directly with industry experts and to gain a foothold in the world of startups. This is a real loss for participants, who are now waiting to see whether an online networking option is planned.\nWhile these projects are moving forward, plants are also thriving. This is the positive takeaway of Victoria Letertre, a systems engineering student who’s also president of the  student association. Her team is developing a robot that grows and harvests plants without human intervention and is intended for use in extreme environments. This project will be presented online in July at the second edition of IGLUNA.\nBehind schedule or ahead of time?\nDue to postponed or canceled competitions,  will not make the rounds of European racetracks,  will not sail the Mediterranean and the  group won’t be travelling to China. In addition, the New Mexico desert will not host the Spaceport America Cup, in which  was planning to compete. Their rocket was slated for completion and a test launch in April. Instead, the team has been making progress on some rocket parts from home, and has been promised a July slot for a launch at a Swiss military base.\nEPFL Racing Team has decided against building its prototype. “We plan to use the resources we have to further enhance our racecar design for next year,” says team leader Pierre Georges. This sentiment is shared by the Swiss Solar Boat team, except that their boat’s assembly was under way when the campus went into lockdown. “We had just received parts from the shipyard,” says Adrien Peltier, the committee president. “We changed our working method to focus on design aspects, which turned out well, because now the project is much more advanced.” Students can carry out simulations from home thanks to the efforts of Julien Delisle and Alessandro Crespi, who provided remote access to computers powerful enough for this type of work.\nEPFL Racing Team competed in the Formula Student co\nmpetition for the first time last year.\nPierre Georges remains optimistic: “We’ll be pretty much ready to build our racecar in September, if we’re allowed back on campus by then. The testing period on the racetrack will just have to be a lot longer than normal.” And as regards the asymmetrical Swiss Boat built by Adrien Peltier and his 60 “colleagues,” it hopefully will be launched in September for fine-tuning. The team will then collect as much performance data as possible and make any necessary adjustments before the 2021 Monaco Solar & Energy Boat Challenge.\nLess impact on longer-term projects\nThe 40 or so  alumni and students still hope to set a new world sailing speed record in 2022. Projects have been revamped so they can be worked on remotely, students will earn credits as planned, and the team has even used lockdown to catch up on some technical dimensions. “When activity partially resumes in early May, I’ll be able to return to campus along with a few other team members,” says project manager Mayeul van den Broek. “We used our downtime to move forward on building a prototype and providing feedback to students.” For van den Broek, the pandemic created significant sponsoring challenges: “Because a number of things can be accomplished in-house, we have the resources we need to keep going until early 2021. However, we need to source the funds necessary to begin building the boat in April/May 2021.”\nThe SP80 team © Alain Herzog / EPFL\nNicolas Martinod, vice president of the  association, considers his team one of the lucky ones. “We’ve started in on the initial construction phase for our satellite, which is design-oriented and can be done remotely,” he says. “All we needed to do was adapt our recruitment procedure for next year’s team, but everything went well because we received some 40 applications.”\nFinally, the  project – which enables students to explore new technologies in the cultural field – has merely been postponed. The team’s app for assessing festival-goer flows and tracking emotional responses will be ready for field testing during the 2021 edition of the Balélec music festival.\nA good time for new initiatives\nA new initiative by students from EPFL Rocket Team expands on what was originally planned. “In a spirit of outreach, we contacted European teams to find out how they were handling the situation, and what opportunities there were on their end for a European-scale launch,” says Pierre Groslambert, a microengineering student. Even if no date has been set, this initiative seems to have gotten off to a good start, since they are dialoguing with around 30 teams and with space agencies from various countries to find a launch site. Baptiste De Christen, who is studying mechanical engineering, says, “All this is done in the hopes of creating a European competition.”\nLaunch of EPFL Rocket Team’s Eiger Rocket during the Spaceport America Cup 2019.\nMany students have used the lockdown to think up new project ideas, and a large number of proposals have landed on Delisle’s desk. “It’s a good sign because some of the projects involve students from fields that have been underrepresented,” he says.

{"id": 568, "text": "It is known as an active emergency lane; that is: an emergency lane temporarily open to traffic. Since January 2010, this is the case for a four kilometers stretch between Morges and Ecublens. Its goal is to smooth the traffic flow of, at rush hour, 82’000 daily vehicles traveling on the A1 Lausanne-Geneva highway. Does it really work? Researchers from the Traffic facilities laboratory (LAVOC) at EPFL have assessed the effectiveness and impact of this measure. They have found that it undoubtedly decreases congestion and accidents, but they also believe that some modifications would bring about an optimal result.\nThe most notable effect of this active emergency lane is the intensification of the traffic flow: there has been an increase of approximately 750 vehicles per hour over a total of approximately 6’000 vehicles, despite a lower speed limit of 100 km/h instead of 120 km/h. Regardless of this increase in traffic, \"simulations show that this represents a reduction of one-fifth of CO2 emissions due to smoother traffic and reduced speed,\" said Professor André-Gilles Dumont, head of LAVOC.\nHowever, the effectiveness of this measure often comes down to a matter of minutes. When the flow reaches 35 vehicles per km, an alarm is triggered at a checkpoint at Blécherette. An employee must manually enable the opening of the lane. Still, sometimes it only takes a few minutes for the formation of a traffic jam which then takes some time to be dissolved. \"We seek to integrate other parameters apart from the flow to determine the opening of the system: the vehicle distribution by lane or the speed differences among the lanes. The most important thing is to maintain the flow of traffic as it is very difficult to recover it once a traffic jam is in place,\" said the professor.\nA better signaling \nAs for accident prevention, a more responsive system would also improve the situation. The introduction of the active emergency lane has resulted in an overall decrease of a quarter of the number of accidents that occurred between 2008 and 2013. \"They are often related to lane changes. If we want to reduce them, it is essential for drivers entering the highway to know as soon as possible that the lane is open so that, for example, they stay on it as long as possible\", said André-Gilles Dumont.\nSurveys conducted by researchers two years after the start of the system also showed that the measure was not yet fully adopted by drivers. Nearly 70% of respondents did not hesitate to use it. However a fourth of them felt uncomfortable to cross the white line and the same proportion did not feel safe.\nTo remedy this, scientists recommend a better signaling. \"A kilometer before entering the highway, in this case at Aubonne and at Crissier, it would be necessary to place a sign indicating whether the emergency lane is open or closed,\" said the professor. In addition, the study suggests indicating each lane’s speed limit in the section where the emergency lane is open. Currently, there are only two speed limit signs on gantries that are thus placed between the lanes. Meanwhile, scientists are thinking about a specific sign to allow drivers to pass across the white line with less apprehension.\nOther highway sections under consideration\nConducted since 2011, the study provides new prospects for the future. In collaboration with other two EPFL laboratories, researchers have also carried out a study on driver behavior through the use of drones. When do drivers change lanes? Under what conditions? What paths do they take? The flights to conduct the investigation took place in March 2014. The analysis of this exploratory study is still underway.\nThe assessment of the partial opening of the emergency lane in Morges is particularly relevant as other Swiss highway sections could use a similar system. That will be the case in 2015 in the Bern region between the Berne-Wankdorf and Muri intersections. There are also plans for its development at the entrance of Geneva, between Nyon and the Vengeron intersection as well as between the Cossonay junction and the Villars-Sainte-Croix intersection.\nThe Traffic facilities laboratory (LAVOC) was commissioned by the Fund for road research (Fonds pour la recherche routière) to carry out this study.

He will be putting this know-how into practice for the second consecutive year, in the writing workshop he is giving for students in their 3rd year graduate studies at the (CDH).\nNamed this year as “artist in residence” by the President of the school, he is responsible for initiating interaction between an art form and the institution. As a consequence, he had the idea of broadening the profile of his course, and making it a genuine event for the campus.\n“Over three semesters, we’re going to experience a fusion of the arts and science, but also of different members of the EPFL community”, explains Metin Arditi.\nHis project will be structured in three phases. First of all, he asked three renowned professors to join with him: Olaf Blanke, of the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, Pierre Magistretti, of the Laboratory of Neuroenergetics and Cellular Dynamics, and Majed Chergui, of the Laboratory of Ultrafast Spectroscopy. He asked them to look ten to twenty years into the future, and to imagine what ethical questions and debates on society will result from their work.\n“I appreciate very much Metin Arditi’s initiative”, emphasizes Majed Chergui, “as I believe that it’s important to raise this debate in the world of science, on questions of ethics and philosophy. To question ourselves on the influence and the importance of our findings as scietists, to return to an attitude based on doubt, and put the general interest at the center of our preoccupations – these should be part of our everyday activity”.\nIn a second phase, the reflections of these professors will help in the elaboration of three “roadmaps”, which will be provided to the students as the beginning of the course, in the Spring term. They will be able to choose the problem that interests them the most. On this basis, they will be asked to write a monolog or a dialog. They will be required to look, in their turn, into the future, and to put themselves in the place of a person who is confronted with these important ethical questions, and who must take a decision.\nLastly, to mark all the work and effort, an open evening will be organized at the beginning of the fall semester 2011. To start with, actors who will also be from the EPFL community will play the three best scenes written by the course participants. Then a debate will take place on the theme of new knowledge and the ethical questions they raise, with a panel of guests composed of several science personalities, among whom will be the three professors associated with the project.\nThe course will be held in the spring at a rhythm of two hours every 15 days, on Tuesdays from 13:00 to 15:00.

{"id": 571, "text": "It’s still impossible to determine where and when an earthquake will occur. For example, California has for years been under the threat of the “Big One,” and closer to home, a recent series of small shocks in Valais Canton in early November has raised fears of a major earthquake in the region. Although we can’t predict earthquakes, researchers from EPFL and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have made a step forward in assessing earthquake dynamics through a better understanding of how frictional slip – the relative motion of two bodies in contact under shear stress, such as tectonic plates – begins. Their work has been published in two complementary parts, in  and \n“We wanted to understand what happens when two bodies in frictional contact suddenly start moving following a gradual increase of the shear stress: the way they start sliding will determine the speed and extent of the movement and, potentially, the severity of an earthquake,” explains Fabian Barras, a doctoral assistant at EPFL’s Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LSMS) during this research, and first author of both articles.\nParallels between slip front and fracture\nThe way in which frictional sliding begins between two bodies is not as uniform as it appears. Ultrafast cameras show that slip starts at a specific point and then spreads to the rest of the surface. “This slip front dynamics is very similar to the way a crack propagates within a brittle material,” says Barras. The researchers’ first publication looks at the similarities between frictional rupture and dynamic fracture. “Although the physics of a crack and a slip front is not exactly the same, they both propagate because of a drop in the material’s load-bearing capacity behind the rupture. Using the analogy with dynamic fracture, we studied the origin of the drop of frictional stress observed in the wake of a slip front when the interface starts to move.”\nThe researchers then looked at the concentration of stress at the slip front and used theoretical tools from the field of rupture dynamics to study the energy balance. Unlike the situation with a crack, friction continues to dissipate energy after slip has started. During an earthquake, only part of the available energy is used to propagate the rupture front, and the remainder is dissipated by friction, mainly in the form of heat. It is here that the researchers were able to revise previously used models and achieve a better understanding of how much frictional energy is involved in the propagation of the rupture front.\nThey used high-performance computers to simulate seismic ruptures based on generic laws of friction, which reproduce the change in frictional force depending on the slip velocity measured between different types of materials. Using dynamic rupture theory and applying it to friction, the researchers were able to assess laboratory experiments and ensure that their predictions were correct. “We were able to validate our predictions across a wide range of experimentally observed rupture velocities. The theoretical models we developed could in the future help us better understand why certain earthquakes in nature are fast and violent, while others propagate slowly and occur over longer periods of time,” adds Barras.\nDeep geothermal energy and induced seismicity\nThese advances in fundamental research could one day be applied to more complex models, such as those representing conditions along tectonic faults, especially where fluids are naturally present or injected into the ground. “Today, several promising technologies in the context of the energy transition – like deep geothermal energy – relies on underground fluid injection. It is important to have a better understanding of how those injections affect seismic activity. I hope to use the tools developed during my PhD to study that impact,” says Barras.\n“This work shows how research developed in a civil engineering laboratory can have very interesting implications for earthquake science and lead to cutting-edge publications in areas such as physics,” says Professor Jean-François Molinari, the head of EPFL’s Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory. Fabian Barras has also received a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to continue his research in a laboratory specializing in fault geology at the University of Oslo.\nCaption: \nBetween two solids in frictional contact, slip nucleates at a point on the surface (corresponding to the hypocenter of an earthquake) before spreading to the rest of the interface – just like a crack growing through a brittle material.

They will set up a weather station and take samples to better understand the unique phenomena related to snowfall and to snowflake sublimation by polar winds. Throughout the experience, the scientists will post regular updates on EPFL Out There, a blog devoted entirely to EPFL research expeditions: \nVery few hydrometeorological data have been collected on Antarctica, but this expedition will change that. It will indirectly help measure the effects of climate change in this region by examining the behavior of the snowfall that creates icecaps.\nThis project was selected through a competition within EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). But this isn’t ENAC’s first foray to Antarctica. During the 2015 and 2016 Antarctic summers, ENAC researchers installed a weather radar at France’s Dumont d’Urville station on the Antarctic coast. That expedition, documented on EPFL Out There (), gave the team valuable experience in setting up research instruments in Antarctica.\nThen, in 2016, ENAC researchers built a weather station at the Princess Elisabeth research station, located further inland. And in 2017 an expedition was sent to the Syowa research station on an island off the shore of Antarctica; this ongoing project is being carried out in association with Japanese scientists.\nSnowfall microphysics\nThe first EPFL student to head to Davis will be Josué Gehring, who will leave on Sunday, 14 October for two months. His trip will take 18 days: a 28-hour flight to Tasmania followed by a 16-day boat ride. Gehring is a PhD student at the Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (LTE), headed by Alexis Berne, and specializes in using weather radars to research the microphysics of snowfall.\nHis first task will be to install a weather radar at Davis and collect data. The radar will operate throughout the Antarctic summer. Gehring will also set up a rain gauge to measure precipitation volumes and a multi-angle snowflake camera – a device that can take three high-resolution photos of a snowflake at the same time.\nOnce the data are collected, Gehring will compare them with data he collected during a research expedition in the South Korean mountains last winter, not far from the PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games. You can read more about this expedition on EPFL Out There: .\nSnowflake sublimation\nPost-doc Franziska Gerber will arrive at Davis at roughly the same time as Gehring. Gerber is conducting her post-doc research at EPFL’s Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences (CRYOS), headed by Michael Lehning. At Davis, she will install two instruments to analyze snowflake sublimation by polar winds. One will count snowflakes, while the other will measure air turbulence and water evaporation. This information will let her calculate the flow of snowflakes hitting the ground and the flow of sublimated vapor in the air, and determine how much snow is sublimated by the wind versus how much lands on the ground. Her instruments will remain at the station and collect data over an entire year, including during the Antarctic winter.\nThis won’t be Gerber’s first experience in the extreme cold. She was recently in Siberia for a research project carried out jointly by EPFL and the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF). Fellow CRYOS post-doc Annelen Kahl posted updates about this expedition on EPFL Out There: #.\nComparing data \nThe final student to reach Davis will be Alfonso Ferrone, who will arrive in mid-December 2018 and stay for two months. Also a PhD student at LTE, Ferrone is an expert in Antarctic precipitation and already spent a full year at the Concordia research station on the Antarctic plateau. He will collect data at Davis and compare them with data previously collected at Dumont d’Urville.\nThe three EPFL scientists will work alongside over 100 other researchers at the station, which is one of the biggest in Antarctica.

{"id": 573, "text": "Tiny factories float inside our cells and provide them with almost all the energy they need: the mitochondria. Their effectiveness decreases when we get older, but also when we face many diseases such as diabetes, cancer or Parkinson's. This is why scientists are increasingly interested in how they work. At EPFL, a team has developed a protocol to measure their activity live in living animals. Described in Nature Chemical Biology, the method relies on the molecule responsible for the firefly's bioluminescence. In the most literal sense of the word, this study sheds light on how mitochondria work.\nMitochondria are almost like cells within the cell. Like their host, they have a membrane that protects their genetic material and, above all, filters exchanges with the outside. The difference in electrical charge between the inside and the outside of the mitochondria, called “membrane potential”, allow certain molecules to go through, while other ramain at bay.\nAs between the two poles of a used electric battery, the membrane potential of the mitochondria can sometimes drop. For scientists, this is an unmistakable clue that its functions are impaired.\nWe know how to measure the phenomenon on cultured cells. But until now, you couldn't really see it on live animals. “Cell cultures are not very effective in studying diseases linked to mitochondria”, explains Elena Goun, professor at EPFL and lead author of the article: “Cancer or diabetes involve complex exchanges between various types of cells, therefore we need animal models. ”\nElena Goun and her colleagues have found a way to study the phenomenon in live mice. They use animals that are genetically modified to express luciferase – an enzyme that produces light when combined with another compound called luciferin. This is how fireflies sometimes light up our summer evenings.\nScientists have developed two molecules that, when injected into the rodent, pass into the mitochondria, where they activate a chemical reaction. The mitochondria then produce luciferin and eject it outwards. Luciferin combines with luciferase in the mice’s cells and produce light.\n“In a completely darkened room, you can see the mice glowing, just like fireflies,” says Elena Goun.\nResearchers need only measure light intensity to get a clear picture of how well the mitochondria are functioning. When they function less well, their membrane lets in less chemical compounds. The production of luciferin decreases, and therefore the luminosity too.\nTo demonstrate the potential of their method, the researchers carried out several experiments. For example, they observed that older rodents produce significantly less light. This drop in light reflects a drop in the activity of mitochondria - their membrane potential is much lower than in younger rodents. We know that age causes a decrease in the activity of mitochondria, but this is the first time that the phenomenon has been accurately measured directly in living animals.\nThe team also tested a chemical known to rejuvenate mitochondria: nicotinamide riboside. This molecule is non-toxic and commercially available as a dietary supplement. Mice given this compound produced more light, a sign of increased mitochondrial activity.\nThe researchers were also able to measure the same phenomenon in animal models of cancer. This could be of great help for anticancer drug research. In addition, they also successfully demonstrated monitoring of mitochondria membrane potential in cells of brown adipose tissue, rich in mitochondria. Its stimulation could help cure certain forms of obesity.\nThe method described by Elena Goun is primarily intended for scientists who want to better understand the role of mitochondria and who need an animal model. The field of application is wide: diabetes, oncology, aging, nutrition, neurogenerative diseases... “Our process can measure varying degrees of mitochondria activity, and not just an on / off signal”, explains Elena Goun. “It is extremely sensitive – much more than a PET scan – affordable and easy to implement. ”", "summary": "The mitochondria provide energy for our cells, yet their role in many diseases is still poorly understood.

But those recently developed at EPFL are altogether different: they are almost as flexible as rubber and can be stretched up to four times their original length and in all directions. And they can be stretched a million times without cracking or interrupting their conductivity. The invention is described in an article published today in the journal\n Advanced Materials\n.\nBoth solid and flexible, this new metallic and partially liquid film offers a wide range of possible applications. It could be used to make circuits that can be twisted and stretched – ideal for artificial skin on prosthetics or robotic machines. It could also be integrated into fabric and used in connected clothing. And because it follows the shape and movements of the human body, it could be used for sensors designed to monitor particular biological functions.\n“We can come up with all sorts of uses, in forms that are complex, moving or that change over time,” said Hadrien Michaud, a PhD student at the Laboratory for Soft Bioelectronic Interfaces (LSBI) and one of the study authors.\nExtensive research has gone into developing an elastic electronic circuit. It is a real challenge, as the components traditionally used to make circuits are rigid. Applying liquid metal to a thin film in polymer supports with elastic properties naturally seems like a promising approach.\nThin and reliable\nOwing to the high surface tension of some of these liquid metals, experiments conducted so far have only produced relatively thick structures. “Using the deposition and structuring methods that we developed, it’s possible to make tracks that are very narrow – several hundredths of a nanometer thick – and very reliable,” said Stéphanie Lacour, holder of the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Neuroprosthetic Technology and who runs the lab.\nApart from their unique fabrication technique, the researchers’ secret lies in the choice of ingredients, an alloy of gold and gallium. “Not only does gallium possess good electrical properties, but it also has a low melting point, around 30o,” said Arthur Hirsch, a PhD student at LSBI and co-author of the study. “So it melts in your hand, and, thanks to the process known as supercooling, it remains liquid at room temperature, even lower.” The layer of gold ensures the gallium remains homogeneous, preventing it from separating into droplets when it comes into contact with the polymer, which would ruin its conductivity.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed conductive tracks that can be bent and stretched up to four times their original length.

{"id": 576, "text": "The chance to program and create video games on the Nintendo DS – a dream opportunity for many a student at EPFL! This is now a reality, thanks to Professor David Atienza. Since February, future electrical engineering graduates can follow a course that consists of developing a game called “Tetris” on the well-known portable console, and then to use the knowledge acquired to create other video games.\n At the beginning of the course, the students receive a “kit”, including a Nintendo DS and a graphical interface, together with a compiler and a Nintendo DS simulator. They are also provided with a memory card, on which they can load applications designed especially for them, using a small Nintendo DS cartridge. It’s on this memory card – which can be inserted either in a portable computer or in the mini-console – that they program the video games. Their objective is to develop a system capable of controlling the Nintendo DS hardware, consisting of the various keys and the touch-screen. There is also a creative aspect to the work, as the students also have to design graphics, create animations and come up with some music to accompany the game.\n Although the “mission” seems to be rather recreational, the course has a very specific goal – to bring genuine added-value to the studies of these third-year electrical engineers. “When they begin the course, the students already have a very good individual understanding of how to create various components and electrical devices, like circuits. Now they have to learn how to combine them, in order to develop a system in its entirety”, explains David Atienza. \n“A tangible result”\nThe course has become very popular, and has aroused the passions of many students. Professor Atienza has even agreed to take some students from the School of Computer and Communication Sciences who asked if it would be possible to follow the studies, without being officially enrolled. Although they obtain no credits, they are able to refine their expertise in programming. As a result, the enthusiasm in the classroom is almost palpable.\n “It’s very interesting to create something tangible and to be able to program on a console that everybody knows”, comments Chloé Weber, one of the students sitting on the front row. “That’s exactly why I chose to study electrical engineering – to understand the functioning of devices we use every day.” Chloé’s view is echoed by her fellow student Paul Ferranet, who is studying electronics: “I never did anything like this before. The course enables us to understand systems in their entirety, and to focus on all their elements. Even though we don’t understand everything, and there is a lot of programming, it’s captivating.”\nA competition to elect the best game\nThe complexity of the task to be performed doesn’t, however, prevent the students from being ambitious. “They have lots of ideas. For example, one group would like to develop a car-race game for several players, so we provided them with a Bluetooth card, which will allow them to connect several Nintendo DS consoles together”, enthuses the professor. “Others are planning to develop a planner, or even an interface enabling a connection to Facebook via the console.”\n Encouraged by this profusion of ideas, David Atienza has decided to mark the end of the course in style. In June, he will organize a competition to reward the student who has created the best game. “Nice graphics are not enough, however – the students have to use all the functionalities of the console.

{"id": 580, "text": "The smartwatch market is booming. According to the International Data Corporation,* nearly 50 million smartwatches were sold worldwide in 2016, and this number is expected to grow to 150 million by 2021. The ever-growing range of features – such as a step counter, altimeter and GPS – requires sensors with varying energy needs. The most power-hungry function – the heart-rate monitor – devours almost 80% of battery power.\nBut a new generation of sensors developed by ActLight, a startup based in EPFL Innovation Park, can measure the wearer's pulse with the same precision while consuming only one-fifth of the energy. These sensors have been tested by Maher Kayal’s laboratory as part of a CTI (Commission for Technology and Innovation) project and are now ready to be used in smartwatches. “The longer battery life certainly makes things easier for the user, but it also offers major savings in terms of electricity consumption,” said Kayal. Thanks to this breakthrough, ActLight was named one of the best Swiss cleantech startups in 2015.\nTime as a signal\nThe secret behind the energy-saving sensors lies in signal processing. In order to grasp how the company’s unique ‘dynamic photodiode’ sensor works, we must first understand how sensors in most smartwatches currently work: Two diodes located on the back of the device – nestled against the wrist – emit light that penetrates the upper layers of the skin, and blood flow determines how much light is reflected back. A sensor placed between the diodes detects these light waves and transforms the information into electrical current, which is then translated into the pulse displayed on the watch.\nInstead of converting the light into a current and then measuring the current’s amplitude, ActLight’s dynamic photodiode sensors turn the current into time. The sensors use the pulse of light to identify the moment at which the current is triggered. The result is a small reduction in energy consumption with every heartbeat, but repeated more than 50,000 times per day it adds up to considerable energy savings.\nActLight is in talks with major semiconductor makers and is about to sell the rights to mass produce its innovative sensors. The new sensors are also attractive in terms of cost savings: “They are less expensive to produce because they do not require as much silicon for the same level of manufacturing,” said Sergei Okhonin, the company’s CEO. Numerous other applications are also being targeted, such as gesture control for video gamers.\n*\n A US company that conducts market studies in information and communication technology and consumer electronics.", "summary": "Nearly 80% of the battery power in smartwatches is used up by the heart-rate monitor.

{"id": 583, "text": "The coronavirus crisis, like all other extreme and painful experiences, offers some important lessons. Valentin Bourdon, who studied at the École de Marne-la-Vallée in Paris, is in the last year of his PhD in architecture at EPFL. He considers it obvious that architects have much to learn from the current situation, in which more than one-third of the world’s population is forced to spend most of their time inside their homes. Of particular interest to Bourdon is the bearing that architecture and urban planning have on how and where social interactions take place in urban areas. In his thesis on architecture theory, he aims to provide architects with the tools they need to bring the concepts of community and shared living spaces into their work. These concerns have become essential as both lifestyles and environmental challenges evolve. We spoke with Bourdon, who offers interesting insights into the current crisis.\nWhat does this crisis reveal about our relationship to living space? \n This lockdown took millions of people by surprise. It has made us all aware of the essential role of housing – and the inequalities that it reflects – in the urban framework. Because of this crisis, we are rediscovering what we own as well as what we forgo when we lose access to outside amenities such as parks, cafés and cultural and sporting facilities. These shared resources are so important to people who live in small spaces and close quarters with limited views. And owing to population density, city dwellers are more directly exposed to the risk of contamination than people who live, or have secondary residences, in more remote areas. From a practical standpoint, our restricted movement also shows that most modern housing is not designed for multiple uses. This becomes clear when work invades our domestic space, for example.\nWhat lessons can architects draw from these unprecedented times?\n The explosion in working from home may force architects to broaden the concept of living space. By living in confinement, we have learned that our homes should perhaps be more versatile. Of course, in view of the costs involved, making such a change is not just a question of architecture. That said, at a time of fast growth in working from home, co-working, the digital economy and new forms of local manufacturing and craftwork, architects have an opportunity to contribute to the conversation. Even the sharp rise in online shopping, which is being further fueled by the current crisis, points to the need to shift the focus back to our living space. That’s now where we shop, work, socialize, exercise and study; but there’s also an aspect of social responsibility, since it's never been so easy to save lives by simply staying home. A fully multipurpose and versatile home also has its limits, however, such as how far we can go before losing our bearings. I think that having so many concomitant uses and their symbolic impact should lead architects to recognize the need to preserve certain distinctions and familiar features in the home. How can we enhance our homes without making them less hospitable? That may be the crux of the matter.\nHave you seen any positive lessons emerge? \n I don’t think this crisis has created a new situation in terms of housing. What it’s doing is underscoring our fundamental needs and further accelerating a number of increasingly prevalent trends, such as working remotely, online shopping and online learning. I’m not sure whether abetting these trends is a truly positive consequence, but there’s no doubt that we’re living through a compressed and consequential period that will have deep implications for our living spaces. In these challenging times, being confined at home also reminds us of what cities are made of – collective sites and public spaces. Forgoing them makes us see their true value and want to take better care of them. What I also find striking is that, in their absence, we turn to our neighbors for social interaction. Our windows and balconies have become interfaces with other people and a vehicle of collective expression, as we share news with our neighbors and applaud our caregivers. Neighborly initiatives, such as running errands for the elderly in your building, are a part of this too. We are seeing a rise in cooperative actions close to home.\nShould we nurture neighborliness?\n We know that when it comes to sustainability, much can be done within the scope of apartment buildings. This can range from neighbors sharing certain resources – like solar panels – to sharing spaces – such as bike storage areas, party rooms, sports rooms, laundry rooms, gardens and terraces, and even craft workshops, reading rooms and guest rooms. This is what the new generation of cooperative housing is looking to do in Switzerland, where it is particularly active. So in my view, the current lockdown shows that we would do well to focus more on the quality of our living space and the importance of community. In so doing, we can help ensure that the physical aspects of our changing lifestyles will continue to strengthen the link between cities and living spaces – a link that we are now seeing as essential. \nThe neighborhood is growing in value during this crisis. © Valentin Bourdon / EPFL", "summary": "The global lockdown caused by the coronavirus has brought the shortcomings and social inequality inherent in modern housing into stark relief.

{"id": 584, "text": "Could it be possible one day to do a complete checkup without a doctor's visit? EPFL's latest discovery is headed in that direction. Professor Hatice Altug and postoctoral fellow Arif Cetin, in collaboration with Prof. Aydogan Ozcan from UCLA, have developed an \"optical lab on a chip.\" Compact and inexpensive, it could offer to quickly analyze up to 170,000 different molecules in a blood sample. This method could simultaneously identify insulin levels, cancer and Alzheimer markers, or even certain viruses. \"We were looking to build an interface similar to a car's dashboard, which is able to indicate gas and oil levels as well as let you know if your headlights are on or if your engine is working correctly,\" explains Altug.\nInstead of analyzing the biosample by looking at the spectral properties of the sensing platforms as has traditionally been the case, this new technique uses changes in the intensity of the light to do on-chip imaging, allowing to dispense with the clunky spectrometers in the process.\nA precision down to a couple nanometers\n Only 7.5 cm high and weighing 60 grams, the device is able to detect viruses and single layer proteins down to 3 nanometers thick. Detailed in a publication in Nature Light Science & Application, the recipe is simple and contains few ingredients: an off the shelf CMOS chip, a light-emitting diode (LED) and a 10 by 10 millimeter gold plate pierced with arrays of extremely small holes less than 200 nanometer wide.\nNanoholes on the gold substrates are compartmented into arrays of different sections, where each section functions as an independent sensor. Sensors are coated with special biofilms that are specifically attracting targeted proteins. Consequently, multiple different proteins in the biosamples could be captured at different places on the platform and monitored simultaneously.\nLight intensity is carefully screened\n The diode then allows for detection of the trapped proteins almost immediately. The light shines on the platform, passes through the nano-openings and its properties are recorded onto the CMOS chip. Since light going through the nanoscaled holes changes its properties depending on the presence of biomolecules, it is possible to easily deduce the number of particles trapped on the sensors.\nLaboratories normally observe the difference between the original wavelength and the resulting one, but this requires using bulky spectrometers. Hatice Altug's ingenuity consists in choosing to ignore the light's wavelength, or spectrum, and focus on changes in the light's intensity instead. This method is possible by tuning into the \"surface plasmonic resonance\" - the collective oscillation of electrons when in contact with light. And this oscillation is very different depending on the presence or absence of a particular protein. Then, the CMOS chip only needs to record the intensity of the oscillation.\nA highly adaptable device\n The size, price and efficiency of this new multi-analyze device make it a highly promising invention for a multiplicity of uses. \"Recent studies have shown that certain illness like cancer or Alzheimer's are better diagnosed and false positive results avoided when several parameters can be analyzed at once,\" says Hatice Altug. \"Moreover, it is possible to remove the substrate and then replace it with another one, allowing to be adapted for a wide range of biomedical and environmental research requiring monitoring of biomolecules, chemicals and bioparticles.\" The research team foresees collaborating with local hospitals in the near future to find the best way to use this new technology.\nLink to article:", "summary": "About the size of a stapler, this new handheld device developed at EFPL is able to test a large number of proteins in our body all at once-a subtle combination of optical science and engineering.", "claim": "About the size of a stapler, this new handheld device developed at EFPL is able to test a large number of proteins in my body all at once-a subtle combination of optical science and engineering.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [24, 24], "noise": false}
{"id": 585, "text": "Chronic stress can be a major cause of depression. The exact mechanism of how that works isn’t clear, but the missing link could be found in the metabolic processes of brain cells. Recent studies have shown that stress depletes the brain’s energy reserves – paving the way for depression to take hold. That implies the disorder could be treated by reversing the process and stimulating the brain’s metabolism. Neurobiologists at EPFL tested this theory on lab mice, and found that giving stressed mice a supplement containing acetyl-L-carnitine – a compound known to stimulate cellular metabolism – reduces the symptoms of depression. The scientists’ findings have just been published in in \neLife\n.\nAcetyl-L-carnitine is naturally found in our bodies and can be purchased as a food supplement. It stimulates the activity of mitochondria, which are our cells’ powerhouses.\nThe researchers administered this compound to mice and then measured their resistance to stress. They found that acetyl-L-carnitine reduces the likelihood that mice will exhibit depressive behaviors. Using spectroscopy, the scientists observed that acetyl-L-carnitine stimulates cellular metabolism in a specific area of the brain – the nucleus accumbens – which plays an important role in reward, effort and motivation systems.\nHigh-rank mice more likely to get depressed \nThe researchers performed their experiment on groups of four mice ranging from high social rank to low social rank. They exposed the mice to stress conditions and found that only the high-rank mice showed depressive symptoms.\n“High-rank mice are accustomed to being in control of a situation. But under our stress protocol – where they were physically constrained – they found themselves completely powerless,” says Carmen Sandi, the study’s lead author and head of EPFL’s Behavioral Genetics Laboratory.\nThe researchers used standard behavioral tests, based on sociability and decision-making capabilities, to assess the degree of depression in mice that had and had not been administered acetyl-L-carnitine.\nNext step – testing the findings on humans \nSandi notes that the role that mitochondria and metabolism play in depression is just starting to be explored. She points to a recent study carried out at The Rockefeller University which found that patients suffering from multi-resistant depression have very low blood levels of acetyl-L-carnitine.\n“Our brain makes up just 2% of our body mass but accounts for 20% of the energy we burn, so it’s not surprising that stress affects our metabolism,” says Sandi. “Our brains’ plasticity is highly solicited when we’re in stressful situations, which means that giving a boost to brain-cell mitochondria could help them maintain energy levels and therefore stave off depression.”\nSandi’s research indicates that acetyl-L-carnitine can affect both cellular functioning and behavior. She now plans to conduct similar tests on humans. “We will soon apply for funding to carry out a study on human patients,” she says.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have discovered a compound that stimulates brain-cell metabolism and reduces signs of depression in mice.

{"id": 586, "text": "Duchenne is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy. Because of this genetic disease, one out of every 3,500 children spends their 12th birthday in a wheelchair. This disorder progressively leads to general paralysis, and most patients die of respiratory failure. The disease is caused by a genetic mutation that prevents a protein required to keep muscle cells intact from being produced. While most research focuses on repairing the defective gene, researchers at EPFL have come up with a different strategy. As part of their work on nutrition and aging, they discovered that large doses of a vitamin called nicotinamide riboside were remarkably effective in countering the progress of the disease in animals. Their work has been published in \nScience Translational Medicine\n.\nPatients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy are unable to produce dystrophin. This protein is mainly responsible for connecting the various parts of muscle cells; without it, the cells cannot deform correctly. As a result, cell movement mechanically triggers an inflammatory response, which in turn gradually destroys the muscles.\nA highly damaging second cycle\nJohan Auwerx's team showed that the disease leads to a second cycle of events inside the cells, a series of reactions that exacerbate the disease's damaging effects.\nSeveral processes are at work in the second cycle. First, the 'primary' inflammation overactivates a certain gene, which then consumes a large quantity of an essential component called NAD+.\nThis causes a shortage of NAD+ within the cell. But this component acts as a fuel for the powerhouse of cells, the mitochondria, which are especially important in muscle tissue. The NAD+ deficiency therefore weakens the muscle, an effect similar to that of mitochondrial deficiency in older people.\nYet the consequences are even worse than they appear. Deprived of energy, the dysfunctional mitochondria aggravate the inflammation that causes muscle loss. So much for what could have initially appeared to be just a minor side effect of the disease.\nReversing course with a vitamin: nicotinamide riboside successfully tested on animals\nWhat if it were possible to reduce muscle inflammation - and thus muscle loss - by providing the worn-out mitochondria with fuel? That would mean administering nicotinamide riboside, the vitamin precursor of NAD+. This is the hypothesis that the researchers wanted to test after having already successfully investigated this vitamin's effect on muscle aging in their work on nutrition.\nThey tried out their approach on animals, using C. elegans worms and mice that had been genetically modified to develop the disease. The effect was remarkable. When large doses of nicotinamide riboside were administered, the worms did not develop any of the disease's symptoms. The mice presented much lower muscular inflammation, and existing lesions were attenuated.\n\"We have good reason to think that humans will also respond to this treatment and that we'll be able to reduce inflammation,\" said Auwerx, the lead author. \"But we don't know to what extent. It's important to remember that we're not going after the primary cause of the disease, dystrophin deficiency.\" Which means it is difficult to predict the treatment's effectiveness. \"Regardless, it would still be quite an accomplishment if we can prolong the patient's life by several years and increase their comfort.\"\nClinical tests may be possible within two years\nNicotinamide riboside is a vitamin precursor to NAD+. This molecule is commercially available and presents no known toxicity, even in high doses. The vitamin is water soluble, and any excess amount is evacuated in the urine.\nAccording to Auwerx, because nicotinamide riboside is readily available and harmless, clinical tests could be possible in the very near future, maybe within two years. \"We will need to test the doses,\" says the researcher. \"In the animals that we tested, the quantities were so large they could not be administered through diet. To see if our strategy works on humans, we will have to use massive doses of synthetic molecules.\"\nThe genetic mutation that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy was discovered 30 years ago. 2016 is thus an anniversary year, and it has already been marked by the FDA's recent approval of a promising treatment that partially corrects the defective gene in certain patients. \"My hope is that we will give people suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy a second reason to celebrate in 2016,\" says Auwerx.", "summary": "Researchers are working on a new strategy to combat one of the most severe forms of muscular dystrophy.

{"id": 587, "text": "It's no surprise that using human embryos for biological and medical research comes with many ethical concerns. Correct though it is to proceed with caution in these matters, the fact is that much science would benefit from being able to study human biology more accurately.\nOne solution lies with alternative tools – what scientists call \nin vitro\n models. But despite some advancements with adult tissues, when it comes to modelling the early developmental processes of the human embryo, things become complicated.\nNow, scientists at  have simulated aspects of embryo formation \nin vitro\n starting from embryonic stem cells. \"A tricky problem in reliably constructing tissues outside of an organism in general is how to present key signaling molecules, also termed morphogens, to the cells in culture at the right time and dose,\" says EPFL Professor Matthias Lütolf, whose  led the research. \"Simply exposing a collection of stem cells to a single concentration of a morphogen ends in uncontrolled morphogenesis because the cells lack important instructions.\"\nBut in a developing embryo, stem cells receive a highly dynamic range of morphogen concentrations from so-called “signaling centers”. It is this gradient of morphogens that tells stem cells what type of specialized cell and tissue to become.\nTo implement this principle, Dr Andrea Manfrin in Lütolf's lab developed a method for exposing human embryonic stem cells in culture to gradients of morphogens, mimicking the real-life conditions of gastrulation – an early stage of the developing embryo where its cells begin to transform into different cell types and tissues.\nThe method involves growing the stem cells in a microfluidic device, which is a chip with small channels that allow the precise control of tiny amounts of fluid. The researchers grew stem cells in a culture chamber on the microfluidic chip, and were able to expose them to carefully controlled concentration gradients of various morphogens.\nA microfluidic chip. Credit: Alain Herzog (EPFL)\nThe results were impressive: the cells developed and organized into domains of different cell types, depending on the concentration they were exposed to, like they do in the body. In fact, the scientists report that they were able to successfully mimic aspects of gastrulation, paving the way for growing specific human tissues in the lab in a more controlled manner.\n“We hypothesized that engineering an artificial signaling center \n‘ex vivo’\n could allow us to steer the self-organization of a stem cell population towards a desired outcome,” explains Manfrin. “This has obvious advantages for tissue and organ engineering.”\nThese advantages include new tools for drug testing and regenerative medicine. The new technique can also help scientists study processes related to developmental biology – like gastrulation – and could provide alternatives to animal experimentation in some areas of research.\n\"One of our long-term goals is to engineer organs for transplantation,\" says Lütolf, who is already working with groups at the  and elsewhere to generate miniaturized organs (‘’) from patient-derived cells. “We are still far from growing functional organs in a dish; but recent progress in stem cell biology and bioengineering make me optimistic that this can become a reality.

{"id": 590, "text": "In Medieval Europe, leprosy was a common disease. The specter of the leper remains firmly entrenched in our collective memory: a person wrapped in homespun cloth, announcing his presence in the streets by ringing a bell. The image is not unfounded. In certain areas it is estimated that nearly one in 30 people were infected with the disease.\n But at the turn of the 16th century, the disease abruptly receded over most of the continent. The event was both sudden and inexplicable. Perhaps the pathogen that causes leprosy had evolved into a less harmful form? To find out, an international team of biologists and archaeologists joined forces. They decoded the nearly complete genome from five strains of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium responsible for leprosy, which they collected and reproduced by digging up the remains of humans buried in medieval graves.\n Reconstructing the bacterial genomes was no easy task, as the material available—from the human remains—contained less than 0.1% of bacterial DNA. The researchers developed an extremely sensitive method for separating the two kinds of DNA and for reconstituting the target genome with an unprecedented level of precision. “We were able to reconstruct the genome without using any contemporary strains as a basis,” explains study co-author and EPFL scientist Pushpendra Singh, who worked closely with Johannes Kraus and team from Tubingen University in Germany.\nNatural selection in action\nThe results are indisputable: the genome of the medieval strains is almost exactly the same as that of contemporary strains, and its mode of action has not changed. “If the explanation of the drop in leprosy cases isn’t in the pathogen, then it must be in the host, that is, in us; so that’s where we need to look,” explains Stewart Cole, co-director of the study and the head of EFFL’s Global Health Institute.\n Many clues indicate that humans developed resistance to the disease. All the conditions were ripe for an intense process of natural selection: a very high prevalence of leprosy and the social isolation of diseased individuals. “In certain conditions, victims could simply be pressured not to procreate,” Cole says. “In addition, other studies have identified genetic causes that made most Europeans more resistant than the rest of the world population, which also lends credence to this hypothesis.”\nTracing the path of pathogens from Scandinavia to the Middle East\nOne interesting thing the researchers discovered was a medieval strain of Mycobacterium leprae in Sweden and the U.K. that is almost identical to the strain currently found in the Middle East. “We didn’t have the data to determine the direction in which the epidemic spread. The pathogen could have been carried to Palestine during the Crusades. But the process could have operated in the opposite direction, as well.”\n In addition to the historical significance of the research, the study in Science is important in that it improves our understanding of epidemics, as well as how the leprosy pathogen operates. Sequencing methods designed as part of this research are among the most precise ever developed, and could enable us to track down many other pathogens that are lurking in foreign DNA. In addition, the incredible resistance of Mycobacterium leprae’s genetic material – probably due to its thick cell walls – opens up the possibility of going even further back in history to uncover the origins of this disease that still affects more than 200,000 people worldwide each year.\nVerena J.

{"id": 601, "text": "In order for a protein to do its job in a cell, it must not only have the right chemical composition, but also the right shape. After the protein is manufactured, it undergoes a complex folding process. If the folding is faulty, the protein will be useless or even toxic to the cell. In an article appearing online October 17, 2010 in the journal Nature Chemical Biology, (EPFL) and Pierre Goloubinoff (University of Lausanne) announce the discovery that another protein, Hsp70, can unfold an incorrectly folded protein, giving it a chance to re-fold itself properly and assume its function within the cell.\nIt’s a kind of natural rehabilitation process for wayward proteins; and it’s one that works well in young tissues but much less effectively as the body ages.\nThis discovery has potential for clinical applications. In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis, proteins that have become toxic following a faulty folding process start accumulating in neurons. Other proteins, called “chaperones”, including Hsp70, roam the cell carrying out a kind of quality control. When they encounter toxic proteins, one of three things will happen: First, if the chaperones are unable to intervene, the cell will die; alternatively, enzymes will be unleashed to destroy the malformed proteins; and the final possibility is that Hsp70 will kick in and unfold the toxic proteins, giving them the opportunity to re-fold and get the cell back on track. Because this last solution consumes 1000 times less energy than destroying the proteins enzymatically, it is likely a much more effective option for the cell.\nThe researchers carried out experiments using luciferase, a protein that allows fireflies to emit light. If this protein is folded incorrectly, it won’t glow. To test if Hsp70 was able to restore normal protein function, they introduced Hsp70 and ATP (a cellular fuel) to a tube containing misfolded luciferase. The Hsp70 did its job; the light emitted was proof that the protein had unfolded and managed to refold again correctly.\nBecause high levels of Hsp70 in a cell can also be toxic, its task of unfolding and re-folding must be isolated and balanced with other cellular processes before it can be used clinically. According to de los Rios and Goloubinoff, it could be many years before this naturally occurring protein police could be used to treat patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease.", "summary": "The accumulation of toxic proteins in neurons has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Diseases and multiple sclerosis.

In fact, that’s the whole point: recreating a cellular microenvironment \nin vitro\n to study physiological functions or test the efficacy of particular molecules. For her Master’s project, 24-year-old bioengineering student Yara Proust spent several months immersed in this new and fascinating world.\n“I was interested in regenerative medicine,” she explains. “My initial plan was to go abroad. I sent off several unsolicited applications but got nowhere.” After turning to EPFL’s student support office, IS-Academia, for help, she secured three offers: one in Paris, one in Eindhoven, and one from a Bern-based startup. “I decided on Alveolix almost immediately. We exchanged a few emails and they invited me for a 90-minute interview. As soon as I walked through the door, it just felt right.”\nA smooth transition to working life\nProust has no regrets about her decision. Officially, Master’s projects should last between four and six months. But Proust spent a full nine months – September to May – at Alveolix, combining a paid internship with her Master’s project and postgraduate research. “The great thing about working at a startup is that it’s a happy medium between school and a job at a big firm. It eases the transition to working life.”\nProust spent all of her time doing research. She used the company’s ground-breaking solution to test how cell cultures react when exposed to air and respiratory movement. She also carried out other experiments, examining aspects such as toxicity and viability when the cells respond to different substances or are handled in a particular way. The firm’s lung-on-chip technology is designed primarily to assess the efficacy of certain drugs without the need for animal testing. In the longer term, patients’ own cells could be used to develop custom treatments.\n“It was an amazing learning experience,” says Proust. “I got the chance to do a lot of biology work. My studies are much more engineering-focused, so it was good to have that practice. I learned a lot about life as a researcher outside the lab too – analyzing data, attending conferences and weekly progress update meetings, and simply talking to my colleagues.” As well as enjoying her time at Alveolix, Proust worked hard. Her efforts paid off when she scooped up second prize for her poster and oral presentation at the 2019 ISAM Congress.\nA great place to work\nProust was lucky enough to work under a dedicated and attentive supervisor at the firm. But she relished the human side of the experience as well. “It’s a young, cosmopolitan team involved in an exciting new field,” says Proust. “It was a great place to work.” She also enjoyed her time in a new city. “I loved living in Bern!” she says enthusiastically. “It’s a compact city – everything’s on your doorstep and there’s lots to see and do. The people are really friendly, too.” Proust fully embraced life in Bern, living with Swiss-German housemates and taking a two-month intensive language course. “I’d definitely study Swiss German if I ever went back there,” she adds. Proust will graduate on 5 October, so she needs to figure out her next move quickly. With a minor in management, she may take some time to explore her options in that area – but not until after a hard-earned vacation.", "summary": "Summer series (2) – For her Master’s project, bioengineering student Yara Proust worked at a Bern-based startup specializing in organ-on-chip technology.

Four students have just started a company for their app called Apety, which is now available on the App Store.Their initial concept was simple: they were looking to make the most of their short lunch break and eat the dish of their choosing with friends. Based on their own experience, the friends thought how nice it would be if there were an app to do those things for them with just a few taps. \"Apety came out of our third-year project for Marc Gruber’s Social and Human Sciences (SHS) course on entrepreneurship in 2016. We designed a comprehensive business model using a made-up company,\" say Aurélien Soccard and Teo Stocco, two of the EPFL students who cofounded Apety. Their professor encouraged them to keep it at, sensing the project’s potential.\nValuing customers’ time\n And so they ran with it. The students turned their core concept into an app that serves as a link between customers and restaurants. Customers choose the sort of food they want, and the app gives them the name of a suitable restaurant nearby. They can reserve a table for a given time and number of people. Then all they have to do is invite their friends and arrive on time – and they’ll get served quickly. At the end of the meal, the bill is expertly handled by Apety, which offers an easy way to divvy the amount up among the guests. The app saves customers time, helps them discover new restaurants and ensures they can enjoy a leisurely meal.\nRaising the number of covers\n Restaurant owners just need to enter their restaurant’s particulars into the app, including their menu and any specials. The app attracts new clients and makes the reservation process smoother. In addition to helping increase the number of covers, it simplifies the payment process at the end of the meal. The restaurants are also able to learn more about their clientele through detailed statistics. In Geneva, where the friends started prospecting, around 40 restaurants have already signed on as well as 10 in Lausanne more recently. \"We tested the app for over two months in Geneva with a few restaurants before broadening our scope,\" says Stocco. The app works well, and their concept has earned them a number of recent plaudits. The students were awarded the “Young Entrepreneur Prize” by the French External Trade Advisers in Switzerland, along with a Microsoft Grant worth CHF 120,000. They are also supported by Genilem. Their company, now up and running, is listed on the commercial register.\nWhat does the future hold? \"Three of us are still studying at EPFL.

{"id": 606, "text": "Cement production is responsible for almost ten percent of human CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, it is one of the most sustainable construction materials. Now, an EPFL-led consortium has received backing from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) to speed up the development and testing of a new blend of low-carbon cement. Elaborated with partners from the Indian Institutes of Technology and from universities in Cuba and Brazil, this new blend substitutes up to half of the usual Portland cement used to make concrete with highly abundant clay and limestone, promising to reduce cement-related CO2 emissions by up to 40%. Applied globally, it could help bring down future global CO2 emissions by several percent.\nSubstituting a fraction of the Portland cement used to make concrete is a well-established way to cut emissions – understandably so, considering that the production of each ton of cement releases up to 800kg of CO2. However, alternative materials that allow substituting a large fraction of cement have been hard to find. Industrial waste products that are commonly used today – slag from the steel industry or fly ash from coal power plants are two examples – but are not available in large enough quantities to keep up with demand.\nSynergistic chemistry\nAs Karen Scrivener, the principle investigator of the project, explains, the strength of the combination of calcined clay and ground limestone, which the researchers call LC3 for Limestone Calcined clay Clinker Cement, lies in its chemistry. When used together, the aluminates from the calcined clay interact with the calcium carbonates from the limestone, leading to a less porous, and therefore stronger, cement paste. While in the past, these materials have been used individually to replace a small fraction of the cement, together, they can replace up to half without altering the performance of the final product.\nThanks to partnerships with industrial and governmental partners, the researchers hope to see LC3 become the new gold standard of low-carbon cement, produced by all major cement companies. Two industrial scale pilot projects in India and Cuba have already emphatically demonstrated the robustness of their method and the ease with which it can be integrated into existing cement production lines. In the next phase of the project, larger-scale production tests are scheduled with industrial partners.\nLC3 is designed to meet the needs of both industry and users. It was developed in close collaboration with industrial partners and designed to integrate into existing cement production lines. Clay and limestone are available en masse in quarries around the world. And consumers will be able to use it the same way they use ordinary Portland cement today.\nTime is of the essence\nTime is of the essence, according to Karen Scrivener, who heads EPFL’s Construction Materials Laboratory. With global demand for cement to double by 2050, driven by growing demand in emerging economies, such as India, China, and Brazil, the need for low-carbon cement is becoming more and more pressing. The just over 4 million Swiss francs in funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation will enable EPFL and its partners to do the necessary research and testing for the introduction and standardization of LC3, so that it makes it to the market as quickly as possible. “If we want to have a real impact on the sustainability of concrete – its cost, its availability, and its environmental footprint – we have to act before demand explodes in the emerging and developing world.”\nThe SDC support comes through its Global Program on Climate Change (GPCC).", "summary": "An EPFL-led consortium is developing a new blend of cement that promises to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by up to 40%.

{"id": 607, "text": "Scientists from EPFL in Switzerland and Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Italy are developing technology for the blind that bypasses the eyeball entirely and sends messages to the brain. They do this by stimulating the optic nerve with a new type of intraneural electrode called OpticSELINE. Successfully tested in rabbits, they report their results in \nNature Biomedical Engineering\n.\n“We believe that intraneural stimulation can be a valuable solution for several neuroprosthetic devices for sensory and motor function restoration. The translational potentials of this approach are indeed extremely promising”, explains Silvestro Micera, EPFL’s Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Translational Neuroengineering, and Professor of Bioelectronics at Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, who continues .\nBlindness affects an estimated 39 million people in the world. Many factors can induce blindness, like genetics, retinal detachment, trauma, stroke in the visual cortex, glaucoma, cataract, inflammation or infection. Some blindness is temporary and can be treated medically. How do you help someone who is permanently blind?\nThe idea is to produce phosphenes, the sensation of seeing light in the form of white patterns, without seeing light directly. , a prosthetic device for helping the blind, suffer from exclusion criteria. For example, ½ million people worldwide are blind due to retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder, but only a few hundred patients qualify for retinal implants for clinical reasons. A brain implant that stimulates the visual cortex directly is another strategy albeit risky. A priori, the new intraneural solution minimizes exclusion criteria since the optic nerve and the pathway to the brain are often intact.\nPrevious attempts to stimulate the optic nerve in the 1990s provided inconclusive results. EPFL’s Medtronic Chair in Neuroengineering Diego Ghezzi explains, “Back then, they used cuff nerve electrodes. The problem is that these electrodes are rigid and they move around, so the electrical stimulation of the nerve fibers is unstable. The patients had a difficult time interpreting the stimulation, because they kept on seeing something different. Moreover, the cuff electrodes probably had limited selectivity because they recruited superficial fibers.”\nIntraneural electrodes may indeed be the answer for providing rich visual information to the subjects. They are also stable and less likely to move around once implanted in a subject, according to the scientists. Cuff electrodes are surgically placed around the nerve, whereas intraneural electrodes pierce through the nerve.\nTogether, Ghezzi, Micera and their teams engineered the OpticSELINE, an electrode array of 12 electrodes. In order to understand how effective these electrodes are at stimulating the various nerve fibers within the optic nerve, the scientists delivered electric current to the optic nerve via OpticSELINE and measured the brain’s activity in the visual cortex. They developed an elaborate algorithm to decode the cortical signals. They showed that each stimulating electrode induces a specific and unique pattern of cortical activation, suggesting that intraneural stimulation of the optic nerve is selective and informative.\nAs a preliminary study, the visual perception behind these cortical patterns remains unknown. Ghezzi continues, “For now, we know that intraneural stimulation has the potential to provide informative visual patterns. It will take feedback from patients in future clinical trials in order to fine-tune those patterns. From a purely technological perspective, we could do clinical trials tomorrow.”\nWith current electrode technology, a human OpticSELINE could consist of up to 48-60 electrodes. This limited number of electrodes is not sufficient to restore sight entirely. But these limited visual signals could be engineered to provide a visual aid for daily living.", "summary": "EPFL scientists are investigating new ways to provide visual signals to the blind by directly stimulating the optic nerve.

{"id": 609, "text": "In contrast to acquired immunity and its targeted, but slow, production of antibodies against specific pathogens, innate immunity reacts immediately: by means of special sensors the cell is able to check whether any DNA or RNA is in the wrong place. As this can be a sign of viral infection, the cell triggers an overall antiviral immune response. The medical researcher Andrea Ablasser has been investigating how such innate immune responses are controlled, and in doing so, has come upon a promising new therapeutic approach. On behalf of the Latsis Foundation, the Swiss National Science Foundation has awarded her the National Latsis Prize 2018 in recognition of her pioneering work. \nAblasser's research focuses on the so-called cGAS/STING signal pathway, which was only discovered ten years ago. This signal pathway, which is activated if DNA is present outside the cell nucleus, mainly boosts the production of inflammation signals, which in turn activate various immune cells that fight viruses. The signal pathway also plays a role in the immune response to tumour cells. Having already done research in this field as an undergraduate and later as a doctoral student, Ablasser was able to characterise an important transmitter substance in this chain of signals while working as a postdoc at the University of Bonn. \"It was during this period that I decided to devote myself entirely to basic research instead of doing clinical work, which would have been the obvious choice as I had studied medicine,\" says Ablasser. \nUnderstanding autoimmune diseases \nSince accepting the professorship at EPFL, Ablasser has mainly been investigating what happens when the cGAS/STING signal pathway is falsely activated, causing health problems. This always happens when the body's own DNA escapes from the nucleus of the cell due to stress, illness or cell ageing, and the DNA sensor mistakenly reacts. \"The clinical importance of this field has been one of the reasons for its rapid development,\" says Ablasser. She has devised experiments to find out how such an error by the cGAS/STING signal pathway can cause illnesses such as chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. \nHer ideas for new experiments often come from chance observations: \"If an experiment isn't going as you expected, it is often worth taking a closer look. You never know what you will find. But you also need to have a good team - one that can think on its feet.\"\nStart-up develops new active substance \nThe discovery that the cGAS signal pathway, if overactive, can cause chronic inflammation and other diseases prompted Ablasser to screen for a substance that inhibits this process. \"Such screenings are considered risky because they involve a lot of work, and there is no guarantee of getting useful results.\" But in this case she was lucky. Out of 60,000 molecules, she was able to filter out one small agent that very specifically inhibits a component of the cGAS/STING pathway. The therapeutic potential of this inhibitor now has to be tested in various disease models, and Ablasser recently co-founded a start-up company to do precisely that. \nIn her own work she wishes to focus more on basic research again. She is currently particularly interested in the link between cell ageing and innate immunity: \"My aim is to gain a better understanding of age-related diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis or the loss of blood-building stem cells.\" Because - as her research until now clearly shows - a fundamental understanding of cellular processes marks an important step in the development of successful new treatments. \nShort biography \n Andrea Ablasser was born in Bad Friedrichshall in 1983. She finished her studies in human medicine at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich in 2008 and obtained a doctorate in clinical pharmacology at the same university in 2010. She continued her work on innate immunity at the Institute of clinical chemistry and pharmacology of the University of Bonn. In 2014, she was appointed as a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL. She has already received a number of prizes for her research work, most recently the 2018 Eppendorf Award for Young European Investigators. \n But work doesn't really feel like work to Ablasser. She considers it a privilege to be able to do research in a place like Lausanne. She lives in a small village not far from the town with her fiancé, the physics professor and Latsis laureate 2014, Tobias Kippenberg.

{"id": 610, "text": "The liver plays a vital role as a filter in the human body. But what happens when it malfunctions? A physicist from EPFL, a clinician from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and a biologist from the Vaud University Hospital Centre (CHUV) and the Universities of Lausanne (UNIL) teamed up to perform a detailed analysis of hepatic encephalopathy, a type of brain damage caused by chronic liver disease.\nFor the first time, the scientists observed how diseased mouse livers can cause molecular disturbances in the animals’ brains within two weeks, before any physical symptoms appear. They also discovered the previously unknown role of two particular molecules in the process. Their findings, published in the \nJournal of Hepatology\n, suggest that brain scans could help detect liver-related brain damage in humans before their health visibly deteriorates.\nExcess ammonium\nThe livers of adults suffering from a liver disease like cirrhosis no longer filter out numerous substances. The psychological, motor and neurocognitive disorders that may result, referred to as hepatic encephalopathy, present a wide range of symptoms, including coma. One substance known to play a role in hepatic encephalopathy is ammonium.\nFour weeks after the onset of liver disease (bottom), astrocytic cells (red) in the brains of diseased rats show altered morphology with shortening and reduction in the number of their extensions (scale bar: 25 μm). © Katarzyna Pierzchala et Dario Sessa\n“Ammonium is produced when proteins break down,” says Valérie McLin, a professor in the Department of Pediatrics, Gynecology and Obstetrics at UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and HUG. “Some of the ammonium goes to the brain, where it is transformed into glutamine and used to produce neurotransmitters. The rest is filtered by the liver and excreted in urine. When the liver malfunctions, too much ammonium goes to the brain. The resulting rise in glutamine production can trigger cerebral edema and, in some cases, hepatic encephalopathy.” That much is known, yet two key questions remained: Are any other molecules involved in hepatic encephalopathy? And how long does it take for a diseased liver to affect the brain?\nImpact much earlier than expected\nIn order to answer these questions, the researchers observed mice with chronic liver disease for eight weeks. “We monitored the animals individually,” says Cristina Cudalbu, a research physicist who manages the 9.4 Tesla MRI machine at the CIBM at EPFL. “Every two weeks, we analyzed them through high-resolution spectroscopy by placing them in a 9.4 Tesla high-magnetic-field MRI machine. This allowed us to track the molecular changes in their brains very precisely from the very onset of the liver disease. And we made some important discoveries!”\nThe scientists observed molecular changes in the mouse brains within two weeks, before the mice presented any symptoms. “Based on earlier studies, we thought it would take about six weeks for the animal’s health to start deteriorating,” says Cudalbu.\nExternal signs of the disease, such as jaundice, malnutrition and water in the stomach, appear between the fourth and eighth weeks. “It was at that point that we saw, in addition to the excess ammonium in the brain, a sudden drop in the level of two other molecules: vitamin C, an antioxidant, and creatine, a compound that, among other things, helps produce energy,” says Olivier Braissant, a professor in the Clinical Chemistry Department at the CHUV and the Faculty of Biology and Medicine at UNIL. This is the first time that researchers have visibly demonstrated the role these two molecules play in the disease. “They come in later, after the level of ammonium increases in the blood,” says Braissant.\nScanning the brain to detect liver disease?\nThese findings suggest that the neurological signs of chronic liver disease could be detected well before any symptoms appear by analyzing the brain through high-resolution spectroscopy. The researchers are also wondering whether doctors could prevent – or at least limit – liver-related brain damage in patients by prescribing supplements, or probiotics such as Vivomixx, to make up for the drop in creatine and vitamin C. “We’re currently conducting similar observations in humans to see whether the brain damage is similar to that in mice,” concludes McLin.\nBringing together the right skillset\nDrs. Cudalbu, Braissant and McLin work at three different research institutions, and their paths crossed thanks to an entirely different research project being carried out by Cudalbu at the CIBM’s EPFL site. “My work consists of developing new, higher-performance spectroscopy methods,” she says. While looking specifically at a method using Nitrogen-15, she unintentionally triggered the symptoms of liver disease. “Since the concentration of Nitrogen-15 is too low to detect in healthy mice, I injected them with ammonium chloride. And that worked in terms of spectroscopy – I was able to obtain a better resolution than we typically get with conventional methods. But the problem was the mice now had too much ammonium in their bodies. So I contacted Olivier Braissant, who is a specialist in this area, and Valérie McLin, who was working on clinical cases in humans,” says Cudalbu. Her development work could therefore be applied in biomedical research on hepatic encephalopathy.\nAbout the Center for Biomedical Imaging (CIBM)\nThe \n is a joint research platform run by EPFL, UNIL, UNIGE, HUG and the CHUV, with facilities on the EPFL, HUG and CHUV campuses. At EPFL, the CIBM has powerful magnets that can create high-resolution magnetic fields reaching not just 9.4 Tesla but also 14 Tesla – in 2007 the CIBM became the world’s first lab to achieve such a high magnetism. The maximum level currently used for clinical medical imaging is 7 Tesla. “The higher the magnetic field, the better the resolution of MRI scans,” says Cudalbu. “With these new methods we hope to be able to detect metabolic changes in patients at an early stage and with a high level of precision.” The methods being developed at the CIBM will help doctors deliver early diagnoses and provide longitudinal, life-long care. This represents a major step forward for personalized medicine.\nThe CIBM was created thanks in part to the generous support of the Leenaards Foundation and the Louis-Jeantet Foundation.", "summary": "Scientists have demonstrated how chronic liver diseases cause molecular changes in the brain.

{"id": 614, "text": "February the 8th at 1:45 p.m., the nuclear reactor at Mühleberg automatically stopped upon detection of an anomaly. Although not frequent, such events are not exceptional. Gaëtan Girardin, a researcher in nuclear engineering and head of the Crocus reactor at EPFL, will participate on February 22nd in “Science! On tourne”—a series of public dialogues about science. The first lecture is entitled \"One Year Later: has Fukushima really changed the game?\" He provides us with some techniques to better understand the operation of nuclear plants and, more particularly, the shutdown procedure that was made impossible in Japan.\nAfter Fukushima, people have realized that shutting down a nuclear reactor is not as simple as turning out the lights. Things are a little more complex.\nGaëtan Girardin: That is correct; we need to stop a chain reaction. A nuclear reactor is a tank filled with metal bars about the diameter of a pen that contain uranium. This is the nuclear fuel itself. As it decays, the uranium nucleus releases neutrons, which will collide with its neighbors, and so on ... The heat produced by the fission reactions will be used to produce steam, which then turn an electric turbine. This is common to all power plants. To stop the reactor, that is to say to stop the chain reaction, we must act on the production of neutrons, or capture them.\nSpecifically, how does one proceed?\nBetween the fuel rods, or sometimes in place of some of them, we introduce bars called \"control rods\". In Mühleberg, for example, there are ceramic rods inside metal sheaths, which have the property of absorbing neutrons. In other reactors, the system may vary. But the principle remains the same whatever the technology.\nIn Fukushima, the reaction had yet been properly stopped... \nAnd this is not sufficient. We know that once the chain reaction stopped, a reactor still produces about 7% of its operating energy as heat. This may seem trivial, but if you consider the power of a nuclear facility, and the fact that the whole is confined in a small space, there is the potential to seriously damage the materials. We must understand one thing: the heat does not magically disappear. Just as when you turn off an electric stovetop, its temperature does not drop instantly to 20 degrees. We therefore use a water circuit to cool the reactor, especially after it has been stopped. If this is not done correctly, there is a danger that the materials melt: first the fuel rods, then the tank and, finally the concrete containment unit. That is precisely what happened at Fukushima. Following the earthquake, the reactors were shut down correctly, but the tsunami flooded the cooling system and this led to a core meltdown.\nAt Mühleberg, it was a simple routine check which caused the shutdown.\nIt appears that the technicians on duty conducted a water test in the wrong place, compared to what was originally planned. I do not know the details of this incident. Maybe this caused a slight change in flow or pressure in one part of the water cooling supply circuits. Whatever the reason, an anomaly was detected by the monitoring system and the reactor was automatically switched off. This is a normal procedure in such circumstances.\nUnder what circumstances are these systems programmed to shut down?\nA reactor is equipped with many security systems that monitor the vital parts of the machine. There are sensitive points, such as the fuel temperature or the flow of water in the cooling circuit. Any damage, however minor, will be detected and analyzed by security systems, and cause a reactor to shut down. It is absolutely essential.\nThis is not the first time a reactor is shut down automatically. The same phenomenon is quite common.\nWe should not exaggerate either. The last time in Mühleberg was in 2007—this does not happen every day. In 2011, none of our five reactors were automatically interrupted by the operating system. What strikes me is that these cases are perceived as a problem.

{"id": 615, "text": "More than 120 years after X-ray technology was invented by Wilhelm Röntgen, medical radiography remains beyond the reach of two-thirds of the world's population. Yet it is an essential tool for diagnosing such things as car-accident injuries and infectious diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia – the latter of which accounts for 20% of infant mortality. Developing countries in particular are unable to afford the high purchase and maintenance costs of X-ray equipment. What’s more, this equipment is ill-suited for operating environments marked by high temperatures and humidity levels and frequent power outages.\nGlobalDiagnostiX aims to overcome these obstacles. The project was launched in 2012 as part of the EssentialTech program at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, and brings together a large number of European and African universities and university hospitals. The result of their joint effort was unveiled on Monday in Yverdon-les-Bains, in Vaud Canton, before a small group of guests that included Federal Councillor Johann N. Schneider-Ammann, who heads Switzerland’s Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research.\nA whole set of tailor-made solutions\nThe GlobalDiagnostiX X-ray system boasts an impressive array of innovations that were developed at EPFL in conjunction with the Universities of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland (HES-SO). It was designed to stand up to demanding climate conditions without compromising on the quality of the X-ray images, and it offers a simple and intuitive interface.\nThe project engineers were guided by two principles – simplicity and robustness – to ensure the system could be maintained by relatively unskilled workers. The team also aimed at keeping the manufacturing and operating costs very low. “Even small hospitals – including in industrialized countries – will be able to afford this sophisticated X-ray equipment,” says Klaus Schönenberger, who runs the EssentialTech program. \"Several teams of engineers, designers and medical radiology technicians of the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts collaborated to realize this high-tech prototype\" says Olivier Naef, Head of the HES-SO Faculty of Engineering and Architecture .\nFirst sales in 2020\nWith the research and development phase now complete, local startup Pristem SA will be in charge of manufacturing and marketing the machine. In August, this EPFL spin-off announced that it had raised 14 million francs in funding from a group of Swiss and African investors. “We’re now prepared to tackle the challenges of this global, highly diversified market by combining Switzerland’s time-tested manufacturing expertise with cutting-edge digital technology,” says Bertrand Klaiber, Pristem’s CEO, who expects to deliver the first machines already in late 2020.\nIn his remarks, Schneider-Ammann underscored the “excellent synergies between EPFL and the other specialized universities.

{"id": 618, "text": "In an unprecedented move, the European Space Agency (ESA) has selected a startup to lead a consortium and execute a landmark Active Debris Removal (ADR) mission under the recently introduced Space Safety Programme. EPFL spin-off ClearSpace will head the ADRIOS activity, developing technologies to capture and de-orbit space debris. The ClearSpace-1 mission will involve recovering a now-obsolete Vespa Upper Part, a payload adapter that once formed part of the Agency’s Vega payload rocket.\nThe ClearSpace-led consortium was selected out of 13 European and Canadian consortia that included the leading names in the Space and Avionics industry. Eight ESA member states have pledged funding for the ClearSpace-1 mission, and the budget was approved at the Space19+ Ministerial meeting in Seville, Spain, in late November. Work is set to begin in early 2020. The removal of the VESPA adapter is planned for 2025.\nSpace is becoming increasingly cluttered with debris. In addition to the 2,000 working satellites currently orbiting our planet, there are over 3,000 abandoned ones. ESA estimates that currently there are more than 34’000 objects of 10 cm and more and this number is rapidly increasing. All this junk is causing a major risk to spaceflight. When disused satellites wear down, explode or collide with other objects, they break up into smaller pieces of all shapes and sizes, many of which measure less than 10 cm across and are undetectable from Earth.\nThe right time to act\nThese fast-moving projectiles hurtle around the planet at 28,000 km/h, posing a clear and present danger to spacecraft and crew. Depending on their distance and trajectory, it can take centuries for these objects to de-orbit on their own (if at all). And with plans to launch thousands of satellites into Space in the next five years – most forming part of network constellations – finding new ways to clear obsolete objects and defective satellites from orbit has never been so urgent.\nSome 40% of modern-day mobile applications rely on satellites and Space infrastructure is a critical component of industries ranging from TV and telecommunications to logistics and Earth observation. The time to act is now.\nESA’s groundbreaking endeavour – to capture and recover one of its own disused satellites – is a first. It is a precedent-setting mission that will pave the way for other, similar missions in the future, laying the foundation for sustainable business models targeting the decluttering and responsible development of Space.\n10 years of experience in space debris\nSince 2010, researchers at EPFL’s Space Center (eSpace) have been hard at work on new space debris rendezvous-and-capture systems as part of the CleanSpace One project. In early 2018, they founded ClearSpace to pick up where the project left off – and turn the idea into a viable, sustainable business model.\nThe startup’s first debris-clearing space robot was designed to de-orbit SwissCube, a Cubesat-type nano-satellite launched into orbit by EPFL and its partners in 2009. The company will now repurpose its space robot to capture a new target: the Vespa Upper Part. This cone-shaped object, weighing 120 kg and measuring 1.8 m by 2 m, was part of an ESA Vega rocket launched in 2013 and designed to place several satellites into orbit.\nEight ESA member states, including Switzerland, will together contribute €86 million to the ADRIOS programme.

{"id": 620, "text": "Urban planners must take a myriad of different objectives into account when designing development programs. These can include optimizing a neighborhood’s built density, preserving old monuments and buildings, using renewable energy, cutting CO\n2\n emissions and minimizing costs – to name a few. These objectives are often contradictory and hard to quantify, and sometimes not fully understood.\nBut Sébastien Cajot and Nils Schüler – two researchers in EPFL’s School of Engineering  headed by Professor François Maréchal – have developed a novel approach to urban planning, called SAGESSE, and an associated software program to help urban planners out.\nAvailable as a , their program lets planners enter the criteria important to them and get a rapid overview of the different variants possible. Cajot and Schüler worked with the Canton of Geneva to develop their software, testing it out on the Cherpines and Palettes neighborhoods. The researchers’ findings appear in \n.\nEach horizontal line represents a variant, clearly indicating the variant’s score on different criteria such as total cost, built density and use of renewable energy.\nAn inverted approach\n“For us, the current approach to urban planning gets things backwards. Planners typically outline four or five possible variants for a given neighborhood and then model them to quantify the impact of each,” says Cajot, who just completed his thesis on this topic. However, urban planning requires coordinating the interests of many different stakeholders – such as property developers, city residents, energy planning officials and local representatives – who often have conflicting goals.\n“For any one goal, there could be millions of possible variants to achieve it,” says Cajot. For instance, the aim of cutting CO\n2\n emissions can be reached by renovating a city’s building facades, installing district heating or replacing old boilers. But the methods currently available for assessing the impact of each option are limited – making it hard for urban planners to take well-informed decisions.\nFirst the values, then the variants \n“Urban planners should start not by asking whether they should build a high-rise building, for example, but by establishing the main goals they want to achieve, such as optimizing a city’s density, improving its quality of life or managing development costs. Our software enables them to start from this basis and come up with the best variants,” says Cajot. The program generates simple diagrams depicting the variants as horizontal lines plotted against vertical axes, where each axis is an urban development objective. The diagram could reveal, for example, that a variant meeting specific cost and built-density targets does not comply with renewable-energy-use regulations or blocks the view from other buildings. In this way, urban planners can adjust their targets and objectives and eventually find a variant acceptable to everyone.\nPilot tests in Geneva\nThe researchers initially tested their software on the development of the new Cherpines neighborhood, near Geneva. Then they tested it out on the existing Geneva neighborhood of Palettes, to see how it could help improve already built-up areas. They worked with local officials to determine what the urban-development priorities were. “They wanted to focus on increasing urban density, cutting CO\n2\n emissions and protecting the local heritage,” says Cajot. The researchers also factored legal requirements into their software, and designed it to be compatible with existing zoning documents, like master plans. Their software uses algorithms to weigh these various elements and calculate an array of urban planning options.\nIn the medium-term, the researchers plan to launch a startup to market their urban planning software and approach. And the IPESE Group is looking into applying the technology in other fields, such as helping to implement Switzerland’s energy strategy, planning out renewable-energy use and determining optimal biomass conversion processes.\nContacts:\nProf. François Maréchal, Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering Group:\nSébastien Cajot, doctoral student:\nNils Schüler, doctoral student:", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a web-based software program that takes a whole new approach to urban planning.

The company plans to use the money, secured from Swisscanto Invest, Swisscom Ventures and CNB, to scale up the production and marketing of its components, some of which went into orbit several months ago.\nMetal-coated 3D-printed components\nData-transfer needs, driven by TVs, telephones, surveillance, GPS and the internet, are growing non-stop. This requires ever more satellite bandwidth, and thus increasingly high wave frequencies – the microwave threshold was crossed several years ago. Yet the higher the frequency the more difficult it is to control, and this is where the quality and shape of antennas play a crucial role. SWISSto12 uses a patented process to manufacture metal-plated 3D-printed components. Behind their brightly colored veneer lies a complex maze of tiny conduits, each custom-built for a specific application. The firm’s antennas are ten times lighter than their all-metal equivalents – a significant difference in an industry where every gram saved translates into lower cost.\n“We may be a new player on the scene, but we’ve already attracted the attention of major names in the satellite and aerospace industries,” says CEO Emile de Rijk, whose PhD thesis led to the spin-off. “Our partners include Airbus Defense and Space, Thales Alenia Space, Cobham Advanced Electronic Solutions and the European Space Agency.” SWISSto12’s technology could also change the way miniature satellites and constellations, two fast-growing market segments, and the antennas fitted to airplane fuselages are designed and manufactured.\nExpanding operations in the US and Israel \n“This investment will allow us to take our business to the next level,” adds de Rijk.

{"id": 626, "text": "The current record for a bicycle travelling across flat road is 133.78 km/h, set in 2012 by a Dutch team at the World Human Powered Speed Challenge, which takes place every year in the Nevada desert. But this September, a team from IUT Annecy aims to beat that record. The team used artificial-intelligence-based software developed by Neural Concept, an EPFL startup, to boost the performance of its bike. In just a few minutes, Neural Concept’s technology can calculate the optimal shape of a bike to make it as aerodynamic as possible. It can also be used for aerodynamics calculations in a number of other applications. The company is presenting its software in Stockholm today at the International Conference on Machine Learning.\nFrom the outside, the IUT Annecy team’s recumbent bike looks more like a tiny racecar than a human-powered bicycle. It was custom-made to fit closely to the cyclist’s body. During the Challenge, he will have to ride down a 200-meter stretch of straight, flat road as fast as possible, after a run-up of 8 km. The design objective clearly isn’t cyclist comfort, but making the most out of every inch of the vehicle.\nComing up with faster, more detailed and more effective designs\nExisting aerodynamic design methods require an enormous amount of computing power. Traditionally bicycle engineers think up different forms and then test them using computer simulation. But here, for the first time, engineers employed optimization software – rather than their own intuition – to define the recumbent bike fairing. The IUT Annecy team used Neural Concept’s software, specifying the bike’s maximum length and width and the space needed for the drivetrain and wheels. The program then sorted through all kinds of shapes, quickly comparing them in order to come up with the best one. For instance, the program helped the engineers determine the best location for the vehicle’s maximum width.\nTo develop the technology behind the software, researchers at EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory trained a convolutional neural network to calculate the aerodynamic properties of various forms represented by generic polygon meshes, which are collections of points used to generate 3D shapes. This type of artificial intelligence works by running through several layers, categorizing information from the simplest to the most complex. In the initial layers, the program identifies a shape’s contours; then it assigns the contours to an object and determines what category the object belongs to based on the expected outcome.\nEngineers can use the software to carry out detailed analyses of different designs more rapidly and with better accuracy. “Our program results in designs that are sometimes 5–20% more aerodynamic than conventional methods. But even more importantly, it can be used in certain situations that conventional methods can’t,” says Pierre Baqué, CEO of Neural Concept. Another benefit is that the software can compare designs without human bias. “The shapes used in training the program can be very different from the standard shapes for a given object. That gives it a great deal of flexibility,” adds Baqué.\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge is a competition involving bicycles designed by teams of university students. This year it will take place on 10–15 September, and many other teams will also be gunning for the record. The Challenge will be a real-world test for both the IUT Annecy team and Neural Concept’s machine-learning technology. The software has myriad other potential applications too, such as for designing drones, wind turbines and aircraft. Other industry professionals clearly see its potential – Baqué has been invited to speak at the world’s biggest machine learning conference today in Stockholm.

{"id": 632, "text": "Centrosomes are cell organelles that are best known for their involvement in cell division. Each centrosome is made up of two small tubes arranged perpendicular to each other, called the centrioles. In turn, each centriole is made up of nine sets of microtubules.\nWhen cell division begins, two centrosomes form at each pole of the cell and begin to assemble a spindle of fibers that will eventually split the cell’s genetic material (e.g. its chromosomes) in half, delivering a set to each of the two daughter cells.\nBut just as the North Pole differs from the South Pole, different regions of cells can have distinct features. This is called “cell polarity”, and it is essential in giving cells their unique identities. In developing embryos, for example, cell polarity ultimately dictates where the head of the organism will be located. This means that the cells of the early embryo divide asymmetrically, with certain proteins localized or produced unevenly inside them.\n“For my project, we’re looking at cell polarization, which is the first thing that allows single-cell embryos of \nC. elegans\n to turn into complete, functioning organisms. There are data showing that the centrosome is somehow involved in setting up a polarity axis,” says Sarah Herrman, referring to the direction along which a cell will polarize.\nTo do this, she is using the roundworm \nC. elegans\n as a model organism – a popular tool among biologists. “\nC. elegans\n is a hermaphrodite, which means that it produces both sperm and eggs,” she says. “Right after fertilization, it produces a symmetric one-cell embryo with all of its cell components spread evenly throughout.” But to produce an organism with different types of cells —nerves, gut cells, a germ line — the embryo needs an asymmetric layout. This changes is known as “symmetry breaking,” and is the focus of both fundamental and medical research.\n“We don’t know exactly what it is about the centrosome that makes it important for proper symmetry breaking, so that’s what my project is looking at,” says Herrman. More specifically, she is looking at the impact that centrosomes have on various proteins that play key roles in the polarization of many different cell types and organisms, including human beings. These proteins include a famous group of six “partitioning-defective” (PAR) proteins that are required for the first asymmetric cell division of the \nC. elegans\n zygote.\n“What I am doing is knocking down the function of different proteins in \nC. elegans\n and analyzing how this affects the worm’s centrosomes – and therefore the polarity that they normally control.” Herrman is performing these knock-downs with either of two methods: \nC. elegans\n worms with a genetic mutation that prevents proper protein function, or RNA interference (RNAi), a Nobel-winning technique that targets mRNAs for degradation by exploiting the cell’s natural gene-controlling machinery.\n“The mutants can be better because you really know that the gene is being knocked down,” says Herrman. But that doesn’t mean they are without limitations: “Some of the mutations are not compatible with adult life, so we can’t analyze their embryos.”\nRNAi offers a way to work around these cases by knocking down the expression of specific genes during oogenesis and spermatogenesis. This allows Herrman to observe the effect on the resulting embryo’s centrosomes and its ability to polarize. “However, with RNAi you don’t necessarily have a complete knock down, so the two approaches are complementary.”\nThe worm embryos are also tagged with fluorescent proteins that allow observation of cell polarization. “We attach fluorescent labels to PAR proteins as well as other proteins involved in cell polarization, which allows us to visualize the centrioles and the posterior PAR domain,” says Herrman, referring to one area of the polarizing \nC. elegans\n embryo. “We also use tags that allow us to see the cortical contractions across the surface of the cell that move proteins toward the anterior end.”\nSo what’s in the future for Sarah Herrman? “I want to go to med school,” she says. “Maybe there’s a chance I’ll get an MD PhD, but I am more interested in the clinical side. Still, I think that research is something that all doctors should do, because if you don’t understand the research being done in the medical field, then you won’t be as effective in your practice.”\n“I think it’s really important to do basic-biology research because it involves the fundamentals of all life,” she concludes. “It allows you to understand what’s going on normally in the cell and then from there you can develop applications more broadly.”\nSarah Herrman carried out her research as part of the , an annual program for international undergraduate students run by EPFL's School of Life Sciences.", "summary": "Summer Series: Sarah Herrman is visiting  from the University of California, Santa Cruz.

You could compare it to an elevator operating horizontally: the customer calls for it from a station thanks to a terminal or a smartphone app, steps in, chooses the destination on a touch screen... and can start reading the newspaper while the machine makes its way.\nThe Navia is fitted with laser telemetry, GPS, 3D cameras and sensors that detect the vehicle’s acceleration (accelerometers) and its rotation (gyroscopes) around all three axes (to and fro, side to side, up and down), enabling it to instantly calculate its position, route and distance traveled. It analyses all this information – location, route, and obstacles – in real time. Any perturbation on the way is dealt with by the on-board computer. The vehicle will either stop or avoid the problem. The environement is analyzed ten times per second over 360° and with a 200 meter range. “Under 50 meters, the computer knows if it's faced with a fixed or moving obstacle, calculates its speed and anticipates its route”, states Pierre Levèvre, Founder and CEO of Induct. \nEPFL: an open-air laboratory for the Navia\n Philippe Vollichard, Deputy to the Vice-President for Planning and Logistics, explains: \"Our collaboration with Induct enables us to make effective progress on our scientific research work on induction charging and artificial intelligence, not only in the laboratory, but also outdoors.

{"id": 639, "text": "Heat transfer happens in various ways in rail tunnels. For instance, when trains brake or accelerate, they produce heat that warms the surrounding air. That hot air mixes with other air in the tunnel and with heat radiating from the ground. \n Until now, engineers have been unable to accurately calculate the amount of heat that tunnel air contains. Researchers at EPFL’s Soil Mechanics Laboratory (LMS) have overcome that problem by precisely estimating the convection heat transfer coefficient. Their findings have been published in \nApplied Thermal Engineering. \n This breakthrough paves the way for innovative applications involving so-called energy tunnels that can supply energy to built environments. The team also tested its model on Lausanne’s future M3 metro line which, once complete, will carry passengers between the city’s train station and the Blécherette district to the north. \nEnough heat for 1,500 apartments\n “Our research shows that fitting the heat-recovery system along 50–60% of the planned route – or 60,000 square meters of tunnel surface area – would cover the heating needs of 1,500 standard 80m2 apartments, or as many as 4,000 Minergie-certified energy-efficient units,” explains Margaux Peltier, a scientific assistant at the LMS, whose Master’s research forms the basis of the article. The system also allows heat to be stored so it can be supplied to homes when needed. “Switching from gas-fired heating would cut the city’s CO2 emissions by two million tons per year,” adds Peltier. Her calculation does not include the savings gleaned from metro stations or at the planned rolling-stock depot in the north of the city, which could also benefit from the system. \n As the temperature naturally stabilizes in underground tunnels, excess heat or cold is evacuated to the surface. The resulting warm airflow can often be felt at metro tunnel entrances. The idea behind the innovation is to harness this surplus warmth in addition to heat naturally present in the ground. \n The system works in a similar way to a refrigerator, with plastic pipes containing heat-transfer fluid, or simply water, placed at regular intervals inside the concrete tunnel walls and connected to a heat pump. In winter, cold water will be pumped into the pipes, emerging hot at the surface. The opposite will happen in summer. According to the researchers, the system would be cheap and energy-efficient to install and would have a lifespan of between 50 and 100 years, with only the heat pumps having to be replaced every 25 years.\nDiagram made by the Laboratory of Soil Mechanics. © LMS / EPFL 2019\nHeating and air-conditioning\n Once equipped, heat from the tunnel would cover up to 80% of the heating needs of local apartments throughout winter, with the shortfall preferably coming from other renewable sources. But what makes geothermal systems like these unique is that they work in summer too. “The tunnel would act like a highly reliable, year-round heating and air-conditioning system,” says Peltier, adding that it would make a real difference to keeping Lausanne’s homes cool during hot weather. The system could even chill the ice rink set to be built in the city’s new Métamorphose eco-district. \n “This article underscores the fact that energy-tunnel technology is mature and could be deployed at district-wide scale,” explains LMS head Lyesse Laloui. “It remains to be seen whether Swiss companies are now prepared to take the lead. Globally, we’ve only seen systems like these used on test sections so far.” The researchers have presented their findings to Lausanne’s utility agency (SIL), local public transport operator (TL), the Canton of Vaud, the prime contractor working on the new metro line, and the City of Lausanne.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have precisely quantified convection heat transfer in rail tunnels.

{"id": 640, "text": "The mission was supposed to last three months to one year, but now, four years later, Swisscube is still orbiting the Earth. This small Cubesat-type satellite, measuring just 10cm by 10cm and entirely designed in Switzerland, was launched on September 23, 2009. After more than 22,000 trips around the planet, all its functions are still operational. Only one of its six solar sensors has been irreversibly damaged.\nThe satellite’s mission was to photograph “air glow,” a photoluminescence phenomenon that occurs in the upper atmosphere and is caused by the interaction between solar radiation and oxygen molecules. In four years, some 250 images were produced. Even though these data are not precise enough to be studied scientifically, the Swiss space community still considers Swisscube a success.\n“Its goal was above all educational,” says Muriel Richard, an engineer at the Swiss Space Center and Swisscube project manager. “It allowed nearly 200 students from EPFL and the Universities of Applied Science to learn about space technology. And today, it’s still valuable for current students as an extraordinary experimentation platform, with which we can, for example, check movements and altitude or test ground-based algorithms.”\nPut to the test\nThe fact that it’s lasted this long proves that the satellite is robust. It confirms the wisdom of certain technological choices that were made; at the time they seemed audacious, but now, in hindsight, they have proven innovative and full of lessons that can be drawn upon for the construction of future spacecraft. For example, it was decided that instead of components that were certified space-quality, standard electronic components would be used; they were thus much less expensive, such as mobile phone batteries bundled into a thermally controlled, waterproof housing. An innovative system of copper mountings was developed that both secured the solar cells to the external walls, ensuring stowage during the violent shakings of launch.\n“The first week is decisive,” explains Richard. “If the satellite gets through it without a hitch, it’s because it was truly well built, and there’s a high likelihood that it will operate for years to come.” Once the satellite reaches space, the electronics on board are seriously put to the test. To start with, vibrations experienced during the launch will reveal even the slightest error in soldering. The materials also undergo temperature variations that can range from -50 to 70 degrees Celsius. Solar radiation and the flow of solar particles can also easily damage systems that are insufficiently protected. And then there’s always the chance of collision with the ever-increasing amount of space debris orbiting the Earth.\nSet your calendar for 2018\nIn fact, Swisscube has narrowly avoided impact several times. As soon as it was launched, it was quickly caught up in the train of debris created by the February 2009 collision between the commercial satellite Iridium-33 the Russian satellite Cosmos-2251. More recently, on September 11, 2013, US Air Force alerted the Swiss Space Center that its Cubesat passed less than 75 meters away from one of the 15,000 pieces of space debris more than 10cm in diameter that have been identified and are monitored from the ground by the U.S.. But it appears that Swisscube’s time has not yet come. Barring an unforeseen event, Swisscube’s demise has been programmed for 2018.

{"id": 641, "text": "When infected with a virus, the response of our immune systems varies widely from person to person. This variation is of great concern, as these differences can determine clinical outcome as well as effectiveness of vaccinations. Comparing the genomes of over 2000 people, scientists from EPFL and the Max Plank Institute have pinpointed a genetic link behind immune variations. , the work connects genetics to antiviral immunity while offering a new path for studying this relationship in other medical contexts.\nStudying genomes to spot correlations\nThe mapping of the human genome – the complete set of DNA of a single person – in 2001 opened up an immensely complex network of genetic information. Biologists today have tools that can study whole genomes instead of individual genes, which has proven very useful when trying to identify which gene or genes are behind complex biological functions, such as immunity.\nOne of these tools is called a “genome-wide association study”. In these studies, computers are used to rapidly scan the genomes of many people to find patterns of genetic variations associated with a particular biological function or a disease.\nGenomes, viruses and the immune system\nThe lab of Jacques Fellay at EPFL performed a genome-wide association study on over 2000 people to uncover the genetic elements that underlie the immune response to viruses. The study, led by postdoc Christian Hammer, looked at fourteen common viruses against which antibodies are developed following natural infection or vaccination. Each one of the people tested had developed varying degrees of immunity against each virus, which can be assessed by measuring the presence and concentration of a particular antibody in their blood.\nUsing this information, the EPFL scientists also looked at the genetic data from each patient to identify correlations of about 6 million common variants across the whole genome with the degree of immune response to each virus. This complex analysis generated masses of digital data, which had to be processed in specialized computer systems at the Vital-IT Group facilities in Lausanne.\nOf the fourteen viruses, the study found “hits” on four: influenza A virus, Epstein-Barr virus, JC polyomavirus, and Merkel cell polyomavirus. There seemed to be a strong connection between immune responses to these and genetic variations across a cluster of genes that are known to be involved with the immune response to viruses.\nSpecifically, these genes – all located on the same chromosome – produce a group of proteins whose job is to attach to viruses and expose specific parts of them to our immune cells, which fight the virus in response. The genetic variations on the genes directly affect the structure of the proteins, and finally impact their ability to present the virus properly and trigger an immune response.\nInterestingly, the study also found that the same genetic variant can affect immune responses differently depending on the virus. For example, a variation can decrease immunity against influenza A but increase it for Epstein-Barr virus. The same variants are already known to also play a role in autoimmune diseases that could be modulated by viruses.\nBut the scientists emphasize that while the study shows correlations, it does not imply causation, which has to be investigated in the future. Nonetheless, the work opens a novel way for exploring, understanding and perhaps even boosting immunity with treatments guided by genomic information.\nThis work was funded by the Max Planck Society and the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nReference\nHammer C, Begemann M, McLaren PJ, Bartha I, Michel A, Klose B, Schmitt C, Waterboer T, Pawlita M, Schulz TF, Ehrenreich H, Fellay J. \nAmino Acid Variation in HLA Class II Proteins Is a Major Determinant of Humoral Response to Common Viruses.\n A\nmerican Journal of Human Genetics\n 05 November 2015.

{"id": 642, "text": "Policies encouraging public transportation and foot and cycle travel have been in place for more than two decades. Their effectiveness is reflected in the latest statistics coming from the cantons of Geneva and Vaud; people have changed their travel behavior. Data for the cantons of Geneva and Vaud from the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), carefully combed and analyzed by EPFL researchers, show that inhabitants are increasingly forgoing their cars for public transportation, walking or cycling. The number of kilometers they’re traveling hasn’t changed; however, it’s taking them longer to get where they’re going.\n“The result of our research is a detailed picture of the mobility patterns of the inhabitants of the two cantons and the major changes recorded since 2000. No other Swiss canton has done this analysis to date,” says study coordinator Sébastien Munafò. The study’s objective was to analyze the 2010 statistics from the FOS’s Mobility and Transports Microcensus, and compare it with those of 2000 and 2005.\nAn hour and a half of daily travel time\n The principal results indicate several common tendencies in the two cantons that border Lake Geneva. First, an overall reduction in the use of automobiles. The percentage of households without a car increased (one in four GE, one in five VD) and this should continue to increase given that young people are obtaining their drivers’ licences later, or sometimes not at all. Among 28-25 year olds, nearly half of those responding to the study did not have a license to drive (48% GE, 42% VD).\nIndividual trips, which are not decreasing, are more often taken using public transportation, walking or cycling. The number of people with public transportation passes increased by 16 percentage points between 2000 and 2010 (50% GE, 46% VD). In addition, walking is currently quite popular, representing 37% of trips by those in Geneva (+8 points in 10 years) and 31% of trips in Vaud (+6 points). “In the city of Geneva, walking and cycling now represent the majority of inhabitants’ trips (52%), confirming the importance of this kind of mobility in this dense region of the canton,” says Munafò, who is a researcher in EPFL’s Laboratory of Urban Sociology (LaSUR) and the University of Geneva Mobility Observatory. In fact, Geneva boats the most walkers of anywhere in Switzerland.\nIn the two cantons, every inhabitant spends an average of 1.5 hours (83 minutes) per day getting from place to place. This time is increasing, although the average distance traveled per day (air travel excluded) – 31 km in Geneva and 41 km in Vaud – is slightly decreasing compared to 2000. For Vincent Kaufmann, Director of LaSUR, this can be explained by heavier road traffic, increasing use of public transportation, and more travel done via walking or cycling, all of which tend to increase average travel time.\nLeisure leads the way \n The Microcensus also reveals that, as in 2000 and 2005, the inhabitants of the two cantons travel mostly for leisure. This motive represents 38% of all trips taken. “Free time represents, in reality, a large portion of our lives and thus the trips we take. The overall increase of the number of retirees in the population adds to this,” says Munafò. “In addition, even though we’re very conscious of trips to and from work, there are rarely more than two of these per day, five times a week.” In close second in terms of trips after leisure activities (23% GE, 21%VD), comes shopping (20% GE, 22% VD). The researchers think that the increase in the number of stores open in the evening and on Sundays, for example in train stations and service stations, probably plays a role in this.\nInhabitants of Geneva are traveling from home to work less by car and more by foot or bicycle (these two increased from 23% - 31% over ten years). They are, however, increasingly fond of their motorbikes; the number of motorbike/cycle commuters has more than doubled among the inhabitants of suburban Geneva (from 7% to 15%). In Vaud, these trends are similar, although inhabitants also favor using the train for their home-work travel, with a doubling in the number of train commuters to 7% (+4 points).\nGeneva’s inhabitants on the go\n This study, coordinated by EPFL’s Transportation Center, also highlights cantonal particularities. Geneva, for example, which has long been a destination for commuters, is now experiencing an outflux of its inhabitants, particularly those of the inner city, as they commute to jobs in suburban neighborhoods or the wider Lake Geneva region.\nIn Vaud, the other mandate with the public transportation authority of Lausanne, it is apparent that the metropolitan region of Lausanne has enormously benefited from an overhaul of the public transportation offer between 2005 and 2010, which has accentuated the decrease in automobile use and the increase in the use of public transportation, walking and cycling. “People in Vaud enthusiastically embraced the improved public transport offer, so much so that some regional lines have become victims of their success at rush hour,” says Christian Liaudat, head of mobilty projections in the mobility service in the Canton Vaud.", "summary": "In the cantons of Geneva and Vaud, people are using their cars less often and their overall travel time is increasing.

{"id": 644, "text": "The proliferation of metastases is often the main cause of complications and death from cancer. For the first time, researchers are looking very closely at the development of these metastases themselves, instead of focusing on the “primary” cancers from which they originated. In doing so, a team from the Swiss Center for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC), at EPFL, was able to identify a protein that plays a major role in metastasis development, and showed that the formation of secondary cancers could be prevented by blocking this protein. Their results have been December 7, 2011, in the advance online edition of the journal \nNature \nand will open the door to new therapeutic options for treating late stage cancers.\nA vital protein for metastases \nThe researchers already knew that cancer cells spread widely throughout the body once a malignant tumor is established. These cells don’t always result in a secondary cancer, however. It turns out that all cancer cells aren’t created equal: only some of them, known as “cancer stem cells,” can initiate metastases.\nAnd in order to do this, they must settle into a spot – a niche – that is conducive for their development.\n The ISREC team was able to show that several conditions are necessary for cancer to propagate. “In particular, we were able to identify a protein, periostin, in the niches where metastases develop,” explains Joerg Huelsken, holder of the EPFL Debiopharm Chair in Signal Transduction in Oncogenesis. “Without this protein, the cancer stem cell cannot initiate metastasis; instead, it disappears or remains dormant.”\nPeriostin exists naturally as part of the extracellular matrix, and has been shown to play a role in fetal development. In adults, it is only active in specific organs – the mammary glands, bones, skin and intestine. This research appears to prove that it plays an essential role in the environment that a cancer stem cell needs in order to develop a metastasis. Mice that were bred to lack this protein are resistant to metastasis formation. “We developed an antibody that adheres to this protein, making it inoperative, and we are hoping in this way to be able to block the process of metastasis formation,” says Huelsken.\nMinimal side effects in mice\nThese experiments that blocked the periostin protein resulted in very few side effects in the mice. “This doesn’t necessarily mean the same will hold true in humans,” the researcher cautions. “We’re not even sure that we’ll be able to find an equivalent antibody that will work in humans.”\n This discovery is nonetheless very encouraging, especially since we now know that malignant tumors tend to spread more quickly than was previously believed. Preventing the development of metastases would thus appear to be an important therapeutic option that could limit the deleterious effects of cancers.\n(Download the press release)", "summary": "An EPFL / ISREC team has shed new light on how cancer metastases develop.

{"id": 647, "text": "Biosensors are devices that can detect biological molecules (“analytes”) in air, water, or blood. They are used widely in drug development, medical diagnostics, biological research, and even security. Despite ongoing advancments, there remains a need for improved portable biosensing devices that are easy to use for both doctors and patients. The development of such devices would offer methods for continuous, real-time monitoring of biomarker levels, which is important for a number of diseases such as diabetes.\nThis is where Edward Honein’s summer project comes in: he is developing an optical, microfluidic biosensor that can detect single biomolecules in a scalable, high-throughput manner.\nThe biosensor itself is made up of carbon nanotubes, which are rolled-up sheets of graphene. Nanotubes have diameters as small as 1 nanometer and lengths up to several centimeters, and their unique physical properties have opened up a whole new world of technologies. One of these properties is emitting light in the near-infrared spectrum (700 – 2500 nm wavelength) when excited with a laser.\nHonein’s project draws from the research of , who heads the lab and combines nanotube optics and biological molecules to explore a range of emerging capabilities, including near-infrared biosensing. In her research, Boghossian has developed nanotubes wrapped with single-stranded DNA, which acts as the actual sensing molecule for the target analyte.\n“In our applications we use semiconducting nanotubes that have a specifc energy barrier, called the ‘band gap’,” says Honein. “When we excite the nanotubes with a laser, an electron is excited across this barrier into the conductance band. Eventually this electron relaxes, and in doing so releases a photon – which is what we see as emitted light.”\nWhen the DNA - or a protein - detects the presence of a target molecule in the vicinity of a carbon nanotube, the resulting interaction changes the 3D conformation of the DNA or protein, which subsequently affects the surface properties of the nanotube. These modifications impact the near-infrared light emitted by the nanotube and changes its signal.\nHonein is now trying to streamline the biosensor to make it scalable for commercial use. This entails a lot of work: first to construct the biosensor, then to characterize the sensor’s sensitivity and selectivity, and finally to integrate the sensor into a working device. One possibility he is exploring is using DNA-wrapped nanotubes that have beem immobilized into a gel, and then incorporating this gel into a microfluidic device.\nThe microfluidic biosensor ©Alain Herzog/EPFL\n“When you add your analyte, the signal of the emitted light changes – so you know you detected something,” says Honein. “But depending on how nanotubes are dispersed in the gel, the intensity may change from experiment to experiment, which is inconsistent.”\n“We have these sensors, they're coming out, they're promising, they can detect biomolecules of interest so it's beyond proof-of-concept,” adds Boghossian. “And at this point, what we're trying to do is package it into something accessible, and even portable - such as a microfluidic device.”\nUltimately, the design and purpose of such devices are limited by the capabilities of their nanotubes, which emit light at different wavelengths depending on their diameters. “Because they have different band gaps, they fluoresce at different wavelengths,” says Honein. “So you look at this wavelength of light and know that you’re detecting molecule X; then this wavelength of light means you’re detecting molecule Y.\"\nBy exploiting this property, sensors can be designed with the ability to simultaneously detect multiple molecules using different wavelengths of light. This offers a particular advantage when conducting multianalyte analysis on more complex samples, such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, and even opaque fluids like blood itself.", "summary": "Summer Series: Edward Honein has joined  from the American University of Beirut.

{"id": 648, "text": "SwissCube, the first Swiss satellite, has taken its first pictures – but only after a spectacular recovery. Launched on the morning of 23 September 2009, its mission was to photograph the airglow, a luminous phenomenon in the upper atmosphere. A few hours later, there was disappointment all round. The satellite was rotating too fast to take the photos. Muriel Noca, responsible for the project, explains that this was probably the result of a problem occurring either when the satellite was being ejected or when the antennas unfolded.\n Scientists and students were faced with a dilemma. They would have to wait quite a long time for the rotation of the satellite to slow down by itself. However, SwissCube was designed to last for only about four months. There was no guarantee that it could stand up to solar radiation and extreme variations in temperature – the deliverable of this students’ project was built using standard electronic components available in shops, and was not designed for such use.\n November 2010. After over a year of suspense, the rotation of SwissCube had decreased. However, bearing out the team’s concerns, some functions had deteriorated. At the Space Center, the idea of relaunching the computer system came to mind, in the hope that it might remedy the faults. “The problem is that, for security reasons, satellites don’t have a re-set function, unlike our computers.” adds Muriel Noca.\nEarth and airglow from the Swisscube © EPFL Space Center\n A former student of the SwissCube team, working at the Space Center, found the solution to the problem. Florian George was the only one to be aware of a command enabling the idle operation of the radiocommunications system. Thus, he managed to drain the satellite’s batteries. Temporarily deprived of energy, the system re-started as expected. The team was relieved when it became clear that all the functions had been re-established.\n Beginning of 2011. Arthur Overlack, a student at the University of Delft in the Netherlands, also made an essential contribution. Informed of SwissCube’s initial setbacks, he developed an IT strategy that would finalize its stabilization. Thanks to his work, the team managed to perfect this aspect of the satellite, by acting on the current of its three electromagnets, aligned with the Earth’s magnetic field. It then became possible to take photos.\n The first pictures eventually reached the team. At low resolution, they clearly show the airglow – this luminescent phenomenon, which results from the formation of O2 oxygen molecules, following their separation by solar radiation. These images will provide precious information to the scientists. However, the greatest success of the program remains first and foremost its educational dimension.

{"id": 649, "text": "Our immune system has two phases: innate and adaptive. The first phase, innate, refers to the immediate defense mechanisms such as skin, blood chemicals and certain types of immune cells that constantly fight off foreign organisms to keep them from infecting us. There has been much interest in understanding innate immunity, and much of that research is carried out using Drosophila flies, a type of fruit fly widely used in biological and genetic research. EPFL scientists have now identified a new receptor that Drosophila flies use to fight off infections, adding a missing piece to the puzzle. The work .\nThe study, led by Igor Iatsenko in , found that the immune cells of Drosophila flies secrete a pattern-recognition receptor to detect foreign pathogens and turn the fly’s immune system against them. The receptor belongs to a larger class of receptors that regulate Drosophila’s innate immune response, and are collectively named “peptidoglycan recognition proteins” or PGRPs for short. Along with insects, PGRPs also exist in mammals.\nPGRPs specialize in scavenging for a complex sugar-protein molecule called peptidoglycan, which is found abundantly on the so-called bacterial wall. When they detect peptidoglycans, the PGRPs send signals that activate various defenses of the innate immune system to fight off potentially threatening bacteria. However, some PGRPs act as bactericidals, attacking the bacteria directly.\nUsing an array of genetic and molecular biology techniques, the EPFL researchers, working with colleagues at the CNRS and Japan’s National Institute of Genetics, were able to identify a new PGRP, as an integral part of Drosophila’s innate immunity. This particular protein is secreted from the fly’s cells to scout their immediate environment for threats.\nOnce it binds it, the PGRP moves peptidoglycan to the cell surface of immune organs where it interacts with another recognition receptor. Then, the whole complex activates a cascade known as the “immune deficiency” pathway. This is a complex molecular cascade that produces various antimicrobial proteins that attack the invading bacterium. The authors of this study speculate that the existence of this secreted recognition receptor increases the sensibility of the fly immune system to bacterial infection.\nThe study adds another piece to the puzzle of Drosophila innate immunity, and gives further clues about our own. In fact, the authors draw a parallel between the secreted PGRP-SD and the well-known CD14 protein, which is a pattern recognition protein of the mammalian innate immune system, and is implicated in a number of allergic and immune conditions.\nReference\nIgor Iatsenko, Shu Kondo, Dominique Mengin-Lecreulx, Bruno Lemaitre. \nPGRP-SD, an extracellular pattern-recognition receptor, enhances peptidoglycan-mediated activation of the Drosophila Imd pathway.\nImmunity\n 15 November 2016.

{"id": 650, "text": "The movement of objects is ultimately governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, which predict some intriguing phenomena: An object could simultaneously be in two places at the same time, and it should always be moving a little, even at a temperature of absolute zero - the oscillator is then said to be in its quantum 'ground state'. Until recently, these strange predictions of quantum mechanics have only been observed in the motion of tiny objects such as individual atoms. For large objects, the unavoidable coupling of the object to the surrounding environment quickly washes out the quantum properties, in a process known as decoherence. But researchers in EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements have now shown that it is possible to use light to control the vibrational motion of a large object, consisting of a hundred trillion atoms, at the quantum level. The results of their research have been published in the February 2nd edition of Nature magazine.\nA ring of light\nThe object they used was circular in design - a 30-micrometer diameter glass donut mounted on a microchip. Under the direction of Tobias Kippenberg, the team injected a laser into a thin optical fiber, and brought the fiber close to the donut, allowing light to 'jump' to the object and circulate around the circumference of the donut up to a million times. Just as the pressure of a finger running along the rim of a wineglass will cause it to hum, the tiny force exerted by the photons traveling inside the glass ring can cause it to vibrate at a well-defined frequency. But the force can in fact also dampen the vibrations, and thus cool down the oscillatory motion.\nCold, colder...\nCooling is crucial to reaching the regime of quantum mechanical motion, as this is normally overshadowed by random thermal fluctuations. For this reason, the structure is placed in a cryostat that brings it to a temperature of less than one degree above absolute zero (−273.15°C). The light launched into the donut slows down the motion one hundred times, thus cooling it even more, very close to the quantum 'ground state'. And more importantly, the interaction between light and the movement of the oscillator can be made so strong that the two form an intimate connection: A small excitation in the form of a light pulse was fully transformed into a small vibration and back again. For the first time, this transformation between light and motion was made to occur within a time that is short enough so that the quantum properties of the original light pulse are not lost in the process through decoherence. By outpacing decoherence, these results demonstrate the possibility of controlling the quantum properties of an object’s motion. It also provides a way to see the peculiar predictions of quantum mechanics at play in man-made objects.\nLooking forward\nMechanical vibrations can be coupled to quantum systems of completely different nature (such as electric currents), as well as to light. They could therefore be used to ‘translate’ quantum information between those systems and light signals. This is especially beneficial as it allows to transport quantum information - the basic ingredient of a future quantum computer - over large distances in optical fibers.\nLink:\t\nSource:\t\n Quantum-coherent coupling of a mechanical oscillator to an optical cavity mode, E.

{"id": 652, "text": "Fusion energy is a promising sustainable energy source. In a fusion reactor, extremely hot hydrogen plasma is kept suspended by magnetic fields. However, there is always a fraction that escapes. To prevent it from damaging the reactor vessel, the escaped hydrogen must be cooled down on its way to the wall. \nCooling can be achieved in various ways, such as by injecting a gas. \"But if you inject too much additional gas, the plasma is cooled too strongly, which reduces the performance,\" says Christian Theiler (Swiss Plasma Center, EPFL), co-author of a study published in \nNature Communications.\n It is therefore necessary to constantly manage the cooling to the point that the reactor can adequately cope. Matthijs van Berkel (DIFFER): “The ability to control the cooling precisely is explicitly stated in the European fusion program (EUROfusion) as a necessary step towards fusion energy. It is fantastic that we can contribute to this now.” In \nNature Communications\n the authors describe how to cool the escaping particles in a quick and controlled manner with an innovative feedback control system. The experiments has been carried out in the TCV tokamak, a fusion research machine at the EPFL’s Swiss Plasma Center.\n“We are going from studying to controlling. This is vital for the future of fusion reactors,” says first author Timo Ravensbergen (DIFFER). “We measure, calculate, and control with incredible speed.”\nA closed system\nEscaping hydrogen is carried away via the reactor’s ‘exhaust’. That exhaust is called the \ndivertor\n, where the plasma heat losses are captured. The process of strong cooling in the vicinity of the divertor is called \ndivertor detachment\n. It reduces plasma temperature and pressure near the wall. Fusion physicists already have a lot of experience with this process, but this is partly based on intuition and on experiences from previous measurements. Now things will be done differently. “We have developed a closed system,” says Van Berkel, group leader Energy Systems & Control. “We have combined many different techniques, that is what makes it unique. Our systems engineering approach can be applied to other fusion reactors.” The experiments are a proof-of-principle. Van Berkel thinks that the method will be - with adjustments - applicable in the large fusion reactors ITER and DEMO. \nThe closed loop of measuring, calculating, and controlling to prevent the tokamak wall from being destroyed © Julia van Leeuwen\nStep-by-step\nThe researchers made use of the camera system MANTIS at the TCV tokamak for this research. This Multispectral Advanced Narrowband Tokamak Imaging System was developed by DIFFER, EPFL and MIT. The researchers adapted the system in such a way that camera images were converted into data from which a computer model could then calculate in real-time the optimum cooling under varying conditions. This all took place with considerable precision: the status of the plasma is determined 800 times per second.\nA new real-time image-processing algorithm, developed at DIFFER, analyzes the MANTIS images. The algorithm calculates how much you need to cool by, and subsequently controls the gas valves automatically. Finally, the researchers produced a model of the system by analyzing, once again with the camera, how the plasma responds to the gas introduced. “With this model, we determine the dynamic relationship between the control of the gas valve and the heat front,” says Van Berkel. \nFast result: tested on EPFL's TCV tokamak\nThe system was tested on the TCV tokamak. \"It is a very flexible device, where ideas can be developed and tested rather quickly,\" emphases Theiler. Van Berkel agrees: “TCV is a fantastic machine for testing control techniques, with a hypermodern real-time control system.” Van Berkel tells results came fast: “Within just four experiments, we managed to achieve feed-back control of the plasma near the divertor. This demonstrates that our systematic approach works.” \nFuture research\nA proposal for follow-up research has already been prepared. The researchers made use of just one MANTIS camera, whereas the system has ten. The researchers want to use the other cameras as well, so that they can control the process even more accurately, and to control additional key processes in the divertor. \nFusion: great energy potential\nFusion, the nuclear reaction that powers the Sun, has a high energy potential, is safe and environment-friendly. Research in this field is boosted by the international reactor ITER. While the giant research machine is being assembled in France, scientists from all over the world are working on the next steps: producing large-scale fusion reactions within it. Fusion occurs when nuclei of light atoms are heated to a hundred million degrees, forming a gas of charged particles called plasma.\nPartners\nThis project is a collaboration between DIFFER, EPFL, Eindhoven University of Technology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, MIT, Institute of Plasma Physics of CAS, CCFE, and the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics and is part of the EUROfusion research programme.", "summary": "The core of a fusion reactor is incredibly hot.

{"id": 657, "text": "At 6 a.m. on Saturday mornings, in the quiet of the day, Testerman likes to arise and work on mathematics problems. “You need a calm setting to do math, because you have to be very focused.” Being a good mathematician, this professor, who teaches at EPFL’s School of Basic Sciences, is disciplined even though she can occasionally digress. “In class, I’ll sometimes go off-topic, because I can’t resist a good story.”\nThis is not surprising for someone who wanted to study literature, art history and theater, before her engineer father convinced her to switch to math. “He told me, ‘An education is expensive, you need to learn something that you can do later on,’ and so I completed a Bachelor’s degree in math and theater.” A double major like this was possible in Virginia, where she grew up – after all, mathematics is a sort of art form. “Sometimes I tell my students, ‘Look at this theorem, isn't it beautiful? It deserves a round of applause.’”\nTesterman, who studies the theory of algebraic groups, has always had a passion for math; she loves exploring its intricacies and sharing her knowledge with others. Although she claims that her teaching method – which involves just a blackboard and a piece of chalk – is “very traditional,” her engagement with her students is outstanding. This sense of involvement, along with the fact that she created a MOOC in linear algebra in 2015 and the quality of her teaching in general, have earned her this year’s Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.\nTo do mathematics\n“You can teach a course like a book, but that was never my style. Books don’t tell you how to arrive at an idea. The real value of a course is the sharing of intuition.” Since 2004, Testerman has taught linear and Lie algebras to EPFL Bachelor’s and Master’s students, with the same level of enthusiasm that she has for helping students understand. Her experience and drive made her the ideal person to design a MOOC version of the linear algebra course she teaches to future first-year engineers. But the online course, which consists of some 100 videos, each 10-15 minutes long, covers even more ground. Available on the edX learning platform, it has already been taken by tens of thousands of students from around the world. At EPFL, other professors also use it for their courses, including Simone Deparis who teaches linear algebra using a flipped classroom format. “Developing the course was painstaking and time-consuming,” says Testerman, “but I had the support of a highly skilled team.”\nSometimes I tell my students, ‘Look at this theorem, isn't it beautiful? It deserves a round of applause.\nDonna Testerman\nProfessor Testerman is not easy-going – her classes are complex and fast-paced. But she’s determined to provide her students with everything they need to pass the course. That’s why she holds office hours where students can drop in and ask questions. “During a one-on-one meeting, I can provide examples that are tailored to their problems and identify areas where I need to improve my teaching.”\nTesterman’s goal is to have students solve problems using their own individual approach. For this reason, she gives her first-year students assignments accompanied by detailed solutions, but in later years she provides little or no assistance. \"To understand mathematics, you have to do it; students have to follow their own line of reasoning.\"\nTesterman, who earned a PhD from the University of Oregon at the age of 25, knows what it means to “wrestle with problems.” Physics was a big challenge for her during her studies, and her research now requires that she ask herself \"a lot of questions.” “I understand what students are going through, and I think that doing research alongside teaching is valuable. Personally, if I don’t do it, I find I get bored.”\nA tremendous challenge\nAfter leaving the US to join her husband in Switzerland, Testerman was offered a position at the University of Warwick in England. “We lived in Geneva and had an au pair for our two children, then aged two and four. I would leave Tuesday morning at 5am and return Friday evening. I estimated that, factoring in time between semesters, I would be able to spend two-thirds of my time at home. I did it for two years, but it was not a long-term solution.”\nShe stepped down from her position at the University of Warwick, and then spent five years teaching at HES-SO Valais-Wallis before the opportunity arose to join the University of Lausanne and EPFL when the School of Basic Sciences was being set up. “Returning to research after five years was a tremendous challenge.” This Alpine enthusiast, who enjoys a guided mountain run once a year, took up the challenge with gusto. And although research means a great deal to her, training students and looking after their well-being is of equal importance. “It’s essential to create an environment where students interact. I try to remember their first names, even in the large courses, and I ask them for their birthdays. If it coincides with a class day, I give them chocolate and we all sing Happy Birthday.” A short break and a sweet treat, and then it’s back to tackling new math problems.", "summary": "Donna Testerman, a professor at EPFL’s Institute of Mathematics, is this year’s recipient of the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.

{"id": 658, "text": "The discovery, using state-of-the-art informatics tools, increases the likelihood that it will be possible to predict much of the fundamental structure and function of the brain without having to measure every aspect of it. That in turn makes the Holy Grail of modelling the brain in silico —the goal of the proposed Human Brain Project—a more realistic, less Herculean, prospect. “It is the door that opens to a world of predictive biology,” says Henry Markram, the senior author on the study, which is published this week in PLoS ONE.\nWithin a cortical column, the basic processing unit of the mammalian brain, there are roughly 300 different neuronal types. These types are defined both by their anatomical structure and by their electrical properties, and their electrical properties are in turn defined by the combination of ion channels they present—the tiny pores in their cell membranes through which electrical current passes, which make communication between neurons possible.\nScientists would like to be able to predict, based on a minimal set of experimental data, which combination of ion channels a neuron presents. They know that genes are often expressed together, perhaps because two genes share a common promoter—the stretch of DNA that allows a gene to be transcribed and, ultimately, translated into a functioning protein—or because one gene modifies the activity of another. The expression of certain gene combinations is therefore informative about a neuron’s characteristics, and Georges Khazen and co-workers hypothesised that they could extract rules from gene expression patterns to predict those characteristics.\nThey took a dataset that Prof Markram and others had collected a few years ago, in which they recorded the expression of 26 genes encoding ion channels in different neuronal types from the rat brain. They also had data classifying those types according to a neuron’s morphology, its electrophysiological properties and its position within the six, anatomically distinct layers of the cortex. They found that, based on the classification data alone, they could predict those previously measured ion channel patterns with 78 per cent accuracy. And when they added in a subset of data about the ion channels to the classification data, as input to their data-mining programme, they were able to boost that accuracy to 87 per cent for the more commonly occurring neuronal types.\n“This shows that it is possible to mine rules from a subset of data and use them to complete the dataset informatically,” says one of the study’s authors, Felix Schürmann. “Using the methods we have developed, it may not be necessary to measure every single aspect of the behaviour you’re interested in.” Once the rules have been validated in similar but independently collected datasets, for example, they could be used to predict the entire complement of ion channels presented by a given neuron, based simply on data about that neuron’s morphology, its electrical behaviour and a few key genes that it expresses.\nResearchers could also use such rules to explore the roles of different genes in regulating transcription processes. And importantly, if rules exist for ion channels, they are also likely to exist for other aspects of brain organisation. For example, the researchers believe it will be possible to predict where synapses are likely to form in neuronal networks, based on information about the ratio of neuronal types in that network. Knowledge of such rules could therefore usher in a new era of predictive biology, and accelerate progress towards understanding and modelling the brain.\nPublication\nKhazen G, Hill SL, Schürmann F, Markram H (2012) PLoS ONE 7(4): e34786. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034786", "summary": "Researchers at the EPFL have discovered rules that relate the genes that a neuron switches on and off, to the shape of that neuron, its electrical properties and its location in the brain.", "claim": "Researchers at the EPFL have discovered rules that relate the genes that a neuron switches on and off, to the shape of that neuron, his electrical properties and its location in the brain.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [26, 26], "noise": false}

The goal is to give urban planners the tools and insight to develop African cities as sustainably as possible.\n To that end, EPFL will develop a training platform with massive open online courses (MOOCs) that is intended specifically for urban-development practitioners in Africa; in a second phase of the project, the platform will be extended to students.

These new titles will more than double Frontiers’ current repertoire of twelve online journals whose peer-reviewed, scientific articles are immediately accessible, free of charge, to anyone. EPFL researcher Kamila Markram launched the company in 2007 with the support of a small group of scientists. Markram will be giving a keynote speech this Sunday, the 11th of November, at London’s SpotOn conference (formally Science Online London) about open science and scientific publication in the digital age.\n“Since working scientists run all of Frontiers journals, the launch is also a call for researchers to take the lead in defining the direction of research in their fields by joining one of the new editorial boards,” explains Markram.\nIn 2008, a small group of leading neuroscientists from around the world launched Frontiers in Neuroscience. Since then, key members of the active scientific community have continued to manage editorial content for all of its twelve current journals, which include Frontiers in Genetics, Frontiers in Psychology and Frontiers in Microbiology. In January of 2012, Frontiers launched Frontiers Network—a web-based platform for scientists to create profiles, network and disseminate their publications.\n“With over 25,000 scientists currently on its editorial boards, Frontiers has built a strong network of working scientists who believe in putting scientific publishing back into the hands of researchers,” says Kamila Markram.\nFrontiers can expand the ‘Frontiers in’ series, in part, because its technology-driven publishing model makes it possible treat a high quantity of manuscripts. By taking advantage of the possibilities of the Internet for scientific communication and publication, their platform allows for publishing and sharing open-access content online, participating in real-time peer-review of manuscripts and tracking publication impact using detailed web analytic tools. Most importantly, the platform automates much of the distribution of editorial tasks, allowing Frontiers to easily scale up production without raising prices.\nOpen access\nAt Frontiers, peer-reviewed articles appear online, free for all to access under a Creative Commons CC-BY license, with authors retaining copyright. And the authors of articles that receive a lot of attention, i.e. are heavily downloaded and cited, are invited back to write another paper that contextualizes their work—what Frontiers calls “climbing up the tier system.”\nBut Frontiers’ expansion into 13 new fields is indicative of a general shift towards open-access publication across the academic world. A recent announcement by the European Commission, following a similar statement made by the UK government earlier this year, claims that increased open access to research will be a boost for Europe’s innovation. And an article published by researchers from the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki, Finland, claims that, “Since the year 2000, the average annual growth rate has been 18% for the number of (open access) journals and 30% for the number of (open access) articles.”\nA challenge to the publishing status quo\n“To solve another fundamental problem in the publishing industry above and beyond the open access question, Frontiers has developed a transparent peer review process,” says Markram.\nOnce a manuscript enters the review process at Frontiers, a private forum is opened where the author and reviewers can exchange messages in real-time—encouraging an efficient and constructive critique of the paper. And if the manuscript is accepted, Frontiers publishes the reviewers’ identities to acknowledge the reviewers’ contribution and to increase the accountability and transparency of the review process.\n“The launch of the new journals means that Frontiers’ transparent, open-access publishing model will ultimately bring new research directions and collaboration to these fields,” says Markram. Frontiers also plans to add new journals in the Humanities, the Arts and other academic disciplines that could benefit from their open-access platform that currently has over 4 million page views per month.\n---\n---\nThe full list of new Frontiers titles is:\nFrontiers in Bioengineering\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology\nFrontiers in Chemistry\nFrontiers in Computer Science\nFrontiers in Dentistry\nFrontiers in Economics\nFrontiers in Energy\nFrontiers in Environmental Science\nFrontiers in Internal Medicine\nFrontiers in Nutrition\nFrontiers in Pediatrics\nFrontiers in Physics\nFrontiers in Public Health\nFrontiers in Surgery", "summary": "The “Frontiers in” journal series brings its peer review model to 13 new fields.", "claim": "The “Frontiers in” journal series brings his peer review model to 13 new fields.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [8, 8], "noise": false}
{"id": 666, "text": "Many countries – including Switzerland – are developing an energy strategy to meet various objectives such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels, cutting CO\n2 \nemissions and promoting the energy transition. That means governments have to make important decisions about which power sources to prioritize in the future and what technologies to invest in, in order to strike the right balance between keeping public spending under control and promoting clean energy. \nThese strategic decisions are generally based on forecasts of natural gas prices, solar power costs, electricity demand and hundreds of other parameters. Today, energy planners enter these forecasts into computer models that then identify the “best” strategies. But because these forecasts stretch out some 20–50 years, they are often wrong – meaning the models’ output is often wrong, too. And this can lead to bad policy decisions.\nGas-fired power plants shut down before ever being put into service\n“For example, the Netherlands have invested heavily in gas-fired power plants, based on the assumption that the price of natural gas would stay low,” says Stefano Moret, a Postdoctoral Researcher at EPFL’s School of Engineering () and author of the study. “However, their forecasts were mistaken, and many power plants were shut down before ever being put into service.” \nA new model \nto consider uncertainty\nThe EPFL scientists developed a new approach that accounts for uncertainty in energy-strategy decisions. More specifically, they came up with a model that uses a range of values for each input data rather than a set figure. “Instead of saying that the price of natural gas will be 3 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next few years, for example, we can enter a range of between 1.5 and 5 cents, depending on how the market evolves. That means our model can incorporate variations in prices, cost and demand,” says Moret. The team’s research indicates that once you factor in such uncertainty, energy strategies that rely heavily on renewable energy are not necessarily more expensive than those dependent on fossil fuels. Their findings have just been published in the .\nMany mistake in past projections\nThe scientists’ model, called Energyscope, is “a mathematical representation of an energy system with over 100 different input parameters,” says Moret. “The problem with the models that governments currently use is that they are extremely complicated and can’t work with ranges.” What’s more, many of those models are not available as open-source applications and therefore have limited reach. \nThe scientists found many mistakes in past projections, with calculated values off by as much as 200–300% from actual values. One such example is forecasts of natural gas prices in the United States. \nThe ranges that the scientists programmed into their model – for each of the hundreds of parameters – are based on historical data and expert opinions.

{"id": 667, "text": "Intensive care units are known for their incessant symphony of alerts. 90% of them are false alarms, and they are so common that medical staff no longer pay them much heed. These false alarms are the result of several factors, such as when electrodes placed on the patient move, causing artifacts that trigger an alert. The alerts stream forth, filling the air day and night. They have a negative impact on both patients and medical staff: they disrupt the patients’ sleep, but, more importantly, they cause alarm fatigue among staff.\nThis very topic – reducing false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU – was the focus of the 2015 \nComputing in Cardiology\n conference. This annual conference, organized in conjunction with MIT, features a competition involving the application of computers in the area of cardiology in order to improve patient care. Sibylle Fallet and Sasan Yazdani, PhD students at EPFL’s Applied Signal Processing Group (ASPG), took up this year’s challenge. The approach they developed, which cut the number of false alarms in half, earned them first place in the competition.\nBradycardia, tachycardia, asystole, arrhythmia, fibrillation – the two EPFL doctoral students had to quickly master the medical jargon since their research focused on signal analysis in cardiology. “This challenge was right in line with their respective projects,” said Jean-Marc Vesin, Senior Scientist at the ASPG. “Sybille is working on an algorithm for instantaneous estimation that will, among other things, help in monitoring the vital functions of premature babies, and Sasan developed an algorithm capable of reliably detecting R wave peaks in ECGs, something that will improve sensors embedded in smart clothes, for example.”\nLike all the other competitors, the EPFL students were given the electrocardiograms of 1,250 patients. “We were provided with different signals. Even if they weren’t always high quality, most of the time we had the ECG and visual data from the PPG, which is read by placing a sensor on the patient's finger,” said Sibylle. The PPG – short for photoplethysmograph – uses light absorption technology to detect waves produced by the body’s pulse. \n The real hurdle in this type of exercise is to precisely measure the heart rate.

Three EPFL spin-offs – CompPair, Hydromea and Nanogence – have made it through a global field of 5,000 deep tech startups and onto the list of just 80 finalists. The teams will have three minutes to pitch to a panel of experts: investors, corporates, other startups, researchers and specialized journalists. The exposure they gain could prove invaluable as they look to grow their businesses and raise funds from investors.\nThe finalists will get their first chance to impress this week – and take away a €10,000 prize – as they battle it out to be crowned the winner in one of 14 industry tracks. In normal times, the competition takes place front of a live audience in Paris. But circumstances this year meant the teams had to pre-record their pitches.

{"id": 671, "text": "The key to future HIV treatment could be hidden right in our own genes. Everyone who becomes infected deploys defense strategies, and some even manage to hold the virus at bay without any therapy at all. This immune system struggle leaves its mark within the pathogen itself – genetic mutations that indicate how the virus reacted to its host’s attacks. Scientists from EPFL and the Vaud university hospital center (UNIL-CHUV) retraced the entire chain of events in these battles, from the genome of the virus to the genome of the victim. They have created the first map of human HIV resistance. The goal of their research, which has been published in the journal eLife on the 29th of October, is to find new therapeutic targets and to enable individualized treatment strategies. \n The human immune system is constantly developing strategies to fight HIV. Unfortunately, “the genome of the virus also changes rapidly, at a rate of millions of mutations a day,” explains Jacques Fellay, co-author and EPFL researcher. In the majority of cases, the pathogen finds an effective strategy via this natural selection.\n Sometimes the virus is faced with a tougher opponent. It resists, but its ability to replicate is compromised. “The virus survives but replicates more slowly, and thus its capacity for destruction is in some sense neutralized,” says the scientist.\n By studying strains of HIV that have been living in human hosts, the researchers can identify specific genetic mutations. These are like scars that each bear witness to a very specific attack launched by the immune system. What are the human genes involved in these defense strategies? And which, among all our genetic variations, predispose us to increased HIV resistance or, on the contrary, increased vulnerability? The scientists developed a method that allowed them to find answers to these questions.\nA supercomputer, 1,071 patients and millions of combinations\nTo draw up the first map of human HIV resistance, the researchers had to analyze an enormous amount of data. They studied various strains of HIV from 1,071 seropositive individuals. They crossed more than 3,000 potential mutations in the viral genome with more than 6 million variations in the patients’ genomes. Using supercomputers, they studied all these possible combinations and identified correspondence between patients. \n “We had to study the virus before the patient had undergone treatment, which is far from easy,” says Fellay. This meant they had to search in data banks established in the 1980s, before effective therapies were made available. \n This novel, indirect method made it possible to obtain the most complete global overview to date of human genes and their implications in terms of HIV resistance. It allows us to not only better understand how we defend ourselves from attack but also how the virus adapts itself to our defense mechanisms. “We now have a true database that tells us which human genetic variation will induce which kind of mutation in the virus”, explains Amalio Telenti, co-author and UNIL-CHUV researcher. \nTherapies inspired by our own natural defense\nThis research has two major implications. New therapies could be developed based on studying humans’ natural defenses, particularly those that result in a reduced replication of the virus. In addition, the scientists hope that by profiling the genome of HIV-infected individuals, it will be possible to develop individually targeted treatments that take into account the patients’ genetic strengths and weaknesses.\nThe journal eLife is part of a recent joint initiative in life science and biomedicine between the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust.", "summary": "Do our genes hold the key to future AIDS therapies?

{"id": 672, "text": "Detailed neuron models consisting of thousands of synapses are key for understanding the computational properties of single neurons and large neuronal networks, and for interpreting experimental results. Simulations of these models are however, computationally expensive (using lots of computing hours), which considerably decreases their utility. For the first time, Scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the  have formulated a unique analytical approach to the challenge of reducing the complexity of neuron models while retaining their key input/output functions and their computational capabilities.\nReduced models of neurons and networks form a bridge between the highly detailed models capturing minute experimental detail and the simpler models that lend themselves more easily to theoretical interpretation at the cost of missing important details. These bridging models significantly reduce the amount of computation time as well as storage that are needed for detailed neuron models (and the networks they form) and lead to faster simulation time and a larger neuronal circuits that could be simulated.\nNeuron_Reduce\n is a new analytical tool that provides a unique multi-cylindrical reduced model for complex nonlinear neuron models, both in terms of reducing the morphological complexity and reducing computational time. The tool analytically maps the detailed dendritic tree into a reduced multi-cylindrical tree, based on Rall’s cable theory and linear circuit theory. Synapses and ion channels are mapped to the reduced model preserving their transfer impedance to the soma (cell body); synapses with identical transfer impedance are merged into one NEURON process all the while retaining their individual activation times.\n“\nNeuron_Reduce\n is a significant innovation in analytically modelling dendritic computations,” explains Prof. Idan Segev, David & Inez Myers Professor in Computational Neuroscience and head of the Department of Neurobiology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI). “The analytically reduced model preserves a large set of subthreshold and suprathreshold features of the detailed model, including the identity of individual stem dendrites, their biophysical properties as well as the identity of individual synapses and the variety of excitable ion channels, and it enhances the computational speed of the model by hundreds folds ” Segev enthuses.\nA key advantage of the reduction algorithm, also exhibiting its solidity, is that it preserves the magnitude of the transfer impedance from each dendritic location to the soma. Oren Amsalem, Neurobiologist at the HUJI describes why this is so important, “since in linear systems the transfer impedance is reciprocal, \nNeuron_Reduce\n also preserves the transfer impedance in the somato-dendritic direction for passive dendritic trees. For example, an injection of current at the soma will result in the same voltage response at the respective dendritic sites in the detailed and reduced models, therefore preserving the bidirectional communication between the soma and the dendrites,” Amsalem confirms.\nAn important tool for computational brain science\nAnother crucial benefit of \nNeuron_Reduce\n is that it preserves the identity of individual synapses and their respective dendrites. It also retains specific membrane properties and dendritic nonlinearities, therefore maintaining specific dendritic computations. Furthermore, \nNeuron_Reduce\n also conserves the passive cable properties (\nR\nm\n, \nR\na\n, and \nC\nm\n) of the detailed model, thus preserving synaptic integration and other temporal aspects of the detailed model.\n“In the course of applying computational approaches, initially to the mouse brain and ultimately, the human brain, any trick in the box may be needed to make this computationally possible,” points out Blue Brain Director of Computing, Prof. Felix Schürmann. “This includes new generations of computers, innovation in simulation software and more compact modelling formulas such as \nNeuron_Reduce\n. \nNeuron_Reduce\n can be used not only for more efficient numerical simulations but also for novel neuromorphic hardware adaptations, which today are not able to cope with the cellular complexity present in biophysically detailed tissue models. This reduction method may also allow this gap to be bridged by reducing more detailed models to a representation that is amenable for neuromorphic hardware implementation,” Schürmann concludes.\n“When modelling brain tissue in biophysical detail as we do in the Blue Brain Project, the cost of the simulation in terms of memory requirements or time to solution (due to the number of calculations that need to be performed) matters considerably,” explains Pramod Kumbhar, a High Performance Computing expert at the Blue Brain Project. “\nNeuron_Reduce\n is extremely exciting as it opens the path for a novel type of reduced models that crucially maintain important details of the model but possibly run 40-250x faster. This complements efforts we recently have made on accelerating the simulation technology,” Kumbhar concludes.\nThe Neuron_Reduce algorithm and the models that were used in the paper, together with detailed examples for the usage of the algorithm, are publicly available on GitHub ().", "summary": "Scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the EPFL Blue Brain Project have developed ‘Neuron_Reduce’, a new computational tool that provides the scientific community with a straightforward capability to simplify complex neuron models of any cell type and still faithfully preserve its input-output properties while significantly reducing simulation run-time.", "claim": "Scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the EPFL Blue Brain Project have developed ‘Neuron_Reduce’, a new computational tool that provides the scientific community with a straightforward capability to simplify complex neuron models of any cell type and still faithfully preserve his input-output properties while significantly reducing simulation run-time.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [45, 45], "noise": false}

With four colleagues who, like him, study mechanical engineering at EPFL and are passionate about space technology, Danylo designed and produced a miniature rocket with the support of the Space Engineering Center (eSpace). The device, around 1.5 meters long and sporting a powerful engine, is not your traditional model rocket. The real innovation is the control system, which the students invented for their Bachelor’s project. “Our goal is to develop rockets that can achieve a soft, vertical landing,” said Danylo.\nA rocket capable of making a precision landing is still a way off. But over the course of five launches the team got past the first major hurdle, which was to stabilize the device vertically at low speeds, specifically when it reached the highest point in its flight, at an altitude of nearly 200 meters.\nThe control system developed by the students consists of a pressurized CO2 gas canister equipped with four valves that feed out the sides of the rocket fuselage. The system kicks in four seconds following launch, after the engine – designed by a US model rocket association – has already finished its burn. When the control system valves open, pressure is released from the pressurized CO2 reservoir. This creates jets whose thrust modifies the attitude of the rocket at the desired point in time.\nFor the system to function properly, special attention is paid to the structure of the rocket and the weight of the various components. Each of the five students contributed his own expertise. Danylo handled the electronics side of things, i.e. the onboard computer located in the nose. Raimondo Pictet ran the flight behavior simulations. Mikael Martins Gaspar developed the launch station and the ignition system. Gauthier Rouaze dealt with the design and production of the payload, including the valves, and helped Xavier Collaud in building the booster. Xavier was also in charge of the rocket design, including the fins.\nAn unusual device\n“The shape and size of the fins are key,” said Xavier. They determine the location of the center of pressure relative to the center of gravity, which is a fundamental piece of information for ensuring optimal stability and thrust.”\n“With 60 bars of pressure and 200 newtons of thrust, it’s a unique and highly sophisticated engine,” said Nikolay Mullin, the project supervisor at eSpace. “This experience allowed the students to acquire some basic techniques, which also apply to the construction of large-scale rockets.”\nDanylo Malyuta hopes to continue this experience by developing new and better prototypes. “We’re looking mainly at testing a more powerful reaction control system and maybe even movable fins.”\nPicture: ©A.Herzog, EPFL 2015.

{"id": 677, "text": "On November 25, 1915, Albert Einstein presented his theory of general relativity at the Prussian Academy of Science. Time and space became just two sides of a single coin, and we never saw things in quite the same way again. The Universe got a birthday with the Big Bang, GPS satellites that use the same equations could be developed, much to drivers’ delight, and the portrait of the physicist sticking his tongue out has become the iconic image of the genius. Today, Anais Rassat and her colleagues are launching an animated film to explain the theory to the public.\nThis isn’t the EPFL physicist’s first shot at communicating difficult scientific concepts to the layperson. That happened in Hyde Park, where she took to a podium amongst all sorts of religious orators and political satirists. She has been a Huffington Post contributor, lead of Euclid's education and public outreach activities Project, a member of the TedX Paris committee, a LIFT conference participant… In short, she combines her passion for research with her vocation as a scientific communicator, and explains the reasons behind her commitment.\nPhysicists are saying that the 100-year mark of general relativity is not just another birthday. Do you feel this way? \nAnais Rassat: This was an extraordinary moment in science, one that changed the world. For a century, or nearly a century, relativity has been practically unassailable. It gave a verifiable explanation for the phenomenon of gravity; it allowed us to give the Universe a birth date, to imagine the Big Bang, whereas before, we didn’t even know if it had a beginning. At a more down to earth level, without Einstein’s equations, GPS satellites wouldn’t work. At the same time, we’re coming the point where the theory appears to be reaching its limits. In the late 90s we realized that the Universe was accelerating. That doesn’t jive with the equations, which basically tell us what the Universe should look like as a function of the matter that’s in it. In reality, for the theory of relativity to explain the Universe accurately, there would need to be a whole lot more matter than what is observed.\nDoes that mean the theory is wrong, or has mistakes in it? \nThat’s exactly what I’m trying to explain to the public. In science, we don’t talk about absolute truth. The theory of relativity is correct insomuch as it agrees with observations. And for it to agree, we’ve introduced, among other things, the concept of dark matter. Yet recent observations are giving us very good reason to think that this invisible matter actually exists. It must be in the form of exotic particles, we don’t yet know exactly.\nThe theory had somehow predicted the existence of this matter even before we observed it? \nThat’s probably the case. In fact, it’s possible that general relativity only describes about 5% of the Universe, in other words, visible matter. Dark matter makes up another 25%. The remaining 70% would be dark energy, a sort of exotic force that decrees that the laws of gravity change at the very large scale. But that introduces more complex problems. It’s possible that it doesn’t really exist, and corresponds instead to a problem in the theory. That’s why I try not to talk about it too much! Whatever the case may be, we have a theory that precisely explains everything that we can directly observe, but doesn’t account for up to 95% of everything that exists!\nDo you think we’ll figure it out in the near future? \nA lot could happen in the next 20 to 30 years. For example via the Euclid project, which I’m involved with along with 1300 other physicists from all over the world. Some people think that the equations should be changed to correspond to the observations, and others think that we should add other elements that still haven’t been observed, like dark energy. We will map out the Universe in detail and obtain new elements of a solution. The final goal is to understand if the theory needs to be changed, or if there are new elements that exist that have been invisible up to this point.\nLet’s go back to your animation. It doesn’t go into these details. \nIt’s a film for the public, and a way of giving this historically important scientific anniversary some visibility. I’ve been preparing this for years with director Jamie Lochhead. Together, we came up with the scenario, and the lion’s share of the work was done by animation expert Eoin Duffy. Finally, we had the good fortune to obtain the participation of David Tennant, a British actor famous for having incarnated the main character in Doctor Who, for the voice-over. Our project was funded by the British Science and Technology Facilities Council.\nYou seem to have a very good network of scientific communicators on the other side of the Channel!\nIt was in England that I began to be interested in the issue of scientific communication. I was writing the introduction to my thesis, fifty or so pages in which I had to recount the entire history of cosmology, among other things. It seemed to me that I could do a better job of this by explaining it to the public. I went to Hyde Park in London, to the well-known “Speaker’s Corner,” where anyone can stand up on a soapbox and hold forth on anything their heart desires. I had brought a telescope along for observing the Sun and a huge poster on which I had written “ask me about the Big Bang.” I found myself among lots of other speakers, mostly carrying on about religion or politics, and I did some speed communication, a bit like speed dating. I gave myself three minutes to give my speech, no more.\nWas it a good experience? \nI found that it helped me better understand my own subject matter. I learned to speak without using jargon. That’s essential, because the more you use a specialized language, the more you lose sight of what you really want to say. You sometimes even forget what the fundamental question you’re trying to answer is. I discovered that by communicating to the public, I was able to gain perspective on my own work.\nBe that as it may, scientific communication doesn’t count for much on an academic CV. \nEven so, it’s an investment that could realistically have an enormous return. Eventually, if you have the public’s support, you will obtain funding to do your research. But it’s a collective investment, which benefits the entire scientific community. Hence the importance of motivating individuals and rewarding this kind of ability. Fortunately, things are changing and communication with the public is becoming increasingly valued. For example, if you are applying for a position at NASA, this aspect counts for 25% of the evaluation.\nIs it part of scientists’ mission to gain public support? \nAs scientists we have a responsibility. We’re funded by the public, and we owe them something in return. In a time of crisis, such as the one we’re currently in, I’m often asked why we should continue to fund basic research. My favorite example is the discovery of quantum mechanics. We had funded this research in the 1930s, at a time of economic and social crisis far greater than anything we’re experiencing today. Yet without this research, we wouldn’t now have computers or the Internet. Science transforms society, sometimes in unpredictable ways, but it has always and will always do so.\nScience also brings about social change, and new ways of seeing the world. \nOf course. That’s what I call cultural capital, as opposed to technological capital. Where did we come from? What is our place in the Universe? These are very good questions that are important in themselves, but they also have a real impact on how we see the world. For example, when you realize that we’re not at the center of the Universe, that our solar system is just one of innumerable solar systems in our galaxy, and that there are billions of galaxies… that understanding unites us and brings us closer together as human beings. I don’t want to wax philosophical, but I think that this vision puts plenty of things into perspective and opens up new ways of thinking about who we are.", "summary": "Time and space are celebrating their 100th wedding anniversary.

{"id": 682, "text": "Severe droughts and storms, bitter cold, intense sunlight and thicker cloud cover might sound like the stuff of science fiction. But like it or not, this is the future that awaits us as climate change takes hold. Just half a century from now, these extreme conditions will affect energy demand and push our supply systems to their limits. Because today’s renewable energy systems are designed with current weather patterns in mind, they will no longer meet demand for power as our climate evolves. Researchers at EPFL have developed a stochastic-robust optimization simulation method to consider both standard variations and extreme weather events. Their findings have been published in the journal \nNature Energy\n.\nSmart Grid © 3alexd\nNumerous researchers in the energy sector are working on new, sustainable energy supply solutions. Yet very few of these systems consider the influence of future climate variability because, until now, there has been no robust method that takes a holistic view of climate change. The world will be a very different place in 2070, not least as extreme weather events become much more commonplace. Scientists working on tomorrow’s energy systems need to factor this into their thinking today. “We observed that current energy systems are designed in a way that makes them highly susceptible to extreme weather events such as storms and heat waves,” says Dasun Perera, a scientist at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB). “We also found that climate variability will result in significant fluctuations in renewable power being fed into grids as well as energy demand. This will make it difficult to match the energy demand and renewable power generation. Dealing with the effects of climate change is going to prove harder than we previously thought.” Perera focused in particular on renewable energy microgrids.\nWinter storm covers solar panels ©\n2ndLookGraphics\nThe research team examined the impact of weather extremes and variations on both energy demand and the resilience of energy supply systems, deliberately approaching the issue from a brand-new angle. “Everyone’s talking about how energy production is driving climate change,” says Perera. “But, to our surprise, nobody had tried to connect these two issues holistically. Climate scientists focus on climate change, while energy experts concentrate on energy systems and grids. As the growing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events puts our energy systems under strain, we realized it was high time to look at the bigger picture.”\nFailing to take climate mitigation and adaptation seriously could have severe, even disastrous consequences in the near and long term, disrupting energy supplies and causing partial or total power outages. Dealing with the fallout could prove extremely costly for cities and urban areas. Some 3.5 billion people currently live in urban areas, consuming two-thirds of the world’s primary energy supply and producing 70% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. “If we do nothing, our current energy systems will no longer be able to meet demand,” says Jean-Louis Scartezzini, who heads the LESO-PB lab at EPFL.\nEurope from space at night with city lights showing European cities © Nasa\nThe researchers applied their method to 30 cities throughout Sweden, including at northerly and more southerly latitudes, considering 13 climate change scenarios. They found that uncertainties in renewable energy potential and demand could lead to a significant performance gap brought about by future climate variations and a drop in power supply reliability. Under extreme conditions, hourly demand for heating and cooling across the country’s current residential housing stock could be anywhere between 50% and 400% higher than the historical 20-year average.

They do this by binding to a specific DNA sequence, from where they can control the rate of its transcription from DNA to messenger RNA, which then is translated into proteins.\nStem cells in the body grow into different cell types. This happens as the stem cell divides into two cells, then four, and so forth. During this cell division most transcription factors are excluded from the chromosomes. However, some remain attached and “bookmark” specific genes for the new cells. While the biological function of bookmarking is still unclear, it may be involved in maintaining the phenotype of normal and cancer cells during cell division.\nIn addition, gene bookmarking is still largely unexplored in most types of stem cells types, and we don’t know whether it plays a role in determining what type of cell a stem cell will grow into.\nA new bookmarking transcription factor \nThe lab of  found that a much-studied transcription factor called Sox2 also bookmarks genes during stem cell division. Sox2 is known to be involved in maintaining embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells —which become the cells of the brain and spinal cord — and even cancer stem cells.\nSox2 is also one of the four reprogramming factors that make induced pluripotent stem cells — non-embryonic stem cells taken from other parts of the adult body. Because of this, Sox2 is heavily involved in research on these cells, an emerging and very promising field of regenerative medicine.\nCombining different microscopy techniques, the scientists observed that Sox2 attaches on chromosomes during cell division. They also used a method called ChIP-sequencing, which can analyze protein interactions with DNA across the entire genome. The technique revealed that Sox2 binds to various chromosomes of embryonic stem cells during division, bookmarking a small set of genes for the next generation of cells.\nNaturally, the researchers wanted to know how important this is in determining what kind of cell the embryonic stem cell will become. For this, they used genetic techniques to remove Sox2 entirely from cell division, and specifically at the point where cell division ends and the new cells are produced. They found that the absence of Sox2 during cell division severely limited the embryonic stem cells in terms of what types of cells they could differentiate into – referred to as “cell fate”. The loss of Sox2 also rendered them unable to differentiate into stem cells of the brain and spinal cord, although they could still be reprogrammed efficiently to become induced pluripotent stem cells.\n“We already knew that a minority of transcription factors remain bound to chromosomes during cell division,” says David Suter. “It was also thought for a long time that chromosome binding during cell division might influence cell fate decisions.”\nThis study demonstrates not only that Sox2 is also involved in gene bookmarking during cell division, but that this bookmarking in general regulates cell fate decisions of stem cells. This discovery opens new windows in our understanding of stem cell biology and opens new possibilities for their use in biotechnology and medicine. “Our findings have implications that go beyond the particular case of Sox2 bookmarking in embryonic stem cells,” says Suter, who remains cautious but visibly excited about the breakthrough.\nThis work also included contributions from \n and its Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility (BBCF). It was funded by the Carigest foundation, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Novartis Foundation for Biomedical Research.\nReference\nCédric Deluz, Elias T.

{"id": 685, "text": "The pilot program, aimed at promoting a tenure-track system in Croatia, was officially launched in May 2018. It was set up by EPFL, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education, the Croatian Ministry of Regional Development and the Croatian Science Foundation (CSF). The aim is to boost the career prospects of Croatia’s most promising researchers.\nTo limit brain drain, the program is based on a tenure-track system, which EPFL has successfully been using since 2000. “Young researchers are awarded assistant-professor status and have a budget of around CHF 1.1 million, a team, equipment and administrative support, so that they can conduct their research independently,” explains Olivier Küttel, Head of International Affairs at EPFL, who has been working on the project since 2013. “After five years, if all goes well, they are guaranteed a permanent position.”\nOngoing collaboration\nSeveral EPFL professors are taking part in the project as mentors, such as Paolo Ricci, head of the theory group at EPFL’s . Their role is to offer strategic and administrative advice to young researchers, while gaining insight into their research topics.\nRicci himself benefited from EPFL’s tenure-track system. “It may be the best thing that’s ever happened to me during my scientific career. I had an excellent mentor, and taking part in this program was the least I could do to give something back after the great support I received,” he says.\nHe made his first trip to the University of Zagreb last week to meet his mentee, Kosuke Nomura, along with his team. “Croatia is growing fast in scientific terms. I’ve seen the enthusiasm of these young researchers and their desire to contribute to Croatia’s development.”\nTamara Nikšić (mentor, University of Zagreb), Kosuke Nomura \n(assistant professor, University of Zagreb)\n, Paolo Ricci (mentor, EPFL) © Kosuke Nomura (edited)\nHelping young researchers\nNomura is one of the three talented researchers selected for this project. Originally from Japan, he has close links with Croatia, having held a post-doctoral position at the University of Zagreb from 2015 to 2018. “The research environment was very stimulating, and I really wanted to carry on my work here. I heard about the program and decided to give it a go,” he explains.\nWhen Nomura learned that his application had been successful, he had just moved back to Japan and was a few weeks into a permanent job at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. There were several factors behind his decision to accept this new challenge: “In Zagreb, I could be independent and form my own working group. That wasn’t possible in Japan. Plus, I love Croatia!”\nNomura packed his bags and moved back to the Croatian capital in May 2019 to start his research project in the field of theoretical nuclear physics, specifically “”. By combining mathematical modelling and advanced scientific computing, his ultimate aim is to develop a universal theoretical framework for describing the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei.\n“Exotic Nuclear Structure and Dynamics” project team: \nMarko Imbrisak (PhD student), Tamara \nNikšić\n (mentor, University of Zagreb), Kosuke Nomura (assistant professor, University of Zagreb), Paolo Ricci (mentor, EPFL), Konstantinos Karakatsanis (Postdoc, University of Zagreb) © Kosuke Nomura\nBigger ambitions\n“This initiative offers key benefits for researchers, such as being able to conduct research independently and being provided with resources and mentoring, but it also has the potential to change the Croatian system which, very often, is overly complicated and limits career opportunities,” adds Küttel. “The project is a template that should be applied Europe-wide. It could be used as a reference for decisions made as part of the Horizon Europe program.”\nFor Nomura, the project offers much more than a permanent position: “It’s very rewarding. In addition to being able to focus on my research, I’m developing my career through teaching.” Longer term, Nomura hopes to form a group of experts and make Europe more influential in the field of theoretical nuclear physics.", "summary": "For several years now, EPFL has been working closely with the Croatian authorities to give young researchers the opportunity to lead research programs in Croatia.

{"id": 687, "text": "Claude Nicollier, an EPFL professor since 2004, will always be known as Switzerland’s first man in space. He took part in four US space shuttle missions in the 1990s; the first aboard the space shuttle \nAtlantis\n on an eight-day mission some 300 km above Earth. To mark the 25\nth\n anniversary of that flight, which took place from July 31 to August 8, 1992, SwissApollo is holding a commemorative event at EPFL’s SwissTech Convention Center on 3 November. We met with Nicollier – a modest man with a warm smile – to get a first-hand account of his amazing story.\n- Can you tell us how your first space mission came about?\n\"\nAn astronaut’s first space mission is like all important firsts in life: unforgettable. My first mission was the culmination of 14 years of training, starting the day when the European Space Agency selected me for the team. The \nChallenger\n disaster in 1986 delayed my flight for six years. Delays were also caused by the fact that I was the only non-American taking the full Space Shuttle Mission Specialist training – NASA had told me that I would take part only in mis­sions where the payload contained a substantial amount of ESA equipment. That was true for the \nAtlantis\n, which carried an Italian tethered satellite system and the EURECA satellite [European Retrievable Carrier, now on display at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Luzern].\n- What were the days leading up to the mission like?\nWe were flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida three days before take-off, on one of the T-38 Mission Support Aircraft that NASA used to carry astronauts. Around two weeks earlier, at the same site, we did what NASA called a “TCDT” – terminal count-down demonstration test – a kind of trial run where we go through every step of the take-off procedure except starting the engines. NASA simulators had given us a good idea of what take-off would be like. But on the day of take-off, when we experienced it for real and the entire shuttle started shaking, it was an extraordinary feeling.\n- What did it feel like?\nThere was a lot of shaking and vibration. The space shuttle weighs 2,000 metric tons, so you need 3,000 metric tons of power just to get it off the ground. It feels like you’re in a machine of a very, very large mass. Out of the seven astronauts on the mission, just two of us were rookies: Franco Malerba, Italy’s first astronaut, and me. We reached orbit in just eight and a half minutes. We felt anxious, of course – because our mission was dangerous, no doubt about it – but also like we were doing something completely crazy, with such a display of force and fuel. We felt as if we were at the very start of a big adventure. And we knew we had our work cut out for us; deploying the EURECA from the payload was a fairly routine operation, but we were a lot less certain about how the tethered satellite system deployment would go.\nPicture taken by the astronauts to express their concerns about the deployment of the tethered satellite system.\n- \nAnd what did zero gravity feel like?\nLike we were floating. It was disconcerting at first, especially when we shut off the main engines. When you go from 1 G to 0 G, it feels like there’s a force lifting you up. I was always afraid of banging my head on the ceiling! Plus we were wearing heavy orange space suits that restricted our movement. We also felt nauseous, like we were seasick. But we had to learn to live under those conditions. It was hard to sleep the first night. The next day we felt better, but the zero gravity still bothered us. It took me a full 48 hours to get over it. At the same time, it was all fantastic – the sky was filled with stars at night, and during the day we could see the Earth rapidly passing by.\n- But you got the job done, despite the physical discomfort...\nI had an important role to play in the EURECA deployment: operating the robotic arm that sent out the satellite. Once it was deployed, we had to fly in formation with the satellite for a few hours until ground control activated a propulsion system that lifted the satellite to a higher orbit. Then we moved to the next step, deploying the tethered satellite system. And there we ran into all kinds of problems. I would say that out of my four missions, that was the part that went the least well. The satellite was connected to the shuttle by a 20-km long cable. We were afraid the cable would slacken, and that’s exactly what happened, after only 200 meters had been released.\n- What was the problem?\nThe cable dispenser jammed. Since the cable was elastic, the satellite came back towards us. The cable had lost all tension at that point. Given the gravity gradient, the satellite was going to drift upwards. We had to make sure the satellite was properly oriented for when the cable would eventually tighten so that the satellite wouldn’t start spinning. We controlled the cable’s attitude using an alphanumeric keypad, which was like trying to drive a truck by pressing buttons on a keyboard! Not easy! We were really sweating! In the end we were able to stabilize the satellite and bring it back to the shuttle.\nIn this video, the astronauts describe the mission. \n- Can you share any other highlights from the mission?\nThere was the televised conversation with Adolf Ogi, then a Swiss Federal Councilor, during which he made his famous comment: \nFreude herrscht\n! Which means, maybe, joy? That powerful expression became a principle, almost an ideology, both for me and for him. An extremely positive message.\n- What has changed with these types of missions today?\nMainly that procedures aren’t written on paper anymore! And that space missions get much more media coverage these days. We saw that recently with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who posted frequently on social networks during his mission on the International Space Station. Our missions took place almost in secret. Not that they were easier – sometimes they were even harder because we were doing things nobody had ever done before. Today, a lot of the work astronauts do at the International Space Station has already been mapped out. The spirit of our space shuttle missions was different – we were headed into the great unknown! Our missions were shorter and always involved extremely complicated, and pretty crazy, tasks. Another difference is that we could talk with our families for just 20 minutes a week. But today, thanks to digital phones, astronauts can stay in regular contact with their loved ones.\nThe show \nClaude Nicollier - Un Suisse dans l’espace\n will take place at the SwissTech Convention Center at 8pm on Friday, 3 November and will be attended by Nicollier and key people from his life including Derib, a cartoonist and childhood friend, astronauts Charlie Duke and Jean-François Clervoy, and astrophysicist Michel Mayor. \nInformation and tickets at \nExpress bio\nBorn in Vevey on 2 September 1944.\n1966: Became a Swiss Air Force pilot flying Hawker Hunter aircraft.\n1970: Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Lausanne.\n1970–1973: Worked as a graduate scientist at the University of Lausanne’s Institute of Astronomy and the Geneva Observatory.\n1976: Obtained a fellowship at the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Space Science Department.\n1978: Selected by the ESA to become a member of the first group of European astronauts.\n1980: Joined NASA, while remaining with the ESA, for astronaut training as a Mission Specialist.\n1992: Carried out the first of his four space shuttle missions, aboard the \nAtlantis\n (from July 31 to August 8).

But millions of small ideas like these, often born during interminable hours stuck in traffic jams, are forever lost by the wayside. They simply never have the chance to make their way out of the heads of their creators and onto the car manufacturers’ drawing boards.

The first Fusebox challenge, in collaboration with PSA Peugeot Citroën, ask people to imagine future cars. \n Creative thinking platforms are based on a simple concept: that outside their research and development departments, universities and companies have thousands of employees who have ideas for solutions to ordinary problems, define new needs and come up with new uses for things. Most of the time these ideas are lost along the way because there’s no opportunity for them to be shared. \n Fusebox is open to the entire campus community, from students to administrative and technical staff to professors. It’s inspired by the experience of business partners who have successfully set up similar idea platforms. In order to make the game more enticing, the most talented participants will receive points based on the relevance and frequency of their contributions – and at the end of the school year a prize will be awarded to the best idea generator. \nAn open model and ideas for everyone \n The ideas that are shared on the platform belong to everyone – a bit like the open source software model. Fusebox is also accessible outside the EPFL campus, and external contributions are welcome. \n Fusebox will regularly launch new challenges drawn from a wide variety of areas, such an energy, robotics, and applications for new materials. To make sure that the ideas generated don’t end up just gathering dust on a shelf, EPFL will insure the participation of a business and institutionnal partner in each contest. PSA Peugeot Citroën, already present on campus, will naturally be leading the future car challenge launched on October 14. \n The Alcoa Foundation is partnering in the project.

{"id": 690, "text": "Professor Fabien Sorin and doctoral assistant Andreas Leber, at the Laboratory of Photonic Materials and Fibre Devices (FIMAP) in EPFL’s School of Engineering, have developed a technology that can be used to detect a body’s movements – and a whole lot more. “Imagine clothing or hospital bed sheets capable of monitoring your breathing and other vital movements, or AI-powered textiles that allow robots to interact more safely and intuitively with humans” says Leber. “The soft transmission lines that we’ve developed open the door to all of this.”\nStretching, pressing and twisting\nThe researchers invented a sensor that can detect different kinds of fabric deformation such as stretch, pressure and torque – all at the same time. “Finding a method for differentiating all these convoluted movements was our biggest challenge, because it is very difficult for sensors to measure several stimulations simultaneously,” says Leber. “Also, conventional sensors in textiles have several drawbacks. First, they are fragile and break easily. Second, you need a lot of them to cover a large area, which eliminates many of the advantages of fabrics. And third, each type of conventional sensor can detect only one kind of deformation.”\nBut by incorporating concepts from reflectometry, Sorin and Leber were able to create soft fiber-shaped sensors that open up new doors for smart textiles. “Our technology works similar to a radar, but it sends out electrical pulses instead of electromagnetic waves,” explains Leber. “That means our fiber sensors operate like transmission lines, known from high-frequency communication. The system measures the time between when a signal is sent out and when it’s received, and uses that to determine the exact location, type and intensity of deformation.” This kind of detection technology has never before been used in structures combining extended mechanical flexibility and high electronic performance, which are key for measuring deformations.\nLiquid metal and fiber optics processing\nCreating the fibers is a complex task involving an optical fiber fabrication process applied to unusual materials such as elastomers or liquid metals that serve as the conductors. “The structure includes micrometer-size features and has to be perfect, otherwise it won’t work,” says Leber. With these fibers, the entire surface of a fabric becomes one large sensor. “The trick was to create transmission lines made entirely of soft materials, using a simple method that can be scaled up,” adds Sorin. The team’s research drew on a variety of disciplines including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and materials science. The next step will be to make the technology more portable by reducing the footprint of peripheral electronics.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed electronic fibers that, when embedded in textiles, can collect a wealth of information about our bodies by measuring subtle and complex fabrics deformations.

This is a clear sign of the solid health of EPFL's business ecosystem. Among the 15 or so spin-offs created each year, several manage to quickly find investors in order to make their first hires, fine-tune a prototype or start production.\n“While total funds didn't surpass CHF 50 million before 2010, they have regularly exceeded CHF 100 million ever since,” commented Hervé Lebret, head of the Innogrant fund, which helps EPFL companies to get off the ground. “But who knows whether 2017 will be as flush as 2016.” The CHF 397 million brought in during this record year is equal to more than a third of all of the capital raised by companies on campus since the Science Park was created in 1993.\nInnovation Park has been expanded, collaborations with laboratories have been made easier, and there is now more assistance available to start-ups, both in terms of financing and coaching. All these factors have helped to create an environment on campus that is conducive to the development of start-ups over the years. No official ranking exists of places that are of interest to investors, but several indicators put the campus and the wider region in a solid position. A study by Atomico, an international technology investment firm headquartered in London, entitled “The State of European Tech”, mentioned Lausanne four times, in relation to: EPFL, quality of life, Faceshift (a spin-off bought by Apple) and Mindmaze.\nThe sharp rise in venture capital across Europe over the last three years seems to have benefited EPFL-related companies. Half of funded start-ups found some funding in Switzerland, a quarter in Europe and the rest went further afield, to the USA and Asia.\nThe magnet effect of a major international player\nNo sector seems to be particularly sought after or spurned by investors looking at EPFL. Thanks to the CHF 100 million invested in Mindmaze, biotechs topped the list with CHF 121.05 million, followed by IT (CHF 62.4 million) and medtech (CHF 49.7 million). This is unsurprising, as these are the sectors with the highest number of start-ups. “EPFL’s wide diversification will serve it well in the future,” according to Lebret.\nBut what’s preventing the region from competing even more closely with major cities in terms of start-up creation? “We need a major international company that would generate a magnet effect,” says Lebret. “A place that would bring in top engineers and scientists who then decide to stay in the region and maybe turn around a few years later and create a start-up. These new arrivals attract investors to the region and help reduce the risk of start-ups going offshore when they increase their capital.” So far, no funded spin-off has left the region for good, although some of them have also set up offices outside the country.", "summary": "Start-ups linked to EPFL raised almost CHF 400 million this year – that’s over 50% more than in 2014, the last record year.

{"id": 692, "text": "Geologists have found evidence of a vast hollow chamber at the heart of the Matterhorn. Using triple-woven spectroscopic probes, they discovered and then re-created in three dimensions the enormous hollow chamber in the deep interior of the mountain. They measured the superficial rocky external layer, which has an average depth of 15 meters, and mapped with precision several superficial fracture lines. The mountain is dangerously unstable, they say. But they add that surrounding populations have nothing to worry about, because due to its world-famous pyramidal shape, the Matterhorn will simply collapse in upon itself without generating dangerous rockslides along its flanks. The discovery was recently published in the journal Nature Apocalypses.\n “The issue is not if it will collapse, but when. It could happen in a thousand years, or it could happen next week,” warns study author Jean-Manu Torthézy. “The population has, in principle, nothing to worry about. But they could get a rude shock some morning when they wake up!” Because instead of the glorious and iconic symbol of the Swiss Alps on the horizon, the inhabitants of Zermatt would wake up to a smooth mountain pasture above the village. “According to our computer models of the Matterhorn, it should fall from its current height of 4,478 meters to a rounded dome of only 2,120 meters.” \n All mountains eventually disappear, the geologist reminds us. But normally this occurs over millions of years as part of a slow process of erosion. “In the very unusual case of the Matterhorn, it will be a little quicker and certainly a lot louder!”\n Local herders were the first to raise the alarm that something was amiss. The crevices that open into the mountain’s inner chamber are deadly traps for the animals grazing the alpine pastures. “Goatherds are familiar with them and have been passing down their location for generations, but lately new fissures have appeared and others that were barely wide enough for a ballpoint pen are now large enough to swallow a cow,” says Torthézy. \n The Federal Office of Hiking Tourism (FOTP) has already begun preparing for post-Matterhorn reality. In discussion with the country’s primary postcard producers, they are trying to find the best viewpoint for promoting the international image of the Valais ski resort, says FOTP director Stefan Müller.

{"id": 693, "text": "Therapeutic cancer vaccines were first developed 100 years ago and have remained broadly ineffective to date. Before tangible results can be achieved, two major obstacles must be overcome. Firstly, since tumor mutations are unique to each patient, cancer cell antigens must be targeted extremely precisely, which is very hard to achieve. Secondly, a safe system is needed to deliver the vaccine to the right location and achieve a strong and specific immune response.\nLi Tang’s team at EPFL’s School of Engineering is coming up with a solution to the delivery problem. The researchers have used a polymerization technique called polycondensation to develop a prototype vaccine that can travel automatically to the desired location and activate immune cells there. The patented technique has been successfully tested in mice and is the topic of a paper appearing in . Li Tang has also co-founded a startup called , with partners that are working on an algorithm for quickly and accurately predicting mutated tumor antigens. Together, the two techniques should result in a new and better cancer vaccine in the next several years.\nHelping the body to defend itself\nMost vaccines – against measles and tetanus for example – are preventive. Healthy individuals are inoculated with weakened or inactivated parts of a virus, which prompt their immune systems to produce antibodies. This prepares the body to defend itself against future infection.\nHowever, the aim of a therapeutic cancer vaccine is not to prevent the disease, but to help the body defend itself against a disease that is already present. “There are various sorts of immunotherapies other than vaccines, but some patients don’t respond well to them. The vaccine could be combined with those immunotherapies to obtain the best possible immune response,” explains Li Tang. Another advantage is that vaccines should reduce the risk of relapse.\nBut how does it all work?\nAvoiding getting lost in the blood stream\nDelivering a cancer vaccine to the immune system involves various stages. First, the patient is inoculated with the vaccine subcutaneously. The vaccine will thus travel to the lymph nodes, where there are lots of immune cells. Once there, the vaccine is expected to penetrate dendritic cells, which act as a kind of alert mechanism. If the vaccine stimulates them correctly, the dendritic cells present specific antigens to cancer-fighting T-cells, a process that activates and trains the T-cells to attack them.\nThe procedure appears simple, but is extremely hard to put into practice. Because they are very small, the components of a vaccine tend to disperse or be absorbed in the blood stream before reaching the lymph nodes.\nTo overcome that obstacle, Li Tang has developed a system that chemically binds the vaccine’s parts together to form a larger entity. The new vaccine, named Polycondensate Neoepitope (PNE), consists of neoantigens (mutated antigens specific to the tumor to be attacked) and an adjuvant. When combined within a solvent, the components naturally bind together, forming an entity that is too large to be absorbed by blood vessels and that travels naturally to the lymph nodes.\nThe vaccin is too large to be absorbed by blood vessels : it travels naturally to the lymph nodes © LBI / EPFL\nOnce inside a dendritic cell, the vaccine components separate again. This enables the dendritic cell to present the right antigens to the T-cells, causing a powerful immune response. “This new vaccine, combined with a highly advanced analysis of each patient’s neoantigens, should allow cancer patients’ immune systems to be activated in a personalized and safe way,” says Li Tang.\nThe team is still perfecting the stage at which the tumor-specific antigens are detected. “This identification stage is just as vital,” concludes Li Tang. “Since these neoantigens aren’t present in healthy cells, accurate identification will allow us to target tumor cells very precisely, without any toxicity in healthy tissue.”", "summary": "The only therapeutic cancer vaccine available on the market has so far showed very limited efficacy in clinical trials.

{"id": 694, "text": "Could there be another planet out there with a society at the same stage of technological advancement as ours? To help find out, EPFL scientist Claudio Grimaldi, working in association with the University of California, Berkeley, has developed a statistical model that gives researchers a new tool in the search for the kind of signals that an extraterrestrial society might emit. His method – described in an article appearing today in \nPNAS\n* – could also make the search cheaper and more efficient.\nAstrophysics initially wasn’t Grimaldi’s thing; he was interested more in the physics of condensed matter. Working at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter, his research involved calculating the probabilities of carbon nanotubes exchanging electrons. But then he wondered: if the nanotubes were stars and the electrons were signals generated by extraterrestrial societies, could we calculate the probability of detecting those signals more accurately?\nThis is not pie-in-the-sky research – scientists have been studying this possibility for nearly 60 years. Several research projects concerning the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) have been launched since the late 1950s, mainly in the United States. The idea is that an advanced civilization on another planet could be generating electromagnetic signals, and scientists on Earth might be able to pick up those signals using the latest high-performance radio telescopes.\nRenewed interest \nDespite considerable advances in radio astronomy and the increase in computing power since then, none of those projects has led to anything concrete. Some signals have been recorded, like the  in 1977, but scientists could not pinpoint their origin. And none of them has been repeated or seems credible enough to be attributable to alien life.\nBut that doesn’t mean scientists have given up. On the contrary, SETI has seen renewed interest following the discovery of the many exoplanets orbiting the billions of suns in our g alaxy. Researchers have designed sophisticated new instruments – like the Square Kilometre Array, a giant radio telescope being built in South Africa and Australia with a total collecting area of one square kilometer – that could pave the way to promising breakthroughs. And Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner recently announced an ambitious program called , which aims to cover 10 times more sky than previous searches and scan a much wider band of frequencies. Milner intends to fund his initiative with 100 million dollars over 10 years.\n“In reality, expanding the search to these magnitudes only increases our chances of finding something by very little. And if we still don’t detect any signals, we can’t necessarily conclude with much more certainty that there is no life out there,” says Grimaldi.\nStill a ways to go\nThe advantage of Grimaldi’s statistical model is that it lets scientists interpret both the success and failure to detect signals at varying distances from the Earth. His model employs Bayes’ theorem to calculate the remaining probability of detecting a signal within a given radius around our planet. For example, even if no signal is detected within a radius of 1,000 light years, there is still an over 10% chance that the Earth is within range of hundreds of similar signals from elsewhere in the galaxy, but that our radio telescopes are currently not powerful enough to detect them. However, that probability rises to nearly 100% if even just one signal is detected within the 1,000-light-year radius. In that case, we could be almost certain that our galaxy is full of alien life.\nAfter factoring in other parameters like the size of the galaxy and how closely packed its stars are, Grimaldi estimates that the probability of detecting a signal becomes very slight only at a radius of 40,000 light years. In other words, if no signals are detected at this distance from the Earth, we could reasonably conclude that no other civilization at the same level of technological development as ours is detectable in the galaxy. But so far, scientists have been able to search for signals within a radius of “just” 40 light years.\nSo there’s still a ways to go. Especially since these search methods can’t detect alien civilizations that may be in primordial stages or that are highly advanced but haven’t followed the same technological trajectory as ours.\nPicture:\n Schematic view of the Milky Way showing six isotropic extraterrestrial emission processes forming spherical shells filled by radio signals. The outer radii of the spherical shells are proportional to the time at which the signals were first emitted, while the thicknesses are proportional to the duration of the emissions. In this example, the Earth is illuminated by one of these signals. \n©\nClaudio Grimaldi.", "summary": "An EPFL scientist has developed a novel approach that boosts the chances of finding extraterrestrial intelligence in our galaxy.

{"id": 695, "text": "This Monday December 3rd was a big day for Astrocast. At 7:34pm Swiss time, the first satellite produced by this EPFL start-up took off from California on board a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The launch, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County, went smoothly. The rocket was carrying almost 70 satellites, which were gradually put into a sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 575km in the hours following take-off.\nAstrocast’s satellite is in the CubeSats category, which is a type of nanosatellite defined by a standard cubic shape measuring 10cm on each side. It consists of three units and is approximately the size of a shoebox. This satellite is for demonstration purposes, and a second one of the same type will be launched from India in January.\nThey represent the first in a long line of Astrocast satellites: they will be used to test the system that Astrocast plans to market, which will involve a further 80 satellites in orbit by 2022. This Internet-of-Things (IoT) system will connect millions of objects all over the Earth’s surface. It will enable Astrocast clients to monitor infrastructure and facilities remotely and at a much lower cost than existing methods.\nFor example, it will allow a company developing water purification machines, intended particularly for remote African villages, to maintain them much more efficiently. The machines will have a communication module inside them that will send water consumption and status data several times per day.\nThe SwissCube story continues\nTo set up the system, two sets of ten satellites are scheduled for launch in October 2019 and early 2020. They will make up the first part of Astrocast’s constellation, which will cover the Earth’s entire surface. Using the satellites in these two orbital planes, the company will sell an initial communication service to a number of interested clients.\nAstrocast employs around 40 people and was founded in September 2014 under its previous name, ELSE. In addition to its main office at EPFL Innovation Park, the company also has a branch on the US west coast.

{"id": 697, "text": "EPFL scientists have invented a new way to quantify – in real-time – glucose metabolism of cancerous tumors by making them bioluminesce. This new light probe is not radioactive and works on living organisms such as mice that carry the tumor cells. The technique requires tagged tumor cells, two jabs and a camera. The results are published in \nNature Methods\n.\nTake a mouse with a luciferase-tagged tumor. Luciferase-expressing tumors are made by taking a sample of the cancerous tumor from a patient, and chemically labeling them with luciferase, a class of oxidative enzymes that produce bioluminescence. These labeled cells are grown in mice to understand the basic biology of the cancer and for the development of effective cancer treatments.\nNext, inject a first compound in the mouse that doesn’t easily break down in the blood. Twenty-four hours later, inject a second compound that is designed to react only with the first under very specific conditions.\nThe reaction between the two compounds is engineered to produce bioluminescent light which escapes the body, like in fireflies, but happens where luciferase-expressing tumors have metabolized sugar. Point a CCD camera sensor at the body and you have a snapshot of the tumor’s metabolic levels. The amount of light produced is directly proportional to the amount of metabolized sugar.\n“We wanted to develop a tool to help create more effective cancer treatments,” explains EPFL chemist Elena Goun of Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry and Molecular Imaging who led the study. “Our new imaging technique allows us to quantify how much sugar is being metabolized in real-time, providing valuable information about the metabolic status of the tumor and the types of drugs that could deprive the tumor of its major energy source.”\nHow it works: from fireflies to cancer imaging\nGoun and her team found inspiration from the way fireflies glow and combined it with click-chemistry, a branch of chemical biology in which biocompatible molecules are designed to specifically “click” together in a tailored reaction that happens directly in the complex environment of the living organism.\nSince cancer has a high metabolic rate, it consumes sugar in large amounts. This process is important for cancer growth and metastasis but remains poorly understood due to the lack of non-invasive tools that work at the level of the entire organism.\nGoun’s idea was to engineer two click-molecules, one with sugar and the other with the “caged” luciferin, the light-emitting compound found in fireflies that make them glow. And it works.\nOnce the click-labeled sugar is eaten by the tumor, it reacts with this “caged” luciferin via the “click” reaction and produces bioluminescent light proportional to the amount of sugar entering the cells. She termed her firefly imaging technique \nBiGluc\n, short for “Bioluminescent glucose”.\nBiGluc could be used to understand the metabolic requirements of different tumors, opening avenues for the generation of novel, effective treatments.\nBiGluc in preclinical imaging of cancer metabolism and drug development\n“Our novel optical imaging technique has high clinical applicability and many advantages,” says Goun. “It is non-radioactive, highly sensitive and quantifiable, the reagents are stable for years, and the glow can be observed for many hours.”\nDue to its versatile nature, BiGluc could also be extended beyond cancer to image dysfunctional cells of many other important human pathologies in which changes in metabolism play a key role, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and many others.\n“What’s exciting about these results is that we have created the foundation for the development of an ultra-sensitive imaging platform for quantifying the uptake of many important metabolites that play a central role in multiple human diseases with the goal of creating more effective treatments,” says Goun.", "summary": "Cancerous tumors can be made to bioluminesce, like fireflies, according to the level of their glucose uptake, giving rise to a technique for quantifying metabolite absorption.

{"id": 706, "text": "Why do city dwellers so urgently need to get away? Statistics show that they cover a large number of kilometers in their free time, often travelling much longer distances than suburban residents. What are they after? And what is the energy cost? Research carried out at EPFL shows that, rather than making up for a supposed lack of green space, city dwellers also seek the density of other cities or the company of friends and family. And despite the distances they cover, their carbon footprint is lower than that of suburban residents. And for good reason: they use public transports more and cars less.\nThese conclusions contradict a hypothesis commonly advanced to explain the large number of kilometers covered by city dwellers: to enjoy nature and some quiet time, things not available at home. Under this same hypothesis, people who live in suburban areas are thought to take advantage of their surroundings and therefore do not need to get away in order to grill some sausages or build a snowman. This is referred to as the ‘barbecue effect’ or ‘offsetting effect.’ This explanation runs counter to the concept of the compact city that, from the transport perspective, should translate into lower per-capita energy use than in more sprawling cities.\nSébastien Munafò, a researcher in the Urban Sociology Laboratory, wanted to challenge the barbecue effect and made it the subject of his thesis. He took two cities, Geneva and Zurich, and divided them into three sectors: downtown, inner suburbs and outer suburbs. He then analyzed the daily and occasional comings and goings of residents, using figures from the “Mobility and Transport Microcensus” that is carried out every five years by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. When it comes to daily commuting, no surprises: urbanites don’t go far – nearly everything is close by – while suburban dwellers rack up the kilometers.\nNo link with urban density\n But when it comes to occasional travel, which is mainly dedicated to leisure-time activities, the reverse is true. City dwellers catch up with or even surpass suburbanites. Their numbers double, reaching 27,000 km per year and per person in Zurich and 18,500 km in Geneva. For people living in the inner and outer suburbs, these occasional trips add up to around one third of their total. This varies between 18,500 and 22,500 km per year and per person in the Zurich suburbs and between 14,000 and 18,800 km in the Geneva suburbs.\nA closer look at leisure-time travel disproves the theory of the barbecue effect. The researcher identifies two types of travel: compactophile trips, for which being in a city is an advantage, and naturophile trips, in pursuit of the advantages of lower density spaces. That is where the link between urban density and the quest for nature is broken. People living in Geneva tend to fall into the compactophile camp, even though Geneva has a higher population density than Zurich. People living in Zurich proper are in fact very naturophile. And suburbanites, especially near Zurich, commonly seek out nature.\n‘Urbanity effect’\n “The barbecue effect implies that one does not freely choose where one lives and that city dwellers find themselves prisoners of unpleasant surroundings,” said Sébastien. “But in most cases, city living is very expensive. Those who live there are thus making a choice, one that offers advantages as well.\" This means people decide where to live as a function of their lifestyle: the suburbs for those who like to be close to nature, or the city for those who prefer its density and diversity. And having a little patch of green nearby doesn’t keep urbanites from travelling extensively, because in the end that is also part of their lifestyle. “One could say that there is an urbanity effect: the more we live in cities, the more regularly we move around, the more comfortable we are travelling, and the better access we have to reliable means of transportation,” concludes the researcher.\nThis thesis was sponsored by Forum Vie Mobile, a SNCF think tank.", "summary": "Statistics show that urbanites travel thousands of miles during their leisure time.

{"id": 712, "text": "“Hidden Carbon”, the new project conducted at EPFL and ECAL Laboratory, is starting this week, with a preview on Wednesday 6 October and on display until 29 October. It actually has more the feeling of a manifesto: to transcend the high-tech aspect of new materials and explore their potential in our daily lives. Two renowned design schools, ENSCI in Paris and ECAL (Ecole Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne) in Renens, have responded to this challenge. “Hidden Carbon” presents the seven best projects where carbon takes other forms: for example; blown glass, light and sound.\nBecause of their exceptional ratio of rigidity to weight, carbon-fiber composite materials have become a reference in sport – even a high-tech icon. To the point of acquiring almost caricatural applications, dominated by their black esthetics, sometimes simply reproduced as \ntrompe l’œil\n!\nA growing number of objects thus evoke the presence of carbon in the product, simply to acquire a kind of technological status. This can distract from their principal value: forms and applications of a singular lightness with astonishingly high thermic, sound-related and electrical performance.\nThe aim of “Hidden Carbon” is to rediscover the relevance of this material by developing typologies of objects and innovative applications based mainly on their specific properties. Under the direction of Jean-François Dingjian for ENSCI-\nLes Ateliers\n and Alexis Georgacopoulos for ECAL, thirty students have taken up the challenge, working together with the Laboratory of Polymer and Composite Technology at EPFL, led by Jan-Anders Månson. The Suter Swiss-Composite Group has provided the design students with the most performant materials, to enable them to experiment with the associated implementation processes.\nHowever, in the end it’s the “Carbon Wizard” Bertrand Cardis and his \nChantier Décision\n which has made a decisive contribution by confronting the students with the realities of the industrial world, and then transforming the best projects into advanced models and prototypes. \nHidden Carbon, EPFL+ECAL Lab, 11 av. du 24-janvier, Renens.

{"id": 714, "text": "Most people are familiar with uranium as a fuel for nuclear power plants. And while that’s the most common application, this element is also used in many other fields, such as dyes, medical devices, and weapons. Scientists at EPFL’s Environmental Microbiology Laboratory (EML) have recently made an important discovery about uranium that could have major implications for soil and groundwater remediation as well as radioactive waste management. Their research has just been published in \nNature Communications.\nUranium is a radioactive heavy metal found in the Earth’s crust and in tiny concentrations in water, air, plants and living organisms – humans have small amounts of uranium in their bones. The EML scientists studied the properties of uranium as it occurs naturally in the environment, and made significant breakthroughs in understanding how it goes from one oxidation state to the other, transitioning from a water-soluble compound to a stable mineral.\n“At the +6 oxidation state, uranium is mostly soluble and can therefore spread uncontrolled in the environment,” says Zezhen Pan, an EML scientist and the study’s lead author. “But at the +4 oxidation state, it is less soluble and less mobile. In our research we were able to pinpoint the nanoscale mechanisms of interaction between uranium and particles of magnetite, a magnetic iron oxide, to transition from one oxidation state to the other. We showed the persistence of Uranium at the +5 oxidation state, which is usually considered metastable.”\nA nanowire structure\nMost interestingly, the scientists also identified a molecular phenomenon that occurs during the transformation from the +6 to the +4 oxidation state: they discovered the formation of novel nanowires composed of very small nanoparticles (~1-2 nm) that assembled spontaneously into chains. These chains eventually collapse as individual nanoparticles grow larger.\n© 2020 EPFL/EML\nUO2 nanoparticles self-assembled into nanowire associated with magnetite particle. Scale bar= 5 nm.\nThe scientists were able to view the nanowires – which have a diameter of just 2–5 nm, or 100,000 times thinner than a human hair – thanks to the electron microscopes at EPFL’s Interdisciplinary Center for Electron Microscopy (CIME). The identification of the nanowire structure could improve understanding of how radioactive compounds spread in the subsurface at contaminated sites.\n“These findings hold a lot of promise because they provide insight into how nanoscale minerals form naturally through interactions at the water-mineral interface,” says Rizlan Bernier-Latmani, the head of the EML. “We now have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms at work for this process.”", "summary": "EPFL scientists have made a significant discovery in how nanoscale minerals form naturally, including the way in which they transition from a soluble to a solid state.

{"id": 715, "text": "A single image changed the direction of Correia’s career. The tenure track assistant professor remembers it as if it were yesterday. After finishing high school, Correia wasn’t sure what he wanted to do, but as the son of two financial accounters, he was sure he didn’t want to go into finance. “I wanted to help people and become a doctor, but my grades weren’t good enough. So I settled for chemistry,” he says. He studied the subject for three years without much enthusiasm, until the day a professor showed him a 3D image of a protein. That aroused his curiosity and made him want to learn more. “The structure was so beautiful, so perfect, to this day how these structures are formed remains a mystery. When I saw that image, I knew exactly what I wanted to study – and I haven’t looked back. After my wife and daughters, it’s the only thing I really care about,” he adds with a laugh.\nClaiming to have been “a bad student”, Correia never imagined he’d go into academia and develop a passion for teaching. He joined EPFL only four years ago yet in 2019 was named best teacher in the life sciences and technology section. “When I taught my first class I was terrified, nervous. I lacked the pedagogical know-how. I could see by the students’ expressions that they were frustrated. Giving a lesson can be extremely stressful for a professor. So I tried to improve – I listened carefully to their feedback and drew inspiration from other EPFL professors I worked with,” says Correia. Today he co-teaches two Bachelor’s classes and one Master’s class, all related to his research field of biochemistry. Students learn about the chemical compounds that form the building blocks of life, with a particular focus on proteins and biomedical research.\nAt his lab at EPFL, Correia – who holds a PhD in computational biology – and his research team uses computational methods to develop and test artificial proteins for applications in immunotherapy, vaccinations and biosensors. They recently developed .\nLearning together \nCorreia encourages his students to adopt the perspective of a researcher from the very beginning of their studies. “I try not to be a professor that simply talks at his students. Instead, I try to foster dialogue and create a climate where we all learn together. Because the teaching process works much better when information is shared both ways and in-between students, something I was taught by the previous SV teaching section director John Mckinney” he says.\nFostering dialogue means asking frequent questions and delving into detail when needed – all with a touch of humor so the students feel at ease. “I ask for volunteers to answer questions, but if nobody raises his hand, then I’ll call someone. But the atmosphere is really relaxed. I think it’s important to discuss things because knowing something and teaching it are two very different things. As soon as you try to teach something, you realize there are some facts you don’t know as well as you thought,” says Correia. He also tries to get students to visualize the concepts so that they learn them better and can then associate them in different ways. “I want my students to understand the mechanisms at work, not just memorize them. That’s why I don’t ask multiple-choice questions in my exams but open questions and let the students use documentation if they wish.”\nCorreia may not have become a doctor but he still achieved his goal of helping people. Besides the fact that his research is medical-related, he is training the next generation of scientists. “I didn’t realize it until someone pointed it out, but it’s true that as professors we give tomorrow’s active players in society, a solid foundation and sharp analytical and critical skills. That will help them make sound decisions and contribute to improve the world we live in. And that’s what really matters, right? Although sometimes I worry that the academic ‘bubble’ my colleagues and I live in, affects how we see the world,” he says.\nCorreia has never regretted his career choice. “EPFL is a fantastic place with excellent facilities. I lived in the US for a long time, and even though here in Switzerland we have less of a ‘go and do it’ mentality, if you really want to do something, you can find the resources, it boils down to your willingness to go forward. And in Switzerland we have a better work-life balance,” he says. A father of two girls aged four and seven, Correia feels he can be there more often for his family. Only one thing bothers him, the issue of gender equality. “I see how hard things can be for women, that’s I try to be very attentive to gender equality issues even in my classes, as a lot of the equality problems start in class rooms ” he says.", "summary": "Bruno Correia, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Protein Design and Immunoengineering, has been named the best teacher in the life sciences and technology section for 2019 – just four years after giving his first-ever class.", "claim": "Bruno Correia, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Protein Design and Immunoengineering, has been named the best teacher in the life sciences and technology section for 2019 – just four years after giving my first-ever class.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [36, 36], "noise": false}
{"id": 716, "text": "Engineers and software developers around the world are seeking to create technology that lets users touch, grasp and manipulate virtual objects, while feeling like they are actually touching something in the real world.\nScientists at EPFL and ETH Zurich have just made a major step toward this goal with their new haptic glove, which is not only lightweight – under 8 grams per finger – but also provides feedback that is extremely realistic. The glove is able to generate up to 40 Newtons of holding force on each finger with just 200 Volts and only a few milliWatts of power. It also has the potential to run on a very small battery. That, together with the glove’s low form factor (only 2 mm thick), translates into an unprecedented level of precision and freedom of movement.\n“We wanted to develop a lightweight device that – unlike existing virtual-reality gloves – doesn’t require a bulky exoskeleton, pumps or very thick cables,” says Herbert Shea, head of EPFL’s .\nThe scientists’ glove, called DextrES, has been successfully tested on volunteers in Zurich and has been presented at the upcoming .\nFabric, metal strips and electricity \nDextrES is made of nylon with thin elastic metal strips running over the fingers. The strips are separated by a thin insulator. When the user’s fingers come into contact with a virtual object, the controller applies a voltage difference between the metal strips causing them to stick together via electrostatic attraction – this produces a braking force that blocks the finger’s or thumb’s movement. Once the voltage is removed, the metal strips glide smoothly and the user can once again move his fingers freely.\nTricking your brain \nFor now the glove is powered by a very thin electrical cable, but thanks to the low voltage and power required, a very small battery could eventually be used instead. “The system’s low power requirement is due to the fact that it doesn’t create a movement, but blocks one”, explains Shea. The researchers also need to conduct tests to see just how closely they have to simulate real conditions to give users a realistic experience. “The human sensory system is highly developed and highly complex. We have many different kinds of receptors at a very high density in the joints of our fingers and embedded in the skin. As a result, rendering realistic feedback when interacting with virtual objects is a very demanding problem and is currently unsolved. Our work goes one step in this direction, focusing particularly on kinesthetic feedback,” says Otmar Hilliges, head of the  at ETH Zurich.\nIn this joint research project, the hardware was developed by EPFL at its Microcity campus in Neuchâtel, and the virtual reality system was created by ETH Zurich, which also carried out the user tests.\n“Our partnership with the EPFL lab is a very good match. It allows us to tackle some of the longstanding challenges in virtual reality at a pace and depth that would otherwise not be possible,” adds Hilliges.\n The next step will be to scale up the device and apply it to other parts of the body using conductive fabric. “Gamers are currently the biggest market, but there are many other potential applications – especially in healthcare, such as for training surgeons. The technology could also be applied in augmented reality,” says Shea.", "summary": "Scientists from EPFL and ETH Zurich have developed an ultra-light glove – weighing less than 8 grams per finger– that enables users to feel and manipulate virtual objects.

{"id": 718, "text": "The idea came from Martin Loos, an avid fan of winter sports who was eager to return to the great outdoors – not “just” to walk, but also to put down his own tracks up the side of a snowy mountain. A rock-climbing accident ten years ago left him paralyzed from the waist down, but that didn’t dampen his ardor for the snow-covered peaks. “With my wheelchair I can get around town fairly simply and easily, but I wanted to go backcountry skiing again and get back to the places I used to enjoy but can’t access in a wheelchair,” he says.\nFor the past few years, Loos has found ways to participate in some winter sports. He still goes skiing using sit-skis and takes part in group backcountry outings. But he doesn’t like having his friends pull him up the mountain. “I’d enjoy simply standing on the snow, even without being able to reach down and touch it like I can in my sit-skis,” he says. Loos, who is studying engineering in Yverdon, contacted the REHAssist research program at EPFL after hearing about it from his father Roland, an EPFL alumnus. The REHAssist engineers working on the TWIICE project agreed to take on the challenge of enabling Loos to “stand” again in the snow.\nFrom project to completion in record time\nThe engineers adapted the TWIICE exoskeleton they’d been working on to create WIITE. People with complete spinal-cord injuries can use WIITE to stand up, walk and, above all, go backcountry skiing thanks to a mechanism that can accommodate standard backcountry ski boots. The only requirement is that “wearers must be able to use their upper bodies to operate the exoskeleton’s crutches, which provide balance and control,” says Mohamed Bouri, head of REHAssist. The user moves the exoskeleton by pressing a button on the crutches – or in the case of Loos, ski poles.\n“The development work was completed in record time, just one month, from the design process to the production of specialty parts,” says Tristan Vouga, a member of the TWIICE and WIITE development teams. “By the third training session Loos was already able to walk around in skis with the exoskeleton,” he adds. After another dozen sessions, Loos was ready to embark on a several-hour-long outing, which he did with the entire development team. “At first I was really concentrated, with each step I was afraid I’d lose my balance. But after just a few minutes I was confident – and then it was magic!” says Loos.\nThe TWIICE engineers are now working on adapting their exoskeleton to other activities, disabilities and body types. Projects in the works include a system for runners who have lost a leg and a device to help stroke victims.\nTWIICE, and by extension WIITE, is an articulated system that attaches to a patient’s knees and hips and supports their legs, thighs and upper body. It contains tiny electric motors that bend and extend the knee and hip joints so as to replicate the body’s natural movements during walking and backcountry skiing. It runs continuously on a two-hour battery housed in the dorsal part of the system. Patients can carry spare batteries (which weigh less than 1 kg each) in a separate backpack. The exoskeleton’s dedicated electronics execute the wearer’s instructions securely and reliably.\nContacts media: \nVideo and pictures taken before the lockdown.", "summary": "While backcountry ski racers are disappointed that they won’t be starting the Patrouille des Glaciers, one disabled skier is happily strapping on the climbing skins once again.

Gonzenbach holds a Master’s in physics from EPFL and a post-graduate degree in mathematical engineering from Ecole Polytechnique de Paris. He worked for a Zurich-based startup, a small business and a multinational before taking a position with the Canton of Vaud to help implement digital processes in public services. In 2015, Gonzenbach joined EPFL as an industry liaison officer and innovation advisor at ENAC.\nHow has the smart living lab evolved since it was created in 2014? \nThe lab emerged out of a joint initiative by the Canton of Fribourg and EPFL to build a research center on an abandoned industrial site that was converted into an innovation park. My predecessor Anne-Claude Cosandey spearheaded the project. What made the idea unique and so successful is that it brought the University of Fribourg and the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture together on EPFL’s Fribourg site. ENAC also played an important role in getting the lab off the ground. Since it’s been open, four EPFL chairs have been created in the lab, and these positions are held by leading international figures. The lab plays an important role in building ties between the local and international scientific communities. And the Swiss team’s victory at the 2017 Solar Decathlon really helped put the smart living lab on the map. The winning pavilion, called NeighborHub, has been installed permanently at our blueFactory site.\nWhat are your plans for the lab going forward?\nThe lab is at a pivotal moment in its development. We need to concentrate our efforts on new, innovative, and collaborative research projects. Of course, the primary goal is to transfer the technology we develop to industry. Some local businesses are already using our systems, but we now have a real opportunity to make an international impact – especially in developing countries, where cities are undergoing profound, rapid change. We would also like to expand the lab’s reach and explore related applications for our technology, such as in the hotel and healthcare industries. Another priority will be to incorporate digital technology into sustainable housing systems. It’s also important for me to give EPFL Fribourg employees an enriching working environment on par with that of the Lausanne campus.\nYou are also heading up a project to construct the lab’s permanent building. Can you tell us more about that? \nFribourg is a university town with a vibrant culture. The blueFactory innovation park where our lab is located forms part of the city’s history – it’s where the old Cardinal brewery used to be. Our new building will help the park meet its zero carbon goal, serving as a real-world testing ground for the research being carried out by our lab’s engineers. We have already issued an RFP for the building design, which is being developed through a collaborative parallel studies mandate. The winning bid will be announced this summer, and construction will start next year. Our engineers will work hand in hand with professionals, meaning everyone will need to be open to new methods and ideas. The building, which will house up to 130 employees, will have to meet demanding criteria in terms of architectural design, research facilities, environmental footprint and usage.\nWhat sets the smart living lab apart from similar research centers?\nOur lab addresses a vast challenge using a long-term vision. We aim to combine technological innovation with societal progress by leveraging our core strength, which is the wide range of disciplines we bring together: not only architecture and engineering, but also law, economics, sociology and psychology. Experts in all these fields work together to develop a human-centric approach to building construction.

The new guide launched today in the form of an application provides valuable information while adjusting to the desires of the user. Rather than keeping one’s nose stuck in the screen, visitors can fully enjoy the scenery. A tourist is alerted by an audible signal when approaching a potentially interesting site.\nLaunched today by the Vaud Office of Tourism, this mobile guide developed by the start-up EDSI-Tech lists a range of 500 points of interest that gradually will be expanded. The most renowned sites such as the Cathedral and the Chillon Castle are presented alongside less frequented places such as The Bolo Museum of Computers, Echallens House of Wheat and Bread or a beautiful view. The application then signals with a beep or tone for those wishing to explore the region. It takes into account the opening hours and the seasonal nature of certain events but does not include commercial advertising.\nHowever, the real innovation introduced by MyCity, the applications launched by the company, to the world of tourism is the development of algorithms to produce personalized recommendations, which was done in collaboration with the Media Laboratory of EPFL. To do this, the system learns not only the information provided at registration such as preferences, age or country of origin, but also the choices made by the user. “Imagine a person visits the Chillon Castle and the one in Morges. MyCity will definitely suggest the one in Grandson,” explains Philippe Bonvin, one of the two founders. The company is developing multiple opportunities to learn these preferences, such as the time spent by the user at a given location. Routes may also be offered according to interest. This multilingual mobile application is available offline and for the latest versions of iOS and Android.\nTourism offices are particularly looking forward to coupling the application with the collection of statistics. Thus far, outside of organized tours, it has been difficult to know how often a site is visited. The anonymous data indicates trends that will enable industry professionals to improve their offerings. Points of interest can be changed and statistics modulated using software supplied with the application. It is also possible to customize requests by crossing several criteria to obtain specific information on the average age of visitors, where they’re from and what other sites they have visited.\nThe young company based at the EPFL Innovation Park hopes to greatly expand its system to other Swiss and French tourism offices. Other interactive features such as augmented reality, a calendar or multimedia galleries, for example, enhance the map. In addition, another version will soon be put into operation for the Gruyère Pays d'Enhaut Regional Nature Park. It aims to promote two itineraries on the themes of Gruyère and Etivaz.

Wouldn't it be nice not to have to think about it -- and still be environmentally friendly? How would you like to live in a building that adjusts to your lifestyle?\nIf you are aiming for the 2000 watt society, or simply trying to prevent a fire from starting, then you may be interested in the way EPFL scientists are using the Internet of Things, i.e. connecting appliances together and monitoring their overall energy consumption to make every day life a little bit smarter. \nThe Internet of Things is a network of smart objects that can be controlled together for optimal energy consumption. Those connected objects, which can be anything from your usual appliances to the heating system, are augmented with sensors and electronics that relay information about how you and your building consume energy. The concept of IoT is a few years old already, so what's new?\nMaher Kayal and his team at EPFL are using the IoT to redefine the idea of the smart building by putting the user's comfort at the core of the system. You, the user, can control your own comfort – temperature, humidity and lighting – in careful balance with how much energy you consume and how much is available from the power grid. Their results are now published in the Krakow Conference Proceedings from the \"\".\nTheir concept of a smart building has three components. The first consists of electronics that would have to be integrated into all of the building's appliances and plugs, basically everything that requires power, like the stove. The electronics make each appliance intelligent, first by adding control-at-a-distance, but also by collecting data about how you use a specific appliance. The second component is the user interface, with a built-in learning mechanism: the interface allows you to control your appliance, while learning about your energy habits and preferences. The third is the building, as a whole, and how it interacts with the environment and its energy demands for intelligent management with the grid.\nTo illustrate the concept, Kayal and his team built a demo wall fitted with intelligent lights and plugs. Kayal identifies himself by placing his identity card on the wall. The system registers Kayal, loads his preferred settings and the lights immediately dim. Meanwhile, he consults his smartphone and reads the temperature of the room, the humidity and the amount of electricity being consumed by the demo wall.\nToday, the impact of our individual comfort, in terms of energy consumption and environmental footprints, is far too complex to quantify. But this shouldn't prevent us from trying. \"Given the right tools, we are intelligent enough to make the right decision for optimizing our energy consumption,\" says Kayal. \"Our main objective is to educate the user, to include people in the feedback loop of energy control, and moving away from fully automated systems that dismiss human interaction.\"\nSmart buildings of the future may well be personalized for your lifestyle.

{"id": 725, "text": "Superconductivity has fascinated scientists for many years since it offers the potential to revolutionize current technologies. Materials only become superconductors – meaning that electrons can travel in them with no resistance – at very low temperatures. These days, this unique zero resistance superconductivity is commonly found in a number of technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Future technologies, however, will harness the total synchrony of electronic behavior in superconductors – a property called the phase. There is currently a race to build the world’s first quantum computer, which will use these phases to perform calculations. Conventional superconductors are very robust and hard to influence, and the challenge is to find new materials in which the superconducting state can be easily manipulated in a device.\nEPFL’s Laboratory of Quantum Materials (QMAT), headed by Philip Moll, professor at the School of Engineering, has been working on a specific group of unconventional superconductors known as heavy fermion materials. The QMAT scientists, as part of a broad international collaboration between EPFL, the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Cornell University, made a surprising discovery about one of these materials, CeIrIn\n5\n.\nCeIrIn\n5\n is a metal that superconducts at a very low temperature, only 0.4°C above absolute zero (around -273°C). The QMAT scientists, together with Katja C. Nowack from Cornell University, have now shown that this material could be produced with superconducting regions coexisting alongside regions in a normal metallic state. Better still, they produced a model that allows researchers to design complex conducting patterns and, by varying the temperature, to distribute them within the material in a highly controlled way. Their research has just been published in .\nTo achieve this feat, the scientists sliced very thin layers of CeIrIn\n5\n – only around a thousandth of a millimeter thick – that they joined to a sapphire substrate. When cooled, the material contracts significantly whereas the sapphire contracts very little. The resulting interaction puts stress on the material, as if it were being pulled in all directions, thus slightly distorting the atomic bonds in the slice. As the superconductivity in CeIrIn\n5\n is unusually sensitive to the material’s exact atomic configuration, engineering a distortion pattern is all it takes to achieve a complex pattern of superconductivity. This new approach allows researchers to “draw” superconducting circuitry on a single crystal bar, a step that paves the way for new quantum technologies.\nCaption; the image illustrates the temperature evolution of the spatially modulated superconducting state\nThis discovery represents a major step forward in controlling superconductivity in heavy fermion materials. But that’s not the end of the story. Following on from this project, a post-doc researcher has just begun exploring possible technological applications.\n“We could, for example, change the regions of superconductivity by modifying the material’s distortion using a microactuator,” says Moll. “The ability to isolate and connect superconducting regions on a chip could also create a kind of switch for future quantum technologies, a little like the transistors used in today’s computing.”\n-----\nIf you are interested in the research being done in EPFL’s Laboratory for Quantum Materials, there are opportunities for undergraduate, Master’s and PhD students.

{"id": 726, "text": "Imagine piloting a drone using the movements of your torso only and leaving your head free to look around, much like a bird. EPFL research has just shown that using your torso to pilot flying machines is indeed more immersive – and more effective – than using the long-established joystick. The results are published in today's issue of PNAS.\n“Our aim was to design a control method which would be easy to learn and therefore require less mental focus from the users so that they can focus on more important issues, like search and rescue,” says lead author Jenifer Miehlbradt of EPFL’s Translational Neuroengineering Laboratory led by Bertarelli Foundation Chair Silvestro Micera. “Using your torso really gives you the feeling that you are actually flying. Joysticks, on the other hand, are of simple design but mastering their use to precisely control distant objects can be challenging.”\nThe scientists wanted to observe how people use their bodies to pilot a flying object, in this case a drone, and determine which movements are most intuitive and natural – approaching the pilot problem from a completely new perspective.\nThey started by monitoring the body movements of 17 individuals thanks to 19 infrared markers placed all over the upper body as well as their muscular activity. Each participant followed the actions of a virtual drone through simulated landscapes that passed-by as viewed through virtual reality goggles.\nMotion patterns emerged and the scientists quickly established torso-related strategies for piloting drones: they found that only 4 markers – located on the torso – were needed to pilot flight simulators and real drones through a circuit of obstacles effectively.\nOverall, the scientists compared their torso strategies to joystick control in 39 individuals. They found that torso drone control outperformed joystick control in precision, reliability and with minimal training sessions.\n\"Data analysis allowed us to develop a very simple and intuitive approach which could also be used with other populations, machines, and operations,” says Micera, also at the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Italy in Biomedical Engineering. He adds, “The approach significantly improves the teleoperation of robots with non-human mechanical attributes.\"\nWhile the PNAS results provide a truly new and completely immersive piloting strategy with a focus on characterizing the relevant torso parameters, leaving the head, limbs, hands and feet free to perform other actions, their proof-of-concept system still requires body markers and external motion detectors in order to work.\nThe next steps are to make the torso strategy completely wearable for piloting flying objects. The application range is huge, from flight simulators to piloting drones and even perhaps planes of the future. A  without external motion detectors was developed at EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems led by co-author Dario Floreano based on the PNAS findings.\nA jacket for flying like a bird\nThe Fly Jacket, a first implementation of the torso strategy for piloting flying objects.\n Drone pilots can now achieve an unprecedented level of immersion thanks to \nFly Jacket\n developed by Carine Rognon, a researcher at EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems led by Dario Floreano. The Fly Jacket appeared in the July 2018 issue of IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.\n Rognon came up with a very lightweight garment that translates the torso strategy described in the PNAS article into drone control commands without external motion detectors. It allows pilots to control their drone intuitively with their body movements – such as leaning forward and backward and pivoting their upper body – rather than with a hand-held device.\n Thanks to an embedded motion sensor developed by EPFL Laboratory of Embedded systems led by David Atienza, the fly jacket makes the drone control extremely responsive. Furthermore, the fly jacket has an arm support system that prevents fatigue. This, together with the use of first-person view (FPV) goggles connected to an on-board camera, allows pilots to navigate the skies naturally while keeping their arms spread out as wings.\n “The Fly Jacket not only produces an immersive and intuitive flight control experience, but also frees the human hands for other tasks. For example, we have shown that humans could wear data gloves to give additional commands to the drone, like for take-off and landing, or to indicate points of interest seen from the drone perspective that would immediately appear on a map. This could be very useful for fire fighters or rescuers to quickly and precisely identify locations where help is needed,” says Floreano.", "summary": "Your torso is more intuitive – and more precise – than joysticks for piloting drones, both simulated and real, according to a recent study by EPFL scientists.

{"id": 727, "text": "Eliott Guenat, a first year master’s student in mechanical engineering, isn’t \na priori \nall that interested in SUVs and big rigs. But his passion for thermodynamics and his interest in environmental issues have given him a reason to take a look under their hoods. He has emerged with plans for a thermomechanical system that can produce electricity from the waste heat of tailpipe emissions and cooling fluids.\nIn spite of the efforts of automobile manufacturers, nearly 70% of the fuel consumption is dissipated as heat into the environment. The problem is that the temperature of the waste heat is too low to be converted in a useful manner.\nHowever, there is a thermodynamic system that can exploit these differences in temperature to produce electricity: the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). It’s currently only used in recuperating industrial heat (in cement production), biomass production and geothermal energy applications. The ORC operates similarly to a steam engine, except that the water is replaced by an organic fluid such as propane. Pumped within a hermetically sealed circuit, the fluid is heated and evaporated, then passed through a turbine, then condensed back into liquid form to start the cycle over again.\nNone of the car manufacturers have managed to incorporate this kind of system in a commercialized vehicle. Promising research on micro-turbomachinery led Guenat, who is supervised by Jürg Schiffmann in the Laboratory of Applied Mechanical Design (LAMD), to study the possibility of using it in vehicles and explore the conditions in which it could be applied.\nPotential for truck transport\n The theory indicates that micro-turbomachines could be the answer, but not for just any vehicle. “For a compact car like those manufactured today, it’s difficult,” says the student. The biggest obstacle is finding room for the exchangers, which have a 40-liter volume (the size of a big microwave oven). The entire vehicle would have to be redesigned to incorporate them, keeping in mind that the bigger they are, the better they’ll work. In addition, the vehicle must generate enough heat to make the process worthwhile, which would typically only be the case in freeway driving.\nThus the vehicles that would benefit the most from a system like this are big ones like trucks or buses. “The theoretical model shows that with the concept we studied, one could gain 8 energy efficiency points, the equivalent of reducing fuel consumption by a quarter to a third,” says Guenat. The gain could be used to provide more power to the engine, to keep the engine at a constant speed, to air-condition the cab, or to power a refrigerated compartment. “It’s still early days for the development of small-scale low-temperature applications,” says Guenat, who’s spending his summer delving deeper into applications of his research in trucks, in the LAMD.", "summary": "Summer series – student research (1) For his semester project in mechanical engineering, Eliott Guenat studied the best way to recuperate waste heat from a car’s engine.

{"id": 731, "text": "Geological, catalytic, biological and chemical processes are driven by surface chemical heterogeneities, electrostatic fields and flow. To understand these processes and to enable the further development of new materials and microtechnology, researchers at EPFL’s  (LBP) have designed a microscope that can track, in real time, three-dimensional spatial changes in the molecular structure and chemistry of confined systems, such as curved surfaces and pores. The microscope was used to image the surface chemical structure of the inside of a glass microcapillary. Surface potential maps were constructed from the millisecond images, and the chemical reaction constant of each 188nm-wide pixel was determined. Surprisingly, this very simple system – which is used in many devices – displayed a remarkable spread in surface heterogeneity. The researchers’ findings have been published in \nScience\n. Their method will be a boon for understanding fundamental (electro)chemical, geological and catalytic processes and for building new devices.\nSecond-harmonic imaging\n Sylvie Roke, director of the  has developed a unique set of optical tools to study water and aqueous interfaces on the nanoscale. She uses second-harmonic and sum-frequency generation, which are optical processes in which two photons of a certain color are converted into a new color. “The second-harmonic process involves 1000 nm femtosecond photons – that is, 0.00000000000001-second bursts of light – being converted into 500 nm photons, and this occurs only at interfaces,” says Roke. “It is therefore ideal for interfacial microscopy. Unfortunately, the process is very inefficient. But by using a number of optical tricks, such as wide field imaging and light shaping, we were able to enhance both the imaging throughput and the resolution, bringing the time to record an image down from minutes to 250 milliseconds.”\nSurprising surface chemistry\n The researchers then imaged the deprotonation reaction of the inner silica capillary/water interface in real time. Silica is one of the most abundant minerals on earth, and its interaction with water shapes our climate and environment. Although many researchers have characterized the properties of the silica/water interface, there is no consensus on its chemical reactivity. Roke continues: “Our data shows why there is a remarkable spread in surface reactivity, even on a very small portion of a capillary. Our data will help in the development of theoretical models that are more effective at capturing this surprising complexity. In addition, our imaging method can be used for a wide variety of processes, such as for analyzing the real-time functioning of a fuel cell, or for seeing which structural facet of a mineral is most chemically active. We could also gain more insight into nanochannels and both artificial and natural pores.\nTop: Phase-contrast image of a microcapillary showing the bulk glass and the bulk water.

Thanks to the deep sky images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope at the end of last year, researchers have been able to characterize the most distant galaxies ever seen. One of these galaxies, located close to the limit of visibility from Earth, is seen the way it looked when the universe was merely 650 million years old –since the image detected by the telescope took more than 13 billion years to reach us.\n\"At this stage of formation, galaxies are very dense and function as nurseries for extremely active stars. This is the first time we are able to observe such faint and distant galaxies\" said Hakim Atek, researcher at EPFL’s Astrophysics Laboratory (LASTRO) and first author of one of the two papers published on this subject*. \"Our partners at the Institute of Astrophysics at the Canary Islands (IAC) were interested in the most distant galaxy observed. They measured its dimensions and determined that its size is about 30 times smaller than our Milky Way, yet it produces stars at a rate at least 10 times superior\", he continued. These calculations were possible thanks to the models developed by Daniel Schaerer from the University of Geneva, expert on the first galaxies.\nA natural telescope located billions of light-years from Earth\n By itself, the Hubble telescope’s performance is not able to clarify much about these entities at the edge of the observable world. The researchers increased the telescope’s capacity through the optical phenomenon of \"gravitational lensing\": the colossal mass of distant galaxy clusters has the effect of augmenting and multiplying the image of the objects behind them.\nResearchers use this phenomenon to amplify up to 100 times the amount of light received from a distant galaxy. \"We have developed an advanced knowledge in modeling the distribution of mass within these galaxy clusters, which allows us to know exactly the way they affect the rays of light passing within their reach, and therefore to precisely reconstruct the image of a galaxy behind them, \"explained Jean- Paul Kneib, head of the ERC research team \"Light on the Dark\" at LASTRO.\nThanks to this knowledge, astronomers identified six \"frontier fields\" of galaxy clusters acting as natural telescopes capable of delivering new information on the most distant galaxies. Then, they obtained NASA authorization to use an important share of the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes’ working time to observe these fields. Their study, which began in November last year, will last three years in total. As for the images, they are available to the global scientific community, which is engaged in a race against the clock to get the most of this opportunity.\nThese extremely promising initial results will be further refined in the coming months thanks to the new images that the Hubble will take by using a second sensor in the visible range.

The ever increasing amount of information in the world, spread across many different industries and markets, makes this an increasingly difficult task. To make it possible for inventors to sense the inventive signal in this ever increasing amount of noise, AI researchers and software developers at Iprova – the innovation creation firm that came up with the aforementioned inventions – have developed an artificial intelligence platform that includes sophisticated semantic analysis algorithms. Ana Manasovska helped create this program as part of her Master’s degree in computer science at EPFL, in association with the school’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She now works for the company, which is based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, to further develop the software that makes it easier for engineers to invent faster and more disruptively..\nMillions of publications sifted\nMillions of research, industry news and other articles are published around the world every year. One part of Iprova’s artificial intelligence platform works by performing a semantic analysis of the terms in published articles. Manasovska’s thesis on summarization methods contributed to this by testing various phrase recognition methods, which she did by representing individual phrases as vectors. If two phrases have a close virtual spatial location, then their meanings are probably similar. This technique can be used to generate better summaries by measuring phrases’ semantic similarity.\nWhat Manasovska found when comparing the different methods is that the more complicated architectures weren’t necessarily better suited to this task. “Even with a simple architecture, we got excellent results in identifying phrases with similar meanings,” she says. “We also learned that the best way to generate the kinds of summaries that Iprova needs is to approach them from an inventor’s perspective. Most conventional summary-generation methods don’t do that, which is why we wanted to develop our own,” she adds.\nToday Manasovska is working on further improving the semantic recognition and recommendation platform. She works closely with inventors, aiming to find out what kind of data they need and how they plan to use it. She has developed programs allowing engineers to create inventions using input data that they wouldn’t have been able to easily get otherwise. An example of this is the linking of information from inventively relevant, but otherwise disparate, research fields that open up entirely new invention opportunities. “What I really like about my work is that it lets me stay on top of the latest developments in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) – two fields that are advancing rapidly. I have the opportunity to use the latest technology and the power of data to help people spot relevant new findings more efficiently,” she says.\n“Traditional inventors were scientists or engineers with a deep understanding of a specific technical field. This only gave the inventor access to a limited amount of research insight. Even collaborative inventing through teamwork only provides insight into a handful of additional fields, since it’s just a team of specialists. With such approaches to invention, researchers can only dig deeper into specific areas rather than offering genuine innovation by taking the field in a different direction.\nIprova does this on a massive scale – in real-time – by using data from across the spectrum of human knowledge to make connections between ideas from different fields of study.”says Julian Nolan, CEO of Iprova.

{"id": 747, "text": "Droople’s smart meters record not just water flow rates and temperatures, but also peak usage times and total consumption – valuable data for facilities managers seeking to cut costs. The system consists of a series of smart flow meters installed at the point of use that collect data and send them through a low-power wide-area network (LoRaWAN) to a cloud-based software program. “Our program runs the data through a series of algorithms to extract the useful information,” says Ramzi Bouzerda, Droople’s founder and CEO. He set up the company in April 2018 at EPFL’s Innovation Park.\nRecovering energy from hot water \nThe Montreux Jazz Café on the EPFL campus recently tried out the device. “I wanted to know if it was worth installing a heat recovery system on the refrigeration compressors in the ArtLab building,” says David Gremaud, who is in charge of the Energy project on EPFL’s facilities management team. Refrigerators and freezers operate through an exothermic (i.e., heat-releasing) process. The excess heat is absorbed by water running through the compressors, creating a stream of hot water. At EPFL, this hot water is generally sent to an evacuation system, but Gremaud is now looking at ways to recover the heat and reuse the energy. This spring he worked with Droople to install smart meters on the Montreux Jazz Café’s refrigeration compressors. After collecting data for two weeks, he saw that the outlet temperature and flow rate were high enough to warrant installing a heat recovery system.\nDroople’s smart meters collect water flow data at the point of use and send them to a cloud-based program that extracts the useful information. ©2019 EPFL/Alain Herzog\n“It’s not always worth making this kind of investment, but in this case, we saw it could save EPFL money. The restaurant could recover around 4,800 kWh a year in energy, which is roughly how much it uses to heat water for its kitchen – 4,000 kWh a year – and corresponds to 720 francs worth of electricity,” says Bouzerda. And since a heat recovery system costs between 1,500 and 1,800 francs, the investment would pay for itself in around two and a half years. Gremaud therefore decided to install a heat recovery system. “Our decision is also consistent with EPFL’s energy efficiency policy and the high standard we want to set in terms of sustainability. We are now collecting data at the Esplanade restaurant in the CO building, and other restaurants will surely follow,” says Gremaud.\nLow-power data transmission network \nAccording to Gremaud, “there is currently no turnkey system out there for monitoring buildings’ water consumption.” Droople’s technology could be useful not only to facilities managers, but also to the operators of heating and sanitary systems. And it can reduce maintenance costs. “For instance, under current health and safety regulations, buildings are required to change the filters on their water fountains and coffee machines after a given volume of water has gone through. With our device, building operators can easily track how much water has passed through the filters and predict when they will need to be replaced. That means they can plan out the most efficient maintenance schedule and route for their technicians,” says Bouzerda. The same principle holds true for the cleaning of restrooms at restaurants and airports, for example.\nAnother benefit to Droople’s system is that it requires very little power, since the smart meters run on batteries, collect relatively little data and transmit the data they do collect through a LoRaWAN. All this means the meters can run for anywhere between three and five years without any maintenance.\nBouzerda got the idea for Droople one morning at 3 o’clock when he was trying to fill his baby son’s bottle with exactly 300 mL of water. The son of a plumber, Bouzerda holds a Master’s in computer science from EPFL and drew on his programming knowledge to come up with a novel way to measure water consumption. His initial concept continues to evolve. “We based our system on fog computing – that is, the smart meters themselves run the data analyses in real time. That means they can detect and respond immediately to micro leaks by closing a valve, for example,” says Bouzerda. “And we’ve submitted a research proposal with Professor David Atienza’s lab at EPFL.”", "summary": "EPFL-based startup Droople has developed a smart flow meter that can measure buildings’ water consumption and identify potential savings in energy.

With new developments in cardiac assistance systems, we can delay the need for a transplant – or even eliminate it altogether,” says Professor Yves Perriard, head of EPFL’s Center for Artificial Muscles within the School of Engineering. He and a team of around ten other engineers from EPFL’s Integrated Actuators Laboratory (LAI) have been working on new cardiac assistance technology over the past four years. Their discovery, which employs flexible actuators, has been published in \nAdvanced Science\n.\nElectrodes and a silicon aorta \nOur aortas are naturally elastic. They expand as blood is pumped into them from the heart’s left ventricle, and then contract to distribute the blood to the rest of the body. But in patients suffering from diseases such as heart failure, the heart has to work harder to accomplish this cycle. To ease the burden on the heart, EPFL engineers have designed an artificial aorta made of silicon and a series of electrodes. Their device is implanted just behind the aortic valve and amplifies the aorta’s efforts, working like an “augmented aorta.” When an electric voltage is applied to the device, the artificial aorta expands to a diameter that’s larger than the natural aorta. “The advantage of our system is that it reduces the pressure on a patient’s heart. The idea isn’t to replace the heart, but to assist it,” says Yoan Civet, a Scientist at the LAI. \n© 2021 EPFL\nHelping the heart expend less energy \nTo validate their system, the engineers built a simulator consisting of pumps and chambers that replicate the blood-flow and pressure conditions within a human heart. “By testing our device on the simulator, we were able to reduce the amount of cardiac energy required by 5.5%,” says Civet. The research team now plans to conduct further tests of their artificial aorta, and are already working on a new design that delivers better performance. \n© Félix Wey, Werner Siemens Stiftung / 2021 EPFL\nHowever, the real challenge lies in the manufacturing step. “We started from scratch and had to develop a new production process that would allow us to increase the volume of the silicone tube. We also had to overcome a problem of electric breakdown. Due to our multi-layer design, only half as affordable electric field was reached as compared to a single-membrane system. We had to troubleshoot the problem and then come up with a solution,” says Civet. The research team has filed a patent for their technology. The hope is that their discovery can be used to treat other medical conditions, such as urological disorders, that require a similar approach.", "summary": "Engineers at EPFL’s Center for Artificial Muscles have developed a silicone aorta that can reduce how hard patients’ hearts have to pump.

{"id": 752, "text": "Making French-speaking culture a vehicle for technological innovation in the context of international scientific competition by bringing together universities in developed and developing countries: such is the ambition of RESCIF, which will link – starting January 2011 – 14 French-speaking universities from developed and developing countries. This approach is unique in its philosophy, scope and linguistic aspects. The aim of the project is to promote collaborative scientific programmes, especially in the areas of water, nutrition and energy management. These domains are crucial, in particular for some countries in the southern hemisphere, subjected to extremely difficult climatic conditions and food safety issues. RESCIF is one of three official initiatives supported by the Swiss government on the occasion of the 13th Conference of Heads of State of French-speaking countries in Montreux.\nThe best French-speaking technology universities\n Started by EPFL, with its 40-year-long experience of North–South scientific partnerships, RESCIF brings together five other French-speaking technology universities from developed countries: Paristech (France), the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), the Polytechnic University of Montréal (Canada), the Ecole Normale Supérieure of Lyon (France) and the Grenoble Polytechnic Institute (France) – and eight French-speaking universities in emerging countries, among the most renowned of the international scientific community, have given their agreement in principle to be finalized by the beginning of 2011: the Ecole Mohammadia d’ingénieurs de Rabat (Marocco), the Ecole Nationale Supérieure Polytechnique de Yaoundé (Cameroon), the Ecole supérieure polytechnique de Dakar (Senegal), the Institut international d’ingéniérie en Eau et Environnement 2IE d’Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), l’Université St-Joseph de Beyrouth (Lebanon) et l’Institut polytechnique d’Ho-Chi-Minh-Ville (Vietnam). RESCIF is also planning to support the rebuilding in Haiti of the State University and the Quisqueya University, which were destroyed during this year’s earthquake. These two universities join the network with a perspective of long-term cooperation.\nThe first projects bearing the mark of RESCIF will begin during 2011. Three objectives have been defined:\n - student exchanges around common trainings\n - establishing of research teams and collaborative laboratories in the developing countries, and\n - development of partnerships with companies\nRESCIF will work in partnership with the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) – the University Agency for French-speaking countries – and to develop a guide to best practices for technological partnerships, intended for all the developing universities of the French-speaking world.\nWater, food, and energy: concrete issues\n The scientific programs will examine areas such as the management of water, food and energy. These areas are important for the Northern countries, but even more crucial for Southern countries, which see their economic growth and food safety threatened by climate changes. Those are priority topics, debated at the Montreux Sommet de la Francophonie.\nA vehicle for scientific and technological innovation\n Common programs will aim in particular to respond quickly to practical concerns. Along these lines, and as an example, cooperation already exists between Swiss universities and those from Burkina-Faso in the area of hydrology. The scientific data is useful for the authorities, who can focus their strategy, and also enables the local populations to adapt their farming practices. Other research projects aim to develop solar technologies for water treatment, or to better manage the links between city planning and pollution. RESCIF sees itself as a catalyst in such projects, by formalizing large-scale technological partnerships, and relying on the French language as a common culture.\nCurbing the brain drain \n For the developing countries, penalized by a significant brain drain, it will also be a question of curbing the phenomenon by increasing the attractiveness of their research institutes. With the creation of RESCIF it is, for the second wave of developing countries, about seizing the opportunity of the scientific and technological co-development on offer, and creating a lasting partnership between “developed” and “developing” universities.\nTurning the French language into a cultural and technological asset\n Although the scientific world is durably affected by the dominance of English, French-speaking universities have an opportunity to position themselves on the international scientific and technological stage if they strengthen their cooperation. Present on all the continents, with 200 million mother-tongue speakers (96 million in Africa) of whom 60 percent are under thirty years of age, French is also one of the languages the most taught in the world.

{"id": 753, "text": "Many natural foods, including milk and perhaps even beer, contain a molecule whose effects on metabolism are nothing short of astonishing. In an , Johan Auwerx, head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Integrative Systems Physiology (LISP) and holder of EPFL’s Nestlé Chair in Energy Metabolism, describes a series of experiments done using nicotinamide riboside (NR), a molecule that, although known to indirectly influence the activity of mitochondria, the “powerhouses” of the cell, has been little studied up to this point.\nAuwerx’s team worked with the laboratory of Anthony Sauve at Cornell University’s Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City to study the role of NR in closer detail. The first challenge was to obtain the molecule, which is complicated and expensive to synthesize. The researchers then measured its effects in vivo using mice. The results were impressive. NR appears to play a role in:\nPreventing obesity. \nMice on a high-fat diet fed NR gained significantly less weight (60%) than mice eating the same diet, but without NR supplementation. In addition, none of the NR-treated mice had indications that they were developing diabetes, unlike the untreated mice. “Even with a normal diet, NR improves insulin sensitivity,” explains Carles Cantó, first author on the article.\nIncreasing muscular performance. \nMice who were fed supplements containing NR over a ten week period had better endurance performance than those who didn’t receive the supplements. They were in better shape – and this was confirmed by observations of their muscle fibers under the microscope.\nImproving energy expenditure.\n After eight weeks of a normal diet supplemented with NR, the mice demonstrated better thermal resistance in an air-conditioned environment.\nThe scientists hypothesize that these effects are the result of an improvement in mitochondrial function. Upon further investigation, they were able to show that supplementing with NR indirectly stimulated the activity of sirtuin enzymes. These enzymes improve metabolic functions associated with mitochondria, such as lipid combustion and cellular oxidative capacities. “Our previous research involved genetically altering the “brake” on sirtuin activity. This research does the opposite; here we can put the pedal to the floor!” says Auwerx.\nSome of the effects of aging are also thwarted by an improvement in mitochondrial function. Many of an organism’s functions slow down as mitochondrial activity wanes; by stimulating mitochondria with NR, the researchers think they may be able to improve health and perhaps even increase longevity. Trials underway on nematodes seem to bear this out. “This substance acts upon a wide spectrum of living things, from yeasts and worms all the way up to mammals,” adds Cantó.\nNo side effects\nThese beneficial effects aren’t the only advantages of this “hidden vitamin.” The fact that it is naturally present in many foods will make it significantly easier for the public to accept its use in a nutritional or therapeutic context. In addition, “despite all our efforts, we were not able to detect side effects,” says Cantó. Even in quantities ten times over the “effective” dose, no adverse reactions were observed. “It really appears that cells use what they need when they need it, and the rest is set aside without being transformed into any kind of deleterious form,” explains the scientist. On that count, if used to improve cholesterol profiles, NR would have a decisive advantage over its “cousin” NA (nicotinic acid, or niacin), which is as effective, but has various side effects such as flushing.\nThis research will certainly have widespread implications in nutrition, health care and the development of “alicaments.” “Other laboratories, as well as companies that can synthesize or extract this molecule, first need to show an interest in it,” says Auwerx. He was able to detect NR in milk, and suspects that it is also present in other common foods. “But at the moment, we can’t even measure its concentration in milk,” he cautions. “So it’s impossible to know how much you would have to drink to be able to observe its effects.”\nA new field of research is opening with this “hidden vitamin in milk,” which will be of interest to doctors, nutritionists and athletes as well as synthetic vitamin manufacturers. The work is just beginning, but “now we know why mothers are right when they tell their kids to drink their milk!” quips Auwerx.", "summary": "A Lausanne-based research team has identified a molecule naturally present in milk and other foods, nicotinamide riboside, that has extraordinary health benefits.

{"id": 754, "text": "Matching supply to demand is a real headache for any enterprise. This is even more the case for public transportation. Is it enough to simply increase the frequency of certain lines for the usage rates to follow suit? In what areas do they face constraints and challenges related to supply planning? The issues are particularly relevant to the evolution of mobility and the choice of a mode of transport that inhabitants of the city and the countryside face today.\nAs part of a research project on combined mobility launched in 2009 by PostBus and the Transportation Center at EPFL, three affiliated laboratories (CEAT, LASUR, and TRANSP-OR) have addressed these issues. The researchers analyzed data collected over four years (2007-2010) on 147 lines in three areas served by PostBus: Valais, the east, and the north of the country.\nThe results are clear: an increase in the rate of a route almost always results in an increase in passengers that exceeds the proportional increase. For all lines analyzed, a 7.5% increase in supply leads to an increase in passengers of nearly 15%. In addition, the study shows that not only does PostBus have an image that is friendly, rural, and touristic, but also it is an integral link in the chain of transport-oriented urban centers and the train.\nRole of Service\nDuring the study period of 2007-2010, PostBus increased the number of passenger-kilometers – an index that measures both the number of customers and the distance traveled – by 7.3%. The study shows that with the high-speed lines, adding an additional carrier adds new passengers on lines whose rate is low. In addition, commuters are more likely to take a yellow bus because it runs at least once an hour on a given line. The density of the population in the vicinity of a stop and the importance of the line in the regional context are also determinants of commuter frequency. In contrast, the employment rate near a stop showed no significant impact.\nThe researchers were also able to measure the effects of changes in behavior in terms of mobility and the recent PostBus strategy. The metropolitan areas with feeder lines in railway stations and lines heading to the center experienced the largest increase in passengers (+15% and +19%, respectively). In addition, on these lines, the closer the train station, the higher the number of passengers. Overall, the company has also benefitted not only from a political environment that favors the development of public transport in Switzerland, but also population growth and urban expansion.\nStark Regional Disparities\nIf there is a positive relationship between frequency and usage, it is neither linear nor constant. The sample shows wide disparities across regions and analyzed contexts. In the areas of St. Gallen and around Sion, for example, the number of passengers increases despite a constant supply of buses. At Brig, a minor adjustment in what is offered is rewarded with a surge of customers. However, Uznach and Basel did not experience an increase in passengers, despite an increased investment exceeding that in Brig. In the areas of Aarau and Frauenfeld, the number of passengers increased by 30%, despite an investment that was smaller than that in Basel. These regional differences are partly attributable to the local political environment, the presence of fare networks, the practice of preferential tariffs for tourists, or structural changes, such as the opening of schools or new infrastructure.\nFinally, scientists have evaluated the potential of improving PostBus. In rural and suburban areas where the transportation company is present, 70% of people use their cars to get to work. “Choosing of a mode of transport is rooted in our way of life, and it is not easy to change practices,” said Vincent Kaufmann, director of LASUR.\nTheir change is often associated with a transition in life. “The greatest opportunities for gains in travelers is by increasing the supply located in the outskirts of large cities on feeder routes to stations, lines, tourist areas – as long as they are well connected to the rail network – or highly frequented lines which can expand the supply in the evening.”\nA Planning Tool\nThis analysis of traffic data is the fifth and final stage of a four-year collaboration conducted between the Transportation Center of EPFL (TraCE) and PostBus. Called Optima and funded with the support of Swiss Post Innovation, this project finishes as an undeniable success for both partners. Scientists have developed analytical tools that are both qualitative and quantitative to determine the factors at work in transportation choices. PostBus profits from valuable input on the determinants that influence demand, an assessment of the impact of its development policies in recent years, and especially ways to sharpen its future strategies.", "summary": "Under a mandate from Swiss PostBus, the Transportation Center of EPFL analyzed attendance data from this enterprise known for their yellow buses.

{"id": 759, "text": "Have you ever thrown into the fire - even if you shouldn’t have - an empty packet of crisps? The outcome is striking: the plastic shrivels and bends into itself, until it turns into a small crumpled and blackened ball. This phenomenon is explained by the tendency of materials to pick up their original features in the presence of the right stimulus. Hence, this usually happens when heating materials that were originally shaped at high temperatures and cooled afterwards.\nEPFL researchers realized that this phenomenon occurred to ultrathin quartz tubes (capillary tubes) under the beam of a scanning electron microscope. \"This is not the original microscope’s purpose. The temperature increase is explained by an accumulation of electrons in the glass. Electrons accumulate because glass is a non-conductive material.\" explains Lorentz Steinbock, researcher at the Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology and co-author of a .\nShrinking under control\n As the glass shrinks, it can be seen live on the microscope screen. \"It’s like a glass-blower. Thanks to the possibilities provided by the new microscope at EPFL’s Center of Micronanotechnology (MIC), the operator can adjust the microscope’s voltage and electric field strength while observing the tube’s reaction. Thus, the person operating the microscope can very precisely control the shape he wants to give to the glass”, says Aleksandra Radenovic, tenure-track assistant professor in charge of the laboratory.\nAt the end of this process, the capillary tube’s ends are perfectly controllable in diameter, ranging from 200 nanometers to fully closed. The scientists tested their slimmed down tubes in an experiment aiming to detect DNA segments in a sample. The test sample was moved from one container to another on a microfluidic chip. Whenever a molecule crossed the \"channel\" connecting the containers, the variation of the ion current was measured. As expected, the EPFL team obtained more accurate results with a tube reduced to the size of 11 nm than with standard market models. \"By using a capillary tube costing only a few cents, in five minutes we are able to make a device that can replace \"nano-channels\" sold for hundreds of dollars!\" explains Aleksandra Radenovic.\nThese nano-fillers have a potential beyond laboratory usage. \"We can imagine industrial applications in ultra-high precision printers, as well as opportunities in surgery, where micro-pipettes of this type could be used at a cell’s scale\", says the researcher.\nFor the time being, the method for manufacturing nano-capillary tubes is manual, the transition to an industrial scale will take some time.

{"id": 760, "text": "Several studies over the past few years have shown that what constitutes a healthy diet for an individual depends to some extent on his or her physiology and lifestyle. This has given rise to the concept of personalized nutrition, where nutritionists take specific information about an individual into account to develop personalized healthy-eating guidelines. For example, scientists have found that individuals’ glycemia – or blood-sugar level – varies according to their diet, lifestyle (e.g., amount of exercise and sleep) and the composition of their intestinal bacteria (also known as “gut flora”).\nA crowdsourcing approach to scientific research\nTo help further research into personalized nutrition, scientists at EPFL’s Digital Epidemiology Laboratory, headed by Marcel Salathé, have launched the Food & You study\n. \nThe goal is to confirm the theory that different people respond very differently – as measured by their blood-sugar levels – after eating the same meal.\nFood & You is a citizen science initiative, meaning volunteers from the general public play a direct role in the research. The upshot is that not only are scientific discoveries made more easily, but researchers also have an opportunity to build awareness about important scientific issues and share their expertise, results and enthusiasm.\nFood & You is being conducted entirely online through a digital cohort of study participants. Unlike in conventional studies, participants don’t have to go through an interview or medical examination. The instructions for participants are provided electronically – by email, text message or on the  – and all materials they need are sent by mail. The data for the study are collected through the website and an app called MyFoodRepo, which was developed in association with Fondation Leenaards. The app draws on information in the  (formerly OpenFood) – an open-source repository of nutritional information on 38,000 bar-coded food products – so that users can easily track their food intake by taking pictures of their meals. Thanks to artificial intelligence and an image-recognition algorithm, the app can calculate the nutritional value of meals based on the products’ bar codes or photos. The Open Food Repo was developed in 2016 by EPFL’s Digital Epidemiology Laboratory and the Kristian Gerhard Jebsen Foundation, a Swiss philanthropy foundation that also sponsors Food & You.\nThe Food & You project will extend over several years; the scientists plan to enroll some 1,000 participants in Switzerland each year. Participants will be asked to record their daily food intake in the MyFoodRepo app for two weeks, and to use another app or a smartwatch to track their sleep and physical activity. They will also have to measure their blood-sugar levels using a tiny portable monitor (like the FreeStyle Libre). Once during the two-week period, participants must collect and send in a stool sample that will be analyzed to sequence the DNA of their gut flora. And they will need to complete online questionnaires to provide anthropometric, demographic and health information.\nAchieving more accurate personalized nutrition\nThe EPFL scientists plan to use the data collected in the Food & You study to develop an algorithm that can predict individuals’ blood-sugar levels after every meal. “Our findings could have a major impact on the nutritional recommendations and personalized eating plans given to individuals. The results could also provide essential information on how our diet affects our health on a daily basis,” says Dr. Salathé.

{"id": 761, "text": "Trouble learning how to write, called dysgraphia, affects some 10% of schoolchildren. This learning disability is often associated with dyslexia and can appear in children to varying degrees, with causes that can differ from one child to the next. A team of researchers at EPFL’s Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction Laboratory (CHILI) has developed software that enables doctors to make highly detailed, personalized assessments of this disability and to accurately identify the letters and numbers that are most difficult and are thus the most discriminative. Their research has just been published in \nNature Digital Medicine.\nWriting is an essential skill for schoolchildren, but it requires an adroit combination of careful concentration, well-developed motor skills and good language comprehension – something that not all children possess. And although writing problems may appear trivial at first, if they are not treated early on, they could quickly snowball into more serious conditions like a lack of confidence, low self-esteem, trouble learning other skills, a high level of fatigue and even behavioral problems. Early detection is therefore key.\nIn French-speaking countries, dysgraphia is currently diagnosed using a standardized writing test called BHK. Ergotherapists or psychomotor therapists use the test to assess a child’s handwriting according to 13 criteria. But according to Thibault Asselborn, a PhD student at CHILI and lead author of the study, the BHK test is limited. “It relies entirely on a therapist’s own observation and is therefore subjective. And it can be six months or more between when a teacher first becomes concerned about a child’s writing skills and when the child is finally taken to a specialist.”\nAnalyzing over 50 different characteristics \nThe test developed at EPFL, called Tegami, which is run using a tablet computer, represents a major step forward in terms of analytical precision and accuracy of input. It was developed from a database of writing samples from 300 children, around 25% of whom suffered from dysgraphia. The program was able to detect the learning disability 98% of the time.\nThe big advantage of Tegami is that it can help pinpoint the cause of a child’s dysgraphia because it analyzes no fewer than 53 different characteristics of a child’s writing, which are measured up to 200 times per second. These characteristics include the angle of the pen, the amount of pressure the child applies to the tablet, how fast the child writes and any changes in that speed, whether the child’s hand trembles and if so, with what frequency, and which letters or characters are most discriminative.\nExample of a disgraphic child's handwriting.\nA dynamic assessment\n“Our software brings a dynamic aspect to the evaluation of a child’s writing. The BHK test lets therapists evaluate a writing sample only after it’s been written. But with Tegami, therapists can analyze the entire writing process and get a clear, comprehensive picture of all of a child’s movements,” says Thomas Gargot, a child psychiatrist, expert in cognitive science, PhD student in computer science at Pitié Salpêtrière teaching hospital in Paris and one of the study’s authors.\nAccording to Gargot, the software also paves the way to classifying different kinds of dysgraphia. The new types of data it collects will enable pediatricians to determine whether there are writing disabilities associated with autism, hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder, and to better understand how teaching methods can be adapted accordingly.\nTegami should also help children with writing disabilities get more targeted treatment. The EPFL researchers are now working with psycho motor therapists and speech therapists to outline remedial measures; for example, if a child shows too much variation in the pressure he puts on his pen, his doctor can prescribe motor-skill exercises. The researchers are also looking into how they can combine Tegami with another program developed at CHILI called CoWriter, where children improve their skills and self-confidence by teaching a robot how to write.", "summary": "Nearly 10% of elementary school students have trouble learning to write, with potentially lasting consequences on their education.

{"id": 762, "text": "The place that cars occupy in Swiss people’s hearts has evolved considerably in recent years. Their conflicting views in this regard may even anticipate a shift from a car-centered society to a service-oriented society. Swiss people could well be ready to move past cars, which would entail leaving behind a means of transport that has long been synonymous with modernity. What’s more, this shift may even be economically viable. These are the main conclusions of a major research project entitled \"PostCarWorld\". The detailed results of this study will be presented at a symposium to be held on 3 October at EPFL and attended by Olivier Français, a former EPFL student who is now a member of the Swiss Council of States representing Vaud.\nCan you imagine getting around in a world without cars? That was the initial question put to a thousand Swiss people, including experts in urban planning and mobility, as well as members of the general public. They were asked to imagine their life in a society that had opted to live without cars, not for environmental reasons or due to a fuel shortage but simply out of choice. The idea for this study had been brewing for several years within the research institutes of EPFL's School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering before finally seeing the light of day. Jacques Lévy, a geographer and head of EPFL’s Chôros Laboratory, directed the study, which was conducted over a four-year period. A cross-disciplinary approach was adopted in order to enhance the study’s scope. The PostCarWorld research project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation's Sinergia program, which supports pioneering, cross-disciplinary research projects. Geographers, architects, urban planners, economists, transport and mobility engineers, political experts and sociologists from EPFL, ETH Zurich and the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) all worked together, giving rise to several theses and scientific publications and numerous cross- and multi-disciplinary collaborations.\nShedding light on the current situation\nWhat did they find? \"The advantage of this type of prospective study is that it sheds light on the current situation. In asking Swiss people to imagine a car-free future, we were really aiming to find out more about what's happening right now and about people's complex relationship with cars,\" explains Lévy. This relationship has been complicated by the rapidly shifting and highly contradictory status of cars in Switzerland. While most Swiss people are prepared to consider alternatives to buying a car, they are slow to change, and people still enjoy driving. As leasing, car sharing, carpooling, public transport and telecommuting gain ground, people no longer need to own their own car to have that sense of freedom. \"We’re shifting from an object-centered world, in which cars are an extension of our private property, a myth, a dream, to a service-oriented world, which is based on a whole new approach to mobility,\" explains Lévy.\nAnother change that they observed was a renewed focus on public spaces within cities. The era of the automobile transformed our cities and landscapes for almost a century. The terrain was divided between cars and pedestrians – and until recently, cars were given priority. \"There was a consensus among the urban planners we interviewed: they all want to rethink our streets and place more importance on shared spaces. Cars will have to adapt to this multimodal world in which pedestrians are reclaiming their rights and public spaces are no longer taken over by cars.\"\nTheir final observation was that cars are responsible for the urban sprawl around us that, once it reaches a certain size, hinders a city’s growth. Here’s why: \"The outer suburbs don't have the same access to services as city centers do. But when those outer areas are developed, they make city centers less attractive. In Switzerland, we've seen how, paradoxically, railways are responsible for some of this urban sprawl, as they clear the roads rather than replacing them. We met many families that used both the train and the car to get into town. So cars are not just an environmental problem – they are a problem when it comes to urban planning and living together as well,\" explains Lévy.\nAs part of the study, researchers looked into whether a car-free Switzerland was economically viable. The answer is surprisingly positive, provided, of course, that part of the budget allocated to roads is transferred to the development of public transport and new infrastructure. \"Based on our geographic models, which incorporate various criteria, we concluded that it wouldn't be technically difficult to develop a car-free society, but the current infrastructure would have to be adapted.\"\nFast moving walkways, telecommuting and anthropology \nAs part of the study, EPFL's TRANSP-OR Laboratory came up with the idea of building fast moving walkways that allow people to get around town quickly without a car. This invention has already caught the eye of the European Commission. Also at EPFL, a study was conducted into the mobility of those living in the Lake Geneva region. It showed that building strategic public transport links could influence the means of transport chosen by people over the long term. The disruptive influence of driverless cars was also analyzed. According to the researchers, these cars will play a unique role in how we get around since they are not designed to replace human-driven cars. At ETH Zurich, researchers looked into how people's timetables could be reorganized in a car-free society, especially by making greater use of telecommunications and telecommunicating. At USI, a difference was observed between German-speaking Switzerland and the French- and Italian-speaking parts of the country, with private cars slightly more popular in the latter regions.\nKindling an in-depth debate\nFor the PostCarWorld researchers, a car-free world is much more likely now than it was 20 years ago. While the individual interviews revealed that Swiss people are contradictory in their approach to mobility, they also showed that people were increasingly aware of the issue and open-minded, and that their expectations were evolving. According to Lévy, \"The balance is shifting. People living in downtown areas are aware that the cars polluting the air around them and creating noise come from outside the town, and that the fine particles they produce are deadly. Certain public policies have changed, but the Swiss Constitution sends a mixed signal: it sets sustainable development as an objective but also stipulates that people must be free to choose their means of transport. But does this right to mobility conflict with other rights, such as the right to health?\"\nAccording to the researchers, these contradictions are a product of the paradoxes of our time – and a sign that we are transitioning to a post-car society. \"That picture-perfect image still used in car ads of a lone driver surrounded by the Grand Canyon resonates less these days: we spend more time stuck in traffic jams and our cars are equipped with such things as cameras and drowsiness and speed detectors. Drivers are expected to have the same reflexes as a machine and be able to absorb a lot of information at the same time. That's far removed from the pleasure of driving fast and conquering open spaces.\"\nHonorary lecture and exhibition\nAfter the findings of the PostCarWorld project are presented, Jacques Lévy, who has headed the Chôros Laboratory since 2004, will give an honorary lecture on the theme of \"living together\". He will look back on 13 years of research and look to the future by proposing new research opportunities in the areas of mobility, urban design, urban planning, globalization, political geography, spatial justice, digital space, and mapping – all topics that he hopes to address by putting in place a cross-disciplinary research network.\nThe day will end with the opening of an exhibition to showcase the work of the Chôros Laboratory, which has strived to bridge the gap between human sciences and exact sciences for over a decade. This work is illustrated through maps, which are used as both a vector of communication and a research tool, reflecting just how useful maps are at all stages of knowledge production. Lévy has also mapped out electoral results in Switzerland and France, shedding light on the reflexivity of citizens and ensuring that the public debate did not overlook the question of space.

{"id": 764, "text": "“Real life genetics” works. This research method involves observing physiological traits or metabolic disease in a large population of “wild-type” mice (those which have not been genetically modified), and then isolating the genes that could be responsible. Because it’s complex and expensive, the method is rarely used, but it has nonetheless enabled EPFL researchers to obtain interesting results.\nAn article published today* in the online edition of the journal \nCell \ndescribes how the method was used to reveal a dysfunctional bone mineralization process. “We compared the genotype of mice with a fragile bone structure with mice that were more robust,” explains Evan Williams, a scientist in EPFL’s Laboratory for Integrative and Systemic Physiology (LISP). “By observing their genes, we were able to identify the one responsible for alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose malfunction leads to various forms of bone disease.”\nA factor in osteoporosis\nScientists were already familiar with hypophosphatase, a human disease caused by the absence of this gene that leads to extreme skeletal fragility from a very young age. “With this new discovery we can conclude that a defect in the gene expression for alkaline phosphatase affects bone strength in mature adults. In fact, fractures are the primary cause for hospitalization in the elderly,” says LISP director Johan Auwerx. Pénélope Andreux, a co-author of the study, adds that the gene has other jobs in the cell as well: “it plays an important role in vitamin B6 absorption, which is involved in protein metabolism,” she explains.\nVery different characteristics\n These results suggest that new therapeutic avenues might be possible for preventing osteoporosis, by acting on the enzymes associated with the expression of this gene. But that’s not all. The study of this population of mice wasn’t limited to their bones: no less than 140 parameters, such as body weight, running speed and fur color, were measured, and the results were often astonishing.\nFor example, in a single population and without any added stimulation, some mice spontaneously ran two km every night, while others ran twelve. And some mice had up to 6.7 times better glucose tolerance than others.\nWhat could explain these differences? “Our results, which we have made available to the scientific community, will allow specialists in various fields to make associations between the genome of these mice and their physical and behavioral characteristics,” says Auwerx. “Then it will be a matter of establishing correlations with the expression of the same genes in humans.” Observing these mice populations will thus lead to many discoveries.\n* Pénélope A.

{"id": 766, "text": "Oxidative stress affects all living organisms, and the damage it causes is believed to play a part in cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and a number of other health conditions. Some animals have developed remarkable, even radical strategies for combating its effects. Researchers at EPFL observed that, under acute oxidative stress, flies belonging to the genus \nDrosophila\n, commonly known as fruit flies, remove and excrete damage-causing lipids, or fats, from their blood. The team has .\nLike humans, fruit flies produce molecules known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group that includes free radicals. Although they tend to get a bad press for the harm they cause to our cells, these molecules also have beneficial effects, for instance alerting the immune system to an infection or repairing damaged tissue.\nIn normal circumstances, their harmful effects are counteracted by our cells’ natural defense mechanisms, and by antioxidants such as vitamins C and E. Yet pathogens, smoking and ultraviolet light can upset this delicate balance by sending ROS production into overdrive, eventually overwhelming our body’s natural defenses.\nDropping like flies\nThe EPFL team, led by Professor Bruno Lemaitre, happened upon a previously unknown defense strategy against ROS in fruit flies after observing that mutant individuals grown in the lab were dying a few days after exposure to a normally benign pathogen.\nAn initial investigation revealed the reason: fruit flies normally produce a fat-binding protein in their kidneys, but a mutated gene was depriving the genetically altered flies of this capability.\n“Because the flies were dropping fast, we decided to have a bit of fun,” says Prof. Lemaitre. “We named the mutated gene and the protein after Marco Materazzi, the Italian soccer player on the receiving end of Zinedine Zidane’s infamous headbutt in the World Cup final.”\nA previously unknown mechanism\nAt this point, the team still hadn’t made the link between the flies’ death, the genetic mutation and oxidative stress. “We were baffled by what we discovered,” explains Prof. Lemaitre. “Why were insects under pathogen-induced stress dying because they couldn’t produce a fat-binding protein in their kidneys?”\nThe answer lies in a secondary mechanism of oxidative stress, by which free radicals attack lipids in the blood, producing toxic compounds and even more ROS. This self-perpetuating process, known as lipid peroxidation, has to be brought under control at all costs.\nFruit flies have a simple yet effective way of stopping this process from spiraling out of control: they remove one part of the equation altogether. Certain stressors cause the fly’s kidneys to begin producing the Materazzi protein, which binds to the lipids in its blood. These are then passed out in the insect’s feces.\n“As we saw with our mutants, this mechanism really is a matter of life and death for a stressed insect,” says Xiaoxue Li, a scientist in Prof. Lemaitre’s group and the paper’s lead author.\nThe scientists suspect this same mechanism could play an important role in other insects, and perhaps even in other animals. Previous studies have identified an allergen in cockroach droppings that bears many similarities to the Materazzi protein.\n“Just like the flies in our study, all living organisms have to deal with oxidative stress damage,” adds Prof. Lemaitre. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see it become a major public health issue.”", "summary": "Flies belonging to the genus Drosophila combat oxidative stress by removing excess fat from their blood.

{"id": 767, "text": "Some 1,880 young athletes aged 15–18 will flock from every corner of the globe to Lausanne and the surrounding area for the 2020 Youth Olympic Games (YOG), which run from 9 to 22 January. They will stay at UNIL’s Dorigny campus, in the purpose-built Vortex village which, once the games are over, will become student accommodations. The venues – Lausanne, Les Diablerets, Villars, Champéry and St. Moritz – will host eight sports in total over the two weeks of the games. Alongside traditional disciplines such as alpine skiing, snowboarding, Nordic combined, ice hockey, biathlon, curling, skating and bobsled, the Lausanne games will be the first to feature ski mountaineering, after the sport was recognized by the International Olympic Committee.\nEPFL boasts a longstanding track record in pushing the boundaries of sports innovation. The school will contribute to the 2020 YOG education program, using the games as a testing ground for new technologies developed in conjunction with the UNIL-EPFL Sport and Health Center (CSS) and CHUV. Pascal Vuilliomenet, a project manager at EPFL’s Vice Presidency for Innovation, is intimately familiar with the 30 or so laboratories carrying out sports-related research and development work. It’s his job to create synergies. “The 2020 YOG is a major event,” says Vuilliomenet. “It’s a chance to get everyone working together on applied projects, to strengthen existing collaborative relationships – and to start new ones.”\nSports and technology come together \nHealth and injury prevention in sports\nFor EPFL, UNIL and CHUV, the Lausanne 2020 YOG are a unique opportunity to showcase  an unprecedented and ambitious educational project that combines technology with sports science and injury prevention techniques to promote the benefits of good health for athletic performance.\nAthletes will have a chance to create their own avatar, or digital double. After completing a series of mobility, stability and movement tests, their data will be fed into the system. The results will be collated in an app, developed by EPFL startup Katapult, where athletes will be able to see their personal musculoskeletal and motor profile, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The app will also enable specialists to give athletes tips and advice on improving their performance.\nThe project is a joint effort between researchers and the CSS. “It’s a virtuous circle,” explains Vuilliomenet. “The CSS, which works directly with athletes, tells us what products and services it wants to develop, then we find labs capable of meeting that demand. The CSS tests the prototypes and reports back to us. And in the process, we generate a rich vein of data that can be used in other areas of research.”\nAthletes’ test results are fed into their avatar © Katapult\nParadigm shift\nThe idea behind Health for Performance is to bring about a paradigm shift in sports coaching and training. Whereas in the past the emphasis was on strength, speed and endurance, the project stresses how moving in the right way can help athletes reach their full potential. “These days, everyone wants to trail race, that’s what’s hot,” says Stéphane Maeder, head of the CSS. “And people want to run faster, go further, or lift heavier weights. But what happens? They get injured! We want to change mindsets and place the emphasis on quality. Athletes should stop thinking about how far they can push themselves, and focus instead on how they’re moving their bodies.” Athletes competing in the 2020 YOG will have a chance to use some of the assessment tools developed by Maeder and his team. These same tools will gradually be rolled out at the CSS.\n Once an extension planned for 2021 is complete, the CSS will serve as a one-stop shop for sports technology. “We’ll be equipped to run tests and assessments for people of all ages and mobility profiles – not just athletes,” says Maeder. “We’ll be able to detect and act on issues before they become serious.”\nKnow yourself better to train better\n© Alain Herzog\nAccording to Stéphane Tercier, lead consultant for adolescent sports medicine (SportAdo) at CHUV, “the medical implications of the Health for Performance concept are clear: young athletes wishing to maintain a high level of performance throughout their careers need to stay in good overall health.” This message, which spans all aspects of adolescents’ physical and mental health, features in preventive health materials developed by CHUV and disseminated through EPFL’s innovative communication channels.\n“There’s a link between elite sports and the work we do,” says Olivier Mutter, a project manager at UNIL’s Institute of Sport Sciences (ISSUL) who has been designing sports education programs for many years. “The aim of our work is to promote good public health – physical and mental. We’re building bridges between worlds that traditionally don’t connect: between research, sports and the general population.”\nThe Squaty sensor-filled mat records downward pressure and center-of-gravity displacement © Alain Herzog\nThree experiments at the 2020 YOG\nSquaty\n, developed by EPFL startup Technis, is a sensor-filled mat. The sensors record downward pressure and center-of-gravity displacement as users perform a squat exercise, sending the readings to an app. The smart mat is also connected to cameras that analyze the joints, observing movement compensation.\nBody Lat\n involves measuring range of motion in the muscles and joints and analyzing mobility.\nMotor skills\n analyzes fine motor skills by assessing how athletes maintain balance while hopping on a seesaw-like apparatus, tracking their movements until they regain stability.\nSports health laboratories and startups\nAt the next YOG, competitors will have a chance to try out the avatar they create using the Katapult app, which will be enhanced by various technologies developed by EPFL, UNIL, CHUV and other Smart Move partners. The app will produce ever more detailed results. For instance, athletes will gain insights into how sleep and diet affect their health and performance, and even check their overall state of health by looking at biomarkers in their sweat. The technologies will include contributions from several EPFL labs and startups.\nTracking movement \nThe Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB), led by Professor Pascal Fua, has developed a system that uses one or more cameras to analyze an athlete’s movements. Using algorithms, the system reconstructs the position of the athlete’s body in space and calculates the trajectory of the joints. Prof. Fua and his team are developing versions of the technology that can operate in increasingly complex environments.\nThe lab’s next challenge, working with Swatch Group’s sports watch arm Swiss Timing, is to track competitive divers as they execute their dives. “Our system should help judges score dives more objectively, and improve training,” explains Prof. Fua. “The idea is to overlay dozens of recorded dives, check for consistency of movement, and perhaps even suggest improvements.” The technology has already been used to track soccer and basketball players, and will soon be deployed on the ski slopes.\nIdentifying and tracking individuals\nAlexandre Alahi, a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL’s Visual Intelligence for Transportation Laboratory (VITA), works on the implications of human behavior for self-driving cars. He has developed an app that uses a smartphone camera to detect a person’s movements, posture, body position and direction of gaze, including in the middle of a crowd. The system can identify and continue tracking people even if they temporarily leave the camera’s field of view because it recognizes their behavior, posture, movement and activity profile. The technology works by building a unique, 17-point model of a person’ skeleton (see photo above). “The system could give coaches precise, detailed, real-time insights into athletes’ movements and postures,” says Prof. Alahi.\nEating well to perform well\nHow can marathon runners keep their blood sugar levels stable? How can sprinters gain explosive strength? In theory, science should be able to address questions like these. But the sheer number of variables in play means that, in practice, precise answers are more elusive. “An apple’s origin, variety, whether or not it’s organic – all these factors affect different people in different ways,” explains Chloé Allémann, a scientific assistant who leads the Food and You project at EPFL’s Digital Epidemiology Lab.\nDiet and health are closely related. Likewise, the foods athletes eat impact their performance. “Many health issues can be addressed with a balanced diet and regular exercise,” says Allémann. “In terms of sports, we could develop custom diets for individual athletes.”\nFrom her diet and lifestyle research – spanning aspects such as exercise, sleep, everyday habits, overall health, gut microbiota and blood sugar – Allémann understands that we all react differently to the foods we eat. “Blood sugar levels vary from one person to the next,” she explains. “Eating a banana before exercising is beneficial for some people but not for others.”\nThe research group plans to invite around 20 athletes to a CSS summer camp for observation. “The athletes will spend a week eating exactly the same diet and doing exactly the same exercises,” says Allémann. “We’ll be able to measure how their blood sugar levels vary under similar conditions.”\nDiet plays a prominent role in health and athletic performance © Alain Herzog\nWearable biochemical sensors\nEPFL spinoff Xsensio – working with the Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab), from which it originated – has developed on-chip sensors that measure biomarkers in sweat. The chip, which measures barely 5 mm\n2\n and is worn on a smart patch stuck to the skin, sends real-time, continuous readings to a smartphone app or other external system. “The sensors can measure variations in electrolyte, metabolite or protein concentrations in an athlete’s sweat,” says Esmeralda Megally, Xsensio co-founder and CEO. “Electrolyte changes, for instance, tell us how dehydrated the wearer is, or how well they’re acclimatizing to heat. Similarly, lactate levels give us insights into muscle activity, while cortisol is an indicator of stress. The data should also be of interest to medical practitioners.”\nWhat sets Xsensio’s device apart is its size: the tiny chip can hold millions of sensors. “Our ambition is to produce a constant flow of biochemical information that’s as accurate as you’d get from a blood test, without the invasive downside,” says Megally. Xsensio’s Lab-on-Skin chip recently scooped a CES Innovation Award in the wearable technologies category. The award ceremony will take place in January in Las Vegas.\nMeasuring biomarkers in sweat with a tiny chip worn on the skin © Xsensio\nTracking athletes, step by step\nCollecting information is only the first part of the process. The data needs to be centralized, delivered to athletes, coaches, physicians, physiotherapists and other team members in a usable format – and kept secure. The Katapult app, developed by the eponymous EPFL startup, is an all-in-one health management hub where athletes can see their test results, get automated, personalized recommendations, and track their progress. The company has been working with the CSS for the past four years. “We tested the app with 2,300 athletes in Buenos Aires in 2018, checking its functionality and robustness,” explains Dan Hafner, Katapult’s director. “Despite power cuts and patchy Wi-Fi coverage, we didn’t lose any data. We’re unlikely to face the same challenges in Lausanne.”\nThe start-up Katapult has developed an application to collect data from athletes © Katapult\nCross-disciplinary approaches in compulsory education\nThe Lausanne 2020 YOG provided the basis for unprecedented collaboration between EPFL’s Education Outreach Department and the Canton of Vaud’s General Directorate of Compulsory Education (DGEO). EPFL and the DGEO spent 12 months developing a cross-disciplinary teaching kit with input from high-school teachers. Every class in Vaud Canton received a copy of the kit.\nWhat makes this new resource different is that it shows how objects in the world around us draw on disciplines that are traditionally taught separately at school. The kit stresses that, while science and technology are important, other subjects – from art and design to marketing, geography and economics – also have a role to play. “The kit also draws links between the curriculum taught in local schools and winter sports,” says Laura Tibourcio de la Corre, from EPFL’s Education Outreach Department. “For instance, downhill skiing can help children learn about Pythagoras’ theorem and how to calculate speed.”\nTwo films were also produced to accompany the kit, looking at the design and manufacture of two pieces of winter sports equipment that will feature prominently at the 2020 YOG: ski helmets and skis. The design of ski helmets touches on issues of biology, research and development. How does the helmet protect against skull fractures? How does it prevent concussion? The helmet film includes footage of EPFL students working on shock absorption systems, as well as physicians from CHUV explaining the mechanisms behind concussion. The second film, on skis, focuses on manufacturing and shows local, cutting-edge companies in action.\n© Alain Herzog\nPublic exhibition\nLausanne’s Malley Sports Center will host an interactive exhibition, housed inside a 300 m\n2\n dome, where schoolchildren and members of the public will have a chance to try some of the athletes’ exercises for themselves.

{"id": 771, "text": "One of the aims of Switzerland’s 2050 Energy Strategy is to increase hydroelectric production. The Swiss government therefore also needs to predict the environment in which these power plants will operate so that the underlying technology can keep pace with changing needs and future conditions. “In Switzerland, the glaciers and snow are melting more and more quickly. This affects the quality of the water, with a sharp rise in the content of sediments,” says François Avellan, who heads the LMH and is one of the study’s authors. “The sediments are very aggressive and erode the turbines.” This undermines the plants' efficiency, leaves cavities in the equipment and leads to an increase in vibrations – and in the frequency and cost of repairs. To top things off, the turbines’ useful life is reduced. Under the umbrella of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity () and with the support of the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), EPFL has teamed up with General Electric Renewable Energy in an effort to better understand and predict the process of sediment erosion. The aim is to lengthen the hydropower plants' life span through improved turbines and more effective operating strategies.\nTiny particles with an outsized impact\nOne of the challenges facing researchers in the field of hydropower is that they cannot run experiments directly on power plants because of the impact and cost of a plant’s outage. They must therefore limit their investigations to simulations and reduced-scale physical model tests. In response to this challenge, the LMH has come up with a novel multiscale computer model that predicts sediment erosion in turbines with much greater accuracy than other approaches. The results have been published in the scientific journal . “Sediment erosion, like many other problems in nature, is a multiscale phenomenon. It means that behavior observed at the macroscopic level is the result of a series of interactions at the microscopic level,” says Sebastián Leguizamón, an EPFL doctoral student and lead author of the study. “The sediments are extremely small and move very fast, and their impact lasts less than a microsecond. On the other hand, the erosion process we see is gradual, taking place over the course of many operating hours and affecting all the turbine.”\nA multiscale solution\nThe researchers therefore opted for a multiscale solution and modeled the two processes involved in erosion separately. At the microscopic level, they focused on the extremely brief impact of the minuscule sediments that strike the turbines, taking into account parameters such as the angle, speed, size, shape – and even composition – of the slurry. At the macroscopic level, they looked at how the sediments are transported by water flow, as this affects the flux, distribution and density of sediments reaching the walls of the turbine flow passages. The results were then combined in order to develop erosion predictions. “It’s not possible to study the entire process of erosion as a whole. The sediments are so small and the period of time over which the process takes place so long that replicating the process would take hundreds of years of calculations and require a computer that doesn’t exist yet,” says Leguizamón. “But the problem becomes manageable when you decouple the different phases.”\nAdapting to the future\nWith conclusive results in hand, the LMH has now moved on to the next phase, which consists in characterizing the materials used in the turbines. Following this step, the researchers will be able to apply the new model to existing hydroelectric facilities. The stakes are global when it comes to retrofitting turbines in response to climate change, as hydropower accounts for 17% of the world’s electricity production. Turbines offer little leeway and have to operate in a wide range of environments – including monsoon regions and anything from tropical to alpine climates. If turbines are to last, changes will have to be made to both their underlying design and how they are operated. “While I was evaluating a hydro plant in the Himalayas, my contacts there told me that if a turbine made it through more than one monsoon season, that was a success!” says Avellan.\nThis study is part of CTI project No. 17568.1 PFEN-IW GPUSpheros. It was conducted in conjunction with General Electric Renewable Energy under the umbrella of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity (SCCER-SoE).\n “A multiscale model for sediment impact erosion simulation using the finite volume particle method,” Sebastián Leguizamón, Ebrahim Jahanbakhsh, Audrey Maertens, Siamak Alimirzazadeh and François Avellan.", "summary": "Of all the electricity produced in Switzerland, 56% comes from hydropower.

{"id": 779, "text": "Anders Meibom is a man who appreciates chance – which might sound a bit contradictory in the sciences, in which precision is usually prized. “When you are carrying out research with a specific goal in mind, you often end up discovering something much more interesting,” he says. “This is why in life I avoid planning. I don’t like writing proposals, either: I always have the feeling that I'm making a plan I probably won’t end up following anyway,” he chuckles. And yet, his non-plans often come together with the help of his “A” team.\nWhen he was young, Meibom says, he was a “nerd.” The former member of the Danish national under-18 football team only went to university “because I was really interested in math and physics.” He was, however, a lucky nerd. Fortune first struck when he met a professor who talked him into studying meteorites and doing a PhD. It struck again in 1997, bringing him to the University of Hawaii, one of the world’s key centers for meteorites and cosmochemistry research. “I started out studying space rocks,” he says, not for a second suspecting he would later investigate what occurs in our oceans. In 2000, he accepted a position as a research associate in the Department of Geological & Environmental Sciences at Stanford.\nSHRIMP, corals and Swiss cheese\nThe Stanford campus is home to a large ion microscope, known incongruously as SHRIMP (Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe). Meibom’s professor left shortly after his arrival, which left him free to pursue his own research. Once Meibom had mastered SHRIMP, it became his favorite tool. One day, he stumbled across a paper that described how its authors had used an ion microprobe, similar to SHRIMP, to analyze trace elements in coral skeletons in order to reconstruct historic ocean temperatures. “Some corals grow their skeletons layer upon layer, a bit like tree rings, one centimeter per year. So drilling into one is like drilling back in time. But the paper’s measurements of trace element compositions were so high, I doubted that the authors knew how to operate an ion microprobe. I thought their data must be incorrect,” Meibom recalls.\n“The only other possibility was that there was something fishy with the trace element ‘proxies’ that were supposed to reflect the ocean temperatures. But when I measured a piece of coral with SHRIMP I found the same ratios and variations. I was flabbergasted.” From that moment on, Meibom took up the challenge of understanding how coral skeletons form. Fifteen years later, we now know that skeleton formation is a highly controlled biological process in which water temperature plays only an indirect role. “I wrote papers that basically called for an end to drilling holes in corals. In some well-known dive spots the corals look like Swiss cheese because every researcher wants their own piece,” he laughs.\nMoving from Stanford University to head up the NanoSIMS laboratory at Paris's National Museum of Natural History in 2005, Meibom expanded his research from coral skeletons to coral organisms as a whole, thanks to an ERC grant. It was there that he began to work with colleagues in Israel, which logically led him, in 2019, to the Red Sea. Now a professor at EPFL, he is also equipped with a NanoSIMS instrument. “We were conducting experiments to understand the role of symbiosis and photosynthesis in corals and wanted to trace metabolites inside coral tissue. The NanoSIMS microprobe has a spatial resolution so precise that we could see how nutrients and metabolites enter tissue and move around. We then began to stress the corals to simulate the effects of global warming and to better understand coral metabolism under thermal stress, which today is tragically killing off corals on a massive scale,” Meibom explains.\nThen the team – again, purely by chance – discovered that Red Sea corals have a huge resistance to abnormally high water temperatures. “We stressed them up to +5°C and they remained healthy. Had we done the same thing to Great Barrier Reef corals, they would have all died,” he says. “This was an incredible discovery – the corals in the northern Red Sea will probably be the ‘last reef standing’ at the end of the century. They will be able to resist global warming, so we must do all we can to protect them from being destroyed by local environmental stresses, such as pollution. Through the creation of the Transnational Red Sea Centre, and with strong support from the Swiss Foreign Ministry, we are now working hard to unite countries bordering the Red Sea in this effort.”\nThe project is far from completion, yet the discovery has made a splash worldwide. “I’ve always been drawn to cool scientific projects that have a ‘wow’ factor,” Meibom admits.\nMeibom’s kingdom of boredom\nThis accomplished sportsman swims, bikes, and practices yoga on a regular basis. “I feel uncomfortable when I don’t move.” And yet, he also confesses to something quite paradoxical: while he needs to be constantly in motion, he forces himself into a state of boredom to remain creative. It's hard to imagine him doing nothing. “During the weekend, I often go to the harbor in Pully; I sit there and stare at the mountains for a couple of hours. I don’t touch my phone. It’s beautiful and peaceful, but after a while it’s quite boring. And when one gets bored, one naturally starts thinking about things, often in a completely new way. Two hours of boredom can actually be much more efficient than a full week at work under pressure or meeting deadlines,” swears Meibom.\nAnd it works: the idea of the SKIL – the Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory – came about this way. At the time, he had the feeling that he should be teaching his classes differently, but he couldn’t put his finger on why. Then it struck him that the students were hungry for hands-on projects. Together with Professor Marilyne Andersen, the former dean of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), he built SKIL, a well-equipped workshop for hands-on projects supported by top-flight lab managers. “SKIL obviously doesn't replace teaching, but at EPFL, when we witness how efficiently students learn by doing, we believe it could play a bigger role in the curriculum. This happens when they have a strong voice in defining their own projects: working hands-on, planning, making decisions as they go, with ongoing professional support. It is an amazing process. The students take ownership of their ideas and projects, while we accompany them closely at every stage. In the process, we also learn a lot from them, I can assure you!” he asserts.\nDoes he ever stop thinking about work? “I think about it 24/7, which is a bit of a problem. I do a lot of sports, partly to take a step back. Yet it often happens that I come up with the solution to an analytical problem, or some data issue, while I’m swimming in the middle of the lake – again because after 45 minutes swimming gets pretty dull.” Eureka! Meibom even crunches numbers in the kitchen. “I love to bake bread and cook. Cooking is a bit like an experiment: it’s sometimes challenging, it’s a problem you have to solve, and you get the results immediately. I see recipes as loose guidelines, that’s why it’s fun. I don’t do exactly what they say and I still get away with it – most of the time,” he laughs. “Baking cakes is subtler, it’s more like chemistry: you have to be very precise otherwise it won’t work. But I always bake too much, so I give my neighbors and colleagues bread from time to time. Nobody’s left the neighborhood yet.” Given the success of his sourdough and fancy breads, one doubts that his recipes are left to chance.\nBio \n1969\n: Born in Denmark\n1997\n: Postdoctoral work at the Hawaii Institute for Geophysics and Planetology\n2000\n: Research associate in the Department of Geological & Environmental Sciences, Stanford University\n2005\n: Director of the NanoSIMS Laboratory at the National Museum of Natural History, Paris\n2012\n: Full professor at EPFL\n2018\n: Helps create SKIL\n2019\n: Studies Red Sea corals", "summary": "Summer series: A calling for research.

{"id": 783, "text": "The brain of a schizophrenia patient shows changes in network connections compared to the brain of a normal individual. That’s what scientists from the EPFL, observed after comparing the topography of affected brain regions and structural connections in a group of 16 schizophrenia patients with a group of 15 healthy individuals. Their results were recently published in the journal Human Brain Mapping.\n“The difficulty with schizophrenia is that it doesn’t seem to produce localised lesions but rather has a highly distributed aspect of neural abnormalities and connectivity deficits,” points out Alessandra Griffa, from the Signal Processing Laboratory 5 (LTS5) and first author of the paper. To identify affected brain networks, the scientists and their collaborators from the Department of psychiatry at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called diffusion spectrum MRI. This allows the diffusion of water in the brain’s white matter to be mapped tracing fiber bundle trajectories between different brain areas. In other words it allows them to map the connectome: the brain’s web of connectivity.\nThe comparison between healthy and schizophrenia brains shows for the first time that in the latter, 26 regions are affected meaning that about 30% of the brain nodes in the entire cerebral network are compromised. Affected areas are found in central as well as peripheral areas and include the frontal-parietal zone, an area involved in cognitive processes. “Even so, we can’t infer a clear association between the affected areas and for example the cognitive problems observed in schizophrenia disorder”, specifies Alessandra Griffa.\nWhite matter alteration\n The scientists were also able quantitate and characterise white matter structure (nerve fibers) and myelin (an insulator of nerve fibers, necessary for proper signal transmission). In afflicted brain areas of schizophrenic patients both these are modified resulting in less efficient nerve fibers connectivity. In effect, to get around damaged areas, connections need to find other paths, usually longer and thereby less efficient. The connection network then is decentralized in patients with the disorder compared to healthy individuals. For the scientists these structural alterations and the decentralized topology of the affected areas could be major mechanisms underlying schizophrenia disorder.

{"id": 785, "text": "For the layman, soil is just soil. But for Claire Guenat, a pedologist and researcher at EPFL’s Laboratory of Ecological Systems (ECOS), it is a subject worthy of a 576-page book. The work is entitled “\nSols et paysages. Types de sols, fonctions et usages en Europe moyenne\n” (“Soils and landscapes: soil types, functions and uses in Central Europe”). Written over five years in partnership with pedologist and biologist Jean-Michel Gobat, an honorary professor at the University of Neuchâtel, this 2.5 kg tome has just been published by Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes (PPUR). The book summarizes recent scientific research and will be of interest to pedologists, biologists, geographers, forestry specialists, town planners and nature-lovers alike.\nThe soils analyzed in the book are located in familiar landscapes, from the plateau to the Alps. As regards Western Switzerland, it looks at 54 soil types, providing insight into the huge variety that exists in the ground on which we walk every day. The book also shows us that, because of its broad range of climates, topography and geology, Western Switzerland alone plays host to 44% of the world’s soil types and two thirds of Europe’s soil types.\nAccording to the authors, these soils – like the bottom of the oceans – represent an unexplored world, forgotten by science, invisible under our feet. However, the potential for innovation contained within soils and the urgent need to protect them should encourage researchers to take an interest in them. We spoke to Claire Guenat to find out more.\nWhy does soil still represent an unknown world?\nFirstly because soil is not something we really see ordinarily, unlike vegetation for example. It also has negative connotations in our society. For example, when we’re young, we learn that earth is dirty, we shouldn’t touch it or eat it. But it’s an environment that’s full of life, full of organisms that carry out vital functions and are crucial for our well-being. People tend more to talk about protecting the quality of air and water than the quality of soil. Soil is taken for granted: people aren’t aware that it’s a finite resource and a valuable one at that, at a time when the surface area of soil is decreasing rapidly, particularly in Switzerland, where around 1 m\n2\n of arable land is disappearing every second. There is some research being done in this area and laws are being enacted to improve soil protection, but the scientific community and the general public are mostly unaware of the wealth and importance that soils represent.\nIn your book, you say that today’s laws protect landscapes, but rarely soils. Is that why your book describes Western Switzerland’s soils within 12 different landscapes?\nYes, that’s a way of raising readers’ awareness of this paradox. We have laws protecting the Lavaux region, the Aletsch Glacier and prehistoric pile dwelling sites, but there are no laws protecting the unique nature of certain rare soil types, even though their heritage value is on a par with that of the landscapes I mentioned. So we wanted to point out that fact, without putting forward any poetic, political or ideological vision, but relying on scientific research, observations and statistics.\nHow does your book help readers to understand the value of soil?\nSoils have various functions. Switzerland’s Federal Office for the Environment recognizes several of these: providing raw materials, support for buildings and infrastructure, resources for forestry and agricultural production and habitats, helping with climate and water regulation and acting as a record of past climates and civilizations. But currently, the only value estimated with respect to a plot of land, and indirectly the soil within it, is its monetary value as a real-estate asset. The value of the soil resulting from its other functions has yet to be established. It’s worth emphasizing that each soil type can fulfill different functions depending on its composition and how it functions in physical, chemical and biological terms. For example, soil helps to sequester CO\n2\n, but the value of that function is not quantified either. When peat soils are used in farming, the organic material in them is mineralized and in the space of a few decades, they end up releasing all the CO\n2\n that they have captured over several millennia. As a result, there is a discussion to be had about balancing the various interests involved. To gain a better understanding of what we gain and lose when we alter soil, we tried to show the attributes and the services that each soil type presented provides to nature and to humans, along with ways in which we can sustainably protect and restore them.\nIn your opinion, which type of soil deserves the most attention? \nAll soils deserve attention, but soil management in cities is now a crucial issue for our increasingly urban societies. Urban soils are the soils in parks, flower beds and gardens, but also the soils underneath buildings and roads. Those soils have important roles to play in the regulation of water and heat as our climate changes, resulting in increasingly frequent heavy rain, flooding and heat waves. This is a major public health issue. The urban gardening trend is also one that needs closer inspection, because some soils need to be remediated or decontaminated before they are used, as our research shows.\nWhat’s left to discover about soil? \nSoils contain millions of types of fungus and bacteria that remain undiscovered. We don’t yet know what they are or what their purpose is, but such organisms could have therapeutic benefits and be a source of innovation, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. So we need to explore them urgently, before it’s too late. Finally, some researchers are trying to reconstitute soils and recreate environments, but we are still a long way from mastering this technique. Our message is that the priority should be on protecting soils and restoring their primary functions – even if that means removing structures from some land that is more suited to agriculture than buildings – rather than on creating artificial soils. In practical terms, we also need to quantify how the various types of soil are distributed spatially in Switzerland: detailed soil maps are a basic tool for any protection effort, and they are still lacking in large areas of the country.\nA book signing session will take place at the , at EPFL (located in the Rolex Learning Center) on the 4th July 2019, at 5pm.", "summary": "Claire Guenat, a researcher at EPFL, has just published a book – the first of its kind – about the soils of Switzerland and Europe with Jean-Michel Gobat, an honorary professor at the University of Neuchâtel.

Renewable energy sources are transforming the way electricity is being generated and distributed, while the ballooning amount of data being collected – and the new systems for processing it – are creating an array of new opportunities. So it is only logical that power companies are teaming up with research institutes to develop solutions for addressing these challenges. One example is Romande Energie’s new Smart Lab at EPFL’s Innovation Park. The Lab, which was inaugurated today, is destined to become a major skills center and marks an important milestone in the partnership between the two organizations.\nRomande Energie first joined forces with EPFL in 2010 to develop and install colored, translucent solar panels equipped with Grätzel cells on one side of the SwissTech Convention Center. Other ambitious R&D projects followed. In the spring of 2015, Romande Energie unveiled Switzerland’s largest urban solar power station with a surface area of 15,500 m\n2\n, located at EPFL. In addition to supplying electricity to the campus, the power station also serves as a test bench for researchers studying innovative systems for using renewable energy more efficiently and feeding it into power grids. The solar power station was developed by Romande Energie and EPFL’s Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory (DESL) in association with the Canton of Vaud and Li-ion battery manufacturer Leclanché. It can generate and store solar energy and distribute it optimally based on peaks in demand.\nA virtual power plant designed for an entire city\nThe Smart Lab will employ four to six people working on an even more ambitious project for Romande Energie: REel-DEMO, which aims to develop a demonstrator of a power grid in local equilibrium. “We will test a decentralized control system for the grid at Rolle and Onnens. That will require maximizing the use of renewable energy and managing all local power generation and consumption, as well as storage,” says Mario Paolone, a professor at DESL. “It’s the same ‘virtual power plant’ concept that we use at EPFL, but with a lot more variables and constraints.” The methods and technologies were developed at the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research (SCCER-Furies) headed by Paolone. The REel-DEMO project has received funding from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy thanks to its innovative nature and potential impact.\nFor EPFL, the Smart Lab will open the door to research in the promising fields of microgrids and smart grids, as well as smart living – which involves smart systems for managing electricity use and heating in buildings – and smart working, which involves connected objects. Engineers will also develop technology for managing power distribution on demand and leveraging data to enhance energy systems. “Our dream is to have a nationwide power grid fueled entirely by renewable energy,” says Paolone.\nAn incubator for leveraging energy data \nRomande Energie will use the Smart Lab as an incubator for all opportunities related to making better use of energy data. The goal is to identify, assess and subsequently demonstrate the value of new business models, with a view to incorporating them into the company’s operations. The development work will take place in association with staff at Romande Energie as well as outside experts. “We are reaching a turning point in our industry.

{"id": 787, "text": "We take it for granted, but walking on two feet is an extremely complex task. Reproducing a bipedal gait in a robot or simulating it on a computer is much more complex and involves many more parameters than one would imagine. That’s why humanoid robots or computer avatars often seem stiff and awkward.\nFascinated by neurosciences, recent life Sciences graduate Steve Berger wanted to contribute to research in this field. He was intrigued by this problem, a combination of biology and technology, and made it the subject of his Master’s thesis work. During a first-year class, he was intrigued by an articleabout Carnegie Mellon professor Hartmut Geyer’s research on muscle simulation. Berger immediately decided to do his research in this area.\n“I reproduced one of his projects that consisted of moving a 2D computer character,” he explains. First, he had to put in place all of the character’s (which he named Regis) basic parameters, such as the number of muscles and tendons involved and their length and viscoelastic properties, as well as the intensity of basic reflexes that enabled a rudimentary two-footed gait. Then he adapted and corrected them during the course of experimentation. “In particular, I introduced the idea of energy consumption; Regis was able to optimize his efforts in order to be able to walk for longer periods of time.”\nIn a third phase, the young scientist is developing a model for allowing the humanoid to get over an obstacle placed on the ground. “I got the idea from a study on cats,” Berger explains. “I realized that in order for Regis to fall as little as possible, his muscles needed to be activated in a certain order, with each one exerting the right amount of “force.””\nSubtle coordination\n By doing this research, Berger is hoping to better understand the mechanism of coordinated movement, and to contribute, in the longer term, to the creation of devices and prostheses that would allow handicapped individuals not only to walk again, but also to be able to navigate difficult and uneven ground. “To do that, it’s critical to pinpoint the logic in the biology in order to build robotics that are really robust, functional and adaptable.”\nWalking is a very complex function, the result of a subtle coordination between the brain and the spinal cord. As in any biological system, using simulations is very helpful in understanding the phenomenon. “It allows you to simplify the function by separating out or isolating its components, to make various hypotheses and then test them, and finally to validate them by implementing them in a robot.”\nThe young scientist is continuing his academic career with a PhD. He’ll continue working on bipedal gait, but now his focus will be on its cognitive aspects, particularly consciousness and the image one has of oneself during the action of walking. Berger himself admits he doesn’t walk the same as he did before he started studying walking; “Now, from time to time, I walk on my hands.”", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES (8) – Our ability to put one foot in front of the other is the result of a subtle coordination between the brain and the spinal cord.

{"id": 792, "text": "Industrial robots are used for a variety of tasks that require a great deal of precision and agility, such as assembling high-precision parts, executing tasks that change repeatedly (such as for manufacturing customized prosthetics), and polishing miniaturized components (like watch crystals). The robots must be able to factor in variables such as an object’s size, exact shape and the maximum force it can withstand before being scratched or breaking. Programming these robots so that they perform reliably can take several weeks – and accounts for up to two-thirds of their total implementation cost. In order to lower these costs and make industrial robots more versatile, EPFL spin-off Aica has developed a modular software application that lets operators select programs for exactly the tasks they need from a vast program library.\nMore affordable automation\nThe software is made up of preprogrammed tasks that operators can select based on their requirements. The robot can then adapt to variations, such as a change in size when working on a new batch. The robot automatically adjusts its movements to account for the new parameters. “An estimated 80% of industrial tasks are not automated because they are too complex or because setting up a robot would be too expensive,” says Lukas Huber, a cofounder of Aica. He sees the software as a way of making automation more widespread and of leveraging artificial intelligence to enable new tasks to be automated and implemented. Their software can also evolve: if a task becomes too complicated for the robot, the program will automatically search the database for a solution.\nAica’s system was designed with collaborative robots in mind, too. These robots can detect interactions with their environment and with plant operators. The software teaches the robots to be more flexible and to better respond to operators’ movements, so that they can work together more effectively. And the system includes integrated force and torque sensors in order to detect changes in the operating environment. “With our system, robots can switch between different tasks instantly based on a simple physical interaction,” says Baptiste Busch, Aica’s other cofounder. Operators can show robots new tasks, which they will then be able to perform on their own under similar conditions. The programmed robots are also capable of working with other robots to handle large parts or carry out other tasks requiring several “hands.”\nAica’s artificial intelligence modules and flexible control algorithms were developed through years of research at EPFL’s Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory. The entrepreneurs have received startup funding from programs such as Venture Kick, Innogrant and EPFL Enable, and will take part in the IMD EMBA startup program starting in 2021.

This is one of the leading biotechnology startup competitions in Europe, designed to showcase deep-tech startups that are working on complex engineering processes or using existing technology in an innovative way. Five hundred companies made it into the competition, but only 80 of those have made it to the finals – and they will square off in Paris. The two EPFL startups have their sights set on the top prize of 100,000 euros, but they will also make the most of the international visibility that they are gaining.\nTreating neurological disorders by targeting glial cells\nUntil now, glial cells have not been a major focus of neuron research or treatments for neurological and psychological disorders. Yet in the 1990s, imaging techniques gradually revealed the importance of these cells in the brain’s functioning. Not only do they interact with neurons, but they are also necessary for the neurons’ survival, provide them with energy and clear out their waste. Pierre Magistretti, now an honorary professor at EPFL, and his team discovered several mechanisms by which neurons activate glial cells and identified some molecules that play a role in consolidating memory. These discoveries suggest that glial cells could be a useful target in treating psychological and neurological disorders.\nThat’s where Gliapharm comes in. When the company was created in 2016, it already had several molecules of interest to explore. One of them could help treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the degenerative disease that Stephen Hawking suffered from. The company, based on Campus Biotech in Geneva, has now tested it on rodents. It already holds two patents, for molecules used to treat dementia and depression. Gliapharm has a distinct competitive advantage, because treatments targeting glial cells are still rare. Even better, according to CEO Sylvain Lengacher: “Among companies working on glial cells, we’re the only one that’s targeting metabolic pathways, that is, exchanges between brain cells.” After focusing almost exclusively on its research program in 2018, the company intends to enter several startup competitions in 2019 in order to enhance its visibility and set the stage for an initial fundraising round midway through the year.\nLight-sensitive materials to help dentists and surgeons\nWhen it comes to root canals, slipped discs and aneurysms, the medical filler developed by Lumendo, a startup created in 2018, could save dentists and surgeons precious minutes. In a root canal, for example, it normally takes around 30 minutes to fill a hollowed-out tooth, since the material used has to be compressed and dried in stages. Lumendo’s filler, which is applied with a catheter and then hardened with an optical fiber, shortens the time required by a factor of ten.\nIt was during his PhD studies at EPFL’s Laboratory of Biomedical Orthopedics and Laboratory of Applied Photonics Devices that Andreas Schmocker, the company’s CEO, came up with the idea of a medical filler. But if he wanted to develop it for commercial purposes, he needed the right light-sensitive molecule to dry the material extremely quickly. He found what he was looking for at ETH Zurich, in a molecule developed by chemist Mark Bispinghoff, now the company’s CTO. Lumendo’s 2019 goals are to test its dental-filling technique on animal cells so that it can then turn its invention into a marketable product and start raising money.", "summary": "EPFL spinoffs Lumendo and Gliapharm are among 80 deep-tech startups from around the world that have qualified for the finals of the Hello Tomorrow Challenge in Paris.

This competition has existed since 2002 and includes ten contests (hence the name decathlon). In order to win this competition, the Swiss team must score a maximum number of points in ten different contests, which include architecture, comfort, engineering, energy balance and communication.\nA social activator\n Jessica Ruffieux, one of the students on the Swiss Team, explains: « the fundamental question that we ask ourselves with this solar-powered housing unit is how it will help to change behavior patterns for more sustainable living. » The housing unit will be designed first and foremost as a community center, where people can meet (e.g. at the repair café).\n « Recycling, repair, reuse, production of energy, consumption and smart use of resources. These are some of the principles that we wish to apply, demonstrate and convey, » continues Jessica. The solar-powered prototype will also promote non-motorized forms of transport by including the necessary facilities for this. « Biodiversity is another theme to be covered. The external surfaces will be designed in a way that favors local fauna and flora, » adds Axelle Marchon, also a student.\nMulti-oriented roofing\n Of course, the prototype is still in the design phase. However, several ideas are already taking shape. First of all, the team wishes to develop an architectural project that includes the technique from the outset. This interdisciplinary methodology is still relatively unheard of and the students would like to promote it. Therefore, the roofing will be angled in such a way as to optimize uniform energy production throughout the day. « This multi-oriented roofing requirement will influence the architectural shape, » explains Matias Cesari, student.\nWood!\n Wood was chosen as the material for the prototype structure. « This is a resource available in Switzerland that is relatively light enough to be used and transported. It also offers great freedom of expression, » comments Baptiste Gex, another student on the Swiss Team. « The outer structure of the building will be put to maximum use. « We imagine it to be 100% productive, not just for solar energy but also as a food production source. We intend to create surfaces that can be used to grow vegetables. » « The housing unit must serve as a symbol, with a clear and easily recognizable visual identity, » adds Axelle.\nThe Swiss Living Challenge\n The Swiss team decided to call the project the Swiss Living Challenge, in homage to , the new research center to develop housing units of the future. This research center is jointly run by the EPFL, HEIA-FR and UNIFR.

This promising scenario has been made possible by the innovations accomplished by EPFL’s Institute of Microengineering in Neuchatel. The team of prof. Christophe Ballif, director of the Photovoltaics Laboratory (PVlab), presented their work at the European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition that just took place in Frankfurt.\nThe PVlab specializes in thin film solar cells and has been interested for several years in \"hybrid\" technologies, better known as heterojunction technologies, designed to enhance solar captors’ performance. \"We apply an infinitesimal layer – one hundredth of a micron – of amorphous silicon on both sides of a crystalline silicon wafer,\" explains Christophe Ballif. This “sandwich” conception contributes to increase the sensors’ effectiveness.\nFor this assembly to be efficient, the interface between the two types of silicon requires to be optimized. Antoine Descoeudres managed to achieve this feat together with Stephaan DeWolf and their colleagues. They chose the commonest – and therefore cheapest – crystalline cell (called \"p-doped silicon\"), took care of its preparation and improved the process of application of amorphous silicon. They obtained a 21.4% conversion efficiency, which had never been achieved before with such type of substrates: nowadays, the best quality monocrystalline cells only attain an energy conversion efficiency of 18-19% at best. In addition, the measured open-circuit voltage was 726 mV, which constitutes a first-time accomplishment as well. Last but not least, they broke the 22% efficiency barrier on a less common substrate.\nClose to the market\n These results, validated by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in Germany, will soon be published by the IEEE Journals of photovoltaics.\n To bring these innovations to a stage of industrialization may only take a few years. This research was partly financed as a commission for Roth & Rau Switzerland, whose parent company, Meyer Burger, has already started the commercialization of machines built for assembling this type of heterojunction sensors. \"Within three to five years, we expect to reach a production cost of 100 francs per square meter of sensors, estimates Stefaan DeWolf.

{"id": 801, "text": "Understanding the brain is one of the biggest ‘big data’ challenges facing us today and increasingly, computational modelling and simulation have become essential tools in the quest to better understand the brain’s structure and to decipher the causal interrelations of its components. General-purpose computing has, until now, largely been able to deliver high performance in simulating brain tissue but at the same time, it is becoming more difficult to rely on future generations of computers due to physical limitations. If whole brain models are to be achieved on future computer generations, understanding models’ and simulation engines’ computational characteristics will be indispensable.\nTo date, in order to simulate brain tissue, the sheer breadth of biochemical and biophysical processes and structures in the brain has led to the development of a large variety of model abstractions and specialized tools, several of which run on the largest computers in the world. However, their advancement has mostly relied on performance benchmarking, i.e. the art of measuring and optimizing a software and algorithmic approach to a given hardware, and only in some cases has used initial model-based extrapolation.\nInsights using analytical performance modelling\nIn order to go beyond the benchmarking approach and previously published initial extrapolations, Blue Brain scientists have used a complementary approach: detailed performance modelling - the science of actually modelling the performance of a brain tissue model, the algorithm used and simulation scheme intersected with a specific computer architecture on where it is run. Using a hybrid grey-box model that combines biological and algorithmic properties with hardware specifications, the scientists identified performance bottlenecks under different simulation regimes, corresponding to a variety of prototypical scientific questions that can be answered by simulations of biological neural networks. The analysis was based on a state-of-the-art high performance computing (HPC) hardware architecture and applied to previously published neural network simulations (the \nBrunel\n model, the original and a simplified version of the Blue Brain Project’s \nReconstructed\nmicrocircuit\n) that were selected to represent important neuron models in the literature.\nFrancesco Cremonesi, the first author of the study, explains, “For the first time, we have applied advanced analytical and quantitative performance modelling techniques to the field of cellular-level brain tissue simulations. This has allowed us a deep insight into which types of models require which type of hardware and what we should do to improve their efficiency (and thus simulate larger models faster on the same hardware). We believe this is an important contribution to the community that sometimes compares brain tissue models solely on the number of neurons and synapses, but ignores the large differences in computational costs depending on the level of detail of the models,” he concludes.\nAn important breakthrough for navigating the uncertain future in computing\nWith Moore’s law slowing down and possibly even ending in the not too distant future, it is becoming of the utmost importance to understand which hardware properties are rate limiting a computation now and on future systems, and which problems may not be solvable if new methods, hardware etc. are not identified. Therefore, this detailed insight on which part of a computer system (e.g. memory bandwidth, network latency, processing speed etc.) is most relevant for solving a scientific problem is indispensable for the future as it provides a quantitative and systematic framework in which these future developments can be prioritized.\nProf. Felix Schürmann, senior author of the study, explains, “This work provides a long necessary formal framework that enables a quantitative discussion between \nin silico\n modelers, high performance software researchers and hardware architects”. He continues, “The methodology developed in this work constitutes a quantitative means through which these scientific communities can collaborate in the task of designing and optimizing future software and hardware for the next generation of brain tissue simulations”.", "summary": "Scientists at the EPFL Blue Brain Project have extended performance modelling techniques to the field of computational brain science.

That’s the question a team of scientists led by EPFL will set out to answer on an unprecedented expedition set to last at least four years. They will travel to the world’s largest mountain glacier systems, collecting microorganisms from hundreds of glacier-fed streams and analyzing their genomes. Through a combination of environmental sciences, life sciences and geology, they hope to learn how these microbiomes have adapted over the millennia to the extreme conditions they are exposed to.\nThrough this project, which officially starts on 1 August 2018, the international team of scientists will explore the “third pole” through glacial streams in Alaska, the Himalayas, the Andes, Greenland, Scandinavia, Pamir, Kamchatka, Caucasus, New Zealand and the European Alps. It’s the inaugural research program for the Alpine and Polar Environment Research Center (Alpole) in Sion and is being made possible thanks to funding from the NOMIS Foundation, which exclusively supports insight-driven scientific endeavors.\nSamples from biofilms\nThe scientists will collect samples from biofilms, which are thin, viscous films of microbes that form on sediment surfaces in glacier-fed streams. They will then use deep sequencing on the microbial DNA to unravel the structure and biological processes of the biofilms’ microbiomes. The sequencing data will be used for two purposes. First, to look back in time, since it may contain ancient biosignatures that could help the scientists to unravel the microbes’ strategies for adapting to their surroundings over time. And second, to get a glimpse into the future, since it will help the scientists to better understand how biofilms are being affected by the melting of glaciers and, consequently, the role that biofilms play in ecosystem functioning and the biogeochemistry of Alpine glacier-fed streams.\nFor the future generations\n“Glaciers and their streams have often been abundant on Earth. But today they are vanishing as a result of climate change. Glaciologists predict that 50% of the small glaciers in Switzerland will disappear within the next 25 years. The same holds true for their glacier-fed streams – and the ecosystems those streams support. We owe it to future generations to better understand the microbial life in these vanishing ecosystems,” says Tom Battin, the project’s research director and head of EPFL’s Stream Biofilm and Ecosystem Research Laboratory. “We can achieve that only with the support of foundations like NOMIS, and only by taking a cross-disciplinary approach bringing together experts from ecology, biogeochemistry, molecular biology and glaciology.”\nInterdisciplinary and novel\n“I am pleased that EPFL is at the center of an initiative to document the microbial life found inside glaciers through this study on glacial runoff,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli. “This research has global importance and is a natural fit for the new Center for Changing Alpine and Polar Environments at EPFL Valais Wallis.” This enthusiasm is shared by Markus Reinhard, Managing Director at NOMIS: “We are delighted to support this exciting research project, which reflects NOMIS’ vision of encouraging interdisciplinary, novel research that has the potential to provide transformational insights about our world.”\nThe first expedition will begin in February 2019. It will be led by Mike Styllas, a geologist and Himalayas specialist, with the help of two mountain experts from Canada and Italy. The genome research will be carried out in association with Professor Paul Wilmes and his team at the University of Luxembourg. Michael Zemp, a research associate at the University of Zurich, will provide his expertise in glaciology. The scientists will start training this summer in the Swiss Alps.\nA unique global DNA repository in EPFL Valais Wallis\nEven before the first expedition gets underway, Battin is already looking ahead to his next challenge. He would like to archive DNA from glacier-fed-stream microbes in a repository that would be housed at the EPFL Valais Wallis campus. This archive would give tomorrow’s researchers a “map” of the microbiomes as they stand today.

He will present his research next February at the  conference in Washington D.C. One research project employs a rotating chair—much like those used to train fighter pilots and astronauts—to discover how the brain processes bodily perception.\nHuman centrifuge\n The rotating chair (or human centrifuge) is used by Blanke and his team to investigate the vestibular system, a “sixth sense” of sorts originating in the inner ear and essential for maintaining balance and spatial coordination. The scientists hope to find out how and where in the brain this balance system is represented, the so-called vestibular cortex, by systematically and mechanically provoking vestibular sensations while recording brain activity.\n “In contrast to conceptual notions of self-consciousness, a new, data-driven theory based on the neurobiology of body representation during a variety of experiments is emerging,” asserts Blanke.\nA neurobiological model of the self\n Previous work in Blanke’s lab suggests that many different senses, but especially the vestibular system gives the brain a crucial reference to represent the self and its location in space. How is the self related to the balance system? And what happens when the visual input and spatial input don’t match up, as in the familiar case of two parallel, stationary trains and the feeling of forward movement of the self when the adjacent train begins to roll in the opposite direction. In the complete darkness of the rotating chair chamber, the subject experiences the movement of her body thanks to her vestibular system, although no visual input is there to back it up. Blanke is using this chair to manipulate and probe the relationship between visual and spatial information in the hopes of unlocking some of the secrets of self-consciousness.\n Blanke is convinced that a deeper neurological understanding of these phenomena will lead to concrete answers that may have therapeutic results. “Decoding how the brain processes bodily perception may lead to a comprehensive neurobiological model of self-consciousness and a better understanding of altered states in neurological and psychiatric diseases,” he explains. \n After three years of painstaking research, Blanke’s team at the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience (LNCO) plan to publish their results from the human centrifuge experiment early next year.\nFor images of the experiment, please click .", "summary": "To be presented next year at the largest scientific conference in the US, EPFL researchers search for the seats of self-consciousness by studying brain activity in a rotating chair.", "claim": "To be presented next year at the largest scientific conference in the Her, EPFL researchers search for the seats of self-consciousness by studying brain activity in a rotating chair.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 12], "noise": false}

Even though they’re effective and used widely, we still don’t completely understand how these proven methods kill viruses.\nProfessor Tamar Kohn, head of EPFL’s Environmental Chemistry Laboratory, and her team have shown that disinfectants don’t all work in the same way. She published an article in Environmental Science and Technology. “A virus is a genome and some proteins. We discovered that each disinfectant has totally different effects, attacking one or several of the virus’ functions. Even though the outcome is the same, the eradication methods are different.”\n Kohn discovered three important functions that must remain intact for the virus to be infectious: it must be able to attach to the host cell, inject its material into the host cell and then be able to replicate. So how do our viruses react to pasteurization, chlorine disinfection and UV radiation?\nPasteurize, chlorinate…\nPasteurization is used to conserve a food, such as milk, for long periods of time by drastically reducing the number of micro-organisms in it. Heat inhibits the bonding with the host cell. The virus no longer recognizes the host, so it cannot attach to it. \n The disinfectant properties of UV radiation have been explored for more than 100 years. Food networks or ventilation and air-conditioning systems were coupled to UV lamps in order to eliminate the propagation of pathogenic agents. \n The radiation acts in two ways on a virus. First, it triggers chemical reactions that destroy the genome, so that it can no longer replicate itself in the host. In addition, it breaks the virus’ protein shell, or capsid. Because the virus’ genetic material is held under pressure in the capsid, when this shell is broken, there is no way for the virus to inject the material into the host cell.\n Chlorinating drinking water and swimming pools has become commonplace. Chlorine attacks the genome, prevents it from replication and destroys its injection function. \n Kohn’s research allows us to better understand how each disinfectant is working and in what quantity it will be effective.

They identified the spear mechanism to be the so-called “type VI secretion system” or T6SS, also used for interbacterial competition by many other bacteria.\nV. cholerae\n uses its T6SS to compete with other bacteria in its aquatic environment and acquire new genetic material, which the pathogen absorbs and exchanges against some parts of its own genome. This mode of “horizontal gene transfer” leads to rapid evolution and pathogen emergence. The pathogen \nV. cholerae\n has caused seven major cholera pandemics since 1817 and, according to , still kills more than 100,000 people each year and infects up to 4 million others, mostly in poor or underdeveloped countries.\nNow, Blokesch’s group has discovered the extent of DNA that \nV. cholerae\n can steal in a single attack: more than 150,000 nucleic acid base pairs, or roughly 150 genes in one go (the cholera bacterium carries around 4,000 genes in total). The researchers calculated this number by sequencing the entire genome of almost 400 \nV. cholerae\n strains before and after stealing DNA from their neighboring bacteria.\nPrevious studies have tried to establish just how much DNA competent bacteria can absorb and integrate into their genome by feeding them large quantities of purified DNA. However, this does not reflect the natural conditions in which the bacteria live and operate, as long stretches of free DNA are scarce in the environment. \nV. cholerae’s \nT6SS-mediated DNA stealing, however, allows the bacterium to acquire fresly released and long DNA fragments. This bacterial behavior is tightly linked to the chitinous surfaces (e.g. shells) on which the bacterium usually lives in oceans and estuaries.\nVibrio cholerae\n bacteria can acquire large stretches of genetic material from killed neighboring bacteria, which fosters rapid evolution. Credit: Noémie Matthey/Blokesch lab; EPFL\nTo address this, the EPFL researchers studied two unrelated (“non-clonal”) strains of \nV. cholerae \nin co-cultures on chitin. This allowed them to determine the frequency and extent of DNA exchanges between the two strains, under more natural conditions.\nThe study, led by PhD student Noémie Matthey, found that \nV. cholerae\n strains that carry a functional and chitin-inducible T6SS system are much more efficient at transferring DNA than bacteria that don’t. The predatory bacterium acquired large genomic regions from its killed prey – up to the 150,000 base pairs mentioned above.\nThe authors conclude that the environmental “lifestyle” of \nV. cholerae\n enables exchange of genetic material with enough coding capacity that it can significantly accelerate the evolution of the bacterium.\n“This finding is very relevant in the context of bacterial evolution,” says Blokesch. “It suggests that environmental bacteria might share a common gene pool, which could render their genomes highly flexible and the microbes prone to quick adaption”.\nOther contributors\nSwiss Institute of Bioinformatics/Vital-IT", "summary": "EPFL scientists have discovered that predatory bacteria like the cholera pathogen can steal up to 150 genes in one go from their neighbors.

{"id": 815, "text": "We could soon see the day when people have to think twice before taking a swim in lakes hitherto considered healthy. That’s because some of the pathogenic viruses on the water’s surface could evolve to become more resistant, as an indirect consequence of global warming and the increase in the number of heat waves and record-breaking temperatures.\nMost of the pathogenic viruses in lakes are naturally rendered harmless by sunlight, warm temperatures and bacteria normally present in the water. But a team of scientists at EPFL’s , within the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), has found that some human enteroviruses – which can cause gastro-intestinal infections or severe diseases such as meningitis, and are found in feces, meaning they could make their way into wastewater effluent – may have the capacity to adapt to higher water temperatures. The study was led in collaboration with a scientist from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Eawag. \nResistant to disinfectants \nIn their study, the research team created four human enterovirus populations by incubating samples in lake water at 10°C and 30°C in both the presence and the absence of sunlight. They found that the viruses surviving in the warmer water became increasingly resistant to temperature, unlike those in the colder water.\n Design of the experimental adaptation of human echovirus to different regimes (10 °C in the dark, 10 °C under simulated sunlight, 30 °C in the dark, and 30 °C under simulated sunlight) © 2020 LCE\n“We then exposed the surviving viruses to chlorine and found that they had also become more resistant to chlorine-based disinfectants. That means viruses with the ability to survive in warm water may also be more difficult to kill with standard water treatment processes,” says Tamar Kohn, a co-author of the study, associate professor at EPFL and head of the LCE.\nThe scientists’ findings have just been published in .\nA consequence of globalization \nWhat’s more, the chances of resistant viruses traveling from one world region to another are growing as a result of globalization, since people and goods (like fruits and vegetables), which could potentially be contaminated, are moving about more readily. For example, a pathogen that is perfectly adapted to the warm water of an equatorial region could inadvertently be carried into Switzerland, where it is likely to survive for a long time because it would be resistant to the ambient temperatures. This would heighten the risk of the virus spreading a benign disease or a more serious one like polio.\n“The other implication of our study is that if temperatures rise, there could be more world regions where viruses develop this capability to resist,” says Kohn. That wouldn’t be a direct consequence of global warming – because even a 3°C rise would be too small to make a difference – but of an increase in the number of long heat waves. The next step for the research team will be to test their findings in a series of field experiments.", "summary": "A recent EPFL study shows that pathogenic viruses may be able to develop resistance to warm temperatures and some types of disinfectant.

{"id": 817, "text": "With the power-conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells plateauing around 25%, perovskites are now ideally placed to become the market’s next generation of photovoltaics. In particular, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites offer manufacturing versatility that can potentially translate into much higher efficiency: studies have already shown photovoltaic performances above 20% across different solar cell architectures built with simple and low-cost processes.\nThe main challenge for the perovskite field is not so much efficiency but stability. Unlike silicon cells, perovskites are soft crystalline materials and prone to problems due to decomposition over time. In a commercial context, this puts perovskites on a higher price tag than conventional silicon cells.\nThere have therefore been many efforts in synthesizing perovskite materials that can maintain high efficiency over time. This is done by introducing different cations (positively charged ions) into the crystal structure of the perovskite. Although success has been reported by mixing inorganic cations like cesium or rubidium into the perovskite composition, these solutions tend to be difficult and expensive to implement.\nMeanwhile, no organic – and easier to synthesize – cations that can improve both efficiency and stability have been found so far. Now, , with colleagues at the University of Cordoba, has discovered that they can improve perovskite stability by introducing the large organic cation guanidinium (CH\n6\nN\n3\n+\n) into methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, which are among the most promising alternatives in the group today.\nThe scientists show that the guanidinium cation inserts into the crystal structure of the perovskite and enhances the material’s overall thermal and environmental stability, overcoming what is known in the field as the “Goldschmidt tolerance factor limit.” This is an indicator of the stability of a perovskite crystal, which describes how compatible a particular ion is to it. An ideal Goldschmidt tolerance factor should be below or equal to 1; guanidinium’s is just 1.03.\nStability test of the novel MA\n(1-x)\nGua\nx\nPbI\n3\n perovskite material under continuous light illumination compared with the state-of-the-art MAPbI\n3\n. A schematic of the device architecture and the simulated crystalline structure is also provided (credit: M.K. Nazeeruddin/EPFL)\nThe study found that the addition of guanidinium significantly improved the material stability of the perovskite while delivering an average power conversion efficiency over 19% (19.2 ± 0.4%) and stabilizing this performance for 1000 hours under continuous light illumination, which is a standard laboratory test for measuring the efficiency of photovoltaic materials. The scientists estimate that this corresponds to 1333 days (or 3.7 years) of real-world usage – this is based on standard criteria used in the field.\nProfessor Nazeeruddin explains: “Taking a standard acceleration factor of 2 for each ten degrees increase in temperature, an acceleration factor of 8 is estimated for 55 °C as opposed to 25 °C degrees. Hence the 1000 hours at 55°C equivalent would be 8000 hours. Our cells were subjected at 60°C, therefore the numbers could be even higher. Assuming the equivalent of 6 hours full sunlight/day, or 250Wm-2 average irradiance (equivalent to North Africa) the total number of days are 1333, equals to 44.4 months and 3.7 years stability. However, for the standard solar cell accreditation a series of stress tests including temperature cycling and damp heat are also required.”\n“This is a fundamental step within the perovskite field,” says Nazeeruddin. “It offers a new paradigm in perovskite design as further explorations beyond the tolerance factor limit could prevail for cationic blends while preserving a 3D structure with improved stability through increased number of H-bonds within the inorganic framework – a problem that we are now close to solving.”\nContributors\nUniversidad de Córdoba\nAbengoa Research\nHumboldt Universitat zu Berlin\nHelmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie\nFunding \nEuropean Commission Horizon 2020 (SOLEDLIGHT)\nSwiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)\nToyota Motor Europe Technical Center\nMarie Skłodowska Curie fellowship (Horizon 2020 Grant agreement)\nSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness\nEuropean Cooperation in Science & Technology (COST)\nDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)\nReference\nAlexander D.

{"id": 819, "text": "Parkinson's disease, which progressively destroys certain types of brain neurons, affects some 15,000 people in Switzerland. It’s the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. Its frequency increases with age and it tends to occur more frequently in men. Although the cause is still largely unknown, scientists agree that in most cases a combination of hereditary and environmental factors play a role.\nBy studying the geographic distribution of Parkinson's patients in a given area, scientists can identify clusters of higher or lower prevalence and, based on this, extrapolate potential environmental risk factors. In 2018,  Pierre Burkhard and Vanessa Fleury carried out Switzerland’s first assessment of the incidence of Parkinson's disease, in the canton of Geneva. They used their findings to compile an anonymized database of Parkinson's patients. “Prof. Burkhard had noticed that several of his patients lived close together, and thought there might be localized clusters of the disease in the canton. Then I worked with him to find a way to scientifically substantiate his hypothesis,” says Fleury. \nAre there places where Parkinson's disease is more prevalent than elsewhere?\nRebecca Himsl\nFleury met with Dr. Stéphane Joost and his student Rebecca Himsl, after being put in touch by the and Prof. Idris Guessous – a long-time research partner of EPFL's . Himsl subsequently selected this topic for her Master's project. Bringing clinicians and spatial-analysis experts together on a cross-disciplinary team proved to be highly effective. “We looked at the situation from an epidemiological point of view and asked: Are there places where Parkinson's disease is more prevalent than elsewhere?” says Himsl, now a flood-risk analyst for a Canadian company. The results of the study were published in \nParkinsonism & Related Disorders\n on 1 February.\nNew perspectives\nThe study's findings are enlightening, above all in terms of the methodology used, which puts forth a new approach to environmental epidemiology research. The team linked environmental and epidemiological data regarding the age, gender and address of the canton's 1,115 Parkinson's disease patients, and drew up detailed maps of case distribution based on specific environmental exposure factors. To create a control group, they incorporated data on 12,614 Geneva residents collected by the Population Epidemiology Unit's Health Bus between 1995 and 2014. This approach based on individual cases differs from the more conventional method of aggregating data, which can be less accurate for detecting highly localized areas of disease prevalence.\nDistribution of Parkinson's disease hotspots (red points) and coldspots (blue points) in the canton of Geneva © LASIG\n“A very complex set of causes”\n“We geolocated patient groups taking into account known confounding factors such as age and gender. This allowed us to pinpoint local hotspots with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease. Such spatial dependence concerns a small percentage of patients (6%), but remains statistically significant even after all factors that could contribute to Parkinson's disease have been eliminated,” Himsl explains. Her findings, generated in part by a probability model, also make it possible to identify “coldspots” – areas where fewer people than average are affected by Parkinson's disease.\nIt's all part of a very complex set of causes. Sometimes, however, we can identify a dominant factor\nStéphane Joost\nThe study shows that most Parkinson's hotspots are located close to downtown Geneva, in contrast to coldspots, which are situated on the outskirts. “There is a significant positive correlation between these hotspots and the degree of air pollution, which leads us to suspect that there is a link between Parkinson's and atmospheric pollution. Our study highlights two key facts: the multifactorial nature of Parkinson's disease, and the importance of improving air quality to prevent the disease,” explains Fleury. Joost adds: “It's all part of a very complex set of causes. Sometimes, however, we can identify a dominant factor, as we did here, which is very likely air pollution.”\nDistribution of Parkinson's disease hotspots and coldspots in the canton of Geneva, associated with air pollution. © LASIG\nMatching results – with two exceptions\nWhen Joost picked up Himsl’s work after she graduated, he incorporated data recently made available by the Greater Geneva agglomeration concerning concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matter. He then superimposed these data on Himsl’s maps and saw that they matched up across all the hotspots – except for the Eaux-Vives district near the city center, where air quality seems to be better, and the Les Délices coldspot, which shows high levels of nitrogen dioxide. “We will now try to identify one or more possible explanatory factors and publish them in a new paper,” says Joost, who already posits that a confluence of positive factors close to home may reduce the risk of developing the disease.\n“Thanks to the areas of prevalence that the study identified, it could be of use to healthcare providers,” says Joost. “We have shown that there is a greater likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease in certain types of neighborhoods, which could lead policymakers to introduce measures to protect residents or improve facilities in these communities. Our findings will also help the HUG neurologists we worked with, who can now focus on looking for other factors that explain the onset of this disease.”", "summary": "In a new paper, a team of EPFL spatial-analysis experts and neurologists from Geneva University Hospital (HUG) show that the probability of developing Parkinson's disease is higher in the canton of Geneva's urban centers than in its rural areas.

{"id": 822, "text": "Tamiflu is one of the few available treatments for those who come down with the flu. But the virus quickly develops resistance; multiplying at a rate of several generations a day, these tiny pathogens rapidly accumulate genetic mutations. Because of this, they have a good chance of developing counterattacks to the antiviral. How can these infinitesimal variations be identified within the immensity of the virus’ genetic code? EPFL researchers have created a computer tool that can shed light on the flu virus’ formidable adaptability. They were able to find mutations that conferred resistance that had up to this point not yet been identified. Their software has been made freely available to researchers everywhere, and is the subject of an . \nWidespread use of Tamiflu leads to resistance\n In theory, Tamiflu should only be used by patients in fragile health. But during the 2008-2009 flu season, the drug was used for the first time on a very wide scale. Resistant strains of the virus appeared within just a few weeks. Fortunately, even though the mutation induced a resistance to Tamiflu, it also caused a reduction in the replication rate of the virus. Once the use of the antiviral was dialed back to a more reasonable level, the resistant strains lost their competitive advantage, and they disappeared, submerged by competitors that were sensitive to the drug but had a higher rate of replication.\n Resistance always results from random mutations, says Jeffrey Jensen, co-author of the EPFL study. But when a mutation leads to a competitive advantage, for example the ability to resist against a source of aggression, it tends to be passed on to its descendants. “A priori, nothing distinguishes one mutation from another; they’re all the result of chance. Our goal is precisely to be able to tell the difference between mutations that make the virus resistant to Tamiflu, thus leading to a selection phenomenon, and other mutations.”\nNew resistant mutations are discovered \n To begin, the team led by Jensen and his colleague Matthieu Foll cultured ordinary H1N1 virus in the laboratory. Certain groups were subjected to Tamiflu, others not. Every 48 hours – 13 generations – the biologists sequenced the virus’ genome to reveal the genetic mutations that had occurred in the interval. \n The more the genetic mutations of viruses exposed to Tamiflu tended to become prevalent with time, the higher the probability that they would confer resistance. With a complex statistics-based software tool, the researchers were able to pinpoint 12 sites on the viral genome that carried suspect variations. One of these was already known, but the rest had not yet been identified. \nWeeding out the resistance-conferring mutations\n Using their statistical software, the researchers were able to comb through the immensity of the viral genetic code and identify only the mutations that were suspected to cause resistance, with a certainty of more than 99% - making their software a powerful tool indeed.\n And these newly discovered mutations are reason for concern: they could allow the virus to be resistant while maintaining an elevated reproductive capacity. Jensen thus doesn’t exclude the possibility that pathogenic strains could appear that are both competitive and Tamiflu-resistant, if the mistake of 2008-2009 is repeated. For Foll, first author on the study, “the risk is real, and we need to investigate further.”\nReference\n, in PLOS Genetics, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.100418", "summary": "It doesn’t take long for the flu virus to outsmart Tamiflu.

In addition to sorting and structuring all this information, these algorithms can give it visual shape – using graph theory – to help us interpret it.\nKirell Benzi, who is finishing his doctoral thesis at EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS2), puts these tools to work to reveal new and often surprising patterns.

That’s because the photovoltaic equipment available on the local market is often unreliable, with huge differences in performance from one solar panel to the next.

{"id": 833, "text": "Could moving walkways help people get where they want to go in cities? This is not a new idea. The first moving walkways were seen in Chicago in 1893, and seven years later they were used at the world’s fair in Paris. Since then, the idea periodically resurfaces in sci-fi books, but also in the minds of transportation engineers and urban planners in search of eco-friendly transport solutions. In a breakthrough study, EPFL researchers have analyzed the feasibility of fast moving walkways in an urban setting. Their results are encouraging.\nTheir task* consisted in imagining a world – or a city – without private cars in which space designed for automobile use could be repurposed. Individual transport needs would be met by a combination of conventional methods (buses, metros, trams, taxis, bikes, etc.) or by more innovative methods like bike- or car-sharing or urban cable cars. It was with this in mind that EPFL’s Transport and Mobility Laboratory studied accelerating moving walkways, which can go up to 15 km/h, to see if they could compete with other means of transport.\nGeneva as a case study\n“15 km/h is around the average speed at which people travel through most large cities during rush hour,” said Riccardo Scarinci, the lead author of the  that will be published in the \nEuropean Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research\n. Researchers at the Transport and Mobility Laboratory focused on the feasibility of a network of moving walkways. They attempted to come up with the optimal design, taking into account the road network, demand, the speed required to make the system competitive, energy consumption and operational and budgetary constraints.\nThe researchers used real data from Geneva in developing their mathematical model. They explored various configurations of the following factors: speed, acceleration, length and width, not to mention intersections and entry and exit points.\nThey optimized their network by closely analyzing people’s daily travels in Geneva – from start to end – along primary, secondary and tertiary roads. The ideal network they developed begins with a small ring around a car-free urban center and extends out along primary roads on 47 different links equipped with 10 gates for a total length of 32 kilometers. There are 37 intersections where expressways would be set up using bridges or underpasses.\nA high-capacity and sustainable solution in limited space\nMoving walkways offer two advantages. First, they are narrower than roads: they measure 1.20 meters across versus 2.5 to 3.5 meters for a roadway. That means that one road is wide enough to hold moving walkways in both directions while still leaving room for other means of transport. In terms of volume, a moving walkway can handle 7,000 passengers per hour, while a roadway can accommodate between 750 and 1,800 vehicles.\nThe question of cost is of course fundamental. Moving walkways consume less energy than buses, which are the most fuel-efficient transport method these days. “Because they are entirely electric, moving walkways represent a sustainable and eco-friendly transport system,” according to the authors. And their operating cost is similar to that of buses. “The main downside is the cost of construction. It will cost about as much to install one line as to build a new tram line,” says Scarinci. “But the cost could drop somewhat if the system were installed on a large scale. That’s why a network of walkways only makes sense in dense and highly congested cities.”\nHanding off to urban planners\n“We have not come up with a turnkey solution,” says Michel Bierlaire, the director of the Transport and Mobility Laboratory. “But this study proves that the concept is credible and that a car-less, pedestrian-centric city is conceivable. This is a useful starting point for urban planners to evaluate the feasibility of accelerating moving walkways.”\n*This research project is part of the  initiative, which aims to explore the future of mobility both through the role of the car and without cars.

The environment adapts to the user’s hand movements, which are visible. Emotions and sensations felt in the moment actually prompt new virtual elements. Imagined movements are performed by the avatar, as if it were directly connected to the user’s brain. The joystick is officially obsolete.\nMindMaze, an EPFL spin-off developed around a device for the rehabilitation of stroke victims, has used its expertise to launch this new system. Still in the prototype stage, the device goes a step further in advancing gamers’ immersive experience. A combination of cameras and depth sensors placed in the front of the glasses detect the user’s hands, making it possible for the player to interact in an immediate way in the virtual environment. Without employing any game developers, the start-up has so far developed a few simple examples that enable one to playfully test the innovations. One of them makes flames dance on a player’s fingertips. When the player relaxes sufficiently, the fire turns to ice.\nThe second innovation is a cap that uses brain activity detection technology to “read” a player’s mind. It captures waves of certain areas of the brain to detect movement, emotions or even a state of stress or relaxation. “From the moment that there is an identifiable and repeated pattern in the brain, it is possible to match a control system,” says Tej Tadi, the company’s CEO.

{"id": 838, "text": "In developing countries, many hospitals have become cemeteries of medical equipment. Several radiology systems, often sent by international aid, may never be used due to the climatic conditions and the instability of electricity networks. In a matter of weeks, they become useless. Besides, the lack of qualified personnel or spare parts rapidly dispels any hope to make them work. Yet, the lack of access to radiology in many developing countries is a serious public health problem, whether for TB screening or the care of road traffic injuries.\nGlobalDiagnostiX is the first medical radiography device specifically designed for developing countries. Its total cost of ownership, including purchase and maintenance over 10 years, is 10 times cheaper than the existing equipment. A fully functional prototype was unveiled in Lausanne on 9 March 2015. It was designed under the leadership of EPFL’s the Cooperation & Development Center.\nThe Center’s EssentialTech team is in charge of the project and manages its various stakeholders. Indeed, four EPFL laboratories, ten research groups from the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO; fields of health, engineering and design), the Paul Scherrer Institute, CHUV, the EssentialMed foundation and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute worked in close collaboration with the University Hospital of Yaounde (Cameroon), the University Research Center on Energy for Health Care in Cameroon, and other local stakeholders.\nReliable and cheap mechanics\n The device is specifically designed to resist harsh tropical climate and the consequences of high temperatures, humidity and dust. It includes an examination stand which was designed to avoid any electrical controls. It can move up, down, and turn depending on the body part to be X-rayed. It is only composed of mechanical, solid and stainless constituents. A subtle and robust mechanism facilitates its handling while preventing errors that could lead to shocks or bad radiographies.\nKeeping costs as low as possible: a composite image sensor\nThe radiographic image sensor has been completely redesigned to withstand shocks as well as the temperature and humidity. Very cheap, it is based on an array of twelve CMOS sensors whose images are assembled by the machine’s software. These sensors are commercially available and their cost is moderate; thus they can be easily replaced.\nResisting the unstable electrical network: power supply facing the worst conditions\nThe latest development is probably the most important: resistance to often inadequate or undersized electrical networks. Indeed, to operate an X-ray emitter, a power supply whose tension is able to briefly reach 150’000 volts is required! The power module will provide this voltage without overloading the hospitals’ network, whose total consumption in developing countries is often lower than a single X-ray machine’s. It also implements an innovative energy storage system, allowing the entire system to operate for several hours even without an external energy supply.\nAnd the research continues. First objective: raising funds – just under 2 million francs – for testing the first prototype’s reliability and improving its design, aiming at the creation of a second version by next year.\nEntrepreneurial approach, costs divided by 10\nDesigned to specifically meet the needs of hospitals in developing countries, GlobalDiagnostiX must leave the lab and get on the ground. A social business model has been created for this purpose. It will aim to make radiography not only accessible in developing countries but also in a self-sustainable and scalable way. The company’s business model, as well as its industrialization and deployment strategies, were developed with many stakeholders, such as potential customers and partners, in Switzerland and Africa.\nThe project has received the support of Pascal Hundt, head of the Assistance division at the International Committee of the Red Cross. He underlines the enthusiasm of Jeffrey Sachs, economist and Ban Ki-moon ‘s consultant at the UN, for whom “X-ray diagnostic imaging is an essential tool in primary healthcare for diagnosing conditions such as trauma or tuberculosis that represent a great burden in developing countries. Yet X-ray diagnostic imaging is still unavailable to two thirds of humanity.

It wasn’t for the scientists in EPFL’s MicroBioRobotic Systems Laboratory (MICROBS), who have come up with technology that does all of these things. “The core component of our device is an acoustic microengine, which we manufactured using 3D nanoprinting,” says Selman Sakar, a professor at the Institute of Mechanical Engineering. “The parts are made out of hydrogel, a biocompatible material that is about as stiff as human tissue. We then drew on computational simulations to invent a complex microdevice consisting of several engines.”\nRemote actuation\n“After the device enters the body, it has to be actuated remotely,” says Sakar. “It would be too invasive to use tethers such as cables or tubes.” The researchers use ultrasound to actuate the specific microengines and manipulate the surrounding fluid. “The device works precisely because of its structural design. Using mechanical resonance, we can carefully control which part of the device is actuated by modulating the frequency of acoustic excitation.”\nSakar’s team has also developed an array of engines and mechanisms. By combining various parts – pumps, a collection chamber and filters of various sizes – they designed a biopsy device. The researchers have also built mobile devices that are propelled by the fluid flow generated by acoustic microengines.\nProgrammable in vivo pharmacology and targeted therapy\nCombining this technology with medical imaging means patients will be able to undergo long-term monitoring without any outside intervention. “We have freed microfluidics technology from its electronic and external constraints,” says Murat Kaynak, lead author of the study. “Microfluidic devices can now be injected into human tissue and used to greatly enhance biochemical analysis thanks to the tunability of hydrogels.”\nThe devices could also be used for therapeutic purposes. “Doctors will be able to program the device to release a specific drug dosage when actuated by ultrasound,” adds Kaynak. “This will allow them to treat a specific part of the body and minimize the side effects.”\nControlled lifespan\nWhile injecting the microscopic devices is minimally invasive, removing the devices has proven more of a challenge. The solution can be found in the materials used to construct the device. “How long a device lasts depends on the materials it’s made of,” says Kaynak. “Some hydrogels biodegrade quickly while others stick around longer. The actuation concept works well with various types of polymers.”\nOnly \nin vitro\n experiments have been conducted so far. The next step will be to test these devices \nin vivo\n.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed remote-controlled, mechanical microdevices that, when inserted into human tissue, can manipulate the fluid that surrounds them, collect cells or release drugs.

{"id": 841, "text": "Whether flyers, swimmers, walkers or crawlers, animal species have developed a wide range of solutions to move efficiently in their environment. For biorobotics specialists, these models constitute a source of inspiration for designing robots able to evolve on all sorts of terrains. Auke Ijspeert, professor at EPFL’s Biorobotics laboratory, has just published an  in \nScience\n magazine \nin which he reviews this growing field.\n- Why has biorobotics developed so strongly during recent years?\n\"Firstly, because technology itself has improved dramatically. 3D printing techniques allow for a quick construction of complex parts, embedded computing capacity is increasing every year; batteries have become more compact and easy to use. This trend also responds to developments in the field of biology that provide new ways to study in detail the characteristics of animal motion, such as X-ray films to observe the movements of bones in real time or force sensors to measure the different forces of interaction with the ground.\n- In addition to making toys, what’s its use? \nBiorobotics is much more than that. It is inspired by the animal world to go further than traditional wheeled-, propeller- or caterpillar- based robots, and find new ways to move such machines. Clearly, nature has worked in our favor. An animal cannot survive long if it doesn’t move in a suitable way. Evolution has developed a range of locomotion modes extremely well suited to grounds that sometimes can be very difficult to get through. Making robots capable of moving in unstructured environments - bumps, rocks, mud, gravel, sand or water - is a real challenge. The animal world offers us a think tank to find solutions.\n- If robotics makes the most of biology, is the opposite also true? \nBiologists are increasingly using robots as scientific tools. By including real physics to researchers - as opposed as simulated physics of numerical simulations - these biorobots offer a clear advantage for testing certain hypotheses. For example, the study of a swimming fish requires the consideration of a large number of criteria: morphology of the animal, movement, speed and direction, force exerted by each muscle, but also interaction with the environment, resistance of the water, etc. These are all very complex problems that add up and influence each other. Robots allow scientists to observe such data live, and thus ensure the inclusion of all elements that come into play. And there is another important advantage: we can carry out operations with a robot that are impossible with a real animal, such as equipping it with multiple sensors for calculating its internal forces, repeating experiments as often as necessary or changing their morphology. Doubling the length of a leg, for example, will help us understand the influence of a particular bone on the efficiency of locomotion. Which of course cannot be done on a living being...\nSalamander robot. Credit: BIOROB\n- What is the future of this field? Where is it going to, in your opinion? \nThe contribution of biorobotics to biology is a rapidly evolving field, and there are many possible studies to come. Biorobots will also have increasingly varied applications, whether in environmental monitoring, agriculture, search-and-rescue to victims of disasters, or exploration of high risk areas too dangerous for humans or dogs. By the way, this is one of the fields of robotics that we tackle in Switzerland within the NCCR in Robotics.\n- Walking, swimming, flying, crawling, which is the most interesting? \nEach is interesting. Take swimming, for example. Observing the efficiency of fish in their environment allows finding alternatives to propeller-based swimming. Thus, we can create more powerful and autonomous robots and even improve the principles of navigation and ship design. Legged robots are particularly suitable in the presence of a non-structured soil, as they make discrete contacts with the ground, unlike wheeled robots requiring continuous contact. As for flying, fixed-wing - like planes - or rotating-wing - like helicopters - models remain the most effective and simple to build for bigger robots. A flapping-wing system is more adequate in the case of smaller ones. Fluid dynamics determines that, for an insect, to move in the air is the same as if we were moving in oil. In this case, a propeller is less effective than an oscillatory motion like insects and birds. \nCredit: Harvard Microrobotics Lab\n- What about our human way of walking? \nThe humanoid model is well suited for moving among humans, where it must climb stairs, use tools, etc. If it were to move outside, other means such as quadruped walking would be better. It is interesting to note that, in the case of humans, biorobotics has also served biology by demonstrating that mechanics, and not just the brain, solves some of the control problems. Experiments have shown that some humanoid robots, called passive walkers, managed to go down a slope without a motor, nor batteries and without falling. Similarly to the human morphology, they produce a pendulum effect that provides the necessary energy and stability. So we can see that there is a kind body intelligence, which, if we understand it, would allow us to invent a more effective and fluid locomotion that would require less energy. \n- What are the biggest challenges for a biorobotics specialist? \nFirstly, designing such robots requires big teams and a range of expertise in mechanical engineering, computer science, electronics and mathematics. Next, understand the movement of a living being is difficult, because locomotion is the result of the interaction of many components, some of which are very difficult to reproduce. For instance, replicating the viscoelastic properties of an arm is very complicated at the mechanical level. And all the technologies that would allow us to achieve this have not yet been accomplished, particularly in terms of skin substitutes or actuators, which are still struggling to replicate muscles faithfully. These, however, are elements that play an important role in locomotion.\nCheetah cub robot. Credit: BIOROB\n- Is a movement that seems trite and simple to us actually a complex operation? \nThe more I work in robotics, the more I realize how every living creature is constantly solving extremely complicated control problems. As they are done intuitively, we tend to underestimate the meaning of these gestures. To try to incorporate into a robot all identified components is an interesting exercise. We often realize that what we had thought to have understood on paper does not work in practice. We usually lack certain data or understanding of certain mechanisms. They are usually subtle interactions that have not been decrypted yet, but which are essential for interacting with the environment.\"", "summary": "Biorobotics’ aim is to design more efficient robots based on locomotion solutions developed by the animal world.

{"id": 842, "text": "Kamusi, which means dictionary in Swahili, aims to translate all the meanings of words from 7,000 languages from around the world into all other languages, and it will include definitions and usage examples. This vast project, which began twenty years ago, is growing at an exponential rate. Some languages, like English and Swahili, are already largely available.\nMore than a translator, this dictionary delves into the words so that two meanings of the same term can no longer be confused. Take the English word light: in French, the automatic translator will translate it as léger or lumière depending on the context. Yet the chosen meaning is often incorrect, and the text becomes gibberish. The problem is even more pronounced when it comes to less common languages. Kamusi, which is now an NGO, intends to overcome these pitfalls. It includes both definitions and examples. In addition to being ambitious, the project is also a major technological challenge because a massive amount of data needs to be stored, organized and made accessible.\nMore than 1 million words in several months\n This summer, EPFL’s Distributed Information Systems Laboratory added 1.2 million words. Researchers imported the entire participatory translation website Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW), making improvements to the search process and the links between the various meanings of words. The Kamusi website shows, for example, if a translation was done by a computer and if the meaning was confirmed by a human being. It also lets users see groups of words with a similar meaning in other languages along with the expanded entry for each term.\nApart from adding existing databases, the Kamusi team counts on human knowledge as well. People who have mastered several languages are translating as many words as possible. This participatory approach works especially well for little-used languages. So much so that the government of Mali has just invested 5 million CFA francs – around 78,000 Swiss francs – in order to add words from three of its local languages. This money, a tidy sum for that country, will mostly be used locally to use any existing databases or to verify, little by little, the terms added by bilingual people.\nAfrica, Vietnam, Europe: an international dictionary\n “This is the first time that an African government is investing its own money in this project, which is a remarkable sign of confidence,” said Martin Benjamin, who founded the Kamusi project and is currently a researcher at the Distributed Information Systems Laboratory. This agreement also marks the cornerstone of a future collaborative effort to make this universal online dictionary the first electronic tool used by the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN), which is the intergovernmental body of the African Union tasked with promoting and developing the continent’s languages. “Africa’s growth and access to knowledge require a dictionary of this sort so that people can communicate with each other and with the outside world,” said Benjamin. The dictionary is also expanding in Asia and Europe. 200,000 Vietnamese words will be added thanks to a small subsidy provided by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation. And the inclusion of other databases with Bulgarian, Greek, Croatian, Slovene and Swedish words is also in the works.\nHow Kamusi started: In 1995, Martin Benjamin, who now works at the Distributed Information Systems Laboratory, tried to learn Swahili in preparation for an anthropological study in Tanzania. He was unable, however, to find an English-Swahili dictionary. He then came up with the idea of creating a participatory website – at a time when the internet was in its infancy – in order to create a Swahili-English database. Work on this language pair has progressed quite far at this point. Kamusi has now become an NGO and is based in Geneva.", "summary": "The universal online dictionary Kamusi has just added 1.2 million terms from several databases in its quest to translate all the meanings of every word in all the world’s languages.

While other vacationers were spending a quiet holiday at the beach, they roamed Ho Chi Minh City and its suburbs visiting... hospitals.\nDuring eight weeks the students conducted their work, subsidized by Ingénieurs du Monde and falling within the framework of the EssentialTech program at the Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV) at EPFL. It builds on the  partnership and focuses on the development of water purification kits specifically tailored to the context of hospitals in emerging and developing countries.\nNot always welcome\n The three Life Sciences and Bioengineering students went to Vietnam to conduct a preliminary - yet crucial - step in this important project. They had to make an assessment of the access to drinking water in hospitals at the capital and its surrounding areas, as well as to estimate their needs. \"We quickly realized that the subject raised rather sensitive points, stated Maxence Dellacherie. The quality control of hospitals’ water is governed by recent legislation and it was not always easy for us to get the required authorization to conduct our analysis ...\"\nIndeed, after visiting the hospitals that did open their doors to our students, they got to the conclusion that, in general, water does not meet the health standards they had chosen to test. \"Patients buy their own bottles of drinking water outside,\" explained Sandra Gribi. Obviously, when it comes to weakened and vulnerable people, access to drinking water is much more important.\nFinding the right people\n Despite several months of preparation with the support of Felippe de Alencastro - from EPFL’s Central Environmental Laboratory - and after making preliminary contacts with Ho Chi Minh City’s University of Technology, the students still had to face some contingencies. \"Identifying the right people to support us during the process and while carrying out the analysis was not an easy task, said Gaëlle Minder. In addition, we did not expect to meet such administrative barriers. I hope that the contacts we made will remain useful in the project’s subsequent phases.\" The three travelers also agree on the necessity of thorough groundwork in addition to simply establishing a contact. “We would have saved a lot of time if some steps had begun before our arrival,\" said Sandra.\nHowever, the students were able to rely on the unwavering commitment of their Vietnamese colleagues. \"I was impressed and touched by their dedication and kindness,\" continued Gaëlle. Bacteriological analyses of the collected samples were carried out in laboratories with equipment described by Maxence as \"surprisingly varied and numerous.\" However, there were significant constraints due to the ambient temperature - over 30 Celsius degrees - and to the lack of air-conditioned spaces, which hindered the conservation of some products as well as the maintenance of the equipment in sterile conditions.\nBack to reality\n \"After spending four years in the Swiss academic environment, adjusting to the reality of the field was not easy, especially within the context of a culture at odds with ours,\" said Gaelle - before adding how the change of scenery has proved rewarding. Vietnamese hospitality undoubtedly accounts for many of their positive memories of the time spent doing the internship. For Sandra it was the impromptu performance of a song in an evening, and for Maxence it was the tasting of a dish of \"mini -chicken\" that later proved to have been made of... rat meat.\nTowards a large-scale project\n The important work carried out by Gaëlle, Sandra and Maxence has laid the groundwork for the realization of the project. The road is still long, and all three would be happy to share their experience with the next candidates for an internship in Vietnam. \"This first step allows us to move forward,\" said Klaus Schönenberger, head of the EssentialTech program at CODEV and originator of the internship. Based on the evidence gathered on site, he was indeed able to obtain, with the assistance of the Dragon Bleu Foundation, the subsidy for a job position to conduct the project’s next phases. \"The issue of access to drinking water in hospital is not unique to Vietnam: it also happens in Africa, he said.

As far as the Congress Center is concerned, we have left it a bit late. However, if the demonstration is conclusive, I hope that future EPFL buildings will be constructed in this way.”\n It is also hoped that, in the near future, the future hospital of the Chablais region will also benefit from it.\nHow does it work?\n Very low energy geothermics is a domain that uses resources situated at depths of between 1 and 100 meters from ground-level. The temperature of this layer is more or less stable, situated between 10 and 12 degrees throughout the year, which represents a reliable source of heat. The use of heat pumps to leverage this source of energy is already well established. The piles are connected to thermal exchangers encased in concrete tubes, through which flows a coolant. The hydraulic circuit is connected to a reversible heat-pump system. Thus, the foundations fulfil the role of heat source in cold periods, and a source of cold in warm periods.\nThis technology also enables seasonal storage of energy produced by solar panels in the sub-soil. \n“In the Congress Center, we will benefit from an analytical laboratory that will include all the elements necessary for heating and measurement. The five structures, equipped with optical fibers and pressure cells, will help us to understand and subsequently to explain the exact functioning of a group of energy-transmitting piles, and this will provide us with essential information on their behavior and their impact within the available volume under the foundations, which is about 200m3.”\n Professor Laloui is also working with The Cambridge-MIT Institute and the University of Beijing on a much more ambitious project: that of an urban area the size of EPFL, built entirely on energy-efficient foundations. \n\"In this case, we will have to look into the hydrogeological consequences of such constructions on the global stability of the region. This is even more important than usual, because in this particular research project we will be drilling very deep, where the water is about 100 degrees, before storing the energy in the foundations of buildings.”\n This experiment, involving the foundations of the Congress Center, will be the focus of an international workshop that Professor Laloui is organizing in January 2012, which has obtained the support of the American National Scientific Fund.", "summary": "Four energy-efficient piles are being installed between end-May and the beginning of June in the foundations of the future building.

{"id": 848, "text": "While water has long been known as a crucial component of biological systems, it is only recently that scientists are beginning to discover the intricate ways in which it drives the structuring of biological compounds such as proteins, membranes, DNA and sugars That is also the case for hyaluronan, a polysaccharide found around cells and in parts of our body where lubrification and viscosity are important, like in our joints. Hyaluronan is a key determinant of the texture of the aqueous fluids in these areas. Using a new method developed in their lab, the LBP scientists found that hyaluronan influences the orientation of many more water molecules than previously thought. Their research, appearing in \nScience Advances\n, marks a breakthrough in how scientists perceive water’s role in biology.\nA new way of understanding hydration\nThe LBP scientists probed at the nanoscale to better understand how hyaluronan interacts with water. Hyaluronan molecules contain many anions, or negatively charged ions, while the water molecules (H\n2\nO) are neutral but positively charged on one end and negatively charged on the other end. This charge distribution orients the water molecules when they ‘see’ the negative charge of the hyaluronan. Previously, charges were thought to influence water over a distance of 3 water molecules, involving only this interaction. However, using their new method, the LBP scientists found the influence actually extends up to 1,600 water molecules. They also discovered a second mechanism that orients water, namely that the electrostatic field of the anions changes slightly the way in which water molecules connect to one another. This mechanism is also at play in hyaluronan solutions. This groundbreaking discovery could challenge conventional ways of thinking about water and how it interacts with complex molecules. Hyaluronan is known for its viscosity-enhancing properties, which has always been thought to arise only from interactions between the hyaluronan molecules. However, this work shows that water and how it is influenced plays an important role as well.\nTesting the orientation of water molecules \nHyaluronan orients water molecules by enhancing water-water correlations. It acts as a “flexible chain surrounded by extended shells of orientationally correlated water, which fluctuates depending on the hyaluronan molecule’s movements,” says Sylvie Roke, head of the LBP. Her team of scientists measured the spatial correlations over nanoscopic length scales.\nTheir method differs from standard techniques, such as light scattering, which measures variations in hyaluronan rather than water molecules. What’s more, existing techniques are not sensitive enough to work at very low concentrations. The LBP method, called femtosecond elastic second-harmonic scattering, offers 1000 times greater sensitivity, allowing to measure the tiny structural correlations that result from the changes in water structure. Illuminating a solution with a femtosecond near infrared laser pulse results in the generation of photons that have the double energy of the incoming photons. Such second harmonic photons can only be generated from regions in the liquid that have a broken symmetry compared to the isotropic structure of the neat bulk liquid. They therefore report in a very sensitive manner on structural differences. By contrast in regular light scattering methods the same color photons are emitted from every molecule so that structural differences are only detectable by making a difference measurement. This results in the 1000 x higher sensitivity, as well as –in this case- the sensitivity to water.\nShedding new light on the complexity of aqueous systems \nRoke explains: “The ability to observe how water superstructures change in response to molecules like hyaluronan opens up a whole new field of research. Our method could be used in combination with other, non-linear optical approaches to better investigate the complexity of aqueous systems, which we are just now starting to discover.”", "summary": "Hyaluronic acid, also known as hyaluronan, is a polysaccharide that helps establish the viscosity of bodily fluids.

That paves the way to important discoveries about biological processes that until now have been insufficiently understood because of the lack of a reliable way to observe them. The company’s new system comes together with a proprietary software for converting the images in 3D and making them easier to interpret, such as by displaying specific organelles in color.\nCells can be observed for hours, days or even weeks \nWith this next-generation microscope, called CX-A, scientists can watch living cell populations and zoom in all the way down to individual organelles with a resolution of <200 nm.

Scientists can rapidly set up their experiments by simply specifying how often they want images to be taken; the device then runs on its own. Data can be collected this way for as long as needed, with thousands of images taken over a period of several days or weeks. As a result, they can obtain unprecedented insights into how biological processes work, how organelles interact, and how mitochondria form intricate networks, for example.\nThe technology was initially developed by Nanolive’s CEO Yann Cotte while he was a PhD student at EPFL. It works like an MRI machine that generates images of cells from all angles using their refractive index and then compiles 3D images with the help of an advanced software. A rotating laser illuminates the sample at a 45° angle to produce a hologram, providing a unique look into cells under natural conditions. The method is non-invasive, manipulation-free, and interference-free, and the rotational scanning allows for 3D reconstruction with excellent resolution.\nTraditional microscopes require the addition of stains or markers to cells, in order to add contrast and visualize them. Unfortunately, these compounds damage cells and cause them to die prematurely, shortening the length of time during which measurements can be taken. Nanolive’s technology requires no stains. “With our microscope, scientists can run experiments under a range of conditions and obtain high-quality images without adding fluorescent markers,” says Mathieu Frechin, head of quantitative biology at Nanolive. “The images generated using refractive index and the possibility to combine them with fluorescent signals enable scientists to follow over time dynamic and delicate cell processes – such as the membrane potential – of living subcellular structures like mitochondria. The signals reveal subtle variations in structure and activity that occur in response to drugs or genetic mutations.\nNanolive prefers not to disclose information about its revenue or fundraising, but it’s clear the company is doing well – it will hire 15 new people this year alone. The company’s first device hit the market in 2015 and is now used by companies around the world to perform R&D in biology, pharmaceutics, and cosmetics, as well as by universities for research and education. So what’s next for the company? “ We plan to double our headcount by next year so we urgently need to move into bigger offices” says Lisa Pollaro, chief marketing officer. “Besides that, we have plenty of research projects in the pipeline, although I can’t discuss them in detail.

{"id": 851, "text": "EPFL has created a unique ecosystem of services, research labs and entrepreneurial programs in the field of education. And today it is adding another string to its bow with LEARN, a new center that will pool the efforts of the different stakeholders involved in educational research and in developing new teaching tools. “To keep pace with the remarkable advancements in digital technology, we need to update both what we teach and how we teach,” says Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education. “LEARN’s primary goal will therefore be to conduct translational research in educational science. That is, to try out new teaching methods, demonstrate their impact and turn them into new teaching practices for our campus and, where desirable, for the educational system as a whole.”\nLEARN will aim to stimulate research and create new synergies in education – a field that has ramifications for our entire society. The center will be headed by Francesco Mondada, a professor at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory and the engineer behind the Thymio teaching robot. LEARN members include the Swiss EdTech Collider, a group of around 70 high-tech startups and the Center for Digital Education, which recently unveiled the Learning Companion application that helps students “learn how to learn.”\nLEARN members operate at all levels of education, from primary school through university. Thymio is a classic example of their work; this robot lets children try out programming and learn the basics of robotics. Over 40,000 Thymio robots have already been sold, mainly to schools. “Adding computational thinking to school curricula doesn’t mean pushing children to think like computers. On the contrary – it means showing children what computers can’t do so that they can have a more complete understanding of the technology,” says Mondada. LEARN will also aim to help teachers adapt to changes in their profession. In addition to leading the new center, Mondada will coordinate teacher training programs to prepare them for the introduction of a new subject called “computer science and digital projects” for young elementary school kids (4-7 years old) in Vaud Canton.\n“Our goal isn’t to make teaching more digital – that’s happening by itself. Rather, we hope to develop ways for using digital technology to make teaching more effective, more varied and more inclusive,” says Professor Pierre Dillenbourg, a LEARN co-founder and head of the Swiss EdTech Collider and of EPFL’s Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction (CHILI) lab. CHILI has just developed a new test, called Tegami, for making granular diagnoses of dysgraphia in children so that they can receive personalized treatment for learning how to write. “We’re also working on systems for professional training. For instance, we developed an augmented reality application for carpenter apprentices,” says Dillenbourg, who is also a former elementary school teacher.\nIn addition, LEARN will help expand EPFL’s online course offering through MOOCs – where EPFL is the leading school in Europe – as well as through the EPFL Extension School, which provides courses on digital technology for the general public (with no prerequisites).", "summary": "EPFL inaugurate this Wednesday, October 10 the LEARN Center for Learning Sciences.

{"id": 852, "text": "EPFL ArtLab inaugurates the world's first cognitive symbiosis experiment, open to the public on October 27th, in the form of an art-science exhibit called \nMental Work\n, and it’s literally thought-provoking.\nFrom a technical standpoint, thought is at the core of the \nMental Work\n exhibit. Visitors have the opportunity to experience what it’s like to control machines using thought alone via brain-machine interfaces, and it requires a fair share of concentration. Plus, anonymized brainwave data will be made available to the scientific community to improve cognitive interfaces.\nMental Work \nalso questions the relationship between human and machine, and how this relationship will evolve with technological advances. It juxtaposes the industrial revolution against the possibly imminent cognitive revolution in which human ­and machine are in symbiosis.\n“We would like to generate a societal debate,” says José Millán, EPFL neuroengineer and co-founder of the project. “This cognitive revolution, which is about to come, may have different shapes. Which is the shape that people would like to see? Which is the place of brain-machine interfaces, if any, in the future cognitive society that we are moving towards?”\n © 2017 EPFL / Mental Work / Adrien Barakat\nEPFL technology deciphers brainwave activity for Mental Work\nAt EPFL, Millán develops , essentially robotic systems that perform a subject’s intention. These systems require technology that detects and decodes the electrical activity of the brain in order to decipher the intended task.\nApplications range from assisting the physically challenged with intact cognitive ability, to improving our daily interactions with machines, or simply preventing one’s cognitive abilities from declining prematurely.\n © 2017 EPFL / Hillary Sanctuary\nThis deciphering of a subject’s intention based on the brain’s electrical activity is possible due to the organized firing of neurons in the brain. The way the  is far from being understood, but the electrical activity can be measured, non-invasively, by placing electrodes on the head. Specific thoughts provoke different patterns of electrical activity, but the signal is noisy. Millán develops algorithms that sift through the noise to detect these patterns, and he has provided this technology to the \nMental Work\n exhibit.\n“\nMental Work\n is an art exhibit where we will be running a large-scale experiment on brain-machine interfaces, meaning that people will be able to control machines by modulating their brainwaves,” continues Millán. “All the [anonymized] data that we will acquire will be made available to the brain-machine-interface scientific community, in order to advance the field through the analysis of brainwave data.”\nA state-of-the-art helmet, fully equipped with electrodes, is provided to visitors at \nMental Work\n. The visitor must imagine either closing both hands – without actually closing them – or simply relaxing both hands. An estimated 15 minutes of training is required in order for the EPFL algorithms to detect the two patterns, closed hands or relaxed hands. These thoughts can then be used as commands to operate a machine via a computer.\nThe Mental Work Factory\nThe machines at \nMental Work\n look like a science-fiction rendition of historical train wheels, equipped with apparent gears and moving parts, all of which are chromed to reflective perfection. The machines were imagined by American artist, experimental philosopher and co-founder of \nMental Work\n, Jonathon Keats, and realized by dedicated EPFL technicians of the ATMX workshop, in collaboration with industrial partners in the Lausanne region.\n“The industrial revolution was a dangerous period in history, literally dangerous for the laborer who might lose a hand while not paying attention,” explains Keats. “Now we are in the cognitive revolution and the stakes are potentially higher. Today, that won’t happen because you are not in touch with the machine in any physical way. Instead, you may lose your mind.”\nThis contrast between the industrial and cognitive revolutions gave rise to the \nMental Work\n exhibit, a “factory” where the visitor is a “worker” providing labor in the form of thought.\n“At the \nMental Work\n Factory, we are asking workers to come and engage in machines using only their brain-power,” says \nMental Work\n co-founder and chief business officer Michael Mitchell. “In the industrial revolution, man’s hands were replaced by machines. Now we have the real risk that man’s brain will be replaced by smarter and smarter machines. We want to bring man and his brainpower back to the center of the technology, and that’s why we are using brain-computer interfaces.”\n © 2017 EPFL / Mental Work / Adrien Barakat\nMental Work, a Swiss experience\n“ArtLab’s primary mission is to be a laboratory for exhibition experiments,” says EPFL Artlab’s Head of Content, Luc Meier.

{"id": 854, "text": "Nine years after an accident caused the loss of his left hand, Dennis Aabo Sørensen from Denmark became the first amputee in the world to feel – in real-time – with a sensory-enhanced prosthetic hand that was surgically wired to nerves in his upper arm. Silvestro Micera and his team at EPFL Center for Neuroprosthetics and SSSA (Italy) developed the revolutionary sensory feedback that allowed Sørensen to feel again while handling objects. A prototype of this bionic technology was tested in February 2013 during a clinical trial in Rome under the supervision of Paolo Maria Rossini at Gemelli Hospital (Italy). The study is published in the February 5, 2014 edition of Science Translational Medicine, and represents a collaboration called Lifehand 2 between several European universities and hospitals.\n “The sensory feedback was incredible,” reports the 36 year-old amputee from Denmark. “I could feel things that I hadn’t been able to feel in over nine years.” In a laboratory setting wearing a blindfold and earplugs, Sørensen was able to detect how strongly he was grasping, as well as the shape and consistency of different objects he picked up with his prosthetic. “When I held an object, I could feel if it was soft or hard, round or square.”\nFrom Electrical Signal to Nerve Impulse\n Micera and his team enhanced the artificial hand with sensors that detect information about touch. This was done by measuring the tension in artificial tendons that control finger movement and turning this measurement into an electrical current. But this electrical signal is too coarse to be understood by the nervous system. Using computer algorithms, the scientists transformed the electrical signal into an impulse that sensory nerves can interpret. The sense of touch was achieved by sending the digitally refined signal through wires into four electrodes that were surgically implanted into what remains of Sørensen’s upper arm nerves.\n“This is the first time in neuroprosthetics that sensory feedback has been restored and used by an amputee in real-time to control an artificial limb,” says Micera.\n“We were worried about reduced sensitivity in Dennis’ nerves since they hadn’t been used in over nine years,” says Stanisa Raspopovic, first author and scientist at EPFL and SSSA. These concerns faded away as the scientists successfully reactivated Sørensen’s sense of touch.\nConnecting Electrodes to Nerves\n On January 26, 2013, Sørensen underwent surgery in Rome at Gemelli Hospital. A specialized group of surgeons and neurologists, led by Paolo Maria Rossini, implanted so-called transneural electrodes into the ulnar and median nerves of Sørensen’s left arm. After 19 days of preliminary tests, Micera and his team connected their prosthetic to the electrodes – and to Sørensen – every day for an entire week.\nThe ultra-thin, ultra-precise electrodes, developed by Thomas Stieglitz’s research group at Freiburg University (Germany), made it possible to relay extremely weak electrical signals directly into the nervous system. A tremendous amount of preliminary research was done to ensure that the electrodes would continue to work even after the formation of post-surgery scar tissue. It is also the first time that such electrodes have been transversally implanted into the peripheral nervous system of an amputee.\nThe First Sensory-Enhanced Artificial Limb\n The clinical study provides the first step towards a bionic hand, although a sensory-enhanced prosthetic is years away from being commercially available and the bionic hand of science fiction movies is even further away.\nThe next step involves miniaturizing the sensory feedback electronics for a portable prosthetic. In addition, the scientists will fine-tune the sensory technology for better touch resolution and increased awareness about the angular movement of fingers.\nThe electrodes were removed from Sørensen’s arm after one month due to safety restrictions imposed on clinical trials, although the scientists are optimistic that they could remain implanted and functional without damage to the nervous system for many years.\nPsychological Strength an Asset\n Sørensen’s psychological strength was an asset for the clinical study. He says, “I was more than happy to volunteer for the clinical trial, not only for myself, but to help other amputees as well.” Now he faces the challenge of having experienced touch again for only a short period of time. \nSørensen lost his left hand while handling fireworks during a family holiday. He was rushed to the hospital where his hand was immediately amputated. Since then, he has been wearing a commercial prosthetic that detects muscle movement in his stump, allowing him to open and close his hand, and hold onto objects.\n“It works like a brake on a motorbike,” explains Sørensen about the conventional prosthetic he usually wears. “When you squeeze the brake, the hand closes. When you relax, the hand opens.” Without sensory information being fed back into the nervous system, though, Sørensen cannot feel what he’s trying to grasp and must constantly watch his prosthetic to avoid crushing the object.\nJust after the amputation, Sørensen recounts what the doctor told him. “There are two ways you can view this. You can sit in the corner and feel sorry for yourself. Or, you can get up and feel grateful for what you have. I believe you’ll adopt the second view.”\n“He was right,” says Sørensen.", "summary": "Dennis Aabo Sørensen is the first amputee in the world to feel sensory rich information – in realtime – with a prosthetic hand wired to nerves in his upper arm.

{"id": 859, "text": "The relationship between corals and the microscopic algae they harbor is a classic example of biological symbiosis - the mutually beneficial interaction of two species. But crucial details regarding their relationship have remained elusive until now. Using state-of-the-art imaging techniques, Anders Meibom and his team of researchers in the Laboratory for Biological Geochemistry have found new evidence on the vital role algae play in helping corals survive in environments where nutrients are scarce. Their findings were on May 16, 2013.\n“Coral reefs are the jungles of our oceans - hotspots of biodiversity that easily outcompete all other marine ecosystems,” says Christophe Kopp, first-author of the publication. Coral bleaching occurs when the colorful algae abandon their coral host because of environmental strains like rising sea temperatures. On their own, corals struggle to survive in tropical waters where nutrients are scarce, and persistent starvation can have irreversible effects. While it is well known that algae help corals to assimilate certain nutrients, such as nitrogen from seawater, how this occurs, and to what extent the corals can get by on their own, are less clear.\nTo study how nitrogen-rich nutrients are taken up and processed by the corals and the algae that inhabit them, Meibom’s research group teamed up with the  in Paris to run a series of experiments. There, they fed the corals nitrogen-rich compounds labeled with a heavy nitrogen isotope that they could later trace in the lab. Every few minutes, they extracted bits of coral, which they fixed and analyzed with a state-of-the-art isotopic imaging instrument, a so-called .\nNext, they assembled a timeline of how the nitrogen is processed by the corals and their resident algae by lining up the images of the samples extracted at different times. A combination of electron microscopy and mass spectrometry allowed them to study with unprecedented precision into which cellular compartments the heavier nitrogen isotopes had been incorporated.\nCrystal food banks\nThe research revealed that the corals depend strongly on the algae to extract sufficient nutrients from the water. This was particularly true when the corals were exposed to nitrate, a compound that they are unable to process and assimilate on their own.\nBut most interestingly, the scientists observed that the algae act as tiny food banks. Their images revealed that the algae temporarily store the nitrogen in the form of uric acid crystals – a fact they later confirmed using crystallographic analysis. This way, the algae can stock up on nutrients when supply is abundant and draw on them when supply drops, leaching some out to their coral host.\nBecause coral reefs are at the foundation of immense economic activity, both as tourist magnets and as the habitats of some of the most productive fish populations, understanding their fate as the environment they inhabit changes is not only of ecological, but also of economic importance.\nThe research was performed in close collaboration with EPFL’s Interdisciplinary Centre For Electron Microscopy (CIME), the Institute of Earth Science at the University of Lausanne, as well as the Aquarium Tropicale du Palais de la Porte Dorée \n and the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris.

{"id": 865, "text": "Immunotherapy is a promising weapon in the fight against cancer. It has proven to be much more effective than chemotherapy and radiotherapy in treatment of some cancers. The drawback is that it manages to cure only about 20% of patients; the remaining 80% do not respond to this kind of treatment. “But if doctors use a stronger form of immunotherapy in order to treat more people, it could become toxic for patients and lead to side effects,” says Li Tang, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Biomaterials for Immunoengineering within the School of Engineering. His team of scientists is developing a method that focuses immunotherapy only on tumor cells, so that the treatments are more effective and less harmful to the body as a whole. Their approach has just been published in \nMaterials Horizons \nas a cover story.\nA T-cell booster\nT cells are the cells in our immune system that destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy involves administering drugs to make those cells more powerful. “When T cells come into contact with cancer cells, they destroy the cells by releasing chemical compounds as well as applying mechanical force,” explains Tang. For immunotherapy to work with limited patient toxicity, the drugs have to be delivered precisely during this step. Existing immunotherapy treatments use biochemical signals to control the drug-release process. “But that’s a blunt tool because doctors have no control over how a drug diffuses within the body,” says Tang. To get around this problem, his team developed a method that uses a biomechanical signal, which means that drugs are released only when T cells come into contact with cancer cells. “The T cells’ mechanical force is only triggered when they are touching their target cells,” he says.\nReleasing drugs by breaking DNA\nTang’s method involves using a silica microparticle that contains lots of tiny holes. The drug is placed inside the holes, which are then capped with double-strand DNA. “We chose DNA because T cells are able to break the double-helix strands,” says Tang. When a T cell comes into contact with the microparticle, its mechanical force automatically breaks the DNA – thereby releasing the drug. “For now we’ve only just completed the proof of concept stage. We’ve shown that our idea works, but we need to develop the technology further before we can start conducting clinical trials,” says Tang. More specifically, his team will work on improving the system’s sensitivity, shrinking the microparticle down to the nanometric scale, and trying it out with different drugs. Tang eventually hopes to develop a dual-agent process whereby the T cell attaches to a nanoparticle that in turn comes into contact with the cancer cell. That means the drug would be released by the T cell, making it more effective in destroying tumors.\nTang’s lab is the first to use the mechanical force of T cells in immunotherapy applications. “If our discovery increases the percentage of patients who respond to immunotherapy by even one percentage point, then we’ll have met the challenge,” he says. \nLi Tang receives the Emerging Investigator Award\nThe scientific journal \nMaterials Horizons\n awarded its Emerging Investigator Award to Professor Li Tang for his publication entitled: “T cell force-responsive delivery of anticancer drugs using mesoporous silica microparticle ». The Editorial Board select every month, from a list of eligible articles, an early-career researcher in materials science who is identified as having the potential to influence future directions in the field. “My lab is doing innovative research at the interface of cancer immunotherapy and material engineering.

{"id": 875, "text": "A blow to the chest can have highly contrasting effects. For instance, some baseball players have died after being hit in the chest by a baseball, while patients undergoing fatal cardiac tachyarrhythmias have been saved by an appropriately timed thump to the chest. Scientists know that such blows create rapid strains on heart tissue, but they still don’t fully understand how the blows affect cardiac functioning. Researchers at EPFL’s  and at the Department of Physiology of the University of Bern () have developed an experimental device that lets scientists subject bioengineered heart tissue to highly dynamic strain cycles and measure its electrophysiological response. Their work has been published in \n.\nThe normal heartbeat is the result of an electro-mechanical coupling process. More specifically, electrical impulses invade the entire heart and “order” the heart muscle to contract. With each contraction, blood is ejected from the heart thereby ensuring stable circulation. “This coupling is essential, because that’s what makes our hearts beat at a regular pace,” says Matthias Imboden, a co-author of the study and EPFL post-doc, who performed part of his research at the Department of Physiology. \nUntil recently, scientists believed that the potentially fatal effects of a blow to the chest, or on the contrary, the rescue of patients in cardiac arrest by an appropriately timed thump to the chest, were the result of the strains that interfere with the transmission of electrical impulses, thereby causing disruption of the heartbeat. But no laboratory systems previously existed to test that hypothesis. “We did have methods for reproducing cellular strain, but they created the strain too slowly to truly replicate what happens during a blow,” says Stephan Rohr, a co-author of the study and University of Bern professor. \nReplicating blow effects in the laboratory\nThe researchers’ experimental device can subject cardiac tissue to strain patterns that closely mimic realistic chest impacts. It consists of stretchable, extremely thin gold and carbon electrodes deposited on a silicone membrane. “The carbon electrodes create the strain in the cardiac tissue and the gold ones measure the cellular electrophysiological response,” says Herbert Shea, head of the Soft Transducers Laboratory, a co-author of the study and a professor at the EPFL's School of Engineering. The researchers tested their system on bioengineered strands of rat cardiac cells, which were placed on top of the electrodes and subjected to different strains patterns. \nMuch faster strains\nThe device can generate cellular strains in the order of 10–12%, which is consistent with what occurs during a normal heartbeat. However, it generates that strain up to 100 times faster than what the heart encounters during normal function – just like what happens during a blow to the chest. The researchers’ device is motorless and is the only one to closely replicate the dynamics of blows to the chest, while simultaneously permitting the measurement of strain effects on the electrophysiology of the cardiac tissue.\nFindings that lead in new directions \nThe researchers found that contrary to what other studies had concluded, even very rapid strains do not affect the propagation of electrical impulses. “That means we need to look into other possible explanations of what exactly happens during a deadly blow to the chest,” says Rohr. “The strain sensitive element in the heart may actually not be the contracting heart cell itself but adjacent connective tissue cells.” Their device also paves the way to further research, such the effect of specific drugs or gene therapies having beneficial effects on mechano-electrical coupling in the heart.\nContacts\nEPFL - Prof. Herbert Shea\n021 693 6663\nUniversity of Bern - Prof. Stephan Rohr\n031 631 8746", "summary": "It is still a mystery why a blow to the chest can kill some people yet save others.

{"id": 876, "text": "When given a choice, people generally opt for sustainability. That’s the encouraging conclusion of our latest mobility survey,* carried out among EPFL students and staff in May. This good news comes as some 11,000 students head back to EPFL this week and the EU celebrates its annual Mobility Week. It turns out that the percentage of respondents who walk to school more than doubled between 2003 and 2019 (rising from 5% to 12%), while that of those who cycle grew by 50% (from 14% to 21%). Crucially, the percentage of people who drive fell by 17 percentage points (from 30% to 13%). “These improvements were achieved entirely through voluntary measures backed by targeted incentives and initiatives,” says Luca Fontana, in charge of mobilties at Durabilité EPFL. “That encourages us to continue rolling out our innovative, ambitious mobility plan.”\nAround 30% of EPFL students and staff – or some 4,600 people – responded to the survey (24% of students and 38% of staff). This response rate is up 8.6 percentage points from the last survey, in 2017. We learn, for example, that six out of ten respondents live either in Lausanne, near the Ecublens campus, or in one of the four surrounding towns. And more than half of commuters (54%) arrive on campus between 7:45am and 8:30am. “That’s good to know because it means we should consider measures to spread out the morning commute and therefore alleviate the traffic on roads and public transportation systems,” says Fontana. People tend to leave campus at different times, however – generally between 5pm and 7pm.\nDifferences between students and staff\nThe survey also found that students and staff differ in their commuting habits (see diagram). Among students, the percentage who walk to campus rose from 6% to 15% between 2003 and 2019, while the percentage who cycle grew from 15% to 22% – and those who drive or ride a motorcycle plunged from 21% to 5%. The percentage of students who use public transportation was relatively unchanged at 57%. However, it’s worth pointing out that there was no student housing on campus before 2003.\nRegarding EPFL staff, they are also more likely to use green transportation. The percentage of low-carbon commuters has risen 13 points since 2003; now some 20% cycle to work, up from 11% in 2003. Public transportation has surpassed the car to become the most popular commuting option; usage of the former grew from 32% to 40%, while that of the latter fell from 50% to 30%.\nElectric bikes and the PubliBike system are catching on\nOf course, the transportation method that people use also depends on the weather. Commuters are more likely to cycle in the summer (up 12 percentage points to 27%); most of them usually take public transportation, while some normally drive. The number of bicycles on campus is 70% higher during the summer months – and that of electric bikes doubles (around 15% of total bicycles). The number of cars is 15% lower.\nThe survey also indicates that EPFL’s PubliBike bike-sharing system has been a huge success. Nearly half of respondents use it – with the percentage of students twice that of staff (66% versus 31%) – and over 120,000 commutes were made on PubliBike in under a year. In addition, around 20% of students have used the EPFL Bike Center to have their bikes repaired or to buy a used bike at discounted rates. And 22% of respondents have tried out the Mobility car-sharing service (29% of staff and 15% of students).\nCarpooling campaign\nThese encouraging survey results do not mean the EPFL sustainability team will rest on its laurels. More initiatives are under way, and their effects will be visible from this fall. For instance, electronic discount cards for Lausanne’s public transportation system will be available to EPFL staff starting in October. And 24 electric vehicle charging stations will go into service in September through a partnership with Greenmotion.\nWhile very few students drive to school (3%) – largely because parking is too hard to find – 30% of staff take their car to work. And in the vast majority of cases (77%), the person drives alone. But the survey found that these commuters are open to carpooling. Therefore the EPFL sustainability team will launch a campaign in October to promote carpooling and introduce a new website that puts commuters in touch with drivers. During the campaign, participants will get free parking and their commute home refunded if something comes up.\n*Carried out in association with the Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences (FORS)", "summary": "As classes get under way, our latest mobility survey revealed that over 80% of respondents use public transportation or other clean ways of getting to campus.", "claim": "As classes get under way, your latest mobility survey revealed that over 80% of respondents use public transportation or other clean ways of getting to campus.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [6, 6], "noise": false}

Topological data analysis reveals the similarity between structures; each node represents a family of similar materials, while a network between two nodes indicates that they share at least one material. The further apart the nodes are, the more dissimilar the materials. The pictures show examples of nanoporous materials at the edges, and represent the topologically most different materials (red = Si, yellow = O, blue area = Pores). (Credit: Berend Smit/EPFL | Figure obtained with the )\nMaterials classified as “nanoporous” have structures (or “frameworks”) with pores up to 100 nm in diameter. These include diverse materials used in different fields from gas separation, catalysis, and even medicine (e.g. activated charcoal). The performance of nanoporous materials depends on both their chemical composition and the shape of their pores, but the latter is very difficult to quantify. So far, chemists rely on visual inspection to see whether two materials have similar pores. EPFL scientists, in the framework of , have now developed an innovative mathematical method that allows a computer to quantify similarity of pore structures. The method makes it possible to search databases with hundreds of thousands of nanoporous materials to discover new materials with the right pore structure. The work is .\nThe search for nanoporous materials\nNanoporous materials comprise a broad category and can differ widely in their chemical makeup. What unites them is the presence of nano-sized pores in their three-dimensional structure, which endows them with catalytic and absorption properties. These pores can range between 0.2-1000 nanometers, and their size and shape (their “geometry”) can have a decisive effect on the material’s properties. In fact, pore shape is as important a predictor of performance as chemical composition. \nToday, computers can generate large databases of potential materials and determine — before having to synthesize them — which materials would perform best for a given application. But their chemistry is so versatile that the number of possible new materials is almost unlimited, while we do not have a method for quantifying and comparing similarity between pore geometries. All this means that finding the best nanoporous material for any given application is challenging.\nMath to the rescue\nA new method developed in a collaboration of the labs of Berend Smit and Kathryn Hess Bellwald at EPFL uses a technique from applied mathematics called “persistent homology”. This technique can quantify the geometric similarity of pore structures by adopting the mathematical tools that are commonly used by Facebook and others to find similar faces in uploaded photos.\nThe persistent homology method produces “fingerprints”, represented by barcodes, that characterize the pore shapes of each material in the database. These fingerprints are then compared to compute how similar the pore shapes of two materials are. This means that this approach can be used to screen databases and identify materials with similar pore structures. \nThe EPFL scientists show that the new method is effective at identifying materials with similar pore geometries. One class of nanoporous materials that would benefit from this innovation are the zeolites and the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), whose applications range from gas separation and storage to catalysis. \nThe scientists used methane storage — an important aspect of renewable energy — as a case study. The new method showed that it is possible to find nanoporous materials that perform as well as known top-performing materials by searching databases for similar pore shapes. \nConversely, the study shows that the pore shapes of the top-performing materials can be sorted into topologically distinct classes, and that materials from each class require a different optimization strategy.\n“We have a database of over 3,000,000 nanoporous materials, so finding similar structures through visual inspection is out of the question,” says Berend Smit. \"In fact, going through the literature, we found that authors often don’t realize when a new MOF has the same pore structure as another one. So we really need a computational method. However, while humans are intuitively good at recognizing shapes as the same or different, we needed to work with the math department at EPFL to develop a formalism that can teach this skill to a computer.”\n“In the field of algebraic topology, mathematicians have formulated the theory of persistence homology in any dimension,” says Kathryn Hess. “Previous applications used only the first two of these dimensions, so it’s exciting that chemical engineers at EPFL have discovered a significant application that requires the third dimension as well.”\nThis work was a collaboration between EPFL, INRIA (France) and UC Berkeley.

{"id": 878, "text": "Leprosy is a chronic infection of the skin, peripheral nerves, eyes and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, affecting over a quarter million people worldwide. Its symptoms can be gruesome and devastating, as the bacteria reduce sensitivity in the body, resulting in skin lesions, nerve damage and disabilities. Until recently, leprosy was attributed to a single bacterium,\n Mycobacterium leprae\n; we now suspect that its close relative, \nMycobacterium lepromatosis\n, might cause a rare but severe form of leprosy. EPFL scientists have analyzed for the first time the complete genome of \nM. lepromatosis\n, and compared it to that of the major leprosy-causing bacterium. Published in \nPNAS\n, the study reveals the origin and evolutionary history of both bacteria, and offers new insights into their biology, global distribution, and possibly treatment.\nAlong with its mutilating symptoms, leprosy also carries a stigma, turning patients into social outcasts. Although we have been able to push back the disease with antibiotics, leprosy remains endemic in many developing countries today.\nLeprosy can manifest itself in various forms, all thought to be caused by the bacterium \nM. leprae\n. But in 2008, a study showed considerable evidence that another species of bacterium, \nM. lepromatosis\n, causes a distinct and aggressive form of the disease called “diffuse lepromatous leprosy”, found in Mexico and the Caribbean.\nStudying the genome of \nM. lepromatosis\n The lab of Stewart Cole at EPFL’s Global Health Institute carried out a genome-wide investigation on \nM. lepromatosis\n. This complex and computer-heavy technique looks at the bacterium’s entire DNA, locating its genes along the sequence. Because \nM. lepromatosis\n cannot be grown in the lab and animal models for this version of leprosy do not exist yet, the scientists used an infected skin sample from a patient in Mexico to obtain the bacterium’s genetic material.\nAfter extracting the DNA from the entire sample, the researchers had to separate the bacterial DNA from the patient’s. To do this, they used two genetic techniques: one that increased the bacterium’s DNA and another that decreased the human DNA. With the bacterium’s DNA isolated, the researchers were able to sequence it and read it. Once they had the complete sequence of the bacterium’s genome, they were able to compare it with the known genome of \nM. leprae\n, the bacterium responsible for the majority of leprosy cases.\nThe study found that the two species of bacteria are very closely related. The comparative genomics analysis could “backtrack” the history of their genes, and showed that the two bacteria have diverged 13.9 million years ago from a common ancestor with a similar genome structure, and possibly a similar lifestyle. That ancestor suffered a process known as “gene decay”, where over a long period of time and multiple generations, a large number of genes mutated, became non-functional, and eventually disappeared. The study showed that the two new species continued to lose genes but from different regions of their genomes, indicating that during their evolution they occupied different biological roles and mechanisms to ensure survival.\nCole’s team also conducted a study on over two hundred skin samples from leprosy patients in Asia, Africa, and the Americas to determine the geographic distribution of \nM. lepromatosis\n. The results showed that the bacterium is relatively scarce, and seems to be restricted to patients in Mexico. In contrast, the major leprosy-causing bacterium \nM. leprae\n is widespread across the world.\nThe study also discovered that \nM. lepromatosis\n has retained the genes needed to infect cells of the nervous system called Schwann cells. These produce protective sheaths that wrap around the axons of peripheral neurons. Although Schwann cell infection is a hallmark of \nM. leprae\n leprosy, the presence of related genes in M. lepromatosis means that this bacterium could also be attacking these cells. This will become clearer in future investigations, facilitated in part by the resources generated by this work.\nThis genome-wide comparative study offers new and deeper insights into the biology of \nM. lepromatosis\n. By uncovering the evolutionary history of the two leprosy bacteria, it can open up new ways for developing therapeutic strategies.\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Global Health Institute with the University of Tübingen, the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, and the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León.

Two days, indeed, were not too much to make this important decision. According to Maya Fruehauf, who was responsible for organizing this open house for the Department for the Promotion of Education: “The goal is to attract new students who have consciously chosen and who will then begin their studies with strong motivation.”\nThe number of students attending the sessions generally reflects the proportion entering these sections in the first year: architecture and life sciences are the most popular.

{"id": 885, "text": "How do neurodegenerative diseases like AD spread within the brain? Do the connections between neurons play a role in how these diseases develop, or is it simply that weaker nerve cells are affected first and stronger ones later in the course of the illness? These key questions, which have not yet been the object of much scientific study, are at the heart of a novel experimental method developed by Robert Meissner and Anja Kunze. The two EPFL scientists have designed a cell culture device with two compartments in which it is possible to “connect” healthy neurons and “sick” neurons via a neurite network. Their work will make it possible to conduct in-depht studies of how neurodegenerative diseases spread via the connections between neurons. \n “Most work on AD focuses on biochemical mechanisms within the cells,” says Microsystems Laboratory 4 (LMSI4) Director Philippe Renaud, in whose lab the work took place. “In fact, AD starts in a specific area of the brain, the limbic system, and then spreads to other areas. This would tend to indicate that neural networks probably play a role in disease propagation.” The method and results were published in the journal Biotechnology and Bioengineering, and might well be applicable to the study of the propagation mechanisms of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s Disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob’s (i.e., the human form of “Mad Cow”) Disease. \nConnecting two separate neuron cell cultures\t\n The team “connected” the two groups of cultured neurons in a custom-designed microfluidic-based cell culture device. The device has three compartments (see illustration). Microchannels measuring 50 to 100 microns were used to guide neurite outgrowths that linked thousands of neurons in the device’s two lateral compartments. In this way the healthy and “sick” neural cell populations were at once separate and interconnected, a situation that the research team refers to as a “co-pathological” state.\nMaking the neurons “sick”\t\n To “infect” one of the two interconnected cell cultures, one of the compartments was exposed to Okadaic Acid (OA). OA makes neurons exhibit one main characteristics of AD by causing hyperphosphorylation of the Tau proteins in the cells. This is a hallmark of AD, and it leads to the progressive destruction of the neural networks as well as the neurons themselves. “We exposed the neurons to high doses of OA, and it killed them within 24 to 48 hours,” says Anja Kunze, co-author of the article detailing the new method. “But we could also try lower exposure levels and observe the results over longer periods of time. Our results thus far show that the healthy cells were contaminated after 24 hours. But more observations are needed before drawing any conclusions.”\nAn innovation that opens the door for further research\n The new method has already aroused the interest of neuroscientists. “What’s really interesting is that they can precisely target the specific neural cell population they want to make sick,” says Patrick Fraering, an AD neuroscience specialist. “This method can be used for many types of tests, including tests for other neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, Parkinson’s Disease symptoms could be triggered in one of the compartments. Or you could try applying various candidate drugs as treatments on diseased cells.” All of this will sharpen our understanding of how these illnesses spread and increase the chances that it may one day be possible to contain the damage that neurodegenerative diseases do to the brain.", "summary": "The connections between neurons might play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).

{"id": 894, "text": "One-and-a-half million people live near Lake Geneva. Fifty percent of this population gets its daily drinking water from the lake. Yet there is still much to learn about the complex workings of this heavily human¬impacted ecosystem. Thanks to support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals and Russia’s Honorary Consulate in Lausanne, two Mir submersibles will be made available to the science teams so they can explore the lakebed. Fitted with state-of-the-art equipment, these Russian-designed underwater vessels will enable the researchers to gain a better understanding of Lake Geneva’s geology and physics, and to conduct studies, notably in the areas of bacteriology and micropollutants. The aim is to collect data deemed vital to ensuring the protection of this environment. In the summer of 2011, the elemo scientific program, coordinated at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), will bring together Swiss, French, British, Russian and American research institutions. The dives will take place from June to August. \n Ferring Phamaceuticals is financing most of the program. “We believe in research, the values of partnership and exchange of knowledge,” said Michel Pettigrew, President of the Executive Board of Ferring Pharmaceuticals. “Our international headquarters are located in Saint-Prex, on the lakeshore, so we are part of the Lake Geneva community. Therefore, we are especially proud to support such a partnership bringing together several of the best international science teams with the goal of better understanding Lake Geneva.” \n Lake Geneva’s environment raises many questions in scientific circles. What pollutants are found in the lake’s waters, and how do they circulate in the water flows? How are bacterial populations distributed on the lakebed? What dynamics govern the settling of the sediments brought in by the many tributaries? Currently, various competing scientific models attempt to answer these very questions. \n The Mir submersibles will be a valuable aid for the science teams, enabling them to garner larger amounts of more accurate data and to place grids over entire areas. The researchers will gain easy access to the deepest parts of the lake, at depths of over 300 meters, where they will be able to study how pollutants accumulate, and even perform field experiments. \n The lake consists of layers of water that are permeable to differing degrees. By using the submersibles to carry out a detailed study of the boundaries between these layers, the researchers will be able to better understand how the water circulates. Over time, these models will be of the utmost importance for measuring the local and overall impact of human activity on Lake Geneva. \n The mouth of the Rhone is one of the areas that most interests the science teams. The sediments washed down by the river form unstable submarine canyons over 30 meters high. The dives should provide a better understanding of this unstable environment, which is as spectacular as it is poorly known. The researchers will also explore the Vidy area, where the shores are densely populated, to learn more about the impact of micropollutants. \n Elemo includes more than 15 research teams in all. Scientists from the EPFL, the Universities of Geneva, Neuchatel, Haute-Savoie and Newcastle, EAWAG (the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology), INRA (the National Agronomic Research Institute) in Toulouse, the CNRS (French National Centre for Research), the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will combine their expertise during the two-month-plus campaign. \n “Russia and the canton of Vaud share historic ties,” explained Frederik Paulsen, the Russian Federation’s Honorary Consul, who is also Chairman of Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ board of directors. “This project will make state-of-the-art Russian submersibles available to an important research program on Lake Geneva. We are proud to be writing a new chapter of this long shared history.” \n The Russian Federation’s Honorary Consulate brought together the EPFL and Anatoly Sagalevitch, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the expedition leader for many missions on board the Mir submersibles, notably in the Arctic and Lake Baikal.

On December 3, 2012, EPFL inaugurates the Margaretha Kamprad Chair in limnology and environmental science, in the presence of Frederik Paulsen, CEO of Ferring, and Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of Ikea. The Chair will be supported by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, who will provide CHF 5 million in the context of a private-public partnership. It will be dedicated to the study of lake ecosystems, which are fragile and often heavily affected by human activity. Alfred Wüest, a world renowned expert in aquatic physics, has been nominated to hold the Chair.\nLimnology, or the “oceanography of lakes”\nLimnology is to lakes as oceanography is to oceans. However, these two environments have significant differences, explains Wüest. “Lakes are relatively closed ecosystems; they are much more sensitive to pollution, and the way current circulate in them is very different. For example, we find what we call “stratification” phenomena, in which different layers of water mix very little with one another.” Billions of human beings depend on the health of these freshwater reservoirs, which are being subjected to increasing environmental pressure.\nWüest’s research focuses on the study of biological phenomena in Lake Geneva, particularly phytoplankton – which are both an indicator of the health status of the lake and the first link in the lake’s food chain. In the next two years, the bulk of his work will be conducted in the context of the elemo program, which includes a component to explore Lake Geneva and Lake Baïkal (Russia) using ultralight aircraft equipped with multiple sensors.\nUniting scientific research on Lake Geneva\nLake Geneva, the largest lake in Western Europe, provides an exceptional research opportunity for local scientists. “The goal of this Chair is to bring together all the research that’s being done on lake environments by scientists in every field, in Switzerland and in neighboring France,” the scientist explains.\nThe Chair already includes a Senior Scientist, and the first PhD student will start work in January.

{"id": 900, "text": "In the fifties, geneticists were faced with a mystery: when two strains of the same fruit fly species (Drosophila) crossed, they only produced female flies instead of the expected 50:50 sex ratio. At first, scientists thought that what lay behind this was a genetic mutation, but it was later discovered that the cause was a hidden bacterium, \nSpiroplasma poulsonii.\nSpiroplasma \nis an endosymbiotic bacterium that lives in the fruit fly’s blood and is passed on to it offspring through the female’s oocytes. This bacterium remains largely hidden from its host but induces a fascinating reproductive manipulation: the specific killing of male embryos.\nMale-killing Spiroplasma bacteria in the hemolymph of an adult Drosophila fruitfly. Credit: Toshiyuki Harumoto/EPFL\nThe existence of male-killer bacteria appear at first sight puzzling, but studies have shown that it promotes the long-term persistence of the symbiotic bacteria by increasing the frequency of infected females who then transmit the bacteria to their offspring.\nMale-killing is not restricted to \nSpiroplasma\n but is also observed in several other endosymbiotic bacteria. The molecular mechanism underlying this process has however never been clarified. The original idea was that \nSpiroplasma\n produces an “androcidin” toxin, which kills males. But despite several attempts, the identity of this of this male killer has remained a mystery.\nNow, Professor Bruno Lemaitre and Dr Toshiyuki Harumoto at EPFL have identified the elusive male-killing bacterial factor, solving the mystery. In a \nNature\n paper, they reveal that the culprit is a protein that they name Spaid (for \nS\npiroplasma \np\noulsonii \na\nndroc\nid\nin).\nThe gene for Spaid is known to encode a protein that has particular structural characteristics needed for its localization and activity inside the bacterium (ankyrin repeats and de-ubiquitinase domains).\nThe scientists found that just expressing Spaid in fruit flies was enough to recreate all the phenotypes associated with male killing in the insect. Consistent with a function in male killing, Spaid specifically binds to the X chromosome of male embryos. The authors speculate that Spaid interferes with a “male-specific process”, such as a mechanism that increases the transcription of genes on the X chromosome (males have one X chromosome, while females have two). Finally, the scientists discovered a strain of the \nSpiroplasma \nbacterium with a mutation in the \nSpaid\n gene, which showed a reduced ability to kill males.\n“To our knowledge, Spaid is the first bacterial effector protein identified to date that affects host cellular machinery in a sex-specific manner,” says Harumoto. “And it is also, to our knowledge again, the first paper to identify an insect endosymbiont factor causing male killing. As such, we expect that it will have a big impact on the fields of symbiosis, sex determination and evolution.”", "summary": "An endosymbiotic bacterium, Spiroplasma, specifically kills the males of its fruit-fly host (Drosophila).

{"id": 905, "text": "Because of its low energy density, natural gas has to be compressed or liquefied, which makes it difficult to integrate into vehicles. A popular solution is to store natural gas inside materials with nano-sized pores, and the search for such is often propelled through governmental targets. In a collaborative study, scientists have simulated over 650,000 designs for nanoporous materials, and propose that the best candidates have already been designed, meeting 70% of the US Department of Energy targets for energy storage and making additional research in this area redundant. The study is published in \nEnergy & Environmental Science\n.\nThe urgency to discover materials that can cost-effectively store methane from natural gas into cars is reflected in governmental targets such as those set by ARPA-e, an organization under the US Department of Energy. The organization wants to find a nanoporous material that can store methane with the same energy density of compressed natural gas, and do so at a lower pressure, applicable to car fuel tanks.\nA computer simulation study led by EPFL and the University of California at Berkeley now suggests the best materials have already been found, and can store a maximum of 220 units of methane, which amounts to 70% of the ARPA-e target. The scientists built structure models of 650,000 different materials on the computer and rapidly prototyped them for natural gas storage using molecular simulations. These included the materials that are currently intensely explored in the field.\nThe scientists used the building blocks of these materials and let computers generate novel materials systematically. The performance of these materials was predicted using advanced molecular simulation techniques that were specifically developed to run on processors used in computer games with heavy graphics.\nThe analysis showed that it may be difficult, if not impossible, to reach the ARPA-e target for natural gas storage using nanoporous materials. Specifically, the study suggests that those targets are unrealistically high, and it predicts that the best nanoporous materials can reach an energy density up to 70% of compressed natural gas. “Of course, an interesting question that this work raises is whether one can derive such a radical conclusion based on computer simulations alone,” says Berend Smit, one of the lead researchers and Director of EPFL’s Energy Center.\nThis means that research groups around the world have already found the best nanoporous materials for methane storage. “We feel that future experimental efforts to improve this target will be a waste of time since the ARPA-e target is impossible to reach,” says Smit. “Even if we find a material that is a few percent better, it will be nowhere close to the original target.”\nThe scientists hope that their findings will prevent what might be an unnecessary research effort. As Smit explains: “We always hope that someone will discover a novel chemistry method that can reach this target, but 70% is already a major step forward and may very well be also interesting from a commercial point of view.”\nThis work represents a collaboration between EPFL, the University of California at Berkeley, Rice University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.\nReference\nSimon C, Kim J, Gomez-Gualdron D, Camp J, Chung YG, Martin RL, Mercado R, Deem MW, Gunter D, Haranczyk M, Sholl D, Snurr RQ Smit B. \nT\nhe Materials Genome in Action: Identifying the Performance Limits for Methane Storage.\nEnergy Environ.

{"id": 907, "text": "For three weeks now, some 40 Swiss students have been in Colorado for the Solar Decathlon, an international competition organized every two years by the US Department of Energy. Universities from around the globe compete against each other to design and build a functional and innovative solar-powered house. It's a decathlon, so there are ten categories to compete in: architecture, market potential, engineering, communications, innovation, water, health and comfort, appliances, home life, and finally, energy. The team that earns the most points wins the competition. The first results will start coming in on 12 October, and the winner will be announced two days later.\nThe Swiss project, called NeighborHub, is a neighborhood house built by students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design, and the University of Fribourg. There are now just a few days left before this three-year-long adventure comes to an end, and the tension, fatigue and excitement building among the students near Denver Airport, where the competition is being held, is palpable.\n\"Who put away the bar for closing the facades? Can someone give the mechanical room a wipedown? Where are those gold flat-head screws? We need Benoît’s arms…and his raincoat! Has anyone seen my green shoes? Pizza party at 1pm @site or @hotel. Muddy day... AGAIN!\" Reading through the Swiss team's WhatsApp group messages shows just how difficult their mission is: they have to organize the on-site teams day and night, manage the ups and downs of extreme weather conditions, sort out meals, and buy urgent supplies on the other side of town. And those are just a few of their many tasks.\nThe competition's tight construction schedule leaves little room for error. So everything has to work like Swiss clockwork, even though the young students are not used to the vast open spaces of Colorado. In the event of a crisis, however, there are six experienced supervisors on hand, some of whom have been helping out since the start of the project and who have already been involved in other pioneering initiatives, such as the Alinghi sailing team and the Solar Impulse plane.\nRainy and cold\n Over the nine days the team had to build NeighborHub, they were on site every morning at 7 o’clock sharp. This Swiss punctuality, which drew the attention of the organizers, meant the team managed to finish building their house on time. Their Swiss precision was also on display when they assembled their solar house. Other teams arrived on site with a house in two or three parts. NeighborHub, however, crossed the Atlantic in a dozen containers, and the students had to rebuild this complex puzzle piece by piece, despite the heavy rain and biting cold. For the students, who on some days arrived back at their hotel rooms exhausted and covered from head to foot in mud, the construction phase was almost certainly one of the greatest challenges of this entire experience.\nOriginal and radical\n Once they finished building their house, the students got to check out the other ten projects. The engineering students, most of whom are from EPFL, went from house to house inspecting their competitors' mechanical rooms with curiosity, while the architecture students were more interested in aspects such as space, light and ambiance. By viewing the other projects, the Swiss Solar Decathletes realized just how original and radical their project is. Their ten competitors all put solar panels on the roof, while the Swiss team integrated photovoltaic and thermal solar panels into NeighborHub’s structure by installing them on the facade. This unique approach cannot go unnoticed: day and night, these shiny panels make NeighborHub stand out from the other houses. What's more, the Swiss project is an educational neighborhood center designed to provide information and advice on the environment – it is not an individual home, which is what the other teams opted for.\nAlready a victory\n And what do people think about NeighborHub? \"We weren't sure whether the American public would like our project, but the people who visited the house during the construction phase and the public viewings were really curious about and interested in our concept. We're very proud that NeighborHub has gotten such positive feedback,\" says Samuel Cotture, the Swiss team’s leader and recent EPFL graduate in mechanical engineering. Nobody dares speculate about who will win, because all the projects are unique (see box). But Cotture is unconcerned: \"Just being here in Denver and presenting the house we've been dreaming of for all these years to the Americans is a victory in itself.\" Simply taking part in Solar Decathlon was no mean feat: out of the 16 candidates, only 11 teams were able to get the backing and sponsors needed to make their project work.\nGuided tours\n A number of hurdles still await the Swiss team before the competition is over: they have to make sure the hot water and the household appliances are working to show that the house is functional, and they have to organize a games evening and drive the electrical car that goes with the house 45km every day. So the Swiss team’s WhatsApp group won’t be going quiet anytime soon.\nAs their final task, the students have to conduct guided tours for the general public every day up until the end of the competition on 15 October. People can also visit the exhibitions that have been organized on the theme of solar-powered houses. Through Solar Decathlon, the US Department of Energy seeks to demonstrate the potential of solar energy to its citizens and raise their awareness of sustainable living. NeighborHub has been a dream come true for around 250 Swiss students, who have in some way been involved in the adventure over the last three years. But will it be enough to win over the jury? We'll find out in just a few days.\nTen adversaries\n Survival, Sinatra, React, Rise, Enable, Silo, Beach, Selficient, Crete House, Our House. These are the names of the ten very different projects competing against NeighborHub. While some have focused on hurricane or earthquake resistance, others seek to demonstrate how to manage water during a drought. Their target users vary as well. Some offer a modular space suitable for a young couple, while others are designed as homes for retirees in Colorado or a family looking for a cheap place to live in a downtown area. The Swiss team is up against nine US projects and a Dutch one.", "summary": "The Swiss students who went to Denver to compete in this year’s Solar Decathlon are living out their dream.

{"id": 908, "text": "One indicator that a cancer has started to develop is the presence of biomarkers. These are molecules that are produced by the cancer and pass into the bloodstream.\nResearchers at EPFL's Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI/STI) have developed a new type of sensor that can detect tiny quantities of these markers and thus improve diagnostic accuracy. The sensor comes in the form of a tiny wire and is ten times more sensitive than any other biosensor ever realized. It is therefore capable of detecting cancer at a very early stage so that patients can receive better treatment. The researchers' work has been published in \nNano Letters\n.\nAn electrical component with a memory\n When doctors suspect that a patient has cancer, they look for biomarkers in their body. But it's not easy to detect these molecules in very small quantities – blood is a very dense fluid, full of molecules and cells that get in the way.\nEPFL researchers have managed to get around this obstacle by inventing a new detection technique. The trick is to trap the molecules of interest by the blood sample and then detect them in a dry environment, where measurements won’t be disturbed by all the molecules. To do this, the researchers used a Memristor – a new electrical component that can “remember” all the electrical currents that pass through it. The device has been successfully tested on the biomarker for prostate cancer, known as the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA).\nA nanowire, DNA fragments and an electric current\n To begin with, fragments of modified DNA are grafted onto a silicon nanowire. The DNA is used to trap the molecules. It is modified so that it traps only the biomarkers for prostate cancer.\nThe wire is dipped into a cancer sample for close to an hour, giving the DNA time to get hold of the molecules. It is then dried and an electric charge is first sent through it. If there are molecules on the wire, they create resistance, which alters the wire's conductivity in places. But this alone is not enough to accurately detect the biomarkers.\nIt is only when the same charge is sent through the wire a second time in the opposite direction that the molecules can be properly detected. \"If the wire had no memory, the two currents' curves would be superimposed, which means there's no memory effect,\" said Sandro Carrara, from the Integrated Systems Lab.\nIf the right biomarkers are trapped at the wire surface, then at the exact spot where the current reverse during the phases of sending charges into the wire, there will be a difference in the curve known as a voltage gap. It is this phenomenon that makes it possible to detect the biomarkers with so high sensitivity together with the use of modified DNA to trap the biomarkers.\n\"It's the first time a Memristor has been used to make such type of biosensor,\" said Carrara.\nFor now, the technique has only been used to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer. But it could be used for all types of markers. \"We are also working with the Ludwig Institute and the CHUV hospital, which are providing us with samples and tumor extracts. Our next step is to use the same technique to detect breast cancer.\"\n-----\nProject partners:\nExperimental Oncology Group, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (Lausanne)\n Senology Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, CHUV hospital (Lausanne)\n Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Bath (United Kingdom)\n Department of Informatics and Microsystem Technology, University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern, Zweibrücken (Germany)\nReference:", "summary": "EPFL researchers have used a nanowire to detect prostate cancer with greater accuracy than ever before.

{"id": 909, "text": "Have you ever gone ahead and eaten that piece of chocolate, despite yourself?\nDo you inadvertently make decisions because you are hungry or cold? In other words, does the brain’s processing of internal bodily signals interfere with your ability to act freely?\nThis line of thinking is at the heart of research that questions our ability to act on thoughts of free will. We already know that inner body signals, like the heartbeat, affect our mental states, can be used to reduce the perception of pain and are of fundamental importance for .\nThanks to a new discovery, it turns out that these inner body signals do indeed affect acts of volition.\nScientists at EPFL in Switzerland have shown that you are more likely to initiate a voluntary decision as you exhale. Published in today’s issue of Nature Communications, these findings propose a new angle on an almost 60-year-old neuroscientific debate about free will and the involvement of the human brain.\n“We show that voluntary action is indeed linked to your body’s inner state, especially with breathing and expiration but not with some other bodily signals, such as the heartbeat,” explains Olaf Blanke, EPFL’s Foundation Bertarelli Chair in Cognitive Neuroprosthetics and senior author.\nAt the center of these results is the readiness potential (RP), a signal of brain activity observed in the human cortex that appears not only before voluntary muscle movement, but also before one becomes aware of the intention to move. The RP is the signature of voluntary action since it consistently appears in brain activity measurements right before acts of free will (like being aware that one wants to reach for the chocolate).\nInterpretations of the RP have been debated for decades. Some interpret the RP to show that free will is an illusion, since the RP precedes the conscious experience of free will. It seems to show that the brain commits to a decision (chocolate) before we are even consciously aware of having made that decision. [See box The readiness potential and interpretations.] \nThe readiness potential and interpretations\nPhilosophers, psychologists, and more recently neuroscientists have long debated our ability to act freely. The meaning of the readiness potential (RP) has been questioned ever since its discovery by neuroscientists Hans Helmut Kornhuber and Lüder Deecke in 1965, and later regarding its relation to free will in neuroscientist Benjamin Libet’s experiments. \nThe entire brain consists of approximately 100 billion neurons, and each individual neuron transmits electrical signals as the brain works. Electrodes placed on the head can measure the collective electrical activity of the brain’s neurons, seen as wavy lines called an electroencephalogram (EEG).\nIn 1965, neuroscientists Hans Helmut Kornhuber and Lüder Deecke conducted a seminal experiment to test voluntary action and discovered a recurring pattern of brain activity. They placed EEG electrodes on top of the subject’s head, and asked the subject to press a button at will. Kornhuber and Deecke discovered that the EEG consistently exhibited a rising slope of wavy lines, the readiness potential, 1 second or more before voluntary movement.\nIn the early 1980s, neuroscientist Benjamin Libet further tested the relationship between the RP and conscious awareness or intention of voluntary action. His highly influential results showed that approximately 200ms before his subjects pressed the button, they were aware of an urge or the intention to act, something Libet referred to as the W time, and yet the RP consistently preceded W time.\nLibet suggested that these findings showed that even before we make a conscious decision of voluntary action, the brain was already unconsciously activated and involved in planning the action.\nSome have interpreted the relation between the RP and W time as an indication that human free will might be an illusion. The RP is viewed as the brain committing to a decision (to press the button) before the subject is even aware of having made that decision. If commitment to a decision is being made before we are even aware of it, then what mechanism is making the decision for us?\nFor the neuroscientist who considers consciousness to arise from brain activity (versus brain activity arising from consciousness), Libet’s results may not surprising, since the conscious experience of free will is viewed as an emergent phenomenon of brain activity.\nYet, Libet’s results are in conflict with the notion of free will and voluntary action in philosophy of the mind, in folk psychology, in culture, and in legal matters.\nMore recently, it was suggested that the RP could be an artefact of measurement, potentially putting free will back into our command. But if we take on the view that our conscious decisions arise from a cascade of firing neurons, then the origin of the RP may actually provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to voluntary action and free will. The way the brain’s neurons work together to come to a decision is still poorly understood. [See  unveiled by higher dimensional algebraic topology.] Our conscious experience of free will, our ability to make decisions freely, may then be intricately wired to the rest of our body. [See box Acts of free will and inner states of the body]\nThe EPFL results suggest that the origin of the RP is linked to breathing, providing a new perspective on experiences of free will: the regular cycle of breathing is part of the mechanism that leads to conscious decision-making and acts of free will. Moreover, we are more likely to initiate voluntary movements as we exhale. (Did you reach for that piece of chocolate during an exhale?)\nActs of free will and inner states of the body\nThe prevailing view in neuroscience is that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon of the brain. Firing of the brain’s neurons leads to consciousness and the feeling of free will or voluntary action. By belonging to the physical universe, the brain’s electrical activity within the constraints of anatomy, is subject to the laws of physics. In this sense, brain signals encoding the body, lungs and heart might naturally affect the brain’s cognitive states too and therefore influence acts of free will.\nTo test whether the RP depends on the body’s inner state and the brain’s representation thereof, Blanke and colleagues asked 52 subjects to press a button at will at Campus Biotech in Geneva. EEGs monitored brain activity, a belt around the chest measured breathing activity and cardiac activity was recorded. \nThe scientists found that the RP and voluntary action (pressing the button) is linked to the body’s inner state – the regular breathing cycle – but not to the heartbeat. Participants initiated voluntary movements more frequently during an exhale than an inhale and were completely unaware of this breathing-action coupling. The RP was also modulated depending on the breathing cycle.\nEPFL scientist and first author of the study Hyeong-Dong Park explains, “The RP no longer corresponds only to cortical activity ‘unconsciously preparing’ voluntary action. The RP, at least partly, reflects respiration-related cortical processing that is coupled to voluntary action. More generally, it further suggests that higher-level motor control, such as voluntary action, is shaped or affected by the involuntary and cyclic motor act of our internal body organs, in particular the lungs. Still the precise neural activity that controls breathing remains to be mapped.”\nThese findings suggest that the breathing pattern may be used to predict ‘when’ people begin voluntary action. Your breathing patterns could also be used to predict consumer behavior, like when you click on that button. Medical devices that use brain-computer interfaces could be tuned and improved according to breathing. The breathing-action coupling could be used in research and diagnostic tools for patients with deficits in voluntary action control, like obsessive compulsive disorders, Parkinson disease, and Tourette syndromes. Blanke and Hyeong-Dong Park, first author of this research, have filed a patent based on these findings.\nFree will hijacked by interoceptive signals?\nMore generally, the EPFL findings suggest that acts of free will are affected by signals from other systems of the body. Succumbing to that urge to eat chocolate may depend more on your body’s internal signals than you may realize!\nBlanke elaborates, “That voluntary action, an internally or self-generated action, is coupled with an interoceptive signal, breathing, may be just one example of how acts of free will are hostage to a host of inner body states and the brain’s processing of these internal signals. Interestingly, such signals have also been shown to be of relevance for self-consciousness.”\nYou may be tempted to blame acts of chocolate binging on interoceptive electrical signals hijacking your free will. The gut-mind connection is an active field of research and interoceptive messages sent to the brain certainly impact food cravings. For now, this latest EPFL research only improves predictions of when you will indulge in that craving, and not what you actually crave.", "summary": "Is free will just an illusion?

{"id": 913, "text": "COVID-19 sometimes causes blood clots, although the exact incidence remains a mystery.  indicates that around 10% of hospitalized patients develop this complication. Doctors still aren’t sure why the virus provokes this reaction – in the most severe cases, the blood clots can lead to a stroke. To get more insight into this phenomenon, EPFL scientists have developed a microfluidic chip that models the human lung and replicates part of its structure to study COVID-19 infections The chip can hold lung epithelial cells, blood-vessel cells and immune-system cells, and lets scientists directly watch how SARS-CoV-2 attacks human cells and triggers the formation of blood clots.\nTwo mechanisms are suspected to be at work. One is an excess production of cytokines, which are proteins that play a role in immune-cell signaling. Coronavirus can cause the “cytokine storms,” which have been much discussed in the news. These disproportionate immune system reactions can damage blood vessels and cause blood clots to form, and are potentially fatal. The other possible mechanism is damage to the interior lining of blood vessels – or the endothelium – in the lungs. The lungs have a lot of this kind of tissue, and when it’s damaged, blood can coagulate easily and form clots.\nSo which mechanism is the likely culprit? To find out, doctors need to be able to watch how the infection progresses in the lungs hour by hour. That’s nearly impossible in living patients and not very feasible in lab cultures either, since cultures usually contain just one kind of cell and don’t provide a realistic enough representation of the entire lung system.\nScientistshave received the support from the EPFL COVID-19 Task Force. Led by a postdoc in the lab, they have now taken a lung-on-a-chip device and adapted it to model the individual steps in a SARS-CoV-2 attack on the lungs. The device contains microfluidic channels that feed nutrients to cells on the chip, which are arranged to recreate a section of the lungs. More specifically, the chip contains a layer of epithelial cells, or the cells coating the lungs, along with a layer of endothelial cells, or the cells lining the blood vessels. The two layers are separated by a membrane.\nAfter the scientists introduced SARS-CoV-2 into their device, the virus first attacked the outside layer of epithelial cells, just like in a natural infection. Working with Dr Jessica Sordet Dessimoz and her team in the Histology Core Facility, they found that within a day the virus had reached the inner layer of endothelial cells and caused considerable damage over subsequent days.\n“There was enough damage to destroy the endothelium and expose blood in the vessels to air, causing clots to form,” says Vivek Thacker. “With our lung-on-a-chip system, we found that the virus may be causing blood clots by attacking the endothelium directly. However, that doesn’t mean that cytokines don’t play a role too and make things worse.” These initial findings have been written up in .\nThe EPFL device has revealed a phenomenon that can’t be observed using conventional methods, since SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t proliferate well in endothelial cell monocultures. “Some virus particles have also been found in the endothelium of infected patients, but the amounts are very small,” says Thacker.\nThe team will next use their lung-on-a-chip with actual blood samples so that they can observe clot formation directly. And that’s not as easy as it sounds – blood coagulates very quickly outside the body, so “we’ll have to be fast and accurate,” explains Thacker. They plan to add an anticoagulant to the samples and then neutralize it just before injecting the samples into the device. The team will work on this complicated procedure in the next few weeks.", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL are using technology to better understand how coronavirus causes blood clots in some patients.

{"id": 915, "text": "Coral reefs are the jungles of the oceans, home to some of the planet’s most fertile fishing grounds, and hotspots of global tourism. Their survival depends on an intricate relationship with tiny coral-dwelling algae. The relationship is a fragile one, as the algae are all too easily driven away by changes in water temperature and pollution. Scientists are only now beginning to understand this symbiosis at a molecular level. Publishing in the journal mBio, researchers from EPFL, the University of Lausanne, as well as the Museum of Natural History and the Tropical Aquarium in Paris present new discoveries on how nutrients are harvested and shuttled between algae and corals.\nCharles Darwin was the first to describe what has since become known as the Darwinian Paradox: coral reef ecosystems flourish in water that is almost devoid of nutrients. Today we know that this would be impossible without tiny coral-dwelling photosynthetic algae that use sunlight to produce the nutrients needed to support their coral hosts. The corals return the favor by sheltering the algae and providing them with other nutrients.\n“In this study, we are looking at the real cellular engine behind coral reefs: the algae’s capability to photosynthetically extract carbon from the surrounding water and store it as sugar and fat,” says principle investigator Anders Meibom. For the first time, Christophe Kopp, a researcher in Meibom’s Laboratory for Biological Geochemistry, was able to visualize at the cell level how the algae produce and store sugars and fats using photosynthesis, before being shuttling them to their coral hosts.\nKopp found that, when exposed to sunlight, it only took minutes for the micro-algae to use photosynthesis to convert bicarbonate present in the surrounding seawater to sugar, then to fat. These fats, which are passed on to the corals within 2-3 hours, can be seen within the coral tissue as small lipid droplets, from which the corals can draw energy for many of their physiological processes.\nHe also discovered a second form of carbon storage, in the form of granules composed of glycogen. While the lipid droplets were found throughout the coral tissue, the glycogen, a readily available source of energy, was found predominantly in the coral’s outer tissue, where little hair-like structures, cilia, swirl up the water that is in direct contact with the corals to promote the exchange of nutrients.\nBy studying samples of corals grown at the Tropical Aquarium in Paris, Kopp was able to observe firsthand the flow of nutrients from the surrounding water first into the algae, and then into their coral hosts. He did so using a combination of two imaging techniques, one with a nanometer spatial resolution (TEM), and the other with the capability of detecting the presence of minute concentrations of atomic markers (nanoSIMS).\nThese findings are important to understand the impact of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems. Coral bleaching is caused by the mass exodus of micro-algae from their coral hosts in response to environmental stresses such as changes in temperature and acidity. Left to themselves, the corals are unable to generate enough nutrients and eventually die off. In future studies, the researchers will use their imaging techniques to study the impact of such environmental changes the microalgae and their coral hosts.", "summary": "Powering coral reefs: Scientists have revealed how coral-dwelling microalgae harvest nutrients from the surrounding seawater and shuttle them out to their coral hosts, sustaining a fragile ecosystem that is under threat.", "claim": "Powering coral reefs: Scientists have revealed how coral-dwelling microalgae harvest nutrients from the surrounding seawater and shuttle me out to their coral hosts, sustaining a fragile ecosystem that is under threat.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [20, 20], "noise": false}
{"id": 917, "text": "40,000,000,000,000,000 neutrinos pass through the human body every second. They are so small that they almost never interact with the matter around us. And yet, being able to detect them would give us extremely valuable information about the universe and the objects it is made of. Consequently, the international scientific community decided to build IceCube, the Antarctica observatory with the goal of improving the observation of neutrinos.\nEPFL’s Laboratory for High Energy Physics (LPHE), and in particular astroparticle physicists, took part in this fascinating adventure, with the construction work being completed on December 18, 2010. Located at the pole of the earth, this innovative detector is dedicated to the study of the fundamental properties of particles, whose origin describes the most spectacular phenomena of the universe, such as supernovae or gamma-ray bursts.\n“In the last five years, during the short austral summer season, 86 bore holes of a depth of 2500m were drilled and equipped with 5000 optical detection modules. These modules are the “eyes” of the IceCube detector, which observes one cubic kilometer of ice near the geographic South Pole”, explains Mathieu Ribordy, professor at the LPHE.\nIceCube uses the Cerenkov effect, the equivalent of the supersonic bang for light. The latter moves at a speed of about 300,000 km/s in space, but slower in material media. As a result, along the trajectory of charged particles, which travel faster than light in the material media, a luminous bluish flash is emitted. This flash is visible by detectors within a one-hundred meter range in the very pure ice of the South Pole. This is how we are able to materialize the passage of a charged particle after interaction with a neutrino. The ice in the depths of Antarctica presents the advantage of being transparent and exceptionally clean, as well as having low radioactivity, which enables us to avoid certain types of interference during observation. It is therefore the ideal candidate for a neutrino observatory.\n“Even if the number of neutrinos which reach the earth is prodigious, those which interact with the ice and cause a Cerenkov effect are rare. In order to put all the odds in our favor, we have built a huge detector measuring one cubic kilometer; that is one billion tons of ice. And in spite of this gigantic size, we still only observe 300 flashes a day. Yet it’s a record!”, adds Mathieu Ribordy.\nWith a detector as sensitive as IceCube, scientists at last hope to observe neutrinos from sources located beyond the sun, and thus better understand the universe surrounding us. It will be mainly a question of determining the nature of dark matter and to at last understand the origin of cosmic rays.\nLink:", "summary": "Ten years will have been required to set up the world’s largest neutrino observatory.

{"id": 921, "text": "An important step toward creating artificial living material has been made by EPFL researchers. They are working on a technique that should eventually allow them to “print” living constructs resembling human tissues in which cells can develop and interact in a coordinated and physiological manner. Their research results have recently been published in the scientific journal \nAdvanced Materials\n.\n“We have not yet created tissue, strictly speaking,” explains Professor Jürgen Brugger, head of EPFL’s Microsystems 1 Laboratory. “At this stage, we have essentially studied a way in which to structure biological materials in three dimensions; this research will improve cell culture and then will eventually be used as a base for creating tissues.”\nSomeday this new technology, which is the fruit of joint research between EPFL’s Engineering School (STI) and School of Life Sciences (SV), will make it possible to print tissues one drop at a time. Progress made in several different areas has combined to bring the technology to this point.\nFirst, printing involves ink, a raw material that’s challenging to design, explains Professor Matthias Lutolf, head of EPFL’s Stem Cell Engineering Laboratory. “Mixing the right ingredients isn’t sufficient. The cells grow in a haphazard manner, randomly, and won’t develop into viable tissue.”\nA more malleable material\nTo make up a coherent whole, the cells need an environment that provides the right kinds of signals that induce very specific behavior in each of the cells – proliferation, migration, differentiation or death. In natural tissues, these signals come from molecules that make up a complex extracellular matrix (ECM). By studying the connections and communications taking place between cells and between cells and ECM molecules, the scientists were able to reconstruct this matrix and thus create a new kind of biological ink.\nOn a technical level, the researchers from EPFL’s two Microsystems Laboratories – under the leadership of professors Jürgen Brugger and Philippe Renaud – focused on developing a gel that could be used as a base from which the tissue could be constructed, as well as a strategy for printing droplets. Thanks to the gel, made up of concentrated calcium, and the printing sequence they came up with, each droplet of ink landing on the surface sticks to it and keeps its initial shape instead of spreading out.\n“The various tissue elements don’t blend together uncontrollably,” explains Brugger. “Above all, the material polymerizes more quickly and becomes flexible and malleable, which allows us to assemble several layers and to envision building channels, which are indispensable for fluid perfusion, nutrient input and waste elimination.”\nTesting new drugs\n“Thanks to the combination of these technical and biological advances, we are working towards the growth of a tissue in which the cells develop and live happily,” Lutolf explains.\nEven though it will still be quite some time before tissue can be constructed, this technology could lead to very promising applications on the medium term. “ An exiting avenue would be to develop 3D constructs that function like human tissues and could be used as models for testing new drugs,” says Lutolf. “This is not only very interesting in a biological sense, but could also reduce the need for animal testing.”", "summary": "EPFL scientists are working on creating artificial living tissues using a very special kind of inkjet printer.

The finished product is fitted with a custom-designed ultra-flat motor developed in partnership with Maxon, a major company located in EPFL’s Innovation Park. The new drone is being presented today, online, at Xponential, the world's largest trade show for unmanned and autonomous systems. Flybotix is planning a market launch in early 2021.\nTwenty minutes’ flying time and flat motors\nCurrently, drones that are small enough to maneuver in tight spaces like ducts can stay airborne only for about ten minutes. To save energy and extend flight time, Flybotix’s drone has been fitted with a propulsion system that is similar to the one used on helicopters, which have unparalleled aerodynamic performance. Because the bulky mechanical stabilization system is replaced with algorithms, the flight time is twice as long.\nEngineers had to redesign the motor’s shape in order to superimpose the twin propellers and free up space for payloads. EPFL's Innovation Park is home to more than 200 start-ups as well as many branches of large companies, putting them in close proximity to EPFL’s fast-paced and flourishing innovation community. A partnership with one of the large companies, Maxon, whose parent company is based in Obwalden, produced the customized motor. “The stationary portion of the gear system has been inverted. This enabled us to flatten it, leaving more space between the propellers,” says Olivier Chappuis, head of miLab, Maxon’s innovation lab at EPFL. Combining Maxon's expertise in motors with Flybotix’s creative energy led to the rapid development of the advanced propulsion system. “We get a great deal out of working with start-ups. They need new systems developed in record time, which spurs us to innovate more quickly. And our findings can be used in other applications too,” says Chappuis.\nLike a turtle flipped on its back\nThe new drone includes a number of other innovations, such as a patented cage system that allows it to navigate through obstacles and right itself when upside down. This system – inspired by turtles – triggers a pendulum movement; the inverted drone rocks back and forth for a few seconds until the swinging movement returns it to an upright position.\nDespite the pandemic, 2020 was a productive year for Flybotix. The firm raised CHF 1.5 million in investments, enabling it to expand its headcount from four to ten people. Its drone is now ready for commercial production and will be assembled in Switzerland. One of the first applications will be monitoring hazardous sites or inaccessible locations. Other start-ups in the region are also developing drones with similar applications and characteristics. “We are aware of them, they represent a model of success for Swiss startups,\" says Samir Bouabdallah, CEO of Flybotix.

{"id": 925, "text": "The future is looking good for drugs designed to combat Alzheimer’s disease. EPFL scientists have unveiled how two classes of drug compounds currently in clinical trials work to fight the disease. Their research suggests that these compounds target the disease-causing peptides with high precision and with minimal side-effects. At the same time, the scientists offer a molecular explanation for early-onset hereditary forms of Alzheimer’s, which can strike as early as thirty years of age. The conclusions of their research, which has been published in the journal Nature Communications, are very encouraging regarding the future of therapeutic means that could keep Alzheimer’s disease in check.\n Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by an aggregation of small biological molecules known as amyloid peptides. We all produce these molecules; they play an essential antioxidant role. But in people with Alzheimer’s disease, these peptides aggregate in the brain into toxic plaques – called “amyloid plaques” – that destroy the surrounding neurons. \n The process starts with a long protein, “APP”, which is located across the neuron’s membrane. This protein is cut into several pieces by an enzyme, much like a ribbon is cut by scissors. The initial cut generates a smaller intracellular protein that plays a useful role in the neuron. Another cut releases the rest of APP outside the cell – this part is the amyloid peptide. \n For reasons not yet well understood, APP protein can be cut in several different places, producing amyloid peptides that are of varying lengths. Only the longer forms of the amyloid peptide carry the risk of aggregating into plaques, and people with Alzheimer’s disease produce an abnormally high number of these.\nA favorite Alzheimer’s target: gamma secretase\nThe two next-generation classes of compound that are currently in clinical trials target an enzyme that cuts APP, known as gamma secretase. Until now, our understanding of the mechanism involved has been lacking. But with this work, the EPFL researchers were able to shed some more light on it by determining how the drug compounds affect gamma secretase and its cutting activity. \n In most forms of Alzheimer’s, abnormally large quantities of the long amyloid peptide 42 – named like that because it contains 42 amino acids – are formed. The drug compounds change the location where gamma secretase cuts the APP protein, thus producing amyloid peptide 38 instead of 42, which is shorter and does not aggregate into neurotoxic plaques. \n Compared to previous therapeutic efforts, this is considerable progress. In 2010, Phase III clinical trials had to be abandoned, because the compound being tested inhibited gamma-secretase’s function across the board, meaning that the enzyme was also deactivated in essential cellular differentiation processes, resulting to side-effects like in gastrointestinal bleeding and skin cancer. \n “Scientists have been trying to target gamma secretase to treat Alzheimer’s for over a decade,” explains Patrick Fraering, senior author on the study and Merck Serono Chair of Neurosciences at EPFL. “Our work suggests that next-generation molecules, by modulating rather than inhibiting the enzyme, could have few, if any, side-effects. It is tremendously encouraging.”\nNew insights into hereditary forms of the disease\nDuring their investigation, the scientists also identified possible causes behind some hereditary forms of Alzheimer’s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer’s can appear as early as thirty years of age, with a life expectancy of only a few years. In vitro experiments and numerical simulations show that in early-onset patients, mutations in the APP protein gene modify the way by which APP is cut by the gamma-secretase enzyme. This results in overproduction of amyloid peptide 42, which then aggregates into amyloid plaques. \n This research illuminates much that is unknown about Alzheimer’s disease. “We have obtained extraordinary knowledge about how gamma secretase can be modulated,” explains co-author Dirk Beher, scientific chief officer of Asceneuron, a spin-off of Merck Serono, the biopharmaceutical division of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. “This knowledge will be invaluable for developing even better targeted drugs to fight the disease.”", "summary": "Next-generation drugs designed to fight Alzheimer’s disease look very promising.

{"id": 926, "text": "It’s a whole new way of thinking about sensors. The tiny fibers developed at EPFL are made of elastomer and can incorporate materials like electrodes and nanocomposite polymers. The fibers can detect even the slightest pressure and strain and can withstand deformation of close to 500% before recovering their initial shape. All that makes them perfect for applications in smart clothing and prostheses, and for creating artificial nerves for robots.\nThe fibers were developed at EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonic Materials and Fiber Devices (FIMAP), headed by Fabien Sorin at the School of Engineering. The scientists came up with a fast and easy method for embedding different kinds of microstructures in super-elastic fibers. For instance, by adding electrodes at strategic locations, they turned the fibers into ultra-sensitive sensors. What’s more, their method can be used to produce hundreds of meters of fiber in a short amount of time. Their research has just been published in \nAdvanced Materials.\nHeat, then stretch\n To make their fibers, the scientists used a thermal drawing process, which is the standard process for optical-fiber manufacturing. They started by creating a macroscopic preform with the various fiber components arranged in a carefully designed 3D pattern. They then heated the preform and stretched it out, like melted plastic, to make fibers of a few hundreds microns in diameter. And while this process stretched out the pattern of components lengthwise, it also contracted it crosswise, meaning the components’ relative positions stayed the same. The end result was a set of fibers with an extremely complicated microarchitecture and advanced properties.\nUntil now, thermal drawing could be used to make only rigid fibers. But Sorin and his team used it to make elastic fibers. With the help of a new criterion for selecting materials, they were able to identify some thermoplastic elastomers that have a high viscosity when heated. After the fibers are drawn, they can be stretched and deformed but they always return to their original shape.\nRigid materials like nanocomposite polymers, metals and thermoplastics can be introduced into the fibers, as well as liquid metals that can be easily deformed. “For instance, we can add three strings of electrodes at the top of the fibers and one at the bottom. Different electrodes will come into contact depending on how the pressure is applied to the fibers. This will cause the electrodes to transmit a signal, which can then be read to determine exactly what type of stress the fiber is exposed to – such as compression or shear stress, for example,” says Sorin.\nArtificial nerves for robots\nWorking in association with Professor Dr. Oliver Brock (Robotics and Biology Laboratory, Technical University of Berlin), the scientists integrated their fibers into robotic fingers as artificial nerves. Whenever the fingers touch something, electrodes in the fibers transmit information about the robot’s tactile interaction with its environment. The research team also tested adding their fibers to large-mesh clothing to detect compression and stretching. “Our technology could be used to develop a touch keyboard that’s integrated directly into clothing, for instance” says Sorin.\nThe researchers see many other potential applications. Especially since the thermal drawing process can be easily tweaked for large-scale production. This is a real plus for the manufacturing sector. The textile sector has already expressed interest in the new technology, and patents have been filed.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have found a fast and simple way to make super-elastic, multi-material, high-performance fibers.

{"id": 928, "text": "Why don’t our arms grow from the middle of our bodies? The question isn’t as trivial as it appears. Vertebrae, limbs, ribs, tailbone ... in only two days, all these elements take their place in the embryo, in the right spot and with the precision of a Swiss watch. Intrigued by the extraordinary reliability of this mechanism, biologists have long wondered how it works. Now, researchers at EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) and the University of Geneva (Unige) have solved the mystery. Their discovery will be published October 13, 2011 in the journal Science. \nThe embryo is built one layer at a time \n During the development of an embryo, everything happens at a specific moment. In about 48 hours, it will grow from the top to the bottom, one slice at a time – scientists call this the embryo’s segmentation. “We’re made up of thirty-odd horizontal slices,” explains Denis Duboule, a professor at EPFL and Unige. “These slices correspond more or less to the number of vertebrae we have.” \n Every hour and a half, a new segment is built. The genes corresponding to the cervical vertebrae, the thoracic vertebrae, the lumbar vertebrae and the tailbone become activated at exactly the right moment one after another. “If the timing is not followed to the letter, you’ll end up with ribs coming off your lumbar vertebrae,” jokes Duboule. How do the genes know how to launch themselves into action in such a perfectly synchronized manner? “We assumed that the DNA played the role of a kind of clock. But we didn’t understand how.”\nWhen DNA acts like a mechanical clock\n Very specific genes, known as “Hox,” are involved in this process. Responsible for the formation of limbs and the spinal column, they have a remarkable characteristic. “Hox genes are situated one exactly after the other on the DNA strand, in four groups. First the neck, then the thorax, then the lumbar, and so on,” explains Duboule. “This unique arrangement inevitably had to play a role.”\n The process is astonishingly simple. In the embryo’s first moments, the Hox genes are dormant, packaged like a spool of wound yarn on the DNA. When the time is right, the strand begins to unwind. When the embryo begins to form the upper levels, the genes encoding the formation of cervical vertebrae come off the spool and become activated. Then it is the thoracic vertebrae’s turn, and so on down to the tailbone. The DNA strand acts a bit like an old-fashioned computer punchcard, delivering specific instructions as it progressively goes through the machine. \n “A new gene comes out of the spool every ninety minutes, which corresponds to the time needed for a new layer of the embryo to be built,” explains Duboule. “It takes two days for the strand to completely unwind; this is the same time that’s needed for all the layers of the embryo to be completed.” This system is the first “mechanical” clock ever discovered in genetics. And it explains why the system is so remarkably precise.\n This discovery is the result of many years of work. Under the direction of Duboule and Daniël Noordermeer, the team analyzed thousands of Hox gene spools. With assistance from the Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics, the scientists were able to compile huge quantities of data and model the structure of the spool and how it unwinds over time. \nThe snake: a veritable vertebral assembly line\n The process discovered at EPFL is shared by numerous living beings, from humans to some kinds of worms, from blue whales to insects. The structure of all these animals – the distribution of their vertebrae, limbs and other appendices along their bodies – is programmed like a sheet of player-piano music by the sequence of Hox genes along the DNA strand. \n The sinuous body of the snake is a perfect illustration. A few years ago, Duboule discovered in these animals a defect in the Hox gene that normally stops the vertebrae-making process. “Now we know what’s happening. The process doesn’t stop, and the snake embryo just keeps on making vertebrae, all identical, until the process just runs out of steam.” \n The Hox clock is a demonstration of the extraordinary complexity of evolution. One notable property of the mechanism is its extreme stability, explains Duboule. “Circadian or menstrual clocks involve complex chemistry. They can thus adapt to changing contexts, but in a general sense are fairly imprecise. The mechanism that we have discovered must be infinitely more stable and precise. Even the smallest change would end up leading to the emergence of a new species.”\n ---\nThis research is carried out within the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Frontiers in Genetics.

{"id": 934, "text": "Neurons, the cells of the nervous system, communicate by transmitting chemical signals to each other through junctions called synapses. This “synaptic transmission” is critical for the brain and the spinal cord to quickly process the huge amount of incoming stimuli and generate outgoing signals. However, studying synaptic transmission in living animals is very difficult, and researchers have to use artificial conditions that don’t capture the real-life environment of neurons. Now, EPFL scientists have observed and measured synaptic transmission in a live animal for the first time, using a new approach that combines genetics with the physics of light. Their breakthrough work is published in \nNeuron\n.\nAurélie Pala and Carl Petersen at EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute used a novel technique, “optogenetics”, that has been making significant inroads in the field of neuroscience in the past ten years. This method uses light to precisely control the activity of specific neurons in living, even moving, animals in real time. Such precision is critical in being able to study the hundreds of different neuron types, and understand higher brain functions such as thought, behavior, language, memory – or even mental disorders.\nActivating neurons with light\nOptogenetics works by inserting the gene of a light-sensitive protein into live neurons, from a single cell to an entire family of them. The genetically modified neurons then produce the light-sensitive protein, which sits on their outside, the membrane. There, it acts as an electrical channel – something like a gate. When light is shone on the neuron, the channel opens up and allows electrical ions to flow into the cell – a bit like a battery being charged by a solar cell.\nThe addition of electrical ions changes the voltage balance of the neuron, and if the optogenetic stimulus is sufficiently strong it generates an explosive electrical signal in the neuron. And that is the impact of optogenetics: controlling neuronal activity by switching a light on and off.\nRecording neuronal transmissions\nPala used optogenetics to stimulate single neurons of anesthetized mice and see if this approach could be used to record synaptic transmissions. The neurons she targeted were located in a part of the mouse’s brain called the barrel cortex, which processes sensory information from the mouse’s whiskers.\nWhen Pala shone blue light on the neurons that contained the light-sensitive protein, the neurons activated and fired signals. At the same time, she measured electrical signals in neighboring neurons using microelectrodes that can record small voltage changes across a neuron’s membrane.\nUsing these approaches, the researchers looked at how the light-sensitive neurons connected to some of their neighbors: small, connector neurons called “interneurons”. In the brain, interneurons are usually inhibitory: when they receive a signal, they make the next neuron down the line less likely to continue the transmission.\nThe researchers recorded and analyzed synaptic transmissions from light-sensitive neurons to interneurons. In addition, they used an advanced imaging technique (two-photon microscopy) that allowed them to look deep into the brain of the live mouse and identify the type of each interneuron they were studying. The data showed that the neuronal transmissions from the light-sensitive neurons differed depending on the type of interneuron on the receiving end.\n“This is a proof-of-concept study,” says Aurélie Pala, who received her PhD for this work. “Nonetheless, we think that we can use optogenetics to put together a larger picture of connectivity between other types of neurons in other areas of the brain.”\nThe scientists are now aiming to explore other neuronal connections in the mouse barrel cortex. They also want to try this technique on awake mice, to see how switching neuronal activity on and off with a light can affect higher brain functions.\nReference\nPala A, Petersen CCH. \nIn Vivo Measurement of Cell-Type-Specific Synaptic Connectivity and Synaptic Transmission in Layer 2/3 Mouse Barrel Cortex.\nNeuron\n (2015) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.11.025", "summary": "EPFL scientists have used a cutting-edge method to stimulate neurons with light.

This third funding round brings its tally of outside investments to nearly 100 million dollars. While US investors dominated the first two rounds of funding, three Swiss groups joined this third round: Swisscom Ventures, Forestay Capital and Fayerweather Capital Partners. The startup focuses on one of the major challenges faced by the electronics industry: high-speed, low-power connectivity inside and between devices. Its advances have already led to the revision of several industry standards.\nMore than 300 patents in its arsenal\nThe company, which was created in 2011, develops IT components that improve the speed and reliability of communications between electronic devices while keeping their energy consumption to a minimum. So far it has marketed its systems through licenses but is now planning to draw on its portfolio of some 300 patents to launch a series of products for consumer applications.\nThis latest round of fundraising was crucial. It will allow the company to market an important component for the development of USB-C plugs that are compatible with the new USB4 specification. That specification was published on 3 September at the USB Implementers Forum, a group of companies – including multinationals Microsoft, Intel, IBM and HP – that is in charge of keeping specifications such as this one up to date. Under the USB4 specification, data transfer capacity will double, meaning that USB-C plugs will be able to handle two \n4K UHD resolution screens with a 60 Hz refresh rate, charge laptop batteries quickly and improve video processing significantly.\n “This market is huge,” says Amin Shokrollahi, Kandou’s founder and CEO. He is not exaggerating: the new plugs, which will be compatible with previous USB versions, will be everywhere, including laptops, external hard drives, screens and video game consoles.\n“In laboratory tests, our initial prototypes designed for USB-C plugs proved to be extremely fast while consuming very little power,” notes Shokrollahi, who is also a professor at EPFL. Kandou’s product could hit the market as early as summer 2020. This is excellent timing for the company, since new and revised standards can take several years to implement.\nUpping the ante in the microelectronics industry\nThe work done by Shokrollahi, who specializes in information and signal theory, and Harm Cronie, a former postdoc, led to the invention of Chord™ signaling.

{"id": 942, "text": "Remember the 2003 heat wave? According to the standard weather models, it was impossible. Mathematicians from EPFL’s Chair of Statistics, however, say that there was a five in ten thousand chance for the event to occur. That’s a pretty slight chance, but not completely negligible. To reach this result, they developed a model that specifically deals with extreme weather events. Thanks to this tool, which takes into account various parameters such as climate change, the researchers are already able to more precisely predict the risk of extreme phenomena for the upcoming decades.\nWeather stations and probability\n“The problem of extremes is that there are so few events, by definition,” explains EPFL mathematician Anthony Davison. “It’s thus necessary to create specific models that are different from those that use innumerable mean values.” The researchers used MeteoSuisse data to simulate a thousand summers, using probabilities and their model of extremes. They were able to determine the risk of elevated temperatures for a given period. To arrive at conclusive results, their model groups weather stations into pairs so their measurements can be correlated.\nCombining the stations into pairs for the simulation requires a huge number of calculations. The number of combinatorial operations can quickly escalate. “For example, to simulate heavy rainfall, we were limited to ten weather stations, which already represented several days’ worth of calculations on a high-speed computer network,” Davison explains. In spite of this, the research is already leading to extreme events analyses that are more realistic than those arrived at using traditional models.\nSix times more likely in 2050\nFor several years now, the scientists have noted that the increase in extreme events associated with climate change appears to be having much more of an impact on society than the increase in mean temperatures. Natural disasters are accompanied by a significant human and economic cost. In the case of exceptional heat waves, the mathematicians found that, based on global warming predictions, the probability of an event at least as severe as the 2003 heat wave will be six times greater in 2050 than it was in 2003.\nThe specialists are also developing models for other extreme weather events, such as rain, snow, and ice. The challenge is to improve them in terms of precision. “Eventually, we would like to be able to integrate more calculation points in order to better cover the territory. We also need to optimize our models to include dynamic phenomena, which require even more operations,” Davison says.\nSource:\nGeostatistics of extremes\n, Davison and Gholamrezaee, \nProceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical\n, Physical and Engineering Sciences (2012) vol. 468 (2138) pp. 581-608\nLink:", "summary": "EPFL mathematicians have shown that the risk of extreme climate events is largely underestimated.

Miniaturized and multiplied, processors are now hidden in most of the objects we encounter in everyday life. As a result, there are now very few requirements for large, centralizing machines.\nThis observation was the starting point for the development of the new exhibition of the Mémoires Informatiques Foundation, located at EPFL and whose \"treasure\" is made up of over one thousand computers, as well as numerous books and software products. “Scheduled disappearance” takes the form of a vast network of questions and answers, clues, suspects and culprits, which bring to light some of the most remarkable elements of the exhibition. “We imagined the presentation as a kind of \nmind map\n where the visitors themselves are encouraged to conduct the enquiry into this disappearance”, explains Yves Bolognini, the president of the Foundation with responsibility for the museum.\nThe other side of the wall is a gigantic window, a “showcase of curiosities” where you can discover some of the computers which made history.\nOne of the first digital machines\nAmong them, Yves Bolognini brought out from a basement at EPFL an exceptional machine. “I had to conduct a real enquiry to find the origin of this computer”, he relates.

While examining this wall, going from one clue to the next, the visitor not only witnesses the evolution of the machines, but also the more and more symbiotic relationships that human beings have with them. “We wanted to present more than a mere technological exhibition”, adds Yves Bolognini. “Computing has become so important in our societies that it seems necessary to step back a little and take stock, to understand how we got here and to imagine how it will continue to evolve.”\nAccess to the museum is free when the building  is open – Mondays to Fridays, except holidays.

{"id": 950, "text": "The Vautrin-Lud Prize will be given to Jacques Lévy at a ceremony on Saturday, 6 October, as part of the International Geography Festival to be held in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, France, on 5–7 October 2018. This prize, established in 1991, is known colloquially as the Nobel Prize for geography due to its strict selection criteria and its jury modeled after the Swedish awards.\n“I’m delighted to receive this prize. But along with me, it’s the dozens of other people I worked with over the years who are also being recognized. Our collaboration enabled me to carry out the most important work of my career,” says Lévy, whose main research areas include political spaces, cities, globalization, cartography and spatial justice.\nBorn in Paris in 1952, Lévy contracted hepatitis at the age of 8 and was forced to spend long days in bed. He came across an atlas and, flipping through the pages, found himself transported to another world. Each map took him on an imaginary journey far from the boredom and confines of his bedroom. Looking back, he now believes that’s when the seeds of his calling as a geographer were planted.\nEspacesTemps \nmagazine\nLévy began studying at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Cachan, France, in the early 1970s. He obtained a state-certified geography degree in 1974, and in 1975 founded a magazine called \nEspacesTemps\n (now \nEspacesTemps.net\n) with a group of classmates, including fellow geographer Christian Grataloup. “We wanted to break down the barriers between the social sciences, philosophy, geography and history,” says Lévy. He was also teaching geography at the time to high-school classes in the tough Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis. This experience sparked an interest in teaching methods and the societal issues related to knowledge, and made him aware of the need in his field for a clear technical vocabulary.\nFrom 1984 to 1993, Lévy worked as a researcher at CNRS, where he completed his state-certified PhD. He served as a professor at the University of Reims from 1993 to 2004 and as a senior lecturer and then professor at France’s prestigious Sciences Po university from 1989 to 2007. He was appointed full professor of urban planning and geography at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2004, where he set up the Chôros Laboratory. EPFL awarded him the title of Professor Emeritus in 2017; that same year, he founded the Chôros association along with several colleagues, including some his former PhD students.\nReading Kant for others\nChôros is an independent research consortium of some 30 scientists mainly from Switzerland, France and Italy. It was set up as a “rhizome” – or an open, horizontal network – to promote civically minded science, as stated in its manifesto. The idea is to further the efforts of EPFL’s Chôros Laboratory, which was closed in 2017. “We want to bring a theoretical perspective to modern challenges like migration and justice. The goal is to give citizens and policymakers tools for framing their analyses so that they can feel freer in their decision-making. A city councilman doesn’t necessarily have time to read Kant, for example. But we do; we read Kant and other philosophers and can explain how their theories and ideas could be useful,” says Lévy. Today he teaches urban planning and political geography at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne. While he was in Lausanne, Lévy managed the \nL’Espace en société\n book collection at Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes (PPUR). In 2017, he was nominated for the Grand Prix de l’Urbanisme, an urban planning award given by the French ministry of the environment.\nThe many facets of Lévy’s work cannot be summarized easily. However, a look back at his most often-cited publications (published alone or with coauthors) points to a handful of key themes.\nHis first few years of research were focused on developing a clear, common vocabulary for geography in French, which he then used to structure his future work. “French-speaking geographers had given up trying to develop concepts and to agree on a simple definition for what is a ‘place,’ for example. So I wanted to establish a clear definition for each term, like in mathematics,” says Lévy. His meticulous work led to the publication in 2003 of \nDictionnaire de la geography et de l’espace des sociétés \n(Belin), written with fellow geographer Michel Lussault. A new, expanded version of the dictionary was released in 2013.\nGeography and societal issues\nPrior to that, Lévy published \nLe monde: espaces et systèmes\n (Les Presses de Sciences Po) in 1991, which has become a classic in his field. This book contains an initial discussion of globalization and what it means for our notions of space, linking geography to the social sciences. Another book, \nL'espace légitime. Sur la dimension géographique de la fonction politique\n (Les Presses de Sciences Po), came out in 1994 and stressed the importance of tying geography to broader societal issues, looking more specifically at cities and at maps of French electoral districts.\nWith the publication of \nLe tournant géographique. Penser l'espace pour lire le monde \n(Belin) in 1999, he introduced a new conception of geography that calls on geographers to address factors such as cities, urban planning, political movements and the world we live in. In 2005, Lévy’s interests turned to how digital technology can be used to enhance geographical research. In \nA Cartographic Turn\n (EPFL Press), published in 2016, he encourages geographers to leverage the latest developments in computer science – especially data processing – and advocates a new kind of map: cartograms. Cartograms show the real weight of cities around the world and illustrate just how interconnected our globalized society really is.\nNew software, new maps\nLévy even developed an open-source software program for generating cartograms, called ScapeToad, in 2008, through a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. “Globalization has made conventional 2D maps of our planet – where the space is dominated by the Earth’s vast oceans – irrelevant. Today, social networks and other virtual systems linking people together have defined new communities, much more so than countries’ borders. For instance, if Facebook generated a map of the world, it would depict our planet based solely on social relationships,” says Lévy.\nHis most recent book, \nThéorie de la justice spatiale \n(Odile Jacob), came out on 3 October of this year. Written in association with Jean-Nicolas Fauchille and Ana Póvoas – two of his former EPFL PhD students and today members of Chôros – the book opens up a new field of research at the crossroads of geography and justice. It aims to deconstruct preconceived notions about abandoned suburban areas, the redistribution of public wealth and the role of “bobos” – yuppie-hipsters – in societal diversity. With \nThéorie de la justice spatiale,\n Lévy once again brings geography into contemporary society, which he analyses through the prism of several disciplines with his primary field as the backdrop.\nArt and science\nHis latest realm of experimentation sits at the intersection of art and science. In 2009 and 2010 he led a research project at EPFL titled “Cosmographies: Sources et ressources pour la cartographie contemporaine,” which entailed linking up historical maps with those created by modern artists over the past 20 years. He posted two films on the internet portraying his research at EPFL: the first, \nUrbanité/s, \nin 2013 (); and the second, \nThinking Places\n, in 2015 (). \nThinking Places\n is a series of nine videos in which nine different researchers from his lab explore a city from a fresh perspective. “Modern artists inspire us geographers. For over a decade these artists have been exploring the concept of personal space, especially in their own movements. I want to enhance their work with a scientific approach and apply problem-solving techniques to the new issues they are bringing up,” says Lévy. He already plans to work with a choreographer to examine the languages of modern dance.\nTestimonials\n“Geography has established itself as the urban science by combining three approaches: first, a theory of social space that goes beyond the empirical definition that the discipline assigned long ago to its objects and instead undertakes a methodical study of spatial expression in social relationships; second, greater dialogue, not just with history, our old companion, but with all the other social sciences, from sociology and economics to political science and anthropology; and third, a commitment inscribed in cities’ policies and achieved through research on urban planning and urban development. Jacques Lévy was the pioneer behind this shift and one of the central figures of its realization.”\nPhilippe Descola, Collège de France, Paris, France\n“I’ve known Jacques Lévy for a long time, both professionally and as an individual. His extensive knowledge of modern and classical culture and the many languages he speaks have allowed him to grasp the societal diversity in today’s world. His research on cities and globalization are well-known here in Italy, where he is viewed as one of the most innovative and visionary geographers. The mapping experiments he carried out at EPFL’s Chôros lab are revolutionizing the role of maps in understanding mobility and societal dynamics. He is also a sensitive, caring, intelligent person. He can read into someone and, in a joking, light-hearted way, play on that to create a deep sense of empathy. I think winning the Vautrin-Lud Prize is an appropriate, well-deserved reward for the researcher and the individual who has understood our world and those who live in it.”\nEmanuela Casti, Geography Professor, Università degli Studi di Bergamo, Italy \n“It is a pleasure to learn that the Vautrin-Lud Prize for this year has been awarded to Jacques Lévy. I have known of Jacques and his original research and writing in urban and political geography for many years. He is a worthy recipient of this honor not least because of his dazzlingly innovative cartographic work and his role in encouraging new ideas about place and the production of knowledge. I have enjoyed working with Jacques on a number of occasions, so I can also attest to his skeptical wisdom tempered by wit and humanity. I can think of few other contemporary geographers who have had the impact on my own work that I would attribute to Jacques.”\nJohn Agnew, Professor of Geography and Italian, University of California, Los Angeles, USA\n“‘The world doesn’t have enemies, it has problems.’ I can’t even remember how many talks and lectures I’ve ended with this quote from Jacques – while showing Martians on the screen. This aphorism reflects his views on the emergence of a global society as well as an ongoing dialogue with all social sciences. Back in the 1970s, we debated these trends with a youthful rage, running up against old epistemological tenets for geography as well as other disciplines. That’s what prompted us to create \nEspacesTemps\n. One regret I don’t have in my career is not having always continued learning by holding things up against Jacques’s thoughts – written, spoken and debated. Thanks, Jacques.”\nChristian Grataloup, Geographer, Professor Emeritus, Université Paris Diderot, France\n“What has Jacques done for the field of geography? Provided proof that space – on every level, from our bodies to our world as a whole – is political and is a factor in power relations. What has Jacques done for the social sciences? Provided proof that you cannot understand modern societies without taking into account their spatial aspects – unfortunately, a common misconception. And what has Jacques done for geographers? Provided proof that a theoretical, conceptual debate, even if it’s heated, is essential for rejuvenating knowledge and opening up closed mindsets.”\nMichel Lussault, Geographer, Professor of Urban Studies, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France\n“Jacques Lévy has left an important mark on our school. He fundamentally reshaped the relationship between geography and the social sciences – and more specifically between geography and architecture – by continually rethinking the notion of space, which is an essential concept for both disciplines. The need to always refer to the concept of a place rather than a space provided fertile ground for discussions with architects, in terms of teaching as well as research. ‘Think Space’ was even the name of one of his PhD seminar series that I was lucky enough to attend; each time I discovered a completely novel topic. Jacques’s main takeaway can be summarized in what he wrote in his important book, \nLe tournant géographique\n: ‘The spirit of a place – what makes a given space both similar to and different from another one – is not a dream or a die-hard spirituality, it exists. So you should learn to see it, tame it and reflect on it.’”\nLuca Ortelli, Architect, Full Professor and Head of the Construction and Conservation Laboratory (LCC), EPFL, Switzerland", "summary": "Jacques Lévy has been awarded the 2018 Vautrin-Lud Prize, a geography award modeled on the Nobel Prize.

{"id": 957, "text": "Is it possible to digitally replicate the way light shines off silk, the kaleidoscope of colors on butterfly wings, or the structure of fabrics, plastics, and stones? A team of researchers at EPFL’s Realistic Graphics Lab and , is developing computer models to do just that. Their process begins by meticulously digitizing any material they can lay their hands on, using a sophisticated machine called a gonio-photometer.\nImagine taking a photo of a car on a sunny day: the picture will only capture its appearance for that specific viewpoint and illumination, but it cannot tell us how the same car would look from another viewpoint later in the evening. In contrast to a camera, a gonio-photometer measures the light reflected by a material at different angles, capturing the essence of what gives the car’s painted surface its particular look: shiny, pearlescent, metallic, faded, etc. The resulting data is much richer than a single photograph and can be used to generate photorealistic computer images of objects made from those same materials within arbitrary virtual scenes.\n Digitize a butterfly wing © 2019 EPFL Alain Herzog\n The team at EPFL, led by Prof. Wenzel Jakob, studies the way in which light interacts with various materials so that this process can be reproduced in a software simulation. “Our goal is to put together a very comprehensive library of materials—not just to recreate them, but also to understand mathematically what makes them look the way that they do,” says Jakob. The researchers intend to digitize samples ranging from a sheet of paper and a piece of plastic from a pen to a butterfly wing and even a piece of fabric from a Darth Vader costume. “This kind of material data is invaluable in areas like architecture, computer vision, or the entertainment industry. We’ve recently started working with Weta Digital and Industrial Light & Magic, who make movies like Avatar and Star Wars,” he adds.\nCreating images that look like the real thing\n Wenzel Jakob uses a photo-goniometer © 2019 EPFL Alain Herzog\nThe gonio-photometer is an impressive machine some five meters long. It is operated in a room, whose walls have been covered with black cloth to absorb the light reflected by the sample being analyzed. The sample is placed in the center of the device, where it is observed from the tip of a robotic arm that spins with a speed of up to 3 meters per second so that measurements can be taken rapidly for many configurations. “A conventional camera only records red, green and blue color information that is visible to the human eye. We instead use a spectrometer that records hundreds of wavelengths throughout the entire visual spectrum, extending even to UV and infrared. That wealth of data provides us with much more information about a material that enables us to simulate its appearance extremely precisely,” says Jakob.\nThe team has developed a new algorithm that takes full control of the gonio-photometer to only capture a small subset of an inconceivably large four-dimensional space, enabling materials to be digitized much more rapidly than was previously possible. Jakob’s group also develops the Mitsuba Renderer, a widely used open source software platform that simulates light computationally to create photorealistic images of virtual worlds. With the acquired data, these simulations can now achieve an unprecedented level of accuracy.\nOn July 29, Jakob received ACM SIGGRAPH’s Significant New Researcher Award.

{"id": 960, "text": "Why are you celebrating this anniversary?\n We realized that the first university sports program began in 1941. That’s why we are celebrating this anniversary. So it’s to recognize this fact, but it’s also an opportunity to let people know about the sports center’s ‘new’ team, which has been in place a little under three years. We also wanted to increase our visibility, because I think we have a real role to play as a real service for both EPFL and the University of Lausanne. Our 75th anniversary will help us project a positive image of university sports, under the slogan Living sports.\nWhat events are planned for this anniversary year?\n We already have two big events, volleyball night and dance night. My colleagues Reto Ineichen and Jean-Sébastien Scharl are going to ‘customize’ these events. For volleyball night, for example, we will use white balls and, for the first part of the tournament, we’ll use the rules from 40 years ago – a flashback to the 1970s, when the first gym was built. There will also be an official, invitation-only evening, on 23 September. Two new events are also being organized to promote competitive sports and student health. The competitive event will be a 24-hour relay race (the Run24Dorigny, see box), while the health event will be one or two days on campus during which the university community will be able to test their physical condition at a number of different stands. One of the big problems, of course, stems from all the sitting we do. The health event will be paired with a Sports UNIL-EPFL app (starting on 29 February) that provides users with a custom fitness program based on short exercises.\nYour philosophy of university sports?\n We have to think about the physical activities we engage in and steer clear of certain problems associated with competitive sports. We encourage people to systematically pay attention to what they’re doing, why they’re doing it and how. It’s important for people to be aware of these things, even when it comes to performance sports, and to always think through their actions including the health and well-being aspects. We mustn’t simply charge forward, unthinking, taking supplements to boost our performance.\nThe most popular sports these days?\n Physical fitness activities and low-impact workouts. We see that our participants already think about their health when doing sports. Sports aren’t as hardcore as they were 15 years ago, no more ‘no pain no gain’. We also see a higher proportion of women in these sports, while men prefer team sports.

{"id": 962, "text": "As the season’s first snow fell on Lausanne, a few dozen hardy students gathered in front of food trucks on the EPFL campus. With just a month to go before the exam period, a number have come to campus to study – after booking a time slot ahead of time – either alone or in small groups. For some, it’s a real necessity: the calm atmosphere of the Rolex Learning Center and the few available revision rooms offer a welcome respite from noisy family homes or cramped student housing, with a stable Internet connection as an added bonus. For others, it’s a chance to meet friends and join working groups, provided that they wear masks and respect social distancing rules, of course. \n“Did you understand that series of math problems?” a young man asks his two classmates, who are rubbing their hands in the cold, waiting to order some Thai takeaway. “Not really. It’s hard to follow a class when you’re not there. Personally, I’m having a tough time concentrating,” his friend answers.\nStaying motivated under the present circumstances can be challenging for students, who started out the semester attending one-third of their classes in person, only to switch to 100% remote learning in November. Quite a few of them have been disoriented by the sudden disappearance of a class setting, the lack of student/teacher interaction – either during breaks or at the end of the day – and the struggle to stay focused on Zoom for long periods of time. The new format of the winter session exams, which will partly be held online, are a further source of stress.\n“The restricted access to the campus changed everything,” says Manon Boissat, a third-year Bachelor’s in electrical engineering student and Vice President of AGEPoly, EPFL’s student association. “That’s why we asked that failing exam grades not be counted. How can you know if you’ll earn a passing grade when you can’t study with your friends and measure yourself against others?” This winter, EPFL exceptionally allows students who have obtained a mark below 4 to retake the failed test at the next winter session without it counting as a new attempt. In case of a second attempt, if the grade causes the student to fail a block or group of classes, the Registrar’s Office will record the higher of the two grades on the transcript.\nAt the end of the article, you will find testimonials from EPFL students.\nA wide range of initiatives\nStill, a to which more than 6,800 EPFL students responded, and whose results were published on 16 November, found that “the examination process is the biggest source of uncertainty for students as regards their future, and this uncertainty is a major cause of stress and discouragement.” To address this, a whole range of initiatives have sprung up on campus at every level: between students as well as by student associations, faculty members and the Vice Presidency for Education. These initiatives are designed in response to lessons learned from last spring's completely unprecedented lockdown.\nExtract from the Facebook students page \"EPFL memes\" showing that the upcoming exams are a main concern © 2020 EPFL memes\nOne important new initiative introduced this semester is a mentoring system for first-year Bachelor’s students, since for them everything is new and they may not have had the opportunity to make friends or form working groups before the shutdown. Under this new initiative, set up by AGEPoly and EPFL's sections with the suport of the Vice Presidency for Education, groups of around ten new students are assigned to second- or third-year Bachelor's-level (or even Master's-level) mentors who provide support. “We wanted to create a student-oriented support system: the mentors encourage students to seek help and to ask questions. They also help build team spirit by making everyone work together, so as not to lose the studying momentum,” says Nicolò Ferrari, a third-year Bachelor's in physics student and President of AGEPoly. Although he regrets that the mentoring system was launched somewhat late in the semester, with the result that some first-year students did not take part, he's pleased with the positive feedback.\n“At EPFL, even under normal circumstances, the first year of a Bachelor’s program is really tough. This year, the lack of social contact and the inability to work with other students on exercises and in tutoring sessions, made it even harder. Mentoring helped some of them stay motivated; they realized that they were not alone in their struggles. In addition to the extremely useful academic support they received, mentoring was both reassuring and inspiring,” says Jeanne Estienne, a first-year Master’s in environmental engineering student and coordinator of AGEPolytique.\nHelping students to keep focus? It’s possible!\n At  we assigned one mentor to each group of new students to support them learning from home. This has been realised in a record time thanks to a deep cooperation between EPFL, teachers and . \n — Nicolò Ferrari (@nicolo_ferrari) \n“Providing the best support possible”\nIt's not only first-year Bachelor's students who experience feelings of loneliness, isolation, discouragement, stress and a fear they are not ready for winter exams – although Master's students seem to be faring relatively better. The counseling service within EPFL’s Student Affairs office provides one-on-one support on these issues for students in every discipline. Student Affairs has also teamed up with AGEPoly to create the . Each Monday, a newsletter on topics related to this semester’s special challenges is sent out to the student community, providing information on programs such as Telegram bots and . In addition, every Thursday the counseling service sends out tips on how to improve your well-being during the semester.\nMentoring helped some of the students to stay motivated; they realized that they were not alone in their struggles.\nJeanne Estienne, coordinator of AGEPolytique.\n“Under the current circumstances, students' stability and well-being are at risk. As a result of losing their bearings, some of them are neglecting the self-care they need (having a routine, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, scheduling activities, etc.) to perform well in their studies,” says Nathalie Ritter, head of Student Affairs. “Hence the importance of our counseling service and our work with Helping Hand, because we offer resources that we hope will provide them with the best support possible.”\nTips and tricks\nEPFL students have also shown solidarity and ingenuity, in order to make the run-up to exams as worry-free as possible. In the normally bustling GR Building, the hangout for environmental sciences and engineering students, a few scattered bursts of laughter interrupt the silence on campus. Diama, Henri and Violette, all second-year Bachelor’s students, and David, in the first year of his Master’s degree, are regular visitors, having reserved time-slots using an EPFL Campus app that limits access to the campus to no more than 1,000 people per day. “In my first year, working with people and being with my study group really motivated me. Now, since everyone’s staying home, no one will notice if I don’t attend a class. When you work alone, you’re less motivated – and that’s a real incentive to come and work in common areas,” says Diama Bassé, who is mentoring eight first-year students.\nExtract from the Facebook students page \"EPFL memes\" © 2020 EPFL memes\nFor her part, Marie-Lise Bellemin-Magninot, a first-year Bachelor's in life sciences engineering student, is able to keep up without coming to campus. The presence of her boyfriend and her roommates, who are also students at EPFL and UNIGE, is a real support. “It's not easy to stay motivated, but it's possible. I get up in the morning to attend classes live on Zoom. I take care of one of the items on my to-do list, and then take a 15-minute break during which I do something else. I repeat this four or five times a day. At midday, we take a proper lunch break – we cook and focus on other things,” she says.\nOthers have adopted technical solutions, such as Diego Dorn, a third-year Bachelor's in mathematics student. “I tried lots of different strategies that didn't work, and three-quarters of the way through the semester I hadn't taken half of the classes. Recently, I figured out how to program my computer to automatically shut down at 9pm. This forces me to stop working and to think about what went well during the day and how to improve my approach to studying. It also gives me the time to settle down, get my clothes ready for the next day and to tidy up my studio.” Since then, Diego sleeps better, is better able to concentrate, and he's stopped working until all hours.\nThese are some of the methods that are helping students – with EPFL’s support – to prepare for the winter exams and the upcoming semester as calmly as possible, while waiting for the return of in-person classes, student evenings and the sound of laughter across the campus.\nStudent testimonials: some tips to motivate yourself individually or collectively\nLéo Theytaz - Second-year Bachelor’s in computer science\n“Meditation and sports really helped me cope with the stress.”\nAntoine Fontaine – Second-year Bachelor’s in microengineering\n“To avoid feeling isolated, I try to see my friends in person at least once a week. I’d like to see them more often, but a full-time EPFL student’s schedule is so full that this isn’t always possible, academically speaking.”\nLola Bardel – Second-year Bachelor’s in life sciences engineering \n“At AGEPoly, we’re proud of our initiatives to improve the atmosphere and liven up our ‘virtual campus.’ These initiatives include AfterPoly (an online Saturday evening concert series), Agep's Got Talent (an online talent show) and decorating the campus for Christmas.”\nMarie-Lise Bellemin-Magninot - First-year Bachelor’s in life-sciences engineering \n“My boyfriend and I work opposite each other. It helps us to stay motivated and not lose focus. I feel guilty if he’s working and I’m not.”\nMaxime Roux – Third-year Bachelor’s in physics \n“I’m the president of JDR-Poly – an EPFL student association that promotes role-playing games – and since the start of the pandemic we’ve held around twenty online events that attracted nearly 500 students. The computer-science students on our board developed apps for holding new kinds of online events, such as interactive investigations. And for students who need of a change of scenery, we’re happy to give them a chance to spend an evening role-playing while complying with the public-health restrictions.\"\nSam Rahnemayan – Second-year Bachelor’s in microengineering\n“The EPFL coaching team is sending out holiday greeting cards to all first-year students to help keep their spirits up. It's a little thing, but it can make a big difference.”\nMaxence Grangeot, Second-year Master's in architecture\n\"The Master's students have tried to take advantage of the situation, since the Bachelor's degree background has allowed them to adapt relatively well to certain project processes. We're more serene, especially in our final year, where we're quite free with a more personal project, Zoom allowing us to see the professors.\"\nDiama Bassé, Second-year Bachelor’s in Environmental sciences and engineering\n\"I learned in my first year that you shouldn't ask yourself too many questions, that the more time you spend stressing, the less time you spend working effectively.

{"id": 963, "text": "Cholera is caused when the bacterium \nVibrio cholerae\n infects the small intestine. The disease is characterized by acute watery diarrhea resulting in severe dehydration. EPFL scientists have now demonstrated that \nV. cholerae\n uses a tiny spear to stab and kill neighboring bacteria – even of its own kind – and then steal their DNA. This mechanism, known as “horizontal gene transfer”, allows the cholera bacterium to become more virulent by absorbing the traits of its prey. The study is published in \nScience\n.\nThe lab of Melanie Blokesch at EPFL has uncovered how \nV. cholerae\n uses a predatory killing device to compete with surrounding bacteria and steal their DNA. This molecular killing device a spring-loaded spear that is constantly shooting out. This weapon is called the “type VI secretion system” (T6SS) and is known to exist in many types of bacteria. When \nV. cholerae\n comes close to other bacteria, the spear punches a hole into them, leaving them to die and release their genetic material, which the predator pulls into itself.\nKilling neighbors and stealing genes\nThis spear-killing, predatory behavior is triggered by the bacterium’s environment. The cholera bacterium naturally lives in water, such as the sea, where it attaches onto small planktonic crustaceans. There, it feeds on the main component of their shells: a sugar polymer called chitin. When chitin is available, \nV. cholerae\n goes into an aggressive survival mode called “natural competence”. When in this mode, \nV. cholerae\n attacks neighboring bacteria with its spear – even if they are of the same species.\nMelanie Blokesch set out to explore how \nV. cholerae\n uses this behavior to compete for survival in nature. Her lab tested different strains of the bacterium from all over the world, most of which have been implicated in the 7\nth\n cholera pandemic, which began in Indonesia in the 1960’s, spread rapidly to Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and still affects populations today.\nThe researchers grew these bacteria on chitin surfaces that simulated their natural habitat on crustaceans. What they found was that the tiny spear is not only part of \nV. cholerae\n’s natural survival system, but it also contributed to the transfer of genes that could make the bacterium more resistant to threats, even to antibiotics. The researchers then used genetic and bioimaging techniques to identify, in real time, which mechanisms are involved in this event, which is called “horizontal gene transfer”.\n“Using this mode of DNA acquisition, a single \nV. cholerae\n cell can absorb fragments containing more than 40 genes from another bacterium,” says Melanie Blokesch. “That’s an enormous amount of new genetic information.” This phenomenon is referred to as “horizontal” gene transfer, as opposed to the conventional “vertical” passage of genes from parent to offspring.\nThe importance of this study lies in the fact that horizontal gene transfer is a widespread phenomenon in bacteria, and it contributes to the dispersal of virulence factors and antibiotic resistances. In addition, the chitin-mediated activation of the spear-killing device most likely renders the bacterium more dangerous to patients when they ingest it, as this molecular spear might also kill protective bacteria in the human gut.\nThe researchers are now extending their investigation into the interplay between the chitin-induced production of the spear and horizontal gene transfer. “By studying this interplay, we can begin to better understand evolutionary forces that shape human pathogens and maybe also transmission of the disease cholera,” says Blokesch.\nReference\nBorgeaud S, Metzger LC, Scrignari T, Blokesch M. \nThe type VI secretion system of V. cholerae fosters horizontal gene transfer.\nScience\n, 2015; 347 (6217): 63 DOI: 10.1126/science.1260064", "summary": "Publishing in \nScience\n, EPFL scientists have uncovered the unconventional way that the cholera bacterium stabs and kills other bacteria to steal their DNA, making it potentially more virulent.", "claim": "Publishing in \nScience\n, EPFL scientists have uncovered the unconventional way that the cholera bacterium stabs and kills other bacteria to steal her DNA, making it potentially more virulent.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [24, 24], "noise": false}
{"id": 964, "text": "We know that the new coronavirus can cause lung infections that can be fatal for elderly people and those already suffering from heart disease, respiratory problems or weakened immune systems. We also know that one of the best things we can do to protect ourselves is to wash our hands. But there are some things we don’t know – which makes it hard to predict how the pandemic will play out. We spoke with Didier Trono, a professor at EPFL’s Laboratory of Virology and Genetics, to get expert answers to some of our questions about SARS-CoV-2 (the new coronavirus) and COVID-19, the disease it causes.\nHow does SARS-CoV-2 work?\nThe virus enters the body through the respiratory system. It then multiplies in the lungs, which is why the symptoms are similar to those of pneumonia. For now, the virus doesn’t seem to affect any other parts of the body.\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nIt’s a lot like the flu – a fever and a cough. Cold-like symptoms are less common. The illness can come on strong but generally doesn’t last long. However, some people can develop a severe lung infection that results in serious complications. That’s because the infected lungs are less able to transfer oxygen to the blood, meaning the body’s cells have less of the oxygen they need to generate energy. Elderly people and those suffering from cardiac or respiratory diseases or a weakened immune system are the most at risk.\nHow does the virus spread?\nThe virus spreads mainly through droplets, especially those that come out of our mouths when we cough. These droplets can travel one, two or even three meters. The virus generally doesn’t go far from infected individuals. However, if you touch a door handle that has been contaminated, for instance, and then touch your face, you could catch the virus. Transmission of the virus is lower where clear symptoms are not present, but we can’t completely rule it out. It does not spread significantly through ventilation systems.\nHow widespread is the disease?\nWe don’t know exactly how many people are infected, since that would require performing serological tests on large numbers of people to see if they’ve developed specific antibodies, which are signatures that appear following an infection. The figures currently being reported are based on whether the virus has been detected, but the actual infection rate is certainly much higher.\nCould someone become immune to SARS-CoV-2?\nIt appears that people develop an effective immunity after being infected. We suspect that a previous infection by another coronavirus, like one of the ones that cause the common cold in children, provide some protection against COVID-19; indeed young people, even if they are not protected against infection, do not develop serious symptoms in most cases.\nHow long will it take to develop a vaccine?\nScientists are working on it, but it’ll probably take 12–18 months. We currently don’t have an active antiviral treatment against COVID-19. Doctors treat it like pneumonia, with intubation if necessary.\nWill the virus become less active over the summer?\nSummer weather does seem to slow the propagation of seasonal influenza, which pretty much disappears in the late spring or early summer for reasons that scientists don’t fully understand. Right now it’s too soon to say whether the same will hold true for the new coronavirus.", "summary": "Didier Trono, a professor at EPFL’s Laboratory of Virology and Genetics, answers some common questions about SARS CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19.

From the importance of social networks in people’s everyday lives, which was inconceivable just ten years ago, to the transformation of our methods of production and consumption, more and more people – both young and old – and objects are now interconnected at all times and in all places. This digital revolution is fundamentally transforming our economy and society. What are the digital applications of the future and how will things stand ten years from now? Two organisations primarily concerned with such issues have today announced the signature of a strategic partnership.\nFrom connected people to connected homes\nThe agreements signed between the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Swisscom, Switzerland’s original telecommunications provider, cover the two key areas of interconnected people and homes. They will enable the study of a wide range of areas of application that are opening up thanks to digitalisation – new user interfaces, professional and household robotics, intelligent towns and buildings, biological sensors and artificial intelligence.\nToday, the networks are primarily used for communication tools. In the future, they will be the cornerstone of a system permanently connecting billions of networked objects and people. They will provide new functions that will redefine home life, mobility services and medical devices, among other things. “The digital revolution is on its way. To maintain their competitiveness and innovative capability, Switzerland and its companies have to be pioneers in this revolution and Swisscom a key player. In EPFL, in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, we’re seekingleading-edge expertise and multidisciplinary innovation that will enable us to further strengthen our position through our commitment,” explained Urs Schaeppi, CEO of Swisscom.\n“Dozens of our laboratories are working on the increased connectivity of people and objects and infrastructure, including data protection issues,” added Patrick Aebischer, President of EPFL. The arrival of Swisscom on our campus will inspire creativity among our students and researchers by providing them with access to the immediate requirements of a leading company with a large customer base.”\nA three-pillar partnership\nSwisscom and EPFL will cooperate closely within three key areas. Their partnership entails the setup of a call-for-proposals fund financed by the operator, worth a million Swiss francs a year for a seven-year period, for applied research projects focusing on its customers needs . The projects, which could involve software or infrastructure solutions as well as objects for the public, will focus on a multidisciplinary approach and cooperation between various laboratories and research facilities. Swisscom will also establish a permanent presence on campus starting in 2016 through its “Digital Lab”. This 428 m2 site in the EPFL Innovation Park will be providing a unique environment to implement and develop pilot projects by pursuing an “open innovation” strategy. Finally, Swisscom is committed to lending fresh impetus to the campus ecosystem by organising events related to the challenges of digitalisation, supporting the ecosystem of start-ups and, more generally, by stimulating exchanges between the operator’s staff and students and researchers. The projects implemented as part of the partnership will be developed on the Lausanne campus as well as on other EPFL sites in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, especially in Fribourg in relation with the project Smart Living Lab.\nThe agreement signed on Wednesday, 16 December 2015, allows the two major players to combine their efforts in a field offering enormous potential for innovation, on both a large and small scale.

{"id": 968, "text": "For the HydroContest EPFL Team, the third competition was the charm. Conceived in 2016, the team’s lightweight boat shone this year, taking first place in both speed and energy efficiency. It was a great reward for the students, who made the risky choice of a fast but unstable bifoiler. The EPFL team was also on the podium for the long-distance race, where they took second place, and for the heavyweight boat category, where they placed third.\nA dozen European teams from six countries participated this year in the event organized in Yverdon by the three French-language universities: EPFL, the Haute école d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Fribourg (HeiaFR), and the Haute école d'ingénierie et de gestion du canton de Vaud (Heig-VD). Using the same engine and batteries, the teams had to design the most energy-efficient boat.\nOn Sunday, the final race in the lightweight boat category was a close call between Heig-VD and EPFL. Five runs were necessary for EPFL to win 3-2. In the heavyweight boat category, the final separated the long Archimedean boats of the two impressive Croatian teams. The Croatian Academy of Engineering also distinguished itself in terms of efficiency, surpassing HeiaFR and Heig-VD with its heavyweight boat.\nExpress fine-tuning\nFor the long-distance race, in which contestants aim to cover the longest distance with a limited amount of energy, EPFL students went it all out. \"Half an hour before the competition, we modified our surface-effect boat – the heavyweight one,\" explains Sébastien Jaffaux, president of the HydroContest EPFL Team. “We took away its fan and the skirts that form an air cushion. It thus become a catamaran. We turned the engine over again, from propulsive to tractive mode. Finally, we added a foil.\" The choice was clearly a good one: like the Heig-VD team, the EPFL students completed 18 laps.

{"id": 970, "text": "To study the fine structure of the brain, including its connections between neurons, the synapses, scientists must use electron microscopes. However, the tissue must first be fixed to prepare it for this high magnification imaging method. This process causes the brain to shrink; as a result, microscope images can be distorted, e.g. showing neurons to be much closer than they actually are. EPFL scientists have now solved the problem by using a technique that rapidly freezes the brain, preserving its true structure. The work is published in \neLife\n.\nThe shrinking brain\nRecent years have seen an upsurge of brain imaging, with renewed interest in techniques like electron microscopy, which allows us to observe and study the architecture of the brain in unprecedented detail. But at the same time, they have also revived old problems associated with how this delicate tissue is prepared before images can be collected.\nTypically, the brain is fixed with stabilizing agents, such as aldehydes, and then encased, or embedded, in a resin. However, it has been known since the mid-sixties that this preparation process causes the brain to shrink by at least 30 percent. This in turn, distorts our understanding of the brain’s anatomy, e.g. the actual proximity of neurons, the structures of blood vessels etc.\nThe freezing brain\nA study by Graham Knott at EPFL, led by Natalya Korogod and working with Carl Petersen, has successfully used an innovative method, called “cryofixation”, to prevent brain shrinkage during the preparation for electron microscopy. The method, whose roots go back to 1965, uses jets of liquid nitrogen to “snap-freeze” brain tissue down to -90oC, within milliseconds. The brain tissue here was mouse cerebral cortex.\nThe rapid freezing method is able to prevent the water in the tissue from forming crystals, as it would do in a regular freezer, by also applying very high pressures. Water crystals can severely damage the tissue by rupturing its cells. But in this high pressure freezing method, the water turns into a kind of glass, preserving the original structures and architecture of the tissue.\nThe next step is to embed the frozen tissue in resin. This requires removing the glass-water and replacing it first with acetone, which is still a liquid at the low temperatures of cryofixation, and then, over a period of days, with resin; allowing it to slowly and gently push out the glassified water from the brain.\nThe real brain\nAfter the brain was cryofixed and embedded, it was observed and photographed in using 3D electron microscopy. The researchers then compared the cryofixed brain images to those taken from a brain fixed with an “only chemical” method.\nThe analysis showed that the chemically fixed brain was much smaller in volume, showing a significant loss of extracellular space – the space around neurons. In addition, supporting brain cells called “astrocytes”, seemed to be less connected with neurons and even blood vessels in the brain. And finally, the connections between neurons, the synapses, seemed significantly weaker in the chemically-fixed brain compared to the cryofixed one.\nThe researchers then compared their measurements of the brain to those calculated in functional studies – studies that measure the time it takes for a molecule to travel across that brain region. To the researchers’ surprise, the data matched, adding even more evidence that cryofixation preserves the real anatomy of the brain.\n“All this shows us that high-pressure cryofixation is a very attractive method for brain imaging,” says Graham Knott. “At the same time, it challenges previous imaging efforts, which we might have to re-examine in light of new evidence.” His team is now aiming to use cryofixation on other parts of the brain and even other types of tissue.\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. \nReference\nKorogod N, Petersen C, Knott G. \nUltrastructural analysis of adult mouse neocortex comparing aldehyde perfusion with cryo fixation.\neLife\n 11 August 2015.

{"id": 976, "text": "EPFL scientists have discovered how to control the limbs of a completely paralyzed rat in real time to help it walk again. Their results are published today in Science Translational Medicine.\nBuilding on earlier work in rats, this new breakthrough is part of a more general therapy that could one day be implemented in rehabilitation programs for people with spinal cord injury, currently being developed in a European project called NEUWalk. Clinical trials could start as early as next summer using the new Gait Platform, built with the support of the Valais canton and the SUVA, and now assembled at the CHUV (Lausanne University Hospital).\nHow it works\nThe human body needs electricity to function. The electrical output of the human brain, for instance, is about 30 watts. When the circuitry of the nervous system is damaged, the transmission of electrical signals is impaired, often leading to devastating neurological disorders like paralysis.\nElectrical stimulation of the nervous system is known to help relieve these neurological disorders at many levels. Deep brain stimulation is used to treat tremors related to Parkinson’s disease, for example. Electrical signals can be engineered to stimulate nerves to restore a sense of touch in the missing limb of amputees. And electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can restore movement control in spinal cord injury.\nBut can electrical signals be engineered to help a paraplegic walk naturally? The answer is yes, for rats at least.\n“We have complete control of the rat’s hind legs,” says EPFL neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine. “The rat has no voluntary control of its limbs, but the severed spinal cord can be reactivated and stimulated to perform natural walking. We can control in real-time how the rat moves forward and how high it lifts its legs.”\nThe scientists studied rats whose spinal cords were completely severed in the middle-back, so signals from the brain were unable to reach the lower spinal cord. That’s where flexible electrodes were surgically implanted. Sending electric current through the electrodes stimulated the spinal cord.\nThey realized that there was a direct relationship between how high the rat lifted its limbs and the frequency of the electrical stimulation. Based on this and careful monitoring of the rat’s walking patterns – its gait – the researchers specially designed the electrical stimulation to adapt the rat’s stride in anticipation of upcoming obstacles, like barriers or stairs.\n“Simple scientific discoveries about how the nervous system works can be exploited to develop more effective neuroprosthetic technologies,” says co-author and neuroengineer Silvestro Micera. “We believe that this technology could one day significantly improve the quality of life of people confronted with neurological disorders.\"\n Taking this idea a step further, Courtine and Micera together with colleagues from EPFL’s Center for Neuroprosthetics are also exploring the possibility of decoding signals directly from the brain about leg movement and using this information to stimulate the spinal cord.\nTowards clinical trials using the Gait Platform at the CHUV\nThe electrical stimulation reported in this study will be tested in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury in a clinical study that may start as early as next summer, using a new Gait Platform that brings together innovative monitoring and rehabilitation technology.\nDesigned by Courtine’s team, the Gait Platform consists of custom-made equipment like a treadmill and an overground support system, as well as 14 infrared cameras that detect reflective markers on the patient’s body and two video cameras, all of which generate extensive amounts of information about leg and body movement. This information can be fully synchronized for complete monitoring and fine-tuning of the equipment in order to achieve intelligent assistance and adaptive electrical spinal cord stimulation of the patient.\nThe Gait Platform is housed in a 100 square meter room provided by the CHUV. The hospital already has a rehabilitation center dedicated to translational research, notably for orthopedic and neurological pathologies.\n“The Gait Platform is not a rehabilitation center,” says Courtine. “It is a research laboratory where we will be able to study and develop new therapies using very specialized technology in close collaboration with medical experts here at the CHUV, like physiotherapists and doctors.”", "summary": "A completely paralyzed rat can be made to walk over obstacles and up stairs by electrically stimulating the severed part of the spinal cord.

In June, five EPFL students* went to Texas for the competition final, where they put the device they had been working on all year to the test. How did they fare?\n\"We got the Tenderfoot Award, which goes to the best newcomer,\" said Luca Barloggio, a student in materials science. \"We finished 20th out of 40 teams, as we didn't have time to transmit all the data collected during the flight. But the wing design of our device was good, the telemetry worked well, and the container opened as planned.\"\nNo more than 500 grams\nIt all started in a class given by Olivier de Weck, an Aeronautics and Astronautics Professor at MIT in Boston. The class is part of EPFL's Minor in Spatial Technology, which the five students took together. One of their exercises was to work under the strict CanSat conditions. After the experiment, they all decided to give the real thing a go and applied for the competition.\nAmong the many requirements for the CanSat category selected by the EPFL team: the system must not weigh more than 500 grams; the materials used should not be at any risk of catching fire; the flight duration must be as close to two minutes as possible; and the cost cannot exceed 1,000 dollars. Released at an altitude of 600 meters, the vehicle has to sample the air pressure and temperature, take images and transmit the data to a ground station in real time.\nA semester of work for two minutes of flight\nSupported by experts from the Swiss Space Center and EPFL's Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, the five students worked tirelessly on their project. \"It seemed doable in theory, but when you actually have to develop the system, you realize what space science really is,\" said Sorina Lupu, a student in microengineering.\nTo design the CanSat, the group took inspiration from a tropical grain \"that glides to the ground when it falls from the tree,\" said Barloggio. \"The project taught us a lot. We learned how to work as a team, how to communicate with each other and with other people, how to organize our work, how to manage very diverse technical aspects and how to make the most of each person's skills.

Soon after joining the Materials Science and Engineering Section, the assistant professor took over teaching an introductory course for Bachelor’s students in the School of Engineering. The class is quite large – some 300 students – which made it a real challenge for the first-year professor. Professor Sorin has poured his heart into the course, and it shows: his students obtain excellent results and give Sorin very high marks. In recognition, Sorin has been awarded the 2017 Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching at EPFL.\nHow does Professor Sorin engage his students? Through a well planned curriculum that combines demonstrations, scientific concepts and experiments. “Teaching these concepts to just one student would be easy, but getting certain points across to a lecture hall full of 300 students through experiments is much more challenging,” says Sorin. “Over the past few years I came up with a three-pronged approach so that I could teach the theoretical and practical sides together.” Sorin begins his classes with often spectacular demonstrations, not hesitating to break dishes, for example, in order to reveal the properties of a given material. Or he shows videos that he made in his laboratory. Having captured the entire class’s attention, he then introduces the theoretical elements of that day’s lesson. He ends the class with experiments.\n“Mixing things up is the best way to hold their attention,” says Professor Sorin. “After doing an experiment, maybe I'll tell a funny story or bring in a historical perspective, and then I’ll explain the underlying concepts on the board. That helps keep them focused.” While he is strict – “silence in class is mandatory” – he believes that connecting with the students and sharing his passion are essential to sparking their interest and winning their respect. Sorin attributes the success of his course to Professor Rappaz, who mentored him early on. He also cites his student assistants, to whom he presents the material ahead of time in a sort of practice run that prepares them for the students’ questions.\nThanks to the effort Professor Sorin puts in, his students rate the class highly despite the fact it’s so hard. And it has even gotten harder as a result of Sorin’s approach of combining theory and practice. “What I find so rewarding is not only that the students like the class, but that the second-year professors have seen the students’ level of understanding increase noticeably since I changed my way of teaching,” says Sorin.", "summary": "Fabien Sorin, an assistant professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Section, has been awarded the 2017 Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.

{"id": 987, "text": "Has the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutated by now?\nLike all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time through random mutations of its genome (which is made of single-stranded RNA). These little changes can be used to draw up phylogenetic trees, a diagram that shows evolutionary relationships between coronaviruses, and can tell us about the virus’s spread. However, most mutations have no impact on viral fitness and ability to cause disease, and so far, there is no evidence of more or less virulent strains of SARS-CoV-2.\nWhat did we learn from the genome of \nSARS-CoV-2\n?\nFirst, we very quickly learned that the pathogen causing a severe pneumonia of unknown origin in the city of Wuhan was in fact a coronavirus. Second, sequencing of the viral RNA made it possible to estimate that the virus probably jumped from animal to human in November 2019, and to identify the bat as the most likely reservoir – sorry to disappoint, but it’s probably not the pangolin… Finally, the distribution of the random mutations detected in the virus’s genome makes it possible to reconstruct the temporal and geographical routes of viral propagation, which is important for informing public health policy.\nIs there any correlation between genetics and symptom severity?\nOn the viral side, as said above, nothing suggests that the slight variations observed in the genome have an impact on symptoms and disease severity. On the human side, the short answer is “we don’t know yet”. As for all infectious diseases, human genetic variants are likely to explain some of the differences observed between patients. However, we don’t have any data yet.\nIs it true that once you are infected the virus stays in your body forever in your DNA?\nNo. This is only true for retroviruses like HIV, which have the capacity to integrate into our own DNA and persist for life. Coronaviruses depend on our cellular machinery to replicate but they cannot colonize the human genome. Once someone is cured, the virus is completely eliminated.\nHow will this pandemic contribute to your research in \nhuman genomics and infections\n?\nMy lab aims at understanding how human genetic variation influences our response to infectious diseases. Hidden in our genome, we can find clues to better fight pathogens. We plan to sequence the genome of previously healthy patients, less than 50 years old, who develop life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of genetic variants that explain this very unusual clinical presentation could shed light on the genes and pathways that play a crucial role in viral pathogenesis, thereby informing drug and vaccine development. \nScience publishing on the Corona topic is mostly published without being peer-reviewed. Is this a problem? Are the papers still useful?\nDuring this pandemic, there is a clear need to rapidly disseminate scientific information about epidemiology, viral biology, clinical outcomes, prevention and therapy, etc. The classical model of peer-reviewed publishing just cannot cope. This has led to a flurry of coronavirus-related preprints posted online (>500 on bioRxiv and medRxiv over the past 3 months). Many of those have provided essential information about the epidemic, almost in real-time. So no, I don’t think it’s a problem. Of course, we must keep in mind that some preprints will be proven false, but the vast majority is scientifically sound – in fact, several of them end up in \nNature\n or the \nNew England Journal of Medicine\n every week – and play an essential role in the rapid dissemination of knowledge.\nDo you think this pandemic could change the opinion of people regarding science?\nTo put in bluntly, the world now has no choice but to count on science to save lives, to predict the impact of various confinement or testing strategies, and to develop efficient antivirals and ultimately a vaccine. Whether this will be enough for society to listen more carefully to scientists in the future is less clear… One can only hope!", "summary": "Jacques Fellay, a professor at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences, talks about mutations of the novel coronavirus, variants in the human genome, and how they might affect the current pandemic.", "claim": "Jacques Fellay, a professor at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences, talks about mutations of the novel coronavirus, variants in the human genome, and how he might affect the current pandemic.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 29], "noise": false}
{"id": 990, "text": "Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes patients to lose their ability to move, speak, and even think. It is caused by a gene mutation that produces an abnormal form of the protein huntingtin, which aggregates and builds up inside neurons of the cortex and striatum. Small chemical modifications on different parts of huntingtin could reduce its toxicity and aggregation, but as many enzymes already chemically modify the protein in the cell, it has been difficult to determine what chemical modifications could serve as future therapies. EPFL scientists have now developed synthetic methods that allow site-specific chemical modifications on huntingtin while bypassing the need to identify the enzymes behind them. The study is .\nAfter being produced by its gene, huntingtin is subjected to numerous chemical changes, during which enzymes in the cell attach different chemical groups to it, such as phosphate (phosphorylation) or acetylene (acetylation). These changes are called “post-translational modifications” but the key molecular players that regulate them remain unknown.\nTo address this knowledge gap and explore the therapeutic potential of post-translational modifications,  turned to chemistry and developed synthetic strategies that allow site-specific introduction of chemical modifications. This approach elucidates the effect of these modifications without needing to identify the key enzymes responsible, and enables the investigation, for the first time, of the “cross-talk” between different modifications on huntingtin.\nThe new strategy combines chemical and bacterial synthesis of proteins to generate a part of mutant huntingtin where many important post-translational modifications take place. This segment is known as “mutant hutingtin exon1” (Httex1) and has been shown to be sufficient for reproducing key features of Huntington’s disease in animal models.\nUsing the method, the researchers could now generate all the known modified forms of huntingtin in very pure and homogeneous forms. “This allowed us to investigate the effects of post-translational modifications with high precision and under controlled conditions,” says Anass Chiki, the PhD student who led the study.\nThe researchers explored how these modifications can act as molecular switches that can be exploited to regulate Huntingtin structure, function and toxicity. In this vein, they made three discoveries regarding the relationship between post-translational modifications of Huntingtin and its structure.\nFirst, phosphorylation of threonine on position 3 (T3) stabilizes a helical formation of huntingtin’s first 17 amino acids, and interferes with its ability to aggregate. This could explain why this particular modification is reduced in Huntington’s disease and suggest that modulating the level of this modification could protect against HD disease.\nSecond, the study found that substituting threonine with another amino acid (glutamate or aspartate) to mimic the charge of the phosphate group, does not fully reproduce the effects of genuine phosphorylation on the structure and aggregation of huntingtin. This is important for biologists who, in the absence of knowledge about the key enzymes that regulate phosphorylation, use this substitution as a go-to solution.\nFinally, the scientists were able for the first time to study the impact of acetylation, which takes place on three Lysine amino acids of huntingtin. While acetylation of individual residues did affect huntingtin’s structure or aggregation, acetylation at one lysine (in position 6) did reverse the protective effect of T3 phosphorylation when the two modifications were introduced simultaneously.\n“Our work underscores how critical it is to identify the enzymes that regulate huntingtin modifications, both for understanding its biology and unlocking their great potential as viable therapeutic targets for Huntington’s disease,” says Hilal Lashuel. “Being able to generate all disease-modified forms with high purity paves the way for assessing whether these modifications could serve as disease biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring disease progression”.\nThis work was conducted in collaboration with the group of Prof. Giovanni Dietler and Annalisa Pastore and received contributions by the \nMRC National Institute for Medical Research (London).

Federated Learning is very appealing for its privacy benefits but because it is designed to have no energy or performance impact on mobile devices it’s not suitable for applications that require frequent updates, such as news recommendations.\nFLeet combines the privacy of standard Federated Learning with the precision of online learning thanks to two core components: \nI-Prof\n, a new lightweight profiler that predicts and controls the impact of learning tasks on mobile devices, and \nAdaSGD\n, a new adaptive learning algorithm that is resilient to delayed updates.\nAs one of the paper’s authors, EPFL Professor Rachid Guerraoui explains, it turns out that today our smartphones have both the data and battery power to enable distributed machine learning to take place.\n“With FLeet it is possible, while you are using your mobile phone, to use some of its spare power towards machine learning tasks without having to worry that your call or internet search will be interrupted. One of the reasons this is important, and we don’t want the machine learning to only be happening when you are asleep and your phone is on charge, is because sometimes we want, and need, real time information.”\nProfessor Anne-Marie Kermarrec was also an author on the paper, “What we have shown is that if we put all our phones together they start constituting big computing power to match the likes of Google and that gives people alternatives to relying on centralized, powerful computer farms. This is truly collaborative learning where local models are aggregated and contribute to the global model but you don’t share raw data and that protects your privacy, a huge motivation behind developing this kind of architecture.”\nFor now, FLeet is a prototype that shows what is possible. Guerraoui and Kermarrec say the next step is to continue work on developing a usable end product as well as research into other aspects of FLeet’s design, including how to make the system secure against possible attacks.\n“There is a huge trend nowadays to try to bring machine learning activities back to the user because, after all, the data comes from us and we should be able to decide what happens on our own devices and with our own data.

After the BlueGene/L, installed in 2005, then the BlueGene/P, which entered service in 2009, the latest addition to the range of IBM supercomputers, the BlueGene/Q, assumed its place at EPFL last November. After undergoing a series of tests, it has been operational since January 28, and has been made available to researchers from EPFL and the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL) through the consortium CADMOS (Center for Advanced Modeling Science), the Geneva center for high performance computing shared by these three institutions.\nWith this new tool, research on complex systems, such as the brain, the climate, or the Earth’s surface, can soar to new heights. Medical research can also benefit by improving treatments for certain illnesses such as cerebral aneurisms.\nWith 1024 computation nodes, the BlueGene/Q has a calculation power of 172.7 teraflops, which means it can do 172,000 billion operations per second. That is four times more than the functioning capacity of BlueGene/P thus far. It is also much smaller, given that it fits in a single cabinet, whereas its predecessor required four. Twenty-five BlueGene/Q are already operational around the world. However, the one from Lake Geneva has a mass storage management system (2.2 petabytes) that is unique in the world today.\nDespite its great power, the BlueGene/Q requires very little energy. Water-cooled, it consumes only 82.2 kilowatts of electricity, the energy equivalent of a mere one-hundred household coffeemakers working continuously. This excellent energy efficiency places it in tenth position in the list of the world’s greenest supercomputers.\nFrom the brain and medical research to the Rhône\nAs the issues scientists face become increasingly complex, their resolution requires ever higher computational power. Twenty teams can leverage the capabilities of BlueGene/Q to make great headway with their research.\nAmong potential supercomputer users are the EPFL plasma physics research center at EPFL. Also, geophycisists of UNIL are trying to simulate the physics involved in plate tectonics. Furthermore, computer scientists of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) are modeling the Rhône River between Geneva and Verbois in an effort to better understand how sediments are deposited. But potential users also include climatologists, astrophysicists, or even experts in biology and computational chemistry who need powerful computers to process large amounts data. Let us not forget the mathematicians who build simulation models of the heart and arteries to predict diseases of the circulatory system.\nBiomedical research, too, could benefit greatly from this supercomputer. This includes notable research by oncologists at UNIL, as well as by researchers at UNIGE who simulate the process of thrombosis in cerebral aneurisms. Their goal is not only to understand biomechanical phenomena at work, but also to help doctors propose the most appropriate treatment for each patient.\nThe acquisition of BlueGene/Q furthermore enables the CADMOS consortium to consolidate its expertise in the field of this family of IBM supercomputers and for scientists of the Lake Geneva region to expand their acquired competencies in scientific calculation. Thereby they will be ready for the next big step, “exa-scale,” which will complete about one billion billion operations per second.

{"id": 993, "text": "Dozens of balloon-borne radiosondes are released into the atmosphere every day. They measure temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and wind direction at different altitudes before eventually falling back to earth. In most cases, this high-tech equipment is never recovered. But a group of five EPFL students,* studying either environmental sciences or physics, could change all that. For their Bachelor’s project, they developed a system that can help guide the radiosonde’s trajectory as it falls to earth so that it can be found and reused. Through a single test flight from the roof of a campus building, they proved the feasibility of their concept.\nRadiosondes are carried aloft by giant helium-filled weather balloons that expand as they rise through the air – in some cases to an altitude of 30 kilometers – until they eventually pop. A small parachute attached to the onboard equipment automatically opens once the maximum altitude has been reached, preventing the radiosondes from causing damage when they touch down.\nThe students’ focused their attention on the parachute release. “Our system controls the exposed surface area of the parachute, directing the radiosonde towards air currents that will guide it to an accessible landing spot,” says Hugo Cruz, a student in Environmental Sciences and Engineering. His classmate Lorenzo Donadio adds: “The main thing is to make sure the radiosonde doesn’t end up on the side of a mountain, at the bottom of a lake or in some no man's land.”\nTheir parachute system is fully automated and run by computer code that the students wrote themselves. It is triggered as soon as the radiosonde starts to fall: a small motor lets out the parachute cords and reels them back in to control the speed of descent. The radiosonde can thus be navigated to an air current that will take it in the desired direction. The system uses up-to-date weather data along with GPS coordinates that are refreshed every 30 seconds relative to a reference point. A tracking device is used to pinpoint where the radiosonde lands.\nAs light as possible\nThe students’ invention, while practical and clever, faced some hurdles. For starters, their parachute system had to be able to withstand all sorts of weather, including extremely high winds. It also had to be as light as possible so that the radiosonde could be easily redirected while freefalling. This seriously limited the instruments and materials that they could use. “We also had to master a number of concepts that we had never studied before, especially in computer science and physics,” says Julie Reznicek, an environmental engineering student.\nThey did a single trial run of their system this past spring, flying their weather balloon to an altitude of around 10,000 meters above Lake Geneva as planned. The equipment was then recovered in a field in Epalinges, just north of Lausanne. While the mechanism used to release and retract the cords worked well, the students noted that the microcontroller lacked the power it needed to record all the data. Some of the students will continue to refine the device this summer, and a second test flight with a larger balloon and more reliable equipment is planned for September. There’s no doubt that these students have set their sights high.\n* Julie Reznicek, Hugo Cruz, Lorenzo Donadio,\nSimon Léo Albers and Guillem Rivas Castellá.", "summary": "Summer series.

With these simple items, around 30 students were schooled in the basics of aerodynamics and space engineering, nothing less. They were participating in a homemade rocket competition organised by eSpace, the new Space Engineering Center at EPFL. The group, divided into ten teams, launched their rockets at noon on Friday, 5 June from the fields at the UNIL-EPFL sports centre. The rockets were judged on three criteria: cost, altitude and flight time.\nAll the rockets reached an altitude of 100 to 123 meters, whether following a straight or slightly sinusoidal path. The only mishap came when three rockets lost their parachute, which was meant to ensure a soft landing. The winning rocket reached an altitude of 115 meters and stayed aloft for over 33 seconds.\n“The competition is a fun way to generate interest in space technologies and show that this field is more accessible than one might think,” said Simon Dandavino, a scientist at eSpace and the event organiser. Some thirty students signed up. All the teams came from EPFL apart from a team of four high school students with a passion for technology. “Unfortunately there were no girls!” said Dandavino. “They’re still pretty underrepresented in this field.”\nSolid display of skills\nThe event gave the teams an opportunity to put their heads together on a fun project. But in the end it was a real engineering competition requiring solid math skills and a keen practical sense.\nThe participants were guided throughout the whole process by the experience of the event’s Technical Director, Nickolay Mullin.

Each team had an equal amount of RocketCoins, or credits, allowing them to purchase the materials needed for their rocket. Before the materials could be selected, however, the teams had to carry out rapid but very precise calculations to assess the impact that various shapes of nose cones and ailerons would have on the stability, trajectory and height of the flight and to estimate how the choice of cardboard or polystyrene foam, for example, would affect the outcome. The teams also had to take a number of factors into account – such as weight, tube length and engine power – in order to pinpoint the centre of mass, which had to be above the centre of thrust.\n“The students became familiar with some core concepts of aerodynamics, which also apply to the design of large rockets,” said Dandavino.

{"id": 998, "text": "Optical fibers carry data in the form of pulses of light over distances of thousands of miles at amazing speeds. They are one of the glories of modern telecommunications technology. However, their capacity is limited, because the pulses of light need to be lined up one after the other in the fiber with a minimum distance between them so the signals don't interfere with each other. This leaves unused empty space in the fiber.\nEPFL's Camille Brès and Luc Thévenaz have come up with a method for fitting pulses together within the fibers, thereby reducing the space between pulses. Their approach, which has been published in Nature Communications, makes it possible to use all the capacity in an optical fiber. This opens the door to a ten-fold increase in throughput in our telecommunications systems.\nFiber optics at a crossroads\n \"Since it appeared in the 1970s, the data capacity of fiber optics has increased by a factor of ten every four years, driven by a constant stream of new technologies,\" says Camille Brès, of the Photonics Systems Laboratory (PHOSL). \"But for the last few years we've hit a sort of ceiling, and scientists all over the world are trying to break through.\"\nThere have been several different approaches to the problem of supplying more throughput to respond to growing consumer demand, but they often require changes to the fibers themselves. That would entail pulling out and replacing the existing infrastructure. Here, the EPFL team took a different approach, looking at the fundamental issue of how to process the light itself, i.e., how best to generate the pulses that carry the digital data. This approach would not entail a need to replace the entire optical fiber network. Only the transmitters would need to be changed.\nTraffic problems on the information superhighway\n In modern telecommunications exchanges, for example when two cell-phones are communicating with each other, the data are transported between the two antennae on optical fibers, by means of a series of light pulses that form codes.\n Simply put, an \"on\" pulse corresponds to the number 1, while an \"off\" pulse corresponds to 0. The messages are thus sets of ones and zeros. These codes are decoded by the receiver, providing the initial message. The problem with this system is that the volume of data transmitted at one time can't be increased. If the pulses get too close together, they no longer deliver the data reliably. \"There needs to be a certain distance between each pulse, so they don't interfere with each other,\" says Luc Thévenaz, of EPFL's Fiber Optics Group (GFO). However, the EPFL team noticed that changes in the shape of the pulses could limit the interference.\nPulses that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle\n Their breakthrough is based on a method that can produce what are known as \"Nyquist sinc pulses\" almost perfectly. \"These pulses have a shape that's more pointed, making it possible to fit them together, a little bit like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle lock together,\" says Camille Brès. \"There is of course some interference, but not at the locations where we actually read the data.\"\nThe first to \"solve\" the puzzle\n The idea of putting pulses together like a puzzle to boost optic fibers' throughput isn't new. However, the \"puzzle\" had never been \"solved\" before: despite attempts using sophisticated and costly infrastructures, nobody had managed to make it work accurately enough - until now. The EPFL team used a simple laser and modulator to generate a pulse that is more than 99% perfect.\nFine-tuning the system\n Practically speaking, the shape of pulse is determined by its spectrum. In this case, in order to be able to generate the \"jigsaw puzzle,\" the spectrum needs to be rectangular. This means that all the frequencies in the pulse need to be of the same intensity. Professors Brès and Thévenaz had this in mind when modulating their lasers.\nSimple lasers are generally made up essentially of just one color - i.e., one optical frequency - with a very narrow spectrum. This is rather like a violin that has only one string. However, a laser can be subtly modulated (using a device called a modulator) so that it has other colors/frequencies. The result is a pulse composed of several different colors, with a larger spectrum. The problem is that the pulse's main color generally still tends to be more intense than the others. This means the spectrum won't have the rectangular shape needed. For that, each color in the pulse needs to be of the same intensity, rather like getting the strings of a violin to vibrate with the same force, but without making any other strings nearby vibrate.\nThe team thus made a series of subtle adjustments based on a concept known as a \"frequency comb\" and succeeded in generating pulses with almost perfectly rectangular spectrum. This constitutes a real breakthrough, since the team has succeeded in producing the long-sought-after \"Nyquist sinc pulses.\" Professor Thévenaz recounts how it all started: \"Camille and I were talking with a Visiting Professor at the University of Leipzig, and we realized that by teaming up we might be able to develop this new approach.\"\nThe technology is already mature\n The new pulses could well generate interest among many telecommunications-industry market participants. The technology is already mature, as well as 100% optic and relatively cheap. In addition, it appears that it could fit on a simple chip. \"It almost seems too good to be true,\" says Prof. Thévenaz.\n-----\nMore information:", "summary": "Two EPFL scientists have shown how to achieve a dramatic increase in the capacity of optical fibers.

That’s why a handful of students has been meeting up almost every day during their summer vacation at either the lakeside headquarters of the Compagnie Générale de Navigation (CGN) – the Lake Geneva ferryboat operator – or the EPFL-UNIL sailing center, to thoroughly test their two prototypes. The  will be held from 2 to 9 September in Saint-Tropez, France. Like last year, three Swiss teams have signed up: EPFL, the Universities of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland in Fribourg (HES-SO Fribourg) and the School of Business and Engineering (HEIG) in Yverdon. The three teams will showcase their boats for the public on 11 August, from 10am to 7pm, at the Parc des Rives du Lac on the  lakefront.\nThe competition is devoted to nautical and maritime energy efficiency, and more than 30 teams will take part this year. Each team will compete with two miniature remote-controlled boats powered by batteries provided by the event organizer. A bit like Laurel and Hardy, one of the boats should be fast and light and run for a long time, while the other, with 200 kg in ballast, is meant to simulate a cargo ship.\nHalf catamaran, half hovercraft\nEPFL has taken part in the event since it was first held in 2014, and this year’s team is going in confident. They believe that their light bifoiler, which was launched in 2016, could win. “We minimized drag by using only two foils, which means our boat can outpace the others. The flip side of the coin is that our boat is more unstable – it’s sort of like flying a drone without a stabilizer,” says Kevin Delizée, a Master’s student in mechanical engineering and vice president of the  association. The trick is to really fine-tune the boat and then pilot it expertly.\nThe EPFL students are also entering a promising new ‘heavy’ boat into the mass transport category, which they have dominated twice in years past. A cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft, their new boat has two sources of propulsion: Archimedes’ buoyancy force acting on the two hulls, and a fan-generated air cushion contained between the hulls by fore and aft skirts.\nValuable partners\nThe upcoming competition will cap off a year of endless hours of work for Delizée, who conceived and designed the new boat as part of two semester projects. “What drives me? It’s just been a lot of fun!” He and close to a dozen other students got out of bed every morning at the crack of dawn for five weeks in order to build the boat in a workshop in Ecublens provided by Décision SA, one of the team’s main partners.\nThe project taught the students many things. In addition to the mechanical and technical know-how they picked up, they experienced some real-world challenges first-hand: project and team management for starters, and then fundraising and the quest for partners. This year, Hydrocontest EPFL Team embarked on a partnership with CGN, which gave them access to a large expanse of open water in the port used by their belle-époque-era ferryboats. “For CGN, this link-up with EPFL is a great opportunity to build bridges in areas that are important to our company and will support our development. We have put in place a solid and forward-looking partnership that will pay off for the students, the school and CGN in terms of energy efficiency, technology intelligence, innovation and hands-on experience,” says Irwin Gafner, CGN’s Technical Director. One small yet memorable result of this partnership: the sight of the EPFL students’ little remote-controlled boat being tested in the shadow of the century-old fleet.\nContact\n:", "summary": "Summer series - Students' projects (6/9).

{"id": 1003, "text": "Many drugs today are produced as powdered solids. But to fully understand how the active ingredients will behave once inside the body, scientists need to know their exact atomic-level structure. For instance, the way molecules are arranged inside a crystal has a direct impact on a compound’s properties, such as its solubility. Researchers are therefore working hard to develop technologies that can easily identify the exact crystal structures of microcrystalline powders.\nA team of EPFL scientists has now written a machine-learning program that can predict, in record time, how atoms will respond to an applied magnetic field. This can be combined with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the exact location of atoms in complex organic compounds. This can be of huge benefit to pharmaceutical companies, which must carefully monitor their molecules’ structures to meet requirements for patient safety. Their research has been published in \nNature Communications\n.\nBreakneck speeds with AI\nNMR spectroscopy is a well-known and highly efficient method for probing the magnetic fields between atoms and determining how neighboring atoms interact with each other. However, full crystal structure determination by NMR spectroscopy requires extremely complicated, time-consuming calculations involving quantum chemistry – nearly impossible for molecules with very intricate structures.\nBut the program developed at EPFL can overcome these obstacles. The scientists trained their AI model on molecular structures taken from structural databases. “Even for relatively simple molecules, this model is almost 10,000 times faster than existing methods, and the advantage grows tremendously when considering more complex compounds,” says Michele Ceriotti, head of the  at EPFL’s School of Engineering and co-author of the study. “To predict the NMR signature of a crystal with nearly 1,600 atoms, our technique – ShiftML – requires about six minutes; the same feat would have taken 16 years with conventional techniques.”\nThis new program will make it possible to use completely different approaches that will be faster and allow access to larger molecules. “This is really exciting because the massive acceleration in computation times will allow us to cover much larger conformational spaces and correctly determine structures where it was just not previously possible. This puts most of the complex contemporary drug molecules within reach,” says Lyndon Emsley, head of the  at EPFL's School of Basic Sciences and co-author of the study.\nThe program is now freely . “Anyone can upload a molecule and get its NMR signature in just a few minutes,” says Ceriotti.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a machine-learning approach that can be combined with experiments to determine, in record time, the location of atoms in powdered solids.

{"id": 1007, "text": "When researchers develop new therapies, such as for cancer, they need to be able to test them on models that closely resemble human tissue. Cell aggregates – groups of cells created in controlled laboratory conditions – represent a promising step in that direction. \nThe  at EPFL's School of Engineering, working in collaboration with the  at the University of Lyon, has developed a device the size of a microchip that can be used to create cell aggregates. This device employs electric fields to precisely control both the number and behavior of the cells used to form the aggregates. This study was recently published in the journal \n.\n“The utility of these aggregates can be seen in the field of electrochemotherapy, for example,” says EPFL post-doctoral researcher Jonathan Cottet, lead author of the study. In electrochemotherapy, electric fields applied to a tumor render the cell membranes permeable enough for cancer drugs to be introduced into the individual cancer cells. “But to improve and standardize this method, we need to be able to carry out tests on models that closely resemble tumors – and such models simply don't exist,” explains Dr. Cottet. “The only tests we can do at this point are at the cellular level.” \nThe newly developed device consists of microchannels and electrodes positioned on a plate the size of a microchip. A liquid, which in this study contained human embryonic kidney cells, flows through the microchannels. When the electric fields are turned on, the cells are “trapped” in the center of the device and form an aggregate. \n“We use a technique called dielectrophoresis to trap the cells,” says Dr. Cottet. “This involves applying electric fields that attract or repel the cells depending on the properties of both the cells and the liquid.” Throughout the process, the researchers control the precise number and type of cells that circulate, selecting the ones they want to form the aggregate. Once created, the aggregate can be released without coming apart. The device was manufactured in a clean room at EPFL and is reproducible.\nCell aggregates, because they are considered permanent, are an important step towards creating organoids of a desired size and composition.

{"id": 1008, "text": "Do you enjoy TV series where doctors and nurses become romantically involved (but not too much!), where there is some police action (but no too much violence!) and a bit of humor? How does one identify TV series that have just the right dose of all of these ingredients?\nFor a course on Big Data given by the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, a group of students developed their own unique project to do exactly that. Raphaël Von Aarburg, student leader, noticed that the usual tools used to recommend TV series all worked using the same formula: comparing the choices of Internet users among themselves. Based on the shared tastes of fans, these recommendations did not take the scenario into account. This was due to the fact that unlike textual information, it is difficult to analyze the content of TV series because they are comprised of two different formats: one sound track and one video track.\nThe solution? Using subtitles to analyze TV series\nHow can these large information flows comprising the content of TV series be processed and analyzed? “Our initiative was to analyze the subtitles contained in the audio track of TV series. Our group of eight students then got together to work on this new idea,” explains Raphaël Von Aarburg.\nThe students decided to write a software program to analyze the ingredients that go into a given scenario such as humor, romance, suspense or drama. More ambitious, the software program was also intended to identify narrative aspects such as drugs, crime or power through dialogues. For example, the TV series South Park is comprised of the following themes: 58% cartoon, 17% vice, 4% (counter-)terrorism, 4% politics et 17% less important themes. The next step was to use this data to recommend a given TV series to Internet users on the basis of the percentage of ingredients that they choose from among the 25 themes proposed by the software: College Life, Sexy, Family, Science, Science Fiction, Crime, Medical, Magic, Supernatural, Action, War, Investigation, etc.\nUsing mathematics to interpret words\nThe first challenge for students was to find a sequence of instructions (i.e. an adequate algorithm) that could group words into themes. “The difficulty was to find mathematical equations capable of categorizing words! This algorithm already existed in part: the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, this algorithm still needed to be decoded, adapted and implemented,” explains Simon-Pierre Genot, one of the students who found this phase of the project exciting. Adaptation meant adjusting the different operations in this algorithm so that several networked computers could perform these operations simultaneously. In IT terms, this is referred to as \"running the algorithm in parallel\". Doing this enables one to implement the algorithm, combining the power of several computers and delivering results far more quickly than what would be possible with a single machine.\nSecond challenge: the eight students had to retrieve the data (subtitles of TV series in English posted on various websites). To do this, the students wrote a series of scripts (i.e. programming code) to launch and coordinate execution of their software program. These scripts run in sequence to automatically search for all subtitles on the web. Once the data had been collected, the students began the cleaning process, i.e. automatically correcting errors such as spelling mistakes, removing duplicates, identifying onomatopoeias (Crash!, Bang!, etc.) and information for the hearing impaired…\nIn addition, the students had to eliminate all sorts of words such as connecting words (however, because, but, therefore, etc.), direct and indirect articles (the, a, an, some, any, etc.) and keep only essential words. “The power of this algorithm is that it does not merely sort words according to themes. It looks for significant words such as “vampire” or “surgery”, for example, not words like “Hello”, which can be found in all TV series,” explains Khalil Hajji, one of the students who devoted considerable time to the project. Preference is given to meaningful nouns and adjectives that allow one to characterize and categorize a given TV series. For the Big Bang Theory, for example, the top words are: earth, school, date, class, planet, party, mom, sex, universe, cool, kiss, fun, etc.\nA minuscule error in the code is enough\n“About a week before the deadline, nothing worked! The results produced by the algorithm were not relevant!” exclaims Khalil Hajji. Working hard, the students went through all of the project phases with a fine-toothed comb and found an error in one of the lines of code drawn from a publication. It was a small error that nevertheless prevented the algorithm from running in parallel. Although the algorithm was perfectly correct, the error in the simultaneous deployment on several computers skewed the students’ results. “We wrote to the author of the publication to report the error and he was very thankful,” recalls Raphaël Von Aarburg.\nIn order to make use of the results of this project, the students designed a website (). By entering the TV series of your choice in the search engine, the tool displays the themes associated with this TV series, their degree of importance, as well as the words most frequently used in the dialogues. The results are often rather funny. For example, the top words for the Game of Thrones are: sir, power, death, brother, lord, magic and king. For comparison, the top words for Breaking Bad are: car, cop, gun, detective, police, shoot and drug.\n“We used graphs to present data in a clear and appealing way,” explains Claire Musso, who greatly contributed to the final phase of the project. “It’s a bit like a map of the various TV series: each point represents a TV series. Between each TV series, there are connecting lines showing similarities. This allows us to see that TV series that take place at a hospital are “spatially and thematically” distant from the other TV series. In contrast, TV series set in police, criminal or political contexts tend to be very close on the map.”\nBritish versus American English\n“A very funny aspect in the results,” describes Simon-Pierre Genot “is that the algorithm is able to distinguish between British and American English with words such as \"mate\", \"lad\", \"blimey\", \"o'clock\" or even by paying attention to the number of repetitions of the word \"tea\". We therefore have a theme called \"British\" that includes such TV series as Doctor Who or Downton Abbey.”\nThe website also recommends similar TV series in terms of content preferred by Internet users. “Ideally,” explains Claire Musso “we would like to find a way to combine our tool with typical recommendation tools. This should help to optimize the results of both…“\nAnd all the students concur: “There were eight of us but we managed to work together in an excellent atmosphere and the support and guidance given to us by the PhD students was outstanding! We would therefore like to thank Professor Christoph Koch and his assistants for their help, Mohammed El Seidy and Amir Shaikha.”\nProject website: \nIC Students: Claire Musso, Florian Simond, Grigory Rozhdestvenskiy, Khalil Hajji, Nassim Drissi El Kamili, Nils Bouchardon, Simon-Pierre Génot and Raphaël von Aarburg", "summary": "What is your favorite TV series: Desperate Housewives, The Mentalist, Game of Thrones or Big Bang Theory?

{"id": 1010, "text": "Humans and most mammals can determine the spatial origin of sounds with remarkable acuity. We use this ability all the time -- crossing the street; locating an invisible ringing cell phone in a cluttered bedroom. To accomplish this small daily miracle, the brain has developed a circuit that’s rapid enough to detect the tiny lag that occurs between the moment the auditory information reaches one of our ears, and the moment it reaches the other. The mastermind of this circuit is the “Calyx of Held,” the largest known synapse in the brain. EPFL scientists have revealed the role that a certain protein plays in initiating the growth of these giant synapses. The discovery, published in Nature Neuroscience, could also help shed light on a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.\nEnormous synapses enable faster communication\nOrdinarily, neurons have thousands of contact points – known as synapses - with neighboring neurons. Within a given time frame, a neuron has to receive several signals from its neighbors in order to be able to fire its own signal in response. Because of this, information passes from neuron to neuron in a relatively random manner. \n In the auditory part of the brain, this is not the case. Synapses often grow to extremely large sizes, and these behemoths are known as “Calyx of Held” synapses. Because they have hundreds of contact points, they are capable of transmitting a signal singlehandedly to a neighboring neuron. “It’s almost like one-to-one communication between neurons,” explains EPFL professor Ralf Schneggenburger, who led the study. The result is that information is processed extremely quickly, in a few fractions of a millisecond, instead of the slower pace of more than 10 milliseconds that occurs in most other neuronal circuits.\nIdentifying the protein\nTo isolate the protein responsible for controlling the growth of this gigantic synapse, the scientists had to perform painstaking research. Using methods for analyzing gene expression in mice, they identified several members of the “BMP” family of proteins from among more than 20,000 possible candidates. \n To verify that they had truly identified the right protein, the researchers disabled BMP protein receptors in the auditory part of a mouse brain. “The resulting electrophysiological signal of the Calyx of Held was significantly altered,” explains Le Xiao, first author on the study. “This would suggest a large anatomical difference.”", "summary": "How do we locate the spatial position of sounds?

{"id": 1011, "text": "Researchers at EPFL have come up with a new middle infrared light source that can detect greenhouse and other gases, as well as molecules in a person’s breath. The compact system, which resembles a tiny suitcase, contains just two parts: a standard laser together with a photonic chip measuring a few millimeters across. The research is detailed in an article published in .\nThe mid-infrared spectrum is especially useful for scientists because, at this wavelength range, light can detect particles that play an important role in the environment and in human health. Until now, however, infrared laser systems have proven difficult to transport because they involve complex, damage-prone hardware.\nThe new technology, developed by researchers at EPFL, could be a game-changer. The team took a commercially available fiber laser and combined it with a micrometer waveguide chip to reliably generate light waves in the mid-infrared spectrum. They then added a spectrometer to demonstrate the potential of this light source, successfully detecting the presence and concentration of acetylene, a colorless and highly flammable gas.\nHow does it work? \nThe system uses a compact and robust fiber laser that emits light in a specific wavelength range. The beam is directed through a waveguide, measuring one micrometer (0.001 mm) across and half a millimeter long, which can alter the frequency of the light as it passes through. The system produces light in the mid-infrared spectrum, retaining 30% of the original signal strength. The researchers can even tune the wavelength of the light by adjusting the waveguide’s geometry.\n“This device sets a new benchmark for efficiency,” says Davide Grassani, one of the authors of the paper. “This is the first time anyone has created a fully integrated spectroscopic laser source. It does away with the painstaking process of precisely aligning all the parts in a conventional laser system.”\nThe breakthrough came after the team refined key aspects of the system’s design – the waveguide geometry and material, and the wavelength of the original laser source. “Coming up with such a simple yet efficient and sturdy system involved a lot of design work,” says Camille Brès, project coordinator and head of the Photonic Systems Laboratory, part of EPFL’s School of Engineering.\nOn-chip spectroscopy\nThis advancement paves the way for miniaturized mid-IR technologies – a wavelength range that scientists rarely get to work with. “Once we’ve developed the system further, we could well see on-chip detectors that scientists can easily carry out into the field,” adds Brès.\nThe technology draws on research conducted at the , headed by Camille Brès, and the , headed by Tobias Kippenberg (STI/SB).", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a simple mid-infrared laser source that can be used to detect pollution in the air or molecules in someone’s breath.

{"id": 1019, "text": "This four-day workshop was organized by EPFL’s International Risk Governance Center (). We spoke with Marie-Valentine Florin, the Center’s executive director, about IRGC’s role at EPFL.\nHow can synthetic biology be used improperly or maliciously?\nSynthetic biologists are able to construct new biological systems and functions with applications in energy, health care and farming. Yet these same technologies can also be hijacked to create potentially dangerous pathogens for which there is no known treatment.\nSo as researchers, we need to ask ourselves what we can do to advance science and technology for the common good while at the same time managing the risks of “dual-use” research, or research that can be turned against people or the environment.\nThe EPFL workshop, which was funded by NATO’s Science for Peace and Security Programme, gave scientists, national and international regulators, security agencies and businesses a chance to pool their expertise in order to clarify the causes and potential consequences of these risks and refine existing response strategies.\nThe working groups formed during the workshop will now turn their discussions into a report and a book discussing the various problems, current and potential future solutions, existing obstacles and recommendations. The workshop participants explored both the failure of well-intentioned researchers to take necessary precautions and the impact of their negligence, as well as the danger that knowledge or material will be used for malevolent purposes.\nWhat is ?\nIRGC was created by EPFL in 2017 to serve as a forum for cross-disciplinary dialogue on complex, uncertain and ambiguous risks – which are often a counterpart to opportunities. Our goal is to give policymakers the information they need to make decisions based on solid scientific and technological foundations.\nMost technologies are aimed at reducing existing risks – think climate change, diseases and natural disasters – and this is something that should be promoted by public policies. It is also essential to create positive incentives through targeted research programs, financial support, and standards that reward performance gains. But new dangers can always arise, and this is where IRGC comes in. Our recommendations are meant to highlight key risks and challenges and help identify possible strategies to deal with them.\nWe have a dual mission. First, we seek to develop widely applicable risk governance concepts and instruments. Risk governance refers to the processes, standards, regulations and structures that come into play when risk-related decisions have to be made. This includes assessing, managing and communicating about risks with the involvement of the various stakeholders. We then issue recommendations, mainly for public policymakers, about how to manage the risks posed by some emerging technologies.\nWhy does EPFL need IRGC?\nAll major universities around the world have an institute or center that studies the link between technology and public policy. The concept of risk is central because it is what justifies public intervention. Yet the risk governance approach that we take encompasses more than simple risk management. For a university like EPFL, it means creating the conditions necessary for new technologies to be adopted. For example, we commonly recommend that new technological applications must not only improve existing performance in some way, but they must also be economically viable and generally responsible, i.e. socially acceptable and environmentally respectful.\nOur role at EPFL is to answer researchers’ questions about such topics. We can also be more proactive in certain areas, such as insisting on the importance of taking cultural differences into account when assessing risk acceptability – in genome editing, for example – and raising awareness of the role and place of ethics in researchers’ work.\nWhat is IRGC currently working on?\nOur work is focused on two of EPFL’s areas of expertise: digitalization and life sciences. In digitalization, this year we are working on deepfakes, which is when text, audio or video content is falsified in order to mislead or manipulate people. We’re looking at what steps can be taken to ensure machine learning is used to improve diagnostics, predictions and decisions without being applied to actually producing deepfakes as well.

The series included captivating presentations from best-selling author Yuval Noah Harari and 2018 Fields Medal-winning mathematician Alessio Figalli.\nE for Education\n. For its 50th anniversary year, EPFL shone a spotlight on its three missions, the first of which – alphabetically – is education. On 17 May, the School held an  for over 300 teachers, guidance counselors and other education practitioners. The event was an opportunity to take a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, how to teach science and manage the transition from high school to college. The key takeaway from the day came in a speech by Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University, who said: “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing.”\nI for Innovation\n. The School’s second mission, again in alphabetical order, is innovation – a theme that also had its own dedicated event with an  in late November. That’s when EPFL invited industry leaders and successful entrepreneurs to talk about their research partnerships and joint ventures with EPFL and how such initiatives help foster innovative thinking. The very next day, the School also held its very first , where attendees had an opportunity to learn about many of EPFL’s startups – from budding enterprises to late-stage companies.\nN for New Logo\n. After a long wait, and some trepidation, EPFL’s new logo finally arrived. And we’re happy to report that it’s been embraced with open arms. That much is clear from the many snapshots of the logo standing proud on the new Place Maurice Cosandey, often with a smiling crowd beside it – and in some cases on top of it!\nO for Open Science\n... Open science is set to be one of the biggest battles in science in the coming decade. And EPFL is deeply involved, giving open and reproducible research the attention it deserves. On 18 October, the School held an , inviting world-class researchers and science policymakers to share their thoughts on some pressing questions at this time of crucial change.\n...\nand for \n.

Some 1,500 staff and students pitched in, organizing around 300 public events. Highlights included the Scientastic science fair, Drone Days, and activities led by star names such as Fred Courant, Physics Girl and Aleksi Briclot.\nR for Research\n.

The team working on the Blue Brain Project at EPFL, led by Professor Henry Markram, however, is offering radically new evidence that this may not be the whole story. The researchers were able to demonstrate that small clusters of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex interconnect according to a set of immutable and relatively simple rules. They published their discovery in an article that appeared in the last issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n These clusters contain an estimated fifty neurons, on average. The scientists look at them as essential building blocks, which contain in themselves a kind of fundamental, innate knowledge – for example, representations of certain simple workings of the physical world. Acquired knowledge, such as memory, would involve combining these elementary building blocks at a higher level of the system. “This could explain why we all share similar perceptions of physical reality, while our memories reflect our individual experience”, explains Markram.\n The principle determining the formation of these microcircuits is astonishingly simple. Basically, when two neurons are each connected to the same neighboring neuron, the probability that they are also interconnected is greater than average. The researchers were able to build a statistical model based on this observation.\n When the scientists tested in vitro neuronal circuits from different rats, they all presented very similar characteristics. If the circuits had only been formed from the experiences lived by the different animals, the values should have diverged considerably from one individual to the next. Thus, the neuronal connectivity must in some way have been programmed in advance. \n \"Since John Lock, about 400 years ago, research into how the brain learns and remembers has been guided by the belief that we start from a clean slate and then print memories with each new experience. The idea that memory is like building lego with fundamental building blocks of knowledge opens up an entirely new door for research\", explains Markram.\n Current technology is now allowing us to qualify the “tabula rasa” hypothesis, which argues that our brains are a “blank slate” at birth, and we only gain knowledge through experience. It’s an idea that has permeated science for centuries. There is no question that knowledge, in the sense that we typically understand it (reading and writing, recognizing our friends, learning a language), is the result of our experiences. But the EPFL team’s work demonstrates that some of our fundamental representations or basic knowledge is inscribed in our genes. This discovery redistributes the balance between innate and acquired, and represents a considerable advance in our understanding of how the brain works.", "summary": "Do we have innate knowledge?

{"id": 1024, "text": "For weeks, the huge fires that consumed Australia at the beginning of this year were front-page news – and a major cause of global concern. Now, Siberia – Russia’s northernmost region – is experiencing wildfires after record spring heat, with temperatures sometimes exceeding 30 degrees in May and an average of 10 degrees above seasonal standards. In 2019, unusually widespread fires swept through a million hectares of forest in the region. And there are indications that so-called “zombie” fires, which survived the winter, are re-emerging across the Russian Arctic.\nClimate scientists warn that this kind of event will become increasingly commonplace in the future, and studies have even shown that climate change had greatly increased the risk of the massive fire event in Australia. But what about the long-term consequences for the environment, the climate and our health? We asked Athanasios Nenes, who leads EPFL’s Laboratory of Atmospheric Processes and their Impacts (LAPI), for his views. Nenes is one of the world’s foremost experts in atmospheric processes and suspended particulate matter (aerosols). His current research, which is funded by the European Research Council, focuses on the impact of biomass-burning aerosols on health and climate.\nWhat do these new fires in Siberia tell us about how the climate is changing? \n\"These fires are perhaps even more concerning than the ones in Australia. They have the potential to accelerate warming in the Arctic, which is already heating up much more quickly than the rest of the planet. The vast Arctic peatlands, which are sustained by permafrost, are now thawing. This can release huge amounts of carbon back into the atmosphere. Peat is also flammable. Once ignited by a lightning strike, it can burn for weeks to months. The embers can even survive the winter, reigniting a large fire the following summer. Fires have a dual effect: as well as melting permafrost directly, they also darken the surface. This further accelerates the melting of permafrost and ice because a darker surface absorbs more of the sun’s heat. Decaying peatlands can also emit large quantities of methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas.\nHow does the vegetation influence the kind of plumes and gases released into the atmosphere?\nThe vegetation is quite different according to the regions, and variations in carbon content can affect emissions. But combustion temperature is a much more important factor in determining what’s emitted into the atmosphere. We talk about two types of fire: flaming (high-temperature) fires and smoldering (low-temperature) fires. Emissions of toxic compounds, aerosols and precursors tend to be higher in the smoldering phase because the combustion is incomplete. Flaming fires tend to emit more CO\n2\n and black carbon (soot), both of which can warm the climate. Peat fires tend to be smoldering, meaning they can burn for weeks or months on end. The vast amount of smoke they produce causes regional haze, and of course they release large amounts of CO\n2\n and methane – two greenhouse gases – into the atmosphere.\nFire and smoke in Siberia in Summer 2019. (c)Greenpeace Russia\nWe know that these fires release toxic particles that can affect our respiratory systems. Does this mean people might be more vulnerable to the virulent version of the COVID-19? \nAbsolutely. The populations in urban environments and other locations that are exposed to high levels of pollutants are more likely to have compromised respiratory, cardiac and immune systems and even conditions like dementia and diabetes – and are therefore more vulnerable to infection from the coronavirus. Biomass-burning smoke is particularly toxic, containing a large number of carcinogens, as well as compounds that cause oxidative stress upon inhalation. Besides, the effects of smoke aren’t only felt near the source – where’s it most apparent to people – but also much further away, where the particles have become diluted and indistinguishable from the background. So even if you don’t see the smoke, its effects are still there – on both health and climate. A recently published study showed that this old, background smoke can have just as big an effect on climate as freshly emitted smoke.\nIs the next big fire event likely to be in the Amazon rainforest again?\nThe real question is whether climate change will place increasing stress on the planet’s large forested areas. And the answer is yes. The Amazon in particular is suffering from many decades of severe deforestation, which, together with wildfires, is vastly accelerating the rate of loss. It’s estimated that, at some point, the rainforest will collapse because it won’t be able to maintain the rainwater needed to sustain it.\nWhat are the long-term effects of the huge fires we’re seeing in many parts of the world? \nThere are many effects. First, on the ground, these fires can dramatically alter ecosystems. When trees are seriously damaged, they take a long time to regenerate and may never recover. Because forests store water, they act like a buffer. Once they’re gone, that buffer – and the associated water – is eventually lost, leading to desertification. This is certainly possible for Australia, and for other drought-prone parts of the world. And also because of land-use change from human encroachment. We see that a lot in Brazil: after forest fires, the “free land” is used for agriculture, cattle farms and other uses..\nForest fires also release a lot of particulate matter into the atmosphere, where it can remain for weeks on end. These particles are transported all over the world, affecting air quality over vast regions. They contain soot and brown-colored molecules that absorb sunlight, thereby accelerating climate warming. And if they fall on ice and snow – as we’ve seen in the Arctic from fires in Siberia – they can darken these normally highly reflective surfaces and cause them to melt more quickly. Smoke from the fires in Australia turned the surface of some glaciers in New Zealand orangey-brown, and there’s evidence to suggest that it even reached coastal areas of the Antarctic.\nAnd of course, the CO\n2\n trapped in these forests – some of which is relatively ancient – gets released back into the atmosphere. Smoke also contains nutrients like nitrogen and iron. Eventually, these nutrients are deposited on the ground or over the oceans, where they act as a fertilizer. But in general, burning biomass – either in forests or in grasslands – can alter the climate in many different ways. Some are immediate, while others are much more long-term.\nWhy will this kind of event be more frequent in the future?\nBecause of changes in precipitation and temperature, land-use change, and other effects associated with climate change and human activities. Many areas are already experiencing extended droughts and are much more susceptible to vast fires. But fires aren’t always a bad thing. They’re part of the natural cycle of ecosystems, some of which have evolved to need fire to germinate seeds. But the problem is that climate change could throw ecosystems “off balance” and lead to catastrophic fires, like the ones we’ve seen in Australia and Siberia, but also in the Mediterranean, for example. Biomass burning, which is a persistent seasonal feature in the region, will likely get worse.\nCan we offset the loss by planting large numbers of trees?\nForest management can indeed help mitigate some of the effects of climate change. It isn’t an easy task either, and dealing with the disappearance of a forest the size of a city is a very different proposition from one the size of Switzerland. The magnitude of the problem is the big deal here. And these aren’t just onetime events. They’ll happen again and again, and in areas of the world that have rarely seen them before. You only have to look at the Sweden fires in the summer of 2018, or the fires in Greenland, to see the direct consequences of climate change in action.\nThe plumes of smoke are visible on the satellite images. Here, the Australian fires in early 2020. (c)NASA\nHow do the effects differ if the smoke stays in one area or spreads in the atmosphere?\nIt depends how much smoke is produced, and how often. Large fires tend to generate considerable amounts of smoke, which persists for weeks in the atmosphere. You can see it in satellite images. It interacts with sunlight, affects clouds and impacts the climate. Fortunately, particles don’t stay in the atmosphere forever. But if you have more frequent fires, you basically have a lot more particles in the air all the time, with impacts on the climate, visibility, and the health of living beings. In Europe, for instance, sometimes half or more of the particle mass we breathe can be attributed to fires – either forest fires in summer or wood burning in winter. In other words, we’re continuously breathing smoke. Now imagine if forest fires become more frequent and prevalent. That will clearly mean we will breath unhealthier air. For humans and many ecosystems, having more fires is just not a good thing.\"\nTo go further:\nForest fires in 2019:\nGlobal Forest Watch:\nFire Information for Resource Management System:\nEarth Data, Nasa:\n Earth Observatory, Nasa:", "summary": "After Australia, Siberia is burning, indicating that the frequency of such events is on the rise, with myriad dire consequences: devastated ecosystems, risk of desertification, CO\n2\n emissions, toxic particles, further climate impacts...

Not really, according to a study by EPFL’s Swiss Finance Institute, recently published in the journal Social Science Research Network.\nThe researchers analyzed the performance and data of 350 American banks between the two most recent important financial crises: involving the Russian debt of 1998 and then the subprime crisis of 2007-2008. A sample of this study concerns both large and small institutions, and includes investment banks, savings banks, and commercial banks.\n“Those which had performed poorly during the first crisis were also adversely affected during the second”, notes Rüdiger Fahlenbrach, Tenure Track Assistant Professor at the College of Management of Technology, who, with his team, looked into the reasons behind these results.\nThey noticed in particular that the Managing Director in charge at the time had very little influence on the performance of these companies. Neither does it depend on the nature of the two crises, both called “the most serious crisis of the last 50 years”, but caused by very different phenomena. In 1998, Russia was not able to meet its debts, which created a chain reaction, with investors registering big losses and trying to get rid of their shares quickly. In 2007, the crisis was essentially caused by a poor estimation of the risks associated with mortgage debts and the over-estimation of the value of certain investments (mortgage-backed securities).\nRisk-taking in re-financing doesn’t pay\n“Contrary to popular belief, small institutions are often less affected by crises – it’s the big banks that are worst affected”, Rüdiger Fahlenbrach points out. “The determining factor is in fact the business model chosen at the beginning.”\nAccording to this expert, the methods used by banks to finance their debts – which are very difficult to sell off or to re-finance in times of crisis – is crucial. The study confirms that the institutions that use these methods in the short-term, and that have only limited capital, will perform less well in the event of a crisis. Those banks that opt for aggressive growth and excessive risk are also among the more fragile institutions. One reason why these companies are reluctant to change their model is that it serves them well when the markets are booming.\nThe message of the research – based on experimental work and empirical data – is to have more capital and less financing in the short term.

Our hair turns grey, our strength wanes, and a slew of age-related diseases represent what is happening at the cellular and molecular levels. Aging affects all the cells in our body’s different tissues, and understanding its impact would be of great value in fighting this eternal enemy of all ephemeral life forms.\nThe key is to first observe and measure. In a paper published in \nCell Reports\n, scientists led by Johan Auwerx at EPFL started by asking a simple question: how do the tissues of aging mice differ from those of mice that are mere adults?\nTo answer the question, the researchers used the multiple techniques to measure the expression of everyone one of the thousands of mouse’s genes, and to identify any underlying epigenetic differences. The researchers not only measured different layers of information, but they did it across three different tissues: liver, heart, and muscle.\nThe data collectively allowed them to define an aging “footprint” that can serve as a field for investigation. But while many of the known aging manifestations were recovered, different tissues behaved differently.\n“We will never have a thorough understanding of aging by studying a single tissue, and this applies to many other processes and diseases,” says lead author Maroun Bou Sleiman. “Data, whether freshly produced or reused, is the key to understanding complex systems, and we are just scratching the surface.”\nThrough multiple bioinformatics analyses, the scientists identified certain genes and proteins that may be controlling the complex aging process. By including human population data, they also showed that many of the “players” they identified in the mouse genome may be also relevant in human aging.\nFinally, the researchers used human genetic data to show that some of the “players” may also explain why some humans live longer than others. “Our final goal is not to stop ageing, but to age better and disease-free, and to do that, we will need to characterize this system,” says Johan Auwerx. “This is a perfect example of cross-species integration starting from the laboratory mouse and ending in human population data that takes us one step closer to understanding one of the most complex processes in biology.”\nProfessor Johan Auwerx’s lab is part of EPFL’s \n, situated in the\n.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have measured the molecular footprint that aging leaves on various mouse and human tissues.

{"id": 1030, "text": "Are pomegranates really the superfood we’ve been led to believe will counteract the aging process? Up to now, scientific proof has been fairly weak. And some controversial marketing tactics have led to skepticism as well. A team of scientists from EPFL and the company Amazentis wanted to explore the issue by taking a closer look at the secrets of this plump pink fruit. They discovered that a molecule in pomegranates, transformed by microbes in the gut, enables muscle cells to protect themselves against one of the major causes of aging. In nematodes and rodents, the effect is nothing short of amazing. Human clinical trials are currently underway, but these initial findings have already been published in the journal \nNature Medicine. \nAs we age, our cells increasingly struggle to recycle their powerhouses. Called mitochondria, these inner compartments are no longer able to carry out their vital function, thus accumulate in the cell. This degradation affects the health of many tissues, including muscles, which gradually weaken over the years. A buildup of dysfunctional mitochondria is also suspected of playing a role in other diseases of aging, such as Parkinson’s disease.\nOne molecule plays David against the Goliath of aging \n The scientists identified a molecule that, all by itself, managed to re-establish the cell’s ability to recycle the components of the defective mitochondria: urolithin A. “It’s the only known molecule that can relaunch the mitochondrial clean-up process, otherwise known as mitophagy,” says Patrick Aebischer, co-author on the study. “It’s a completely natural substance, and its effect is powerful and measurable.”\nThe team started out by testing their hypothesis on the usual suspect: the nematode C. elegans. It’s a favorite test subject among aging experts, because after just 8-10 days it’s already considered elderly. The lifespan of worms exposed to urolithin A increased by more than 45% compared with the control group.\nThese initial encouraging results led the team to test the molecule on animals that have more in common with humans. In the rodent studies, like with C. elegans, a significant reduction in the number of mitochondria was observed, indicating that a robust cellular recycling process was taking place. Older mice, around two years of age, showed 42% better endurance while running than equally old mice in the control group.\nHuman testing underway\n Before heading out to stock up on pomegranates, however, it’s worth noting that the fruit doesn’t itself contain the miracle molecule, but rather its precursor. That molecule is converted into urolithin A by the microbes that inhabit the intestine. Because of this, the amount of urolithin A produced can vary widely, depending on the species of animal and the flora present in the gut microbiome. Some individuals don’t produce any at all. If you’re one of the unlucky ones, it’s possible that pomegranate juice won’t do you any good.\nFor those without the right microbes in their guts, however, the scientists are already working on a solution. The study’s co-authors founded a start-up company, Amazentis, which has developed a method to deliver finely calibrated doses of urolithin A. The company is currently conducting first clinical trials testing the molecule in humans in European hospitals.\nDarwin at your service: parallel evolution makes good dinner partners\n According to study co-author Johan Auwerx, it would be surprising if urolithin A weren’t effective in humans. “Species that are evolutionarily quite distant, such as C elegans and the rat, react to the same substance in the same way. That’s a good indication that we’re touching here on an essential mechanism in living organisms.”\nUrolithin A’s function is the product of tens of millions of years of parallel evolution between plants, bacteria and animals. According to Chris Rinsch, co-author and CEO of Amazentis, this evolutionary process explains the molecule’s effectiveness: “Precursors to urolithin A are found not only in pomegranates, but also in smaller amounts in many nuts and berries. Yet for it to be produced in our intestines, the bacteria must be able to break down what we’re eating. When, via digestion, a substance is produced that is of benefit to us, natural selection favors both the bacteria involved and their host. Our objective is to follow strict clinical validations, so that everyone can benefit from the result of these millions of years of evolution.”\nThe EPFL scientists’ approach provides a whole new palette of opportunities to fight the muscular degeneration that takes place as we age, and possibly also to counteract other effects of aging. By helping the body to renew itself, urolithin A could well succeed where so many pharmaceutical products, most of which have tried to increase muscle mass, have failed. Auwerx, who has also published a recent discovery about the anti-aging effects of another molecule in the journal \nScience, \nemphasizes the game-changing importance of these studies. “The nutritional approach opens up territory that traditional pharma has never explored. It’s a true shift in the scientific paradigm.”\nPress material \nPress kit (photos, video, article, TV B-roll with 3D animation): \nYoutube video (embeddable): \nContact\nLionel Pousaz, EPFL Press Service,  or +41 79 559 71 61", "summary": "Pomegranates have proven their anti-aging potential: intestinal bacteria transform a molecule contained in the fruit with spectacular results.

We’ve known about this phenomenon for quite some time, dating back nearly to the discovery of penicillin. For more than 50 years, scientists have believed that the resistant bacteria were individuals that had stopped growing and dividing.\nUp to now, in fact, it hasn’t been possible to track the growth of cells before and after their exposure to antibiotics, which makes any analysis of the phenomenon quite imprecise. “Using microfluidics, we can now observe every bacterium individually, instead of having to count a population,” says John McKinney, director of EPFL’s Microbiology and Microsystems Laboratory (LMIC).\nActive survivors\n This new tool has revealed quite a few surprises. “We thought that surviving bacteria made up a fixed population that stopped dividing, but instead we found that some of them continued to divide and others died. The persistent population is thus very dynamic, and the cells that constitute it are constantly changing – even though the total number of cells remains the same. Because they’re dividing, the bacteria can mutate and thus develop resistance in the presence of the antibiotic,” explains LMIC scientist Neeraj Dhar.\nThis point is extremely important. “We were able to eliminate a purely genetic explanation of the phenomenon,” continues Dhar. In other words, “a population of genetically identical bacteria consists of individuals with widely varying behavior. Some of them can adapt to stressors that they have not previously encountered, thanks to the selection of persistent individuals. This could lead to a revision of the entire theory of adaptation,” says McKinney.\nIntermittent efficiency\n The EPFL scientists were particularly interested in a relative of the tuberculosis bacterium. Their observations enabled them to formally challenge the argument that persistent bacteria are those that have stopped growing and dividing. “We were able to reveal the role of an enzyme whose presence is necessary in order for the antibiotic to work, and show that the bacilli produced this enzyme in a pulsatile and random manner,” explains Dhar. “Our measurements showed that bacterial death correlated more closely with the expression of this enzyme than with their growth factor.” The research is being published this week in .\nThese conclusions could mark the beginning of a new theory of bacterial resistance, or perhaps even introduce a new view of how such resistance evolves. Further research is being done using other microorganisms, such as tuberculosis and E. coli bacteria. The persistence of some cancer cells to treatment could also be studied in a different manner. “It’s a new approach for trying to figure out why some infections are so difficult to eliminate.

They also created the Ouchy Film Awards, which are held in Lausanne.\nBut what sets this new video streaming service apart from all the others available online? “There are more than five billion videos on YouTube, for instance, and you get about 63 million hits if you search for ‘short film’. It’s really difficult to narrow down your search, and the quality of the films you get is not always great,” says Sami Arpa, one of the co-founders of Sofy.tv. Arpa notes that other services offer very few shorts and require film makers to pay a fee to add their films to the catalog.\nTattooed video\nComputer-vision and deep-learning specialist Sami Arpa and his partner Vassilis Kalofolias, an artificial intelligence expert, wanted to use their digital expertise to offer film makers a way to market their films through a smart website.\nThey integrated several technologies developed in their laboratories, including a now-patented tempocodes system that protects films against piracy. With this system, film makers can take a photo of a screen showing their film, and the camera will reveal a hidden image.

The software will eventually be capable of judging the quality of the films submitted by film makers in order to pick out the best ones for the Sofy.tv catalog.\nAnother innovative feature to be integrated into the service is a dynamic video filter that makes it possible to view a film with or without the violent scenes. “Current parental control options tend to block the whole film,” explains Arpa. “But with our filter, you can watch films as a family without the inappropriate scenes.” The researcher won’t reveal any more about that feature for the moment, as the results of their work are due to be published shortly.\nPress Kit\nSandy Evangelista\n EPFL Press Service\n +41 79 502 81 06\nSami Arpa\n Doctoral Assistant\n +41 21 69 31272\n +41 78 908 7502\nVassilis Kalofolias\n +41 78 890 73 69\nSabine Süsstrunk\n Director of EPFL’s Image and Visual Representation Lab\n +41 21 69 36664\n +41 79 391 52 84", "summary": "A new cutting-edge streaming service, Sofy.tv, offers short-film makers a free and secure platform for showcasing their work.

The study just appeared in the journal Nature Chemical Biology.\nPause button\nAcr (Anti-CRISPR) proteins are powerful tools to control CRISPR-Cas technologies. However, the available Acr repertoire is limited to naturally occurring variants. In order to make the breakthrough, the team had to think laterally. “Our artificial protein is an upgrade to proteins existent in nature”, says Prof. Correia of EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI). “We went back to the drawing board and applied structural design principles to enhance the natural version of the protein. In other words, we designed this molecule by simulating many possible variants in the computer and identified the most promising ones.”\n As a synthetic protein, AcrX can fulfill functions that are beyond the reach of naturally occurring proteins. In this case, it acts like a pause button, giving scientists greater control over CRISPR-Cas9. “Inhibitory proteins occur in nature, but the artificial one we’ve developed is much more effective. It can, for instance, fully block CRISPR activity an avoid off-target editing, thereby making genome editing much safer. This might, in the future, become highly relevant for therapeutic genome editing directly within patients with genetic disorders” adds Correia.\nCRISPR-Cas molecular scissors\nCRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. Put simply, it is a genome-editing tool that works like a pair of high-precision molecular scissors, snipping away target DNA that can then be discarded or replaced with other genetic material. But it comes with a catch: It is typically difficult to stop CRISPR’s editing activity after inserting it into cells or a living organism. “When CRISPR-Cas9 gets to work inside cells, it can have potentially toxic or disease-causing off-target effects,” explains Zander Harteveld, a doctoral assistant at the LPDI. “The likelihood of these off-target effects increases with time. That’s why it’s so important to have a pause button.” The AcrX protein serves precisely that purpose.\nThe new protein is the result of 18 months of research. The next step for the team is to optimize the delivery of the protein in cells and see how it can work \nin vivo\n. Ultimately, their discovery could pave the way for safer, more effective and better-targeted gene therapies.", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have developed an artificial protein that can keep the CRISPR genome-editing tool on its tracks.

{"id": 1053, "text": "Train travel may be fast, but mobile connectivity onboard often lags behind. This is because the modern train car is a metal box that blocks out microwaves – in physics, this is called a Faraday cage. Even the windows contain an ultra-thin metal coating to improve thermal insulation. But EPFL researchers, working with manufacturing partners, have developed a new type of window that guarantees a comfortable temperature for passengers while at the same time letting mobile phone signals through.\nIn the rail industry, energy use is critical: around one third of the energy consumed by trains goes into providing heating and air conditioning in the train cars. And around 3% of this escapes through the windows. Double-glazed windows with an ultra-thin metal coating increase energy efficiency by a factor of four compared with untreated windows.\nBut the problem is that the metal sharply weakens the telecommunication signals. The solution that mobile phone operators and railway companies have used until now consists of placing signal boosters – or repeaters – in the trains. But they are expensive to install and maintain and have to be replaced regularly to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies. And each repeater consumes electricity.\nA laser-scribed coating\nAndreas Schüler, from EPFL’s Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Conversion Group, had another idea: “A metal coating that reflects heat waves (which are micrometric in size) but lets through both visible light (which is nanometric in size) and the electromagnetic waves of mobile phones (microwaves, which are centimetric in size).” But how is this done? “We breach the Faraday cage by modifying the metal coating with a special laser treatment. The windows then let the signals through,” said Schüler, a specialist in the optical and electronic properties of ultra-thin coatings.\nTo do this, a special structure is scribed into the metal coating with the aid of a high-precision laser. No more than 2.5% of the surface area of the metal coating is ablated by laser scribing. The resulting pattern is nearly invisible to the naked eye and does not affect the window’s insulating properties.\nA manufacturing partnership pays off\nInitial laboratory tests were extremely convincing. Several manufacturing partners were brought into the team in order to apply the method on a large scale. Thanks to the skills of glassmaker AGC Verres Industriels and the expertise of Class4Laser, prototype glass samples were produced and tested. “Measurements taken by experts from the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) have demonstrated that this works,” said Schüler.\nEnergy savings for BLS\nBut the innovative glass needed to prove its mettle under real-life conditions. BLS was enthusiastic about testing the new windows as part of ongoing studies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of its trains. The first full-size windows were produced in the AGC Verres Industriels workshop and installed throughout a NINA-type self-propelled regional train.\nThe field tests met the partners’ expectations. Swisscom and SUPSI tested the efficacy of the new windows, both in BLS’s workshops and on the Bern-Thun train line. “Mobile reception is just as good in the train through laser-treated insulating glass as it is through ordinary glass,” said Schüler.\nAs a result, BLS has decided to install the new windows in most of its 36 NINA regional trains, replacing the old, non-insulating windows. Installation will begin in September 2016 as part of the company’s train modernization program. “Our commitment will help bring to market an innovative product designed to improve the energy efficiency of trains without compromising mobile reception for passengers,” said Quentin Sauvagnat, NINA fleet manager at BLS. Thanks to this product, those expensive signal repeaters will no longer be needed.\nAre frequency-selective buildings next?\nThis proven and developed technology could be applied to buildings next. This is because, according to Schüler, “some glass buildings also act like Faraday cages. And as the internet of things continues to grow, there is a real interest in improving the properties of building materials that allow mobile signals through. More broadly, by making materials more frequency-selective, we could, for example, imagine a building that lets electromagnetic waves through but blocks Wi-Fi waves, thus enhancing corporate security.”\nThe Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Conversion Group is part of EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory \nLESO-PB.

This therapy, using equipment that fits into a small briefcase, works using virtual reality. It consists of a screen, a webcam, a pair of dark glasses, a helmet fitted with electrodes, and a glove: the patient puts on the equipment, presses “ON” and the session starts. This ease of use makes it suitable for daily practice at home. “The first few weeks are known to be the most important for recovery. This is when many people give up”, emphasizes Tej Tadi, founder of MindMaze, the start-up based at The Garage – EPFL’s breeding-ground for new companies – which is developing the \"Nano\".\nMaking progress using an avatar \n The physiotherapy is based on a simple principle: observing the scene that is supposed to represent us is enough, gradually, to reactivate the damaged region of the brain. When the patient moves his active hand, he actually sees the 3D avatar of his disabled limb moving through his glasses. This activates a region of the cortex adjacent to the damaged area, which then slowly takes over. \n The exercises are then carried out with the disabled limb: stretching the arm, picking up an object, or pointing at something.\nDoctors can access real-time data\n The electrodes fitted to the helmet provide constant data on the brain’s activity. Transmitted via the internet with a 3D-image of the brain, these enable the medical staff to see the changes in the patient’s brain directly, while remaining at the hospital, and to give him instructions. The patient can follow his progress through the display of this data in the form of a graphic.\n The system is due to be marketed by the end of this year. It’s currently in the preclinical trials stage at the Vaud canton’s university hospital (CHUV). For now it would seem that mobility is also being recovered more rapidly than with the programs currently on offer. \n Every year 10,000 people in Switzerland and 12 million worldwide are affected by a CVA. “We began by suggesting a device designed to rehabilitate the arm, because this is the main handicap for 75% of patients who have undergone a CVA”, emphasizes Tej Tadi, who developed this technology during his doctoral work at the EPFL Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience. \n An EPFL spin-off company, the MindMaze start-up has already won several awards, including the Venture Leaders in 2010 and PERL (Prix Entreprendre Région Lausanne), the prize awarded by the Association of communes of the Lausanne region, in March last year.

{"id": 1072, "text": "If plasmas can be controlled, then it may one day be possible to use nuclear fusion as an energy source. As in stars, however, this ultra-hot material is constantly boiling, which makes it hard to control in a reactor. Instabilities in the plasma create bubble-like “blobs” that, upon bursting, can damage the internal walls of the reactor. Scientists are trying to find ways to stabilize plasmas from the inner core out to the surface. Two CRPP teams have recently made progress in this area by improving our understanding of these instabilities.\nOn the surface\nSurface instabilities appear as filaments. Physicists have observed that these structures originate from waves propagating in the plasma. They worked out the wave dynamics, and then precisely measured the filaments’ properties (electrical, in particular), using instruments capable of taking 250,000 images per second. These measurements represent a major accomplishment, because the filaments, only a few centimeters long, move at a speed of one to two kilometers a second, are at a temperature of nearly 50,000°C and hold the energy of a 10-ton truck going at 80 km/hour. The researchers nonetheless managed to observe that the filaments carried their own current. They thus confirmed the theory proposed by Christian Theiler as part of his PhD research at the CRPP.\nThanks to this discovery, it will be possible to apply voltage directly to the filaments. Ivo Furno, who led the experiment, explains: “It is very difficult to prevent them from forming, but it may be possible to control their speed and trajectory.” Given the plasma’s elevated temperature, it is necessary to act on it without direct contact to control the filaments, which makes this technique particularly promising. The discovery will have a very important impact on research, because filaments appear in all plasmas in “tokamaks”, or nuclear fusion reactors. In fact, controlling the behavior of the filaments in the ITER tokamak is considered a gauge of the project’s success.\nIn the core\nReactors like EPFL’s TCV have a plasma core that is maintained at extremely high temperatures – up to a hundred million degrees – as long as possible, in order to generate fusion reactions. To do this, physicists confine the plasma using magnetic fields. Despite their efforts, hot blobs are still created in the core, and the danger is that several blobs could combine and eventually escape to the surface.\nA group of scientists led by Timothy Goodman has - for the first time - managed to concentrate radiation equivalent to a thousand microwave ovens with a precision of just a few millimeters, using a set of mirrors that can be adjusted in real time. With this powerful beam they were able to prevent the blobs from aggregating, without disturbing the reactions taking place in the plasma core.\n“Like surgeons, physicists must intervene in the plasma in the least invasive manner possible to guarantee its stability,” adds Ambroglio Fasoli, the EPFL Professor responsible for the two teams. This research marks a new step in the journey towards controlling nuclear fusion. And its arrival is timely; not only is conventional nuclear power (fission) under considerable scrutiny, but fusion is also being called upon to provide proof of its potential. “We can’t just sit back and watch. We also have to control the reactions,” concludes the physicist. And so physics takes another step forward.\nLinks:\nArticles:\nDirect Two-Dimensional Measurements of the Field-Aligned Current Associated with Plasma Blobs\n, I. Furno, M. Spolaore, C. Theiler, N.

The aim? To ensure that our roads are as safe as possible and that the freedom that comes with personal mobility remains at the heart of society.\nNissan is undertaking this pioneering work in collaboration with the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland (EPFL). Far reaching research on Brain Machine Interface (BMI) systems by scientists at EPFL already allows disabled users to manoeuvre their wheelchairs by thought transference alone. The next stage is to adapt the BMI processes to the car – and driver – of the future.\nProfessor José del R. Millán, leading the project, said: “The idea is to blend driver and vehicle intelligence together in such a way that eliminates conflicts between them, leading to a safer motoring environment.”\nAlthough thought control – via brain-machine interface – is well established in the scientific world, the levels of concentration needed are exceptionally high. The Nissan/EPFL collaboration is developing systems that go to the next stage using statistical analysis to predict a diver’s intentions and to evaluate a driver’s cognitive state relevant to the driving environment.\nUsing brain activity measurement, eye movement patterns and by scanning the environment around the car in conjunction with the car’s own sensors, it should be possible to predict what the driver plans to do – be it a turn, an overtake, a lane change – and then assist with the manoeuvre in complete safety, thus improving the driving experience.\nFor the programme, the scientists at EPFL were joined by a researcher from Nissan this summer. Lucian Gheorghe, originally from Romania but who has spent the last 14 years of his life in Japan, joined Nissan’s Mobility Research Center after graduating in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from Kobe University.\nAt Nissan, Lucian has been responsible for researching a number of Driver Assist systems as well as searching for new ways of adapting brain science programmes into automobile development.\n“Brain wave analysis has helped me understand driver burden in order to reduce driver stress. During our collaboration with EPFL, I believe we will not only be able to contribute to the scientific community but we will also find engineering solutions that will bring us close to providing easy access to personal mobility for everyone,” he said.\n“As part of our recently announced six year plan – Nissan Power 88 – we are focusing on new technologies. We have already developed a number of advanced safety systems for our cars – such as Intelligent Cruise Control, Distance Control Assist or Moving Object Detection, all systems that constantly scan the environment around the car ¬– and the research being undertaken by EPFL complements this perfectly,” said Christopher Benardis, GM Product Economic and Control, Business Development & OC-E Office at NISSAN International SA.\nPhoto Credit: EPFL / Alain Herzog", "summary": "After scanning the thought patterns of its driver, the car of tomorrow will be able to predict its next move.", "claim": "After scanning the thought patterns of its driver, the car of tomorrow will be able to predict your next move.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [18, 18], "noise": false}

{"id": 1084, "text": "In January 2010, the earthquake – over 7.0 on the Richter scale – destroyed Haiti, devastating its capital, Port au Prince,causing the deaths of 230,000 people and injuring 300,000. A state of emergency was declared, and over ten thousand NGOs, as well as United Nations personnel, were dispatched to the country. Humanitarian organizations and peace keeping forces provided first aid, distributing drinking water, giving medical care, and clearing the rubble. This phase was followed, nine months later, by an outbreak of cholera. Polluted water, fruit and vegetables which had been watered, or dirty hands caused the disease to be transmitted. Without sewage treatment facilities, everything flowed into the rivers. And in Haiti, rivers are strategic “corridors”: the people wash, play and drink in these places. One-and-a-half years after the catastrophe, the population is still living among the rubble and the garbage.\nA strain unknown in South America\nCases of cholera had not been identified in the country for over 100 years. The population was not prepare\nd for this new twist of fate. Studies have revealed that\n the bacteria was identical to that found in Asia, and which may have infected Nepalese UN soldiers. Before they arrived in Haiti, it’s quite probable that they did not have time to be screened. Since the bacteria strain appeared only after their installation, downstream from their camp, it’s likely that it was spread through their sewage water.\n “If the disease is not treated, it may be misdiagnozed as severe diarrhoea,” explains Melanie Blokesch, Professor at the EPFL and expert in the evolution of the cholera bacteria. “In more severe cases, you can lose up to 20 liters of fluid per day, and children often die within a few hours,” she adds. Absorbing a salt solution enables the prevention of this fatal dehydration. It’s therefore essential to predict how the bacteria spreads in the short term, in order to warn the health authorities and organizations, and protect the population.\nWhen the environment meets the life sciences\nIn the at EPFL, Andrea Rinaldo is undertaking research into the role of waterway networks – real ecological corridors – in the propagation of water-borne diseases. Soon after the outbreak of cholera at the end of 2010, he published a spatial model that enables the prediction of the distribution of pathogenic bacteria, taking into account the time, the place and the movement of populations in Haiti. “We had to improve the model and understand why it didn’t always correspond to the reality, while determining the reasons for unexplained peaks in the epidemic. That’s why we decided to travel to the site of the epidemic and find out what was happening on the ground.” The research group is made up of: Melanie Blokesch, microbiologist; Andrea Rinaldo, hydrologist; and Silvan Vesenbeckh, epidemiologist at the Harvard Medical School.\nA different perspective “on the ground”\n On their arrival, the scientists had to confront surprise after surprise. They discovered that antibiotics were being distributed widely, sometimes as prophylactics. With no clear directives, some NGOs were just winging it, occasionally in contradiction to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which distorted the spatial representation of the probleme\n They noticed that most people have no access to toilets, and relieve themselves wherever they can. During the rainy season, water carries fecal bacteria into rivers and pollutes them, thus increasing the numbers of people exposed to contaminated water. The rain has other unexpected consequences: “The water washes away the paper-based warning posters, and the people then assume that the epidemic has been dealt with, and get out of the habit of taking precautions,” regrets Melanie Blokesch. This helps to explain the return of the epidemic at this time of the year.\nEPFL’s mission was to meet with the various humanitarian organizations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, Terre des Hommes, and also the WHO, in order to take into account all the facts of the situation on the ground. That is now complete. Soon, a new tool will be available to these organizations, to enable them to rapidly put in place the logistical elements of care, in line with Andrea Rinaldo’s conviction that the epidemiology of the future will be based on modelization.", "summary": "Two EPFL laboratories have rallied round Terre des Hommes Lausanne.

{"id": 1085, "text": "Marilyne Andersen is Associate Professor in Sustainable Construction Technologies at the ENAC Faculty. She directs the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Performance-Integrated Design, which she inaugurated in 2010. Her research focuses on the performance of buildings in their architectural context, and more particularly, on the use and optimization of natural light in buildings. We interviewed her a few months before she is to take office next September.\nWhat made you decide to take the lead of the Faculty? \nTo me, ENAC’s configuration is already very unique. EPFL is one of a small group of universities around the world that provides the opportunity to forge such strong relationships between architecture, civil and environmental engineering, and urban planning. Ideas can be explored on multiple levels, in research, education, innovation, and technology transfer – even in terms of academic recognition. I think we should play this card and continue to strengthen it.\nWhat kinds of interactions do you see between architecture, civil and environmental engineering, and urban planning? \nThere are a number of laboratories that are already active at the interface between traditional domains of expertise; some that come to mind are iBois, the Laboratory for Timber Constructions, LMS, the Laboratory for Soil Mechanics, and the laboratories at INTER, the Institute for Urban and Regional Science, which, among others, blend a multitude of scientific disciplines. To round off this approach, we should encourage core disciplinary fields to collaborate in addressing new questions that are central to each of them by leveraging their unique perspective, enriched by broadened research horizons. Take, for instance, architecture and environmental engineering. These fields may seem distant, yet the potential for links is huge. Indeed, buildings interact with climate, but how can we anticipate the effects that different climate change scenarios will have on them? Both the impact of the built environment on the natural environment and vice versa – from large civil engineering projects to sites in extreme locations – raise tough questions that can only be addressed by going beyond today’s borders in each field. The potential for synergies is enormous.\nHow can interactions between different disciplines be fostered? \nMy predecessors, Laurent Vulliet and Marc Parlange, successfully fostered an “ENAC spirit.” I’d like to further strengthen this spirit of scientific curiosity through concrete projects that encourage the laboratories involved to push the envelope in terms of their research. I’d like to develop a common base, without diluting the expertise, in order to preserve the identity of each field, and in the long run to be able to do first-rate scientific research, while as much as possible from the potential offered by interdisciplinary collaborations. Regarding education, one could envision a pedagogical project that celebrates the process of co-creation. Its strength would lie in its capacity to highlight the value of sharing knowledge. The idea of looking at what other people are doing to progress in one’s own field – a notion that lies at the core of the scientific research process - is one that I find appealing.\nIs it easy to build bridges and work together? \nFor me, it is a vital source of enrichment. Every day, since I began my career, I experience the potential of bridging domains that, at least from a scientific perspective, are not very close to each other. For my diploma and later for my PhD, I was already sitting on the fence between building physics and optics. Later, at MIT, I began to approach the field of architecture. Today in my lab, I have integrated these subjects, adding other ones such as computer science to support the decision-making process using numerical simulations. As I have always felt drawn to the field of light, I’ve established ties to photobiology and vision specialists. Building bridges without necessarily speaking the same language from the start is not easy, but it is exciting.\nWhat will be your priorities as the new dean? \nMy first priority will be to map existing and missing domains of expertise within the Faculty, in order to foster its common identity by looking at it as a single unit. To do so, I will base myself on the experience and analyses of my colleagues at ENAC. Furthermore, by defining objective indicators related to publications and financing, for example, we will be able to understand how bridges are built within ENAC and with groups throughout EPFL, as well as how we are linked to the rest of the world through our research.

The system uses a novel kind of electrode stimulation to treat Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders that cause trembling.\nDBS is approved for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and epilepsy. It works by delivering mild electrical pulses to targeted areas of the brain using tiny electrodes that have been implanted in the cerebral tissue. Existing DBS systems often create unwanted side effects because the electrical current is sent out in many directions. However, with its directSTIM™ system, Aleva has developed a new array of microelectrodes that can direct the electrical pulses with greater precision and therefore deliver a more targeted treatment.\nThe firm has formed R&D partnerships with other companies such as Nuvectra, a listed company based in the US.

{"id": 1092, "text": "The driver ahead suddenly stops, and you find yourself stomping on your brakes before you even realize what is going on. We would call this a reflex, but the underlying reality is much more complex, forming a debate that goes back centuries: Is consciousness a constant, uninterrupted stream or a series of discrete bits – like the 24 frames-per-second of a movie reel? Scientists from EPFL and the universities of Ulm and Zurich, now put forward a new model of how the brain processes unconscious information, suggesting that consciousness arises only in intervals up to 400 milliseconds, with no consciousness in between. The work is \nContinuous or discrete?\nConsciousness seems to work as continuous stream: one image or sound or smell or touch smoothly follows the other, providing us with a continuous image of the world around us. As far as we are concerned, it seems that sensory information is continuously translated into conscious perception: we see objects move smoothly, we hear sounds continuously, and we smell and feel without interruption. However, another school of thought argues that our brain collects sensory information only at discrete time-points, like a camera taking snapshots. Even though there is a growing body of evidence against “continuous” consciousness, it also looks like that the “discrete” theory of snapshots is too simple to be true.\nA two-stage model\n, working with Frank Scharnowski at the University of Zurich, have now developed a new paradigm, or “conceptual framework”, of how consciousness might actually work. They did this by reviewing data from previously published psychological and behavioral experiments that aim to determine if consciousness is continuous or discrete. Such experiments can involve showing a person two images in rapid succession and asking them to distinguish between them while monitoring their brain activity.\nThe new model proposes a two-stage processing of information. First comes the unconscious stage: The brain processes specific features of objects, e.g. color or shape, and analyzes them quasi-continuously and unconsciously with a very high time-resolution. However, the model suggests that there is no perception of time during this unconscious processing. Even time features, such as duration or color change, are not perceived during this period. Instead, the brain represents its duration as a kind of “number”, just as it does for color and shape.\nThen comes the conscious stage: Unconscious processing is completed, and the brain simultaneously renders all the features conscious. This produces the final “picture”, which the brain finally presents to our consciousness, making us aware of the stimulus.\nThe whole process, from stimulus to conscious perception, can last up to 400 milliseconds, which is a considerable delay from a physiological point of view. “The reason is that the brain wants to give you the best, clearest information it can, and this demands a substantial amount of time,” explains Michael Herzog. “There is no advantage in making you aware of its unconscious processing, because that would be immensely confusing.” This model focuses on visual perception, but the time delay might be different for other sensory information, e.g. auditory or olfactory.\nThis is the first two-stage model of how consciousness arises, and it provides a more complete picture of how the brain manages consciousness than the “continuous versus discrete” debate envisages. But it especially provides useful insights about the way the brain processes time and relates it to our perception of the world.\nThis work involved a collaboration between EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute with the University of Zurich and the University of Ulm. It was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nReference\nHerzog MH, Kammer T, Scharnowski F. \nTime Slices: What is the duration of a percept?\nPLoS Biology \n14(4): e1002433. 12 April 2016.

Lithium technology is currently leading the way, but there are also hydrogen cars, which the major carmakers are betting on and Japan has allocated millions to developing. In this spirit, on Saturday 10th of September, EPFL inaugurates its prototype fueling station in Martigny, in the presence of Marc-Henry Favre, President of Martigny, Philippe Gillet, EPFL Vice-President as well as representatives from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE).\n200 years after Valais-based inventor Isaac de Rivaz came up with plans for hydrogen-powered carriages, this fueling station seeks to tap into the same energy vector. It is equipped with two fuel dispensers for charging battery-powered electric cars and for filling the tank of hydrogen cars. The station is packed with sensors and will provide the engineers with the data they need to measure, understand and improve all the steps involved in producing, compressing, storing and distributing the fuel in order to optimize the energy balance.\nClean energy\n “Valais is an ideal testing ground,” says Hubert Girault, who heads the Laboratory of Physical and Analytical Electrochemistry (LEPA). “This canton produces electricity using renewable energies like solar, wind and hydroelectric, and thanks to our decision to transform this electricity through electrolysis, we produce hydrogen without any CO\n2\n emissions.”\nHydrogen is commonly produced from natural gas, in a process that releases carbon dioxide. But that’s not how it works in Martigny. To keep the fueling station’s dispensers operating, the laboratory installed a megabattery capable of holding 400 kWh. It is connected to the power grid and, in addition to storing energy, it can also produce hydrogen thanks to a system developed specifically in Martigny.\nThe purpose of this facility is to see what fueling stations could be like once the car population shifts away from fossil energies. “We could, for example, set up a fleet of taxis or specially equip ambulance services, because you can fill up on hydrogen in 3 minutes versus 30 minutes for the battery-based technology,” says Girault. The hydrogen car is an electric car that works with a fuel cell and a small backup battery under its hood.\nTwo test cars will ply the roads in Valais in order to collect field data and consume some of the hydrogen. One of them will be used by Sinergy, the local utility company, in its day-to-day repair service, and the other will be used by EPFL.\nThis experimental fueling station is a collaborative effort of EPFL, the \nCentre de Recherches Energétiques et Municipales\n (CREM), Sinergy and the city of Martigny.

{"id": 1100, "text": "How long will it take until Switzerland’s picturesque Anniviers Valley is filled in with silt and gravel? More quickly than one might think, if global warming indeed leads to a predicted increase in sediment deposits during the course of the coming century. Of course, a lot of water will flow down the mountain valleys before they’ll be buried in sediment. For some villages, the threat of rocks and torrential flooding is always a serious problem, even on the short term.\nMountain streams transport all kinds and sizes of sediment loads. Depending on where it piles up, this primarily rocky debris can be seriously dangerous. Lakes can form upstream, flooding buildings. If natural dams break in flood situations, the mix of water and gravel can cause devastating damage downstream.\nTwo thousand truckloads of rocks\nThis is the case for Zinal, a popular ski resort situated on the Naviscence River. The river originates in the Zinal glacier at the southern end of the Anniviers Valley, and is fed as it winds its way down towards the village by several other, smaller streams. A series of small retaining dams were built along the river to mitigate the risks associated with stones and other glacial sediments. Today, these dams hold around 10,000 cubic meters of material and are reaching their saturation point. “It’s almost inconceivable to evacuate these materials out of the valley,” explains professor Christophe Ancey, head of EPFL’s . “The road going up the valley is one of the most narrow and winding roads in the entire canton, and to get the right rhythm going, you’d have to run 1,250 to 2,00 trucks back and forth every year!”\nWhat can be done with these impressive pileups of rock and gravel, whose quantity is predicted to increase as glaciers and permafrost melt under the effects of global warming? In collaboration with CREALP (The Valais Center for Research on the Alpine Environment), EPFL is studying the possibility of leaving them where they are in the valley, while still not adversely impacting protected zones. The research is being done both in the laboratory and in the field.\nUpstream of Zinal, the meandering Naviscence has formed the “Plats de la Lé,” a zone that is flat enough to be used as a cross-country ski trail in winter. Cantonal authorities want to know if it would be possible to retain sediments here, or even to deposit thin layers of sediment over this large surface area. “The challenge is to find a way of holding the sediments back,” says Ancey. Do dams need to be built, or can natural slopes be used? But in that case, what would happen in the event of a flood?\n150 years of evolution\nA lot of research has been done at EPFL and with other partners to study this pressing situation that is in need of appropriate solutions. In particular, projects have been undertaken to better understand the mechanisms at work in sediment transport and deposit. Currently, sensors installed under the riverbed are continuously “listening” to the passage of stones and measuring the flow rate. Many research projects were carried out in the valley this summer. The data obtained will be correlated with temperature and rainfall measurements to try and establish a model. “We observed in several cases that there is not necessarily a direct correlation between climatic phenomena and sediment transport,” Ancey says.\nTo try and get a better understanding of the situation, a spherical sensor about 10cm in diameter that can be thrown into the river is being developed at EPFL. As if flows down the river like a real stone, the device will measure the accelerations, trajectories and forces involved in this kind of movement. The sensors could also be used to study flows in avalanches. A historical study, using old aerial photographs and topographical measurements, is also making it possible to retrace how the situation has evolved since 1950, in order to help develop a simulation that will be able to make forecasts up to the year 2100.\nMelting glaciers will clearly generate more problems than just a lack of water and the reduction in the electricity that can be generated by hydropower installations – although these are unquestionably important issues. “The Anniviers Valley is where we’re working, but the entire canton of Valais is concerned,” warns Ancey.", "summary": "EPFL’s Environmental Hydraulics Laboratory is working with Crealp (Center for Research on Alpine Environments) in Sion to model sediment deposits carried by the Naviscence River.

{"id": 1104, "text": "It is the largest 3D map of the Universe produced to date. It is the fruit of a twenty-year collaboration of several hundred scientists from around thirty different institutions around the world, all united within the “Sloan Digital Sky Survey” (SDSS), with data collected from an optical telescope dedicated to the project located in New Mexico, in the United States.\nReleased today in the form of more than twenty scientific publications, this latest mapping of the night sky is an unprecedented and ambitious astronomical survey from 2014 until 2020. Resulting from the analysis of several millions of galaxies and quasars, this latest survey builds upon existing data as early as 1998 to fill certain gaps in cosmological history and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the expansion of the Universe.\nEPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) is directly involved in this important project. This latest cosmological survey of the SDSS, called “The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey” (eBOSS), includes more than 100 astrophysicists, of which several are researchers from EPFL. Jean-Paul Kneib, who heads EPFL’s Astrophysics Laboratory (LASTRO), initiated the eBOSS survey and was its principal investigator (PI) for several years.\n“In 2012, I launched the eBOSS project with the idea of ​​producing the most complete 3D map of the Universe throughout the lifetime of the Universe, implementing for the first time celestial objects that indicate the distribution of matter in the distant Universe, galaxies that actively form stars and quasars,” reports Jean-Paul Kneib. “It is a great pleasure to see the culmination of this work today. \"\n Thanks to the extensive theoretical models describing the Universe after the Big Bang, as well as observation of the Cosmic Microwave Backgound Radiation (CMBR), the infant Universe is relatively well known. Scientists have also explored its expansion history over the most recent few billion years from Supernovae distance measurements and galaxy maps, including those from previous phases of the SDSS. “We know both the ancient history of the Universe and its recent expansion history fairly well, but there’s a troublesome gap in the middle 11 billion years,” says cosmologist Kyle Dawson of the University of Utah, who leads the team announcing today’s results. “Thanks to five years of continuous observations, we have worked to fill in that gap, and we are using that information to provide some of the most substantial advances in cosmology in the last decade.”\n“Taken together, detailed analyses of the eBOSS map and the earlier SDSS experiments, we have now provided the most accurate expansion history measurements over the widest-ever range of cosmic time,” says Will Percival of the University of Waterloo, eBOSS’s Survey Scientist. “These studies allow us to connect all these measurements into a complete story of the expansion of the Universe.”\n The finalized map shows filaments of matter and voids that more precisely define the structure of the Universe since its beginnings, when it was only 380,000 years old. From there, the researchers measured the recurring patterns in the distribution of galaxies, thus identifying several key cosmological parameters, including the density of hypothetical dark matter and energy in the Universe, with a high degree of precision.\nTo carry out this survey, the teams involved in the eBOSS project looked at different galactic tracers that reveal the mass distribution in the Universe. For the part of the map relating to the Universe six billion years ago, researchers observed the oldest and reddest galaxies. For more distant eras, they concentrated on the youngest galaxies, the blue ones. To go back further, that is to say up to eleven billion years, they used quasars, galaxies whose super-massive black hole is extremely luminous.\nSlower expansion?\nThis map reveals the history of the Universe, and in particular, that the expansion of the Universe began to accelerate at some point and has since continued to do so. This seems to be due to the presence of dark energy, an invisible element that fits naturally into Einstein's general theory of relativity but whose origin is not yet understood.\nWhen eBOSS observations are compared with studies of the Universe’s early days, discrepancies appear in estimates of the Universe’s expansion rate. The currently accepted expansion rate, called the \"Hubble constant\", is 10% slower than the value calculated from the distances between the galaxies closest to us. It is unlikely that this 10% difference is random due to the high precision and wide variety of data in the eBOSS database.\nTo date, there is no commonly accepted explanation for these disagreements between the different estimations of the speed of expansion, but the fact that a still unknown form of matter or energy from the early Universe could have left traces in our history is an interesting possibility.", "summary": "An international consortium of scientists has analyzed, as part of a vast program of cosmological surveys, several million galaxies and quasars, thus retracing a more continuous history of the Universe and offering a better understanding of the mechanisms of its expansion.

The JPEG standard, which is used more than one billion times each day on social networks alone, recently elected as its Head the EPFL professor Touradj Ebrahimi. At its core, what is the significance of JPEG? Touradj Ebrahimi gives us an overview of this popular standard that has revolutionized our lives.\nJPEG is everywhere. The basis of this project, however, was laid out over 30 years ago...\n This is true. JPEG is an image format created to address a major problem in the digital age. In the early 80s, no technology existed to copy or transmit electronic images. Minitel, invented by the French, only allows you to send text and simple graphics. We had to find a way to reduce the size of image files. It was the international standardization groups and telecommunications industry that provided the impetus for the creation of JPEG. In 1982, they brought world experts in image compression to the table to form the \"Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG).\" The JPEG format was created in 1992.\nHow does JPEG reduce image file sizes more that other formats?\n Basically, JPEG relies on a lossy compression algorithm. When an image is compressed in JPEG, a portion of its contents is destroyed, but practically without being noticeable to the human eye. This technique makes it possible to reduce the image file size, so that it can be easily stored, copied and transmitted. Over the years, other formats with various technologies have been developed, such as JPEG2000, which can operate with or without loss. Lossless compression is used mainly in the medical settings, where it is crucial to preserve image details. The JPEG group is also working on a new standard called JPEG XT, which will allow efficient compression of High-Dynamic-Range images with a wide color gamut.\nWhy has JPEG become a global standard?\n At the time of the emergence of Internet and digital devices, JPEG was the only international standard that was fre\nIf everything is open and free, what's the point of working on the development of standards such as JPEG?\n There are several. When a format is free, developers and consumers are more inclined to use it. If it is also open source, it means that everybody can access the details of the algorithm, and try to improve it. For scientists, it is therefore easier to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, and to propose new ideas to improve it.\nWhat are your next challenges as President of JPEG?\n Before the end of 2015, we plan to finalize the new JPEG XT format, for an efficient compression of High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) images, which are increasingly widespread. JPEG XT contains enough information to correct the shot when a picture taken by a digital camera is under-exposed or over-exposed resulting in a too dark or too bright image. Then, for the years 2015-2020, we will launch the basis of a new version of JPEG called JPEG Pleno, in reference to the term \"plenoptic.\" The idea is to correct the focus of a picture after it has been taken, and to make any object in the image sharper even if it appears blurred in the initial picture. It will also be possible to look at any object in the picture, even from a different perspective than what the camera that captured it..\nWhy is image transmission so important to human beings?\n To have value and meaning, an image must be shared and copied. Since the dawn of time, humans have sought to transmit images, whether by painting on cave walls, by copying illustrations manually or by mechanically reproducing them with the invention of the printing press. The instrument of JPEG is part of this mission of transmission, but this time in digital form. It has changed our world. Today, almost everyone has used JPEG, whether via computer, smartphone, tablet or camera. And yet, most of the time, people don't really know what it is.\nHow do you predict our relationship with images will evolve in the future?\n I hope JPEG Pleno can last for 20 to 30 years. Then, in my opinion, we will progress towards a point at which it's no longer necessary to go through the eye to access images. Images could for example be injected directly into the brain!\n ----\nMore information and latest press release here:", "summary": "JPEG is the image format we use the most in the world, be it in our computers, smartphones or digital cameras.

Toxic, impenetrable smoke and darkness add to the dangers and slow the firefighters’ progress. Clad in protective gear weighing over 20 kilos, firefighters may also be dragging a firehose behind them and carrying a thermal imaging camera to help orient them, analyze their surroundings and locate victims.\n“They really count on the thermal imaging camera, but it gets in the way and forces them to interrupt their search if they want to analyze a room,” said Adrien Birbaumer and Martijn Bosch, who are behind the VIZIR project at the Images and Visual Representation Laboratory. To overcome this handicap, the two engineers came up with a solution that frees up the firefighters’ hands. Their solution consists of placing a mini infrared camera on the helmet and incorporating a transparent screen in the oxygen mask.\nThus equipped, firefighters see two images in their field of view: what their eyes see and what the thermal imaging camera records and displays in real time. This allows firefighters to move around more easily and avoid obstacles without having to interrupt the search process. “We worked on the best way of representing hot and cold zones,” said Birbaumer. “We used red and blue, of course, but we had to find the right tones that would be visible on a transparent surface.”\nA little getting used to\n The two engineers are testing their prototype – a pair of augmented-reality glasses for the time being – with the help of ECA, the public fire and natural disaster insurance company in Vaud Canton.

{"id": 1119, "text": "You may have heard of virtual keyboards controlled by thought, brain-powered wheelchairs, and neuro-prosthetic limbs. Once the mind is trained to send the right kind of signals, operating the interface can be downright tiring for the mind - a fact that prevents the technology from being of much use to people with disabilities, among others. Professor José del R. Millán and his team at the EPFL have a solution: engineer the system so that it learns about its user, allows for periods of rest, and even multitasking.\nIn a typical brain-computer interface (BCI) set-up, users can send one of three commands – left, right, or no-command. No-command is necessary for a brain-powered wheelchair to continue going straight, for example, or to stay put in front of a specific target. Paradoxically, in order for the wheelchair or small robot to continue on its way it needs constant input, and this ‘no-command’ is very taxing to maintain and requires extreme concentration. After about an hour, most users are spent. Not much help if you need to maneuver that wheelchair through an airport.\nIn an ongoing study demonstrated by Millán and doctoral student Michele Tavella at the AAAS 2011 Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C., the scientists hook volunteers up to BCI and ask them to read, speak, or read aloud while delivering as many left and right commands as possible or delivering a no-command. By using statistical analysis programmed by the scientists, Millán’s BCI can distinguish between left and right commands and learn when each subject is sending one of these versus a no-command. In other words, the machine learns to read the subject’s mental intention. The result is that users can mentally relax and also execute secondary tasks while controlling the BCI.\nThe so-called Shared Control approach to facilitating human-robot interactions employs image sensors and image-processing to avoid obstacles. According to Millán, however, Shared Control isn’t enough to let an operator to rest or concentrate on more than one command at once, limiting long-term use.\nMillán’s new work complements research on Shared Control and makes multitasking a reality while at the same time allows users to catch a break. His trick is in decoding the signals coming from EEG readings on the scalp—readings that represent the activity of millions of neurons and have notoriously low resolution. By incorporating statistical analysis, or probability theory, his BCI allows for both targeted control—maneuvering around an obstacle—and more precise tasks, such as staying on a target. It also makes it easier to give simple commands like “go straight” that need to be executed over longer periods of time (think back to that airport) without having to focus on giving the same command over and over again.\nIt will be a while before this cutting-edge technology makes the move from lab to production line, but Millán’s prototypes are the first working models of their kind to use probability theory to make BCIs easier to use over time. His next step is to combine this new level of sophistication with Shared Control in an ongoing effort to take BCI to the next level, necessary for widespread use. Further advancements, such as finer grained interpretation of cognitive information, are being developed in collaboration with the European project for Tools for Brain Computer (). The multinational project is headed by Professor Millán and has moved into the clinical testing phase for several BCIs.

{"id": 1123, "text": "Under the streets of Montreal lies a second city, a bustling complex of shops and restaurants. Helsinki’s bedrock has been hollowed out for industrial purposes – oil storage, water treatment, a data center – with commercial applications in the making. Around the world, in Tokyo, Paris, Amsterdam, and elsewhere, cities are experimenting with underground expansion. But assessing the potential to exploit their subsurface is difficult. So difficult that many cities shy away from it altogether. Now, city developers seeking guidance can turn to the Deep City Method, a systematic decision-making framework developed at EPFL that has recently been applied to four cities in Switzerland, and four larger emerging cities in China.\n“Many cities don’t recognize the potential of the ground they are built on,” says Li Huanqing just finished her PhD at the Environmental Economics and Management Laboratory at EPFL. What she hopes to show is that, if they go about exploiting their subsurface smartly, the investment can help cities grow in a way that pays off in the long term. “Our objective was to provide city planners with a set of guidelines to help them exploit underground resources more efficiently. The problem is part engineering, part economics. We wanted to integrate both of these disciplines to develop our approach.” Two articles outlining her work are currently in press in the journal Tunneling and Underground Space Technology.\nMore than space\nSpace is probably the most obvious underground resource, but it comes at a price. Building downwards can cost up to five times as much as conventional aboveground construction. Because many cities are under such pressure to grow, but lack the land to do so, this investment can become worthwhile. And by linking projects, coordinating them across an entire city and taking advantage of other resources provided by the underground, the price can further be kept in check.\nGeothermal energy is one such resource. Made more accessible by excavations, it can be used for residential heating or industrial applications. Geo-materials are another. Excavation debris inevitably accumulates and can be used to stabilize roads or produce cement. And increased access to groundwater, and careful protection of it, can help sustainably grow cities. Managing the multiplicity of resources that can underlie a single parcel of land can be a remarkable challenge.\nMost cities have a master plan detailing the use and the value of their land, but normally, nothing similar exists for the subsurface. Drawing on experiences gained around the world, the Deep City Method, developed at EPFL’s Laboratory of Engineering and Environmental Geology aims to fill this void by confronting underground land-use demand with the potential to exploit it, and assist cities in extending their legal systems into these traditionally lawless expanses. In the best of cases, the possibility of exploiting the first 100 meters of the subsurface for construction projects can represent a substantial gain in growth potential.\nA Sino-Swiss study\nSwitzerland, a land of tunnels and underground fortresses, has a long history of exploiting the underground. Of the four cities that were tested for their potential to expand into the depths, Geneva came out on top, before Zürich, Lausanne, and Bern. The city’s high population density and GDP per capita as well as the quality of its groundwater made it stand out in particular. And Geneva is already moving towards increased exploitation of its urban subsurface, with a new subway line underway, and an underground expansion of its main railway station being considered.\nIn her thesis, Huanqing focused on the growing Chinese city of Suzhou, slated to have 5 million inhabitants by 2015 and conducted an extensive case study of its potential to expand underground. To her, this project was a considerable success. “We were able to establish ties to the government and work together to towards formulating a 3D land-value map, which combines land value with environmental and other constraints.”\nSo does this mean that in the future we will all be living underground? Probably not, but building certain infrastructure projects underground frees up space on the surface, often a strongly limited resource. Now the job is getting more cities to jump on the bandwagon. As Li Huanqing says: “It is our job to show how underground space can be used multi-functionally and create demand in the future.”", "summary": "The Deep City Method helps urban planners decide how to best exploit their underground resources.", "claim": "The Deep City Method helps urban planners decide how to best exploit our underground resources.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 12], "noise": false}
{"id": 1124, "text": "“We got the idea by talking with civil engineering students in the United States and at ETH Zürich, and decided that EPFL should participate in the competition as well,” says Charles Jeanbart, president of EPFL’s Civil Engineering Student Association (AEGC), the organization behind the project.\nA team of eight students is spending the semester designing a canoe made of reinforced concrete. An annual Concrete Canoe Competition is already a tradition for many US and Canadian universities and has also been held in Europe – mainly in Germany – since 1986. This year, the “Betonkanu Regatta” will take place in Cologne from 9-10 June. A record 50 universities from around the world will compete on Fühlinger See, an artificial lake in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia\n.\nThe EPFL team has just submitted its engineering design to the evaluation panel, thereby securing its place in the competition. This is crucial for the competition since the most prestigious award goes to the team with the best design, especially in terms of innovation. But even if they don’t win this award, they can still fight in other categories: lightest canoe, heaviest canoe, best-looking canoe, or fastest canoe. There is also a booby prize for the unluckiest crew. The regatta is divided between men and women, and includes a 100-meter stretch and a slalom.\n“Like IKEA furniture”\nDesigning the canoe is the semester project for the eight master’s students who are overseen by Professor Aurelio Muttoni. On top of the engineering challenge inherent in making concrete float, the students must also follow strict design specifications set forth in the competition’s rules and regulations; for instance, the canoes can contain no more than two kilograms of synthetic materials in addition to the concrete. There are also limits on how long and wide the canoes can be. “This is our first time in the competition, so we have to learn everything from scratch,” says Hanne Cloesen, a student on the EPFL team. “We decided to build a five-meter-long canoe made up of three sections that can be taken apart – like IKEA furniture – to make it easier to transport. And we used a bridge-building method called pre-stressing to make sure the whole thing stays together.” Taking a page from IKEA, the students named their canoe Kånöepfl and wrote their design paper as if it were a set of assembly instructions.\nTextile-reinforced concrete and pre-stressing cables\nThe students initially built a 1:5-scale model and tested it in a fountain. Then, when building the real thing, they experienced a few setbacks in applying the concrete layers by hand. “We had to make sure there were no surface defects and that the joints holding the three parts together were watertight. We alternated the layers of concrete with layers of carbon fiber, which has the advantage of being ultralight. It turns the concrete into textile-reinforced concrete,” says team-member Stephan Mühlberg. But the students have another ace up their sleeve: they also used steel pre-stressing cables (typically used in bridges) that compress the concrete and hold the three parts of the canoe in place. The team’s novel approach is what convinced Professor Muttoni to head the project. “In our Structural Concrete Laboratory, PhD student Patrick Valeri is looking into potential applications for textile-reinforced concrete – especially for eco-friendly buildings, since carbon fiber makes concrete corrosion-resistant and therefore cuts the amount of CO\n2\n generated in concrete production,” said Muttoni.\nLooking for more sponsors\nThe students will also be the ones paddling their canoe in the regatta and have already started an intense training program at EPFL’s Viv’Eden gym, which is one of the team’s sponsors. Other sponsors include EPFL’s Educational Affairs office (DAF), the student association (AGEPoly) and the Civil Engineering section (SGC). The Civil Engineering Student Association, which is handling all project logistics, is seeking additional sponsors to cover the expenses, which are estimated at CHF 20,000.\nSemi-finals\nThanks to its strength and agility, the EPFL team was one of 12 – out of 48 in the starting field – to make it to the semi-finals of the three-day regatta in Cologne. Certain design details of EPFL’s canoe, especially the pre-stressing approach, caught the attention of the jury, which also cited the narrow shape of the boat and the fact that it can be disassembled. What’s more, visitors to the competition were impressed by the team’s concept, which they learned about at the EPFL stand.

{"id": 1125, "text": "The widespread installation of photovoltaic panels on building rooftops could play an important role in Switzerland’s transition to a low-carbon energy system. Until now, however, the overall photovoltaic (PV) potential of Swiss rooftops could not be estimated accurately owing to a lack of data about buildings and their environments, along with wide margins of error arising from existing calculation methods. To fill that gap, researchers at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) have developed a methodology combining machine learning algorithms with geographical information systems and physical models to estimate PV potential. And, for the first time, they estimated hourly profiles of PV potential. Their results have been published in \nApplied Energy\n.\nAll roofs have their particularity\n“We’re not just looking at solar radiation, but also at the space available on rooftops. Some rooftops have an unusual shape or contain superstructures such as chimneys that prevent photovoltaic panels from being installed,” says Alina Walch, who led the second phase of the study. Their algorithm takes into account parameters such as the size of the roof, its orientation and whether the building is in a city center or a more isolated location. The results show that solar photovoltaic panels could be fitted to 55% of Switzerland’s total rooftop area. Even if panels were only installed on mainly south-facing rooftops, this could cover more than 40% of Switzerland’s electricity demand.\nSolar panels adapted to the different geometries of the roofs\nAn initial study, using artificial intelligence techniques, had already been carried out in a previous thesis by LESO-PB’s Dan Assouline. It was based on data collected in Geneva and then extended to the whole of Switzerland. “That study explored, for the first time, the use of artificial intelligence to quantify the potential for the large-scale installation of photovoltaic panels on building rooftops,” says Jean-Louis Scartezzini, the head of LESO-PB. “Using new high-resolution data, we have now improved the estimation method and increased the spatio-temporal resolution of the results. This will enable us to model future energy systems that are 100% renewable.”\nUsing the national “SIG-Énergie” geographic information system, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy has created a highly accurate model of Switzerland’s buildings. Using machine learning, estimates were made of the total roof area that could be covered by solar panels, depending on their shape and shading. Estimates were made even more accurate by applying real-world practical installation rules, resulting in PV potential of 24 terawatt-hours (TWh), ten times the capacity of existing installations. That figure’s margin of error is 9 TWh, due to the variability of solar radiation and the methodology used.\nAnnual energy potential\nBut Walch did not stop there: her study also includes the first ever hour-by-hour estimate of PV potential. This allows power generation to be gauged relative to consumption. “We have a surplus of energy in the summer and a shortage in the winter, and no energy at all at night,” she notes. “To address that imbalance, we need to consider other forms of renewable energy to make up for the shortfalls and allow energy to be stored. Hydroelectric power is an attractive way of storing energy, but the content of storage dams varies with the seasons. Wind power, used on a large scale, could fill the gaps.”\nHourly fraction of shaded roof area\nThe results obtained at EPFL could be used to put forward effective policies for installing PV panels on roofs. LESO-PB, the Swiss National Science Foundation, Innosuisse and the Swiss Federal Office of Energy are in talks to develop a platform that will enable cities, cantons and municipalities, but also individuals, to visualize the renewable energy potential of their buildings.\nAt the moment, Switzerland has tapped into only a tenth of its PV potential, which means that another 90% remains to be unlocked.\nApplied Energy \n Alina Walch,⁎, Roberto Castello, Nahid Mohajeri, Jean-Louis Scartezzini\n a Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland\nb Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom\nDan Assouline, Nahid Mohajeri, and Jean-Louis Scartezzini. “Large-Scale Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Technical Potential Estimation Using Random Forests.” Applied Energy 217 (May 1, 2018): 189–211. .", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL are assessing Switzerland’s solar power potential.

{"id": 1126, "text": "From what you have seen and heard today, what is your viewpoint about digitalisation in Swiss schools, and maybe your vision for the future?\n I can see that a lot of progress is going on. It is not just empty talk; I see high hopes and possibilities. There are plans and development work that are realistic.\nCould you tell us about the Impact Programme that you are currently leading?\n The Impact Programme develops big processes; the most important ones are curriculum processes. These are developed in different ways in various levels of education. Many teachers are retiring, new ones are arriving. We ask professors how they found these processes and what there is to develop from their point of view; we are doing a lot of researches. There is still a lot of work to be done, but ideas are coming.\nThroughout your career – considering its length and the numerous hats you have worn, how did you perceive the early days and then the implementation of digitalisation in Finnish schools?\n I was a teacher in the 1980’s when the digital revolution started. Back then, the first personal computers were huge and their power was 20 mega only but they were fine. Development was so quick. That decade saw the raise of a big national programme for teachers in Finland. The learning of the basic IT skills and related further skills had a huge impact on the pedagogical use of ICT. The problem was that the equipment and the connection were not ready for proper pedagogical use. The enthusiasm of the beginnings vanished. Real significant steps started with good equipment: digital white boards, PCs for classrooms, digital cameras… Then the wireless connection came. Today we use these in many fields of education.\nIn the 1990’s municipalities were responsible for health and services, including schools. They noticed that different fields were buying ICT equipment of their own. Purchases should have been pooled but it was not a good solution from the schools’ perspective since the equipment was for office use and not for teaching purposes.\nIt took several years for the stakeholders to discuss the special needs in education. This is not a problem anymore, except for the money: there is not enough to keep the equipment updated.\nWhat was the role and influence of the various stakeholders (teachers, politicians, pupils, companies) involved, and how did they collaborate?\n Cooperation has to be organised in a way that education remains free and coherent.\n As far as business is concerned, cooperation with ICT companies is restricted, yet Microsoft and Apple operating systems were bought for schools, and the latter are now dependent of the former. Many ICT companies would have liked to sell their products labelled “approved by the Finnish Government” but the Government refused. There are a few collaborations with companies today, however not at a large scale. Some interesting start-ups in Finland have an agreement with municipalities, but commercial agreements with schools are not permitted.\n On the tool side, the biggest municipalities are planning to connect our e-curriculum platform to new systems that will help teachers plan their work at school and assess students, amongst other features.\nThe State is not officially involved in the development of those systems, yet it has a link through the municipalities.\nHow does that translate in the field, concretely speaking? I mean by this: financial and human resources involved, trainings for teachers, teaching tools, apprenticeship etc.\n Learning and teaching materials (digital tools, equipment, etc.) are the responsibility of the municipalities, who buy and use them to their best knowledge. In the past, the State subsided the purchase of equipment but not anymore, hence the municipalities using their own resources. It had a large budget to lead huge development programmes but it did not last. The strategy is different today, focussing on small steps. For instance, the State subsidies teachers’ trainings in the equipment but also in the pedagogical use of ICT.\nWhat does digitalisation in schools actually imply?\n Digitalisation is part of a school’s everyday life; we do not separate digital and non-digital daily activities. For instance, children in kindergarten play with tablets, take photos, play games, use the various installed programmes. Teachers document these activities by taking photos and sending them to the parents. In primary school, tablets are considered as learning material, pretty much like a pen or a book. At the vocational education stage, digitalisation is very closely organised with companies and the tools at the students’ disposal are related to their fields of profession. All fields of profession are covered.\nWhat were the challenges of this digital revolution in education/teaching?\n The main challenges were resources – both human and financial. Implementing digitalisation in schools was not an easy task back then, and is actually still the case today. Municipalities are struggling with finances and have to cut in equipment and personnel. Some kindergartens and small schools even had to be shut down.\nWhat has proven to be successful and unsuccessful?\n We believe that digital education has to be organised as an integral part of daily life. We noticed that training is the most effective when it comes directly to the schools. It is a question of empowerment. Students have to believe they can learn it and fix it, even if not right at the first try.\nWhy do these actions work particularly well? How could they be implementable in other countries where culture, school routine and education style are different?\n Some actions could work everywhere, such as developing a network of teachers that would enable them to discuss, visit different places to stay up to date with various methods. Teachers have to look around what is going on in society. Some of them are reluctant to digitalisation at school, but they use laptops, social media, pay bills online etc. themselves. These are nowadays basic skills like reading. The role of teachers is to prepare children for life-long learning, so none can say that s/he is not a “digital person”. It is something more profound, on the kind of society that we want. Learning by listening as we were used to in the past is now over. An old proverb says, “Those things you learn without joy you will forget easily”. We are good learners but we learn bad things too. Whereas the things you are highly motivated to learn, you will remember for the rest of your life.\nHow can digitalisation and essence of play be compatible? Screens are often blamed for making children less intelligent since they do not use their cognitive skills as much anymore.\n It really depends on what you do with the hardware. Is it for entertainment, for instance? Small kids are thrilled with sound and music already.\n There was a discussion in Finland about screen time that led to restrict it, especially for the younger. We consider that, generally, screen time should be used to learn something. We need to learn again how to learn.\nWhat did today’s various presentations and discussions inspire you? Any action that was implemented in Switzerland and France that could also work in Finland, in your opinion?\n Peer-school system, like Ecole 42, is something that we should consider for later. There is a lack in Finland and worldwide of people with ICT and coding skills, which makes this model really interesting. We have to consider informal forms of education, how we develop know-how from hobbies. Is there a system that could be created to recognise this expertise?\n Currently universities of applied sciences organise coding workshops for adults. They are very popular because they are accessible and free.\n I also really liked Mrs. Cesla Amarelle’s presentation about the organisation of digitalisation in schools planned over the next years. I think it is brilliantly done and very concrete. It will surely be a success.\nAbout the event\nThe symposium offered a varied program with presentations, a panel discussion and workshops that provided the framework to explore the topic from various angles. Not only were experiences from different European countries shared, but also speakers from fields ranging from education, industry, politics to the teachers’ union represented the different stakeholders involved in this digital transition in schools.

This geographical proximity is amplified by many technical, scientific and even emotional affinities. Rivages, the Vaud navigator Bernard Stamm’s sleek new sea-creature, will add a new chapter to the nautical history of the EPFL laboratories.\nThanks to support from the Sandoz family’s Foundation, which owns the boat and has special ties with our school, EPFL has brought its expertise to bear in several areas and benefited from productive interaction with the navigator’s technical team. The work involved to optimize the boat’s component materials, for example, were carried out at the Laboratory of Composite and Polymer Technology (LTC), with the objective of meeting the construction requirements as closely as possible.\nThe sails in real time\nAs well as taking this “scientific advisory” role in the actual construction, several teams from EPFL are continuing to follow Bernard Stamm’s adventures in real time.

It will now add some more cameras to observe the sails and model their movements in three dimensions and in real time, to gain a better understanding of the wind-flow patterns and to optimize their adjustments.\nSome other experiments, in particular oceanographic, will be conducted on board.

On the hour, this will take a sampling of water, to make an automatic analysis of several parameters (temperature, salinity, oxygenation, turbidity, and micro-organism content) that it will transmit to land-based centers. Oceanopolis and the CNRS will be able to use the findings immediately as part of a specific study of micro-plankton, and these will also be made available to the scientific community. “The race uses routes that are rarely followed around the Antarctic, so it is an excellent opportunity to collect rare and detailed data and compare them with the measurements obtained by satellite”, explains Guillermo Barrenetxea, a scientist working at LCAV.\nEnergy needs\n A high-tech boat like Rivages needs more than a little wind and fresh water. The extensive electronic equipment required for navigation and – in this case – for all the scientific tasks need electricity. How can it be produced on-site and be managed optimally without weighing down and braking the boat? The Industrial Electronics Laboratory (LEI) is working to find the best solution. As Philippe Barrade, First Assistant, sums it up: “We must not only optimize the instruments to make them more energy-efficient, but also develop an intelligent system to manage the use, the reserves and the battery recharging system”.\n Solar cells, wind and water turbines and a diesel generator are the main candidates for supplying electricity. A combination of these sources will have to meet all the boat’s needs without making too many demands on the skipper’s attention. “Our energy production and management systems will therefore need to be extremely reliable”, adds Philippe Barrade.\nOn 11 November 2012, at Sables-d’Olonne, the starting-boat will give the signal for the Vendée Globe race to begin – this legendary solo race with no stopover or assistance. An impressive 60-foot monohull curved like a seagull, Rivages will then launch its assault on the southern seas.\nEighteen months in preparation\n For the moment, Rivages has just undergone a long voyage by special convoy to La Ciotat, near Marseille, where it arrived yesterday. And this weekend it will receive the traditional dose of champagne as a christening, as well as its mast, its sails and all the equipment still to be added. It will make its maiden voyage at the beginning of May, flying the colors of its sponsor “Cheminées Poujoulat”, and will complete several practice races this year (Tour de l’Europe, Transat Jacques Vabre).\nThese are 18 months of preparation that will be useful both to the navigator and his team, but also to the scientists involved in the project. “This partnership will enable us to advance in many fields”, Bernard Stamm comments happily. “As well as collecting important data, we will be able to improve the boat’s reliability and performance.” At EPFL, the impact of this major project is also being emphasized: “Solving practical questions concerning such a spectacular achievement is highly motivating for both the scientists and the students”, declares Pascal Vuilliomenet, in charge of the Strategic initiatives for the Vice-Presidency for Innovation and Valorization.", "summary": "The navigator from the Swiss canton of Vaud is working with EPFL to equip his new boat, Rivages, designed for the Vendée Globe 2012.

{"id": 1129, "text": "Once taken, antibiotics do not simply disappear. Released from the body by urine, some escape water treatment plants unscathed. Traces of antibiotics and a variety of other molecular contaminants such as pesticides and pharmaceutical drugs are consistently measured in Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva, above the site where processed wastewater is released. The impact of micropollutants is receiving ever more attention from the scientific community, but it is still unclear how long they persist and to what extent they pose a threat to organisms. In , researchers at EPFL present findings on the dilution of the micropollutants by lake currents. Their results showed that the pollutants are most persistent during summer, several meters under water. In the winter, they rise to the lake surface and are most effectively degraded by sunlight\nEvery second, between one and three tons of treated wastewater from the city of Lausanne gush out into Lake Geneva from a pipe that ends 700 meters offshore and 30 meters below the lake’s surface. Lake currents disperse and dilute this water in the same way that wind disperses the smoke from a chimney, with a persistent underwater pollutant plume emanating from the discharge pipe.\nFlorence Bonvin from EPFL’s Environmental Chemistry Lab has been studying the dynamics of this plume and the pollutants it contains. “We consistently detect a range of micropollutants – antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and anti-epileptic drugs and urban pesticides in particular in the vicinity of the wastewater treatment plant outfall,” she says. Although the concentrations are very small, she says, they are frequently well above threshold concentrations that are considered to have no effect on organisms.\nDriven by lake currents \nActually getting on a boat and sampling for micropollutants is time-intensive, expensive, and only provides a partial snapshot of the situation at any given time. A computer model gives a more complete image. “We would have to sample hundreds of sites simultaneously – which is basically impossible – to come close to getting as much detail as we can using a computer model,” says Bonvin. This way, she can study two simultaneously occurring processes in great detail: dilution of the micropollutants by mixing with the surrounding lake water, and their degradation by sunlight.\nThe dynamics of the pollutant plume are mostly driven by lake currents, which vary with the season and the weather. Summers see the lake’s surface waters warm up, while the depths remain cool. The interface between warm and cold water – the thermocline – acts as a cap, trapping currents and the pollutant plume several meters under water. But as the lake’s surface waters cool down during the winter, the thermocline disappears and the plume rises to the surface. With increased exposure to surface winds and sunlight, pollutants are diluted and degraded much more effectively.\nThe computer model lets Bonvin quantify the ecotoxicological threat posed by 24 different micropollutants as they enter the lake, disperse into the surrounding water, and eventually degrade. To study two different lake circulation patterns driven by the most prevalent winds, such as the bise, both with and without the summer thermocline, Bonvin used results from a 3D lake circulation model developed by Amir Razmi from EPFL’s Ecological Engineering Laboratory, which reproduced lake currents measured during an experimental campaign carried out in Vidy Bay. The degradation of the pollutants by the sun were based on measurements she performed herself in the lab.\n“Using our simulation results, we can draw a map of where the pollutants are depending on the season, the winds, and the cloud cover,” says Bonvin. And they offer a way to evaluate the potential risk they pose. “The concentrations of each pollutant are very low, but since we don’t know how living organisms respond to being exposed to these pollutants over long time periods, this isn’t an issue we can simply ignore.”\nBonvin previously showed that even antibiotics that have been processed and inactivated in our body and then released into the lake could be revived when exposed to sunlight, returning to their original, active form. This adds another source of micropollutants to the picture. Her findings, which add an additional twist to this story, were published earlier this year in Environmental Science & Technology.\nThis project was carried out in the context of the elemo research campaign, with the support of Ferring Pharmaceuticals and the Russian Honorary Consulate in Lausanne.", "summary": "Antibiotics, urban pesticides, and other contaminants accumulate where wastewater is released into Lake Geneva.

In the same year, he oversaw completion of the Palais Franscini, a unique project on the banks of the Ticino river that brought together five cultural institutions and housed the cantonal library and archives. On the EPFL campus, he splits his time between teaching and research, and takes evident pleasure in interacting with students. The students appreciate his dedication as well, awarding him the ENAC teaching prize in 2005 and 2007. Here’s a brief interview with this philosopher-architect. \nHow would you define this discipline?\n An architect maintains a balance between three pillars: art, science and technique. But I consider architecture first of all as an intellectual endeavor and the academic environment is ideal for cultivating this aspect. Architecture theorizes, interprets and envisages that which has been, is and is yet to be. I would like for this to be a fundamental mission of teaching starting with the first year, because it has an undisputable social implication. It makes the invisible visible. But this way of looking at things could very well be endangered today. The pressure to globalize could threaten architectural diversity.\nWhat was the most memorable moment of your career?\n The Aebsicher revolution! The arrival of Patrick Aebischer at EPFL, the Bologna reforms and the creation of a new School that brought engineers and architects together under a single roof obliged me to redefine architecture in the polytechnical environment. Until then, we existed on an island apart, without real connections with the rest of EPFL, much as many architecture institutes still do around the world today. That pushed us into a new dimension of research. Since then, many connections have been created between various ENAC laboratories. Several research projects focusing on subjects such as concrete are being done. I have done research with Aurèle Parriaux from ENAC’s Engineering and Environmental Geology Laboratory on massive stone constructions.\nWhat are the avenues that you would like to explore in your role as Director of the Institute of Architecture and the City?\n I would like to create an avenue that doesn’t exist yet! Come up with research tools that would integrate all the parameters that are known, but that have been used up to now separately, such as historical research, architectural techniques, physics of buildings or even industrial engineering—to take an epistemological viewpoint. Among the major projects that I would like to undertake or reinforce are energy issues, which bring together several ENAC researchers. The issue of habitat, also, can be looked at on several levels. It’s first an ethical issue; I can’t help but think of the millions of people who are homeless, and I would like to undertake research in the area of low-tech housing. That would certainly allow us to provide solutions not only at the Swiss and European level, but also for developing countries.", "summary": "Luca Ortelli is the new director of the Institute of Architecture and the City in EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC).

{"id": 1132, "text": "Although we tend to think of them as solitary sojourners of the world, bacteria are actually very social organisms. In fact, the vast majority of bacteria live on surfaces by forming “biofilms”: three-dimensional communities hosting thousands to millions of bacteria of such bustling activity that scientists describe them as “bacterial cities”.\nBacteria form biofilms by attaching to each other on a wide variety of surfaces: the bottom of oceans, lakes or rivers, medical equipment and even internal organs, like the intestine, lungs, and teeth – the latter is the familiar dental plaque, a large source of income for dentists.\nIn short, biofilms are the preferred lifestyle of bacteria. They grow wide and thick, forming a new, social dynamic among their member microorganisms, while also defending them: biofilms can be notoriously inaccessible to antibiotics, which is why they have drawn a lot of medical research.\n\"Forced\" social interactions\nBut looking at biofilms can also give us clues about broader social dynamics that have shaped the evolution of species across the entire planet, like cooperation, competition etc. And it is such questions that drive the work of Alexandre Persat, director of EPFL’s .\n“About ninety percent of bacterial life at the surface of Earth is found in the form of biofilms” he says. “Because these structures are so dense, they bring many species in proximity, which makes them interact socially and consequently drives their evolution. The outcome of social interactions such as competition or cooperation thus depends on the spatial arrangement of these cells. But what shapes the architecture and the organization of cells in biofilms, for example to mix or segregate, is still unclear.”\nIn a new study, Tamara Rossy, a PhD student in Persat’s group, expands our view of biofilms to look at how physical cues affect their development – more specifically, how they are affected by flow of the surrounding fluid. “Whether in oceans, lung infections skin, gut microbiota – the physics of fluids are ubiquitous to biofilms,” says Rossy. “We wanted to study how flow changes their spatial organization.”\nTo do this, Rossy had to first create a model biofilm that could be studied under controllable flow conditions. She chose two different clones of the bacterium \nCaulobacter crescentus\n, which is commonly found in freshwater lakes and streams, and undergoes a “stalked” cell stage that allows it to anchor on surfaces, colonize them, and form biofilms. Rossy grew the bacteria in microfluidic chips within which she could carefully control minute amounts of liquid flowing through channels just half a millimeter wide.\nRossy imaged the formation of biofilms at the level of single bacteria to monitor the effects of each flow rate on the bacterial colonies. The results showed dramatic differences in architecture between different flows: in weak flows, biofilms were very dense. In stronger flows, bacteria grew in sparse, cluster-like biofilms.\nTo understand this process, Rossy built a physical model that is reminiscent of the transport of molecules in fluidic systems. Using it, she found that stronger flows can dramatically impair the ability of bacteria to swim towards a surface and colonize it, resulting in sparse colonies.\nCounter-intuitive results\nBut some results were also counter-intuitive. “High flow rates lower the probability of swimming bacteria to invade existing colonies,” says Rossy. “In order to grow in such high flows, single cells rely on immediate attachment of daughter cells close to their mother cells.”\nStronger flows also segregated the two populations, with potentially significant effects on the overall social dynamics between biofilm-dwelling bacteria. \n“\nLow and high flow really matter to the arrangement and structure of the biofilm,” says Persat. “This shows that flow and, more generally, the physical environment of biofilms can affect the evolutionary history of a bacterial species; this is true at least between different bacterial clones like the ones we used, but it is very likely to apply across different bacterial species.”\n“Biofilms are a really fascinating and important facet of microbial life,\" he concludes. \"We are only now appreciating how physical principles guide their architecture and how this feeds back into bacterial physiology and evolution. But we have only here scratched the surface — there is still so much to learn.”\nImpact of low and high flow rates on mixing between two Caulobacter crescentus clones (purple and green).

{"id": 1138, "text": "The way we walk is a direct indicator of our health. It can even give us an estimate of how many years we have left to live. These findings have been proven by several studies involving thousands of patients in the last two decades, and form the basis of an ambitious European project called MOBILISE-D. The project consortium consists of 34 partners from the academic, pharmaceutical and industrial fields, including EPFL. Researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Movement Analysis and Measurement (LMAM) are working on a device that can measure people’s gait during their everyday activities. Today marks the official launch of the project.\nGait speed is increasingly regarded as the sixth vital sign, alongside body temperature, blood pressure, breathing rate, heart rate and pain. “It has been proven that older adults who walk more slowly than one meter per second have more health problems on average,” says Kamiar Aminian, who heads the LMAM. “Conversely, people who have a good gait speed show greater cognitive function, develop fewer illnesses, suffer fewer falls and spend less time in the hospital. Scientists have even established a direct link between gait and lifespan.”\nThat is why the project leaders are so intent on finding ways of analyzing people’s gait, both for preventive purposes and to develop new drugs and therapeutic tools. This is particularly important in Europe, where over-65s now make up almost 20% of the population. Gait analysis is also practical because it is simple to do: currently, patients only have to walk for three or four meters for a device to gauge their average speed. However, the MOBILISE-D project aims to achieve much greater precision and to identify the key factors involved in gait.\nStudying slow walkers\n“One of our main challenges will be to develop a portable system that can reliably analyze people with a very slow gait speed. This is more difficult – and the margin of error is much larger – than with people who walk rapidly,” explains Aminian.\nThe device is being designed for everyday use, and must be very simple, with only one sensor. It must be able to tell whether each step is intentional and also to distinguish between phases of walking, i.e., times when a person stops, slows down or speeds up, and changes direction or turns around. The system must also be able to capture data such as the number, length and height of each step, as well as gait consistency and any limping. In terms of accuracy, the system’s algorithms must be able to capture changes in speed of as little as five centimeters per second, as this has already proven to be significant for health. To meet these technical requirements, several specialist laboratories around the world, including the LMAM, are working together, sharing results and data.\nMOBILISE-D was launched with the support of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), and it is being led by the University of Newcastle in the UK. It has a budget of 50 million euros, of which the European Union is contributing 29 million euros. It is expected to run for five years: two years of technical work and three years of clinical trials.\nWebsite \nA selection of studies looking at gait speed as the sixth vital sign:\nJerome, Gerald J., et al. “Gait characteristics associated with walking speed decline in older adults: results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging,” \nArchives of gerontology and geriatrics\n 60.2 (2015): 239-243.\nMiller, Michael E., et al. “Gait Speed and Mobility Disability: Revisiting Meaningful Levels in Diverse Clinical Populations,” \nJournal of the American Geriatrics Society\n 66.5 (2018): 954-961.\nStudenski, Stephanie, et al. “Gait speed and survival in older adults,” \nJama\n 305.1 (2011): 50-58.", "summary": "Gait characteristics are sometimes regarded as the sixth vital sign in humans.

{"id": 1140, "text": "Bee populations are succumbing to a number of dangers, led by pesticides and a particular kind of parasite known as Varroa mites. These parasites can be found on all continents except Australia. They attach to bees, weaken them and end up killing them. “This parasite is the leading cause of bee deaths,” says Alain Bugnon, a local beekeeper. “Left untreated, the hives won’t last a year.” If beekeepers could monitor Varroa mite infestations, they would be able to treat their hives at the right time and save their bees. Bugnon came up with the idea for an app that would provide this information, and teamed up with EPFL’s  (LTS5) to create it.\nBeekeepers currently assess infestations by counting the number of dead mites that land on a wooden board placed below the hives. But this technique is not very accurate: the parasites are barely a millimeter long, and their bodies get mixed up with waste and other material on the board. The process is also time-consuming, especially if a beekeeper has several hives.\nThis was the challenge presented to the students in LTS5, a lab in EPFL’s School of Engineering run by Professor Jean-Philippe Thiran. The students came up with a system – consisting of an app linked to a web platform – that uses artificial intelligence to quickly and automatically count up the mites on the boards. This means that beekeepers can keep close tabs on infestations in order to target their treatments, which are in keeping with Swiss organic farming practices. \nTeaching the app to recognize Varroa mites\nThe technology developed by the LTS5 students streamlines the beekeepers’ task. They still need to put wooden boards under each of their hives, but now they simply photograph the boards and upload the images to the web platform. To develop their app, the students used machine learning – scanning thousands of images into a computer – to teach their program how to recognize the mites. The app can spot and count the dead parasites on the board in just seconds. \n“The first step was to create a database of images of Varroa mites for the computer, so that it could recognize the mites on its own and without making mistakes,” says Maxime Bohnenblust, a Master’s student who has been involved in this project from the start. Several beekeepers regularly submitted photos of their boards to the laboratory and gave the students feedback on their results in order to help them improve the algorithms. \nThe students overcame several hurdles in coming up with their solution: photos taken with smartphones are often not very clear; the light in photos taken outside is very bright; and each board has to be associated with a corresponding hive. In response to the third hurdle, the students programmed their app to generate a specific QR code for each hive. A beekeeper using the program then takes a picture of his board alongside the QR code for his hive and uploads the image to the platform, where it is immediately analyzed. The results – how many mites are detected – are stored and will be used to create statistics and a time profile.\nIn search of mite-resistant bees\nThis system will also make it possible to compile nationwide data in order to produce statistics. No other system of this sort – based on standardized data – currently exists. “The beekeepers didn’t have any shared metric or standard,” says Bohnenblust. “And until now, beekeepers associations have been sending their data to Agroscope, the Swiss government’s agricultural research center, once a year.” Yet if there is to be any chance of saving the bees, timely data is required. “Anti-parasite treatments must be applied at the right time and scaled to the size of the infestation,” says Professor Thiran. \nFinally, the collected data could be used to map out and track Varroa infestations in Switzerland and potentially identify parasite-resistant strains of bees. \nThis project was carried out by the  and beekeeper Alain Bugnon.

{"id": 1142, "text": "The brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease contain characteristic tangles inside neurons. These tangles are formed when a protein called Tau aggregates into twisted fibrils. As a result, the neurons’ transport systems disintegrate, essential nutrients can’t move through, and the cells begin to die, affecting the brain’s functions and giving rise to the disease’s symptoms.\nGiven its role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, Tau protein has been extensively investigated. With several clinical trials of amyloid-targeting therapies failing recently, Tau has become one of the most actively pursued therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease. However, questions still remain about how Tau spreads in the brain and kills neurons. The cell membrane has been shown to play a role in regulating Tau’s aggregation properties and physiological functions, but we still do not understand how the interplay between Tau and lipid membranes can lead to the loss of neurons seen in Alzheimer’s disease.\nNow, the , in collaboration with the lab of Thomas Walz at the Rockefeller University, found that individual Tau proteins interact with and disrupt the cell membrane of neurons. This disruption gives rise to highly stable complexes made up of several Tau proteins as well as fat molecules (phospholipids) from the membrane.\nSubsequent studies showed that the protein/phospholipid complexes are more readily taken up by neurons compared to the fibril form of the protein, and induce toxicity in primary neurons of the hippocampus \nin vitro\n. The hippocampus is where memory is processed, and loss of hippocampal neurons is a classic symptom of Alzheimer’s disease. The complexes were detectable with an antibody (MC-1) that is used as a standard for detecting pathological conformations of Tau, meaning that they share some features of the pathological form of the protein.\n“Our goal was to identify the sequence and structural factors that drive Tau interaction with membranes and the formation of these complexes so that we can develop strategies to interfere with their formation and block their toxicity,” says Nadine Ait Bouziad, the PhD student who led the study.\nIn collaboration with Professor David Eliezer at Weill Cornell School of Medical Sciences in New York, the researchers used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to gain insight into the structure of Tau in the core of the complexes. This revealed that the cores are made up of two small peptides, each only six amino acids long. These peptides are called PHF6* and PHF6, and they play important roles in driving Tau aggregation and assembly into fibrils. Their presence connects the protein/phospholipid complexes with the development of Alzheimer’s disease.\nBuilding on their findings, the researchers were able to produce mutant Tau protein. The introduced mutations disrupted Tau’s ability to interact with cell membranes, but did so without interfering with its ability to form fibrils. The idea behind this is that such mutants can be used to uncouple these two processes, which would allow researchers to investigate the effect that these membrane interactions have on the function, aggregation and toxicity of Tau in primary neuron cultures. This would be a first step in gaining a clearer picture of how Tau tangles begin to form, which would be critical if we are to develop efficient therapies to counteract their toxicity.\nA graphical summary of the study's findings (Nature Communications/Credit: Hilal Lashuel)\n“Our findings point toward a novel form of Tau protein/phospholipid complexes that might be part of a membrane-dependent mechanism that regulates Tau structure, oligomerization, toxicity, and possibly its normal and aberrant trafficking between and within neurons,” says Hilal Lashuel. “By developing tools that allow us to detect, disrupt and/or target these complexes, we hope to identify novel strategies to inhibit Tau aggregation, toxicity, and pathology spreading in the Alzheimer’s brain.”\nContributions\nWeill Cornell Medicine\nThe Rockefeller University\nFunding\nAC Immune\nEPFL\nUS National Institutes of Health (NIH)\nReference\nNadine Ait-Bouziad, Guohua Lv, Anne-Laure Mahul-Mellier, Shifeng Xiao, Gizem Zorludemir, David Eliezer, Thomas Walz, Hilal A.

{"id": 1143, "text": "Individual cells in a population, e.g. a tumor, can vary greatly in terms of biochemistry and function. In order to fully understand and address this variability, it is necessary to profile the properties of each individual cell, such as the interactions between its DNA, RNA and proteins. This has always been a challenge due to the technical and physical limitations associated with the fragility and small size of cells, as well as the large variety yet low amount of biomolecules they contain. EPFL scientists have now combined, for the first time, affinity beads with microfluidics to produce an integrated, highly sensitive method for studying single cells that could be soon used in clinical diagnostics. The pioneering work is published in the journal \nSmall\n.\nThere are two major obstacles for efficient single-cell analysis: first, the large number of different types of low quantity of biomolecules that have to be investigated in each cell. Second, the sheer number of cells that have to be processed, especially when trying to detect rare changes, which occur only in a few cells of a large population.\nThe lab of Horst Vogel at EPFL was able to overcome these hurdles by combining several micro-technologies: Micrometer- to submicrometer-sized affinity beads transferred into cells, and extraction of these beads from individual cells in a microfluidic channel. In the technique, developed by PhD student Michael Werner, the target molecule inside a single cell is captured on (sub)micrometer-sized silicon beads, which have previously been coated with capture agents, e.g. antibodies, that can bind specifically to the target biomolecule in the cell.\nWhen taken up by a cell, the bead is first internalized in a closed intracellular cage called the phagosome. This creates a problem, as the phagosome keeps the bead from finding its target biomolecule inside the cell. In order to release the bead from the phagosome, the researchers used a photochemical trick. Along with the beads, they also incubated the cells with photosensitive molecules, which became incorporated into the phagosome’s membrane.\nWhen light is shone on the cells, the photosensitive molecules disrupt the phagosome’s membranes. With the membranes ruptured, the beads are now released inside the cell, where they capture and extract all of the target molecules from the cell’s cytoplasm with high specificity.\nNext, the bead-containing cells are put through a microfluidic chip. This is a small device designed specifically to control the flow of tiny volumes of fluids across a network of small channels (100 μm in width) etched into glass slides. The channels in this study are so narrow that cells can only pass through one at a time. The cells pass through a point in the channel where a “laser tweezer” (a highly focused laser beam) catches individual cells by interacting with their internalized beads. The trapped cells are then lysed, leaving only the beads with the bound target biomolecules in the laser trap.

The team is now working with the Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV) in Lausanne to test their assay on cancer cells from actual tumors, which show enormous variability in signaling profiles between individual cells. “We hope that characterizing these variations will improve the treatment of the disease on an individual basis”, says Horst Vogel.\nReference\nWerner M, Palankar R, Arm L, Hovius R, Vogel H.

{"id": 1146, "text": "Making a diagnosis using ultrasound images often requires advice from experts in other hospitals, particularly in neurology. Sonography is one of the most commonly used imaging techniques. But to make an interpretation, a doctor must have access to the ultrasound images and know exactly where the transducer is placed on the patient. This has been an obstacle to remote diagnostics, one that will soon be overcome. A remote ultrasound machine, developed by French-Swiss teams of researchers and two start-up companies, allows the specialist see the image taken by the transducer as well as its position, all in real time. The doctor can also indicate the exact area that he or she would like to see with the cursor. The technician who is with the patient then moves the transducer.\n This equipment, developed by a team led by Professor Jean-Philippe Thiran from EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory, has been adapted to work on traditional ultrasound machines. A small motion detector the size of a cherry is attached underneath the transducer. A optical feedback system consisting of two infrared cameras, developed by Atracsys, an EPFL start-up headquartered in Le Mont-sur-Lausanne, films the transducer, and a software program displays it in color on a virtual human on the screen. The corresponding ultrasound images are displayed in parallel. The specialist can thus interact with the image and ask the on-site team to move the transducer to precise points. Using software developed by Thiran’s team, the specialist indicates the zone to observe on the patient with a movement of the mouse. Already tested at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the CHU in Besançon, the device has been integrated into a telediagnosis platform being developed by Covalia, a project partner company based in Besançon, and will be commercially available within a few months.\nA server for medical imaging analysis\n “Medical imaging is currently very quantitatively oriented, for example, to highlight brain structures, and measure and compare them,” explains Thiran.

{"id": 1147, "text": "Mercury, when dumped in lakes and rivers, accumulates in fish, and often ends up on our plates. A Swiss-American team of researchers led by Francesco Stellacci at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Bartosz Grzybowski at Northwestern University has devised a simple, inexpensive system based on nanoparticles, a kind of nano-velcro, to detect and trap this toxic pollutant as well as others. The particles are covered with tiny hairs that can grab onto toxic heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium. This technology makes it possible to easily and inexpensively test for these substances in water and, more importantly, in the fish that we eat. Their new method can measure methyl mercury, the most common form of mercury pollution, at unprecedentedly small attomolar concentrations. The system is outlined in an article appearing September 9, 2012 in the journal Nature Materials.\nMethyl mercury, toxic and difficult to monitor\nResearchers are particularly interested in detecting mercury. Its most common form, methyl mercury, accumulates as one goes up the food chain, reaching its highest levels in large predatory fish such as tuna and swordfish. In the US, France and Canada, public health authorities advise pregnant women to limit fish consumption because mercury can compromise nervous system development in the developing fetus.\n “The problem is that current monitoring techniques are too expensive and complex,” explains Constellium Chair holder at EPFL and co-author Francesco Stellacci. “We periodically test levels of mercury in drinking water, and if those results are good, we make the assumption that levels are acceptable in between those testing periods.” But industrial discharge fluctuates.\nA simple, inexpensive new technology\nThe technology developed by the Swiss-American team is simple to use. A strip of glass covered with a film of “hairy”nanoparticles is dipped into the water. When an ion – a positively charged particle, such as a methyl mercury or cadmium ion – gets in between two hairs, the hairs close up, trapping the pollutant.\n A voltage-measuring device reveals the result; the more ions there are trapped in the nano-velcro, the more electricity it will conduct. So to calculate the number of trapped particles, all one needs to do is measure the voltage across the nanostructure.\n By varying the length of the nano-hairs, the scientists can target a particular kind of pollutant. “The procedure is empirical,” explains Stellacci. Methyl mercury, fortunately, has properties that make it extremely easy to trap without accidentally trapping other substances at the same time; thus the results are very reliable.\n The interesting aspect of this approach is that the ‘reading’ glass strip could costs less than 10 dollars, while the measurement device will cost only a few hundreds of dollars. The analysis can be done in the field, so the results are immediately available. “With a conventional method, you have to send samples to the laboratory, and the analysis equipment costs several million dollars,” notes Stellacci.\nConvincing tests in Lake Michigan and Florida\nThe researchers tested the system in Lake Michigan, near Chicago. Despite the high level of industry in the region, mercury levels were extremely low. “The goal was to compare our measurements to FDA measurements done using conventional methods,” explains Stellacci. “Our results fell within an acceptable range.”\n A mosquito fish from the Everglades in Florida was also tested. This species is not very high on the food chain and thus does not accumulate high levels of mercury in its tissues. “We measured tissue that had been dissolved in acid. The goal was to see if we could detect even minuscule quantities.” says Bartosz Grzybowski, Burgess Professor of Chemistry and Director of Non-Equilibrium Energy Research Center at Northwestern University. The United States Geological Survey reported near-identical results after analyzing the same sample.\nFrom quantum to real applications\n“I think it is quite incredible,” Grzybowski adds, “how the complex principles of quantum tunneling underlying our device translate into such an accurate and practically useful device. It is also notable that our system - through some relatively simple chemical modifications - can be readily adapted to detect other toxic species” Researchers have already demonstrated the detection of cadmium with a very high femtomolar sensitivity.\n “With this technology, it will be possible to conduct tests on a much larger scale in the field, or even in fish before they are put on the market,” says lead author Eun Seon Cho. This is a necessary public health measure, given the toxic nature of methyl mercury and the extremely complex manner in which it spreads in the environment and accumulates in living tissues.\nFunding for this research came from ENI, via the ENI-MIT Alliance; the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency via a grant to MIT and U Michigan; the US Department of Energy via a Nonequilibrium Energy Research Center grant to Northwestern and U Michigan.", "summary": "Researchers develop nano-strips for inexpensive testing of mercury levels in our lakes and oceans with unprecedented sensitivity", "claim": "Researchers develop nano-strips for inexpensive testing of mercury levels in their lakes and oceans with unprecedented sensitivity", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 12], "noise": false}
{"id": 1148, "text": "Being able to monitor drug concentration in the blood of a patient is an important aspect of any pharmaceutical treatment. However, this requires equipment and facilities that are often missing from field healthcare in developing countries, but also inhibits the quality of life for patients elsewhere. EPFL scientists, working through their startup LUCENTIX, have now developed an antibody-linked biosensor that can track drug concentration in the blood by changing its color. The biosensor is incorporated into a full system that can be used in the field or by patients at home. The science behind it is published in .\nThe lab of  is known for developing biosensors, and the research gave birth to the startup , which has developed a biosensor that allows patients to easily measure drug concentrations in their system without need for complex lab systems.\nThe biosensor is a molecule made up of three components: First, a protein that can bind the drug to be monitored. Second, the light-producing enzyme luciferase. And third, a “tagging” molecule called SNAP-tag, which carries a fluorescent ligand that the protein (the first component) recognizes and binds when no drug is present. This causes a reaction between the luciferase and the fluorescent molecule called “bioluminescent resonance energy transfer” (BRET), which produces a red light. \nThe recent innovation, carried out by postdoc Lin Xue, involves replacing the binding protein of the biosensor with part of an antibody that has been developed against the target drug. When the biosensor detects and binds the drug in the patient’s blood or saliva, the antibody “prefers” to bind this rather than the SNAP-tag’s fluorescent ligand. As the ligand is displaced, the BRET reaction is progressively disrupted, and now emits a blue light.\nAntibodies are naturally able to identify and bind foreign molecules, turning our immune systems against potential infections. In addition, generating antibodies that can specifically identify small molecules like drugs is a routine procedure. This means that the monitoring system can be adapted to virtually an unlimited number of molecules, while patients can carry out the monitoring themselves at home and receive laboratory-level quality information. Current lab methods for doing this are complex and expensive, and reduce the quality of life for patients who have to often be confined within or close to hospitals.\nReplacing the binding protein with an antibody establishes a general pipeline for the generation of biosensors that can identify a synthetic drug in a patient’s blood sample. As proof-of-principle, the EPFL scientists successfully tested the new biosensors against three drugs – methotrexate, theophylline, and quinine – in the lab. The next step will be to optimize the biosensor’s sensitivity so that it can accurately detect the nanomolar or even lower concentrations of drugs/biomolecules in clinical samples.\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the NCCR Chemical Biology, and EPFL. It also received contributions from EPFL’s Protein Expression Core Facility. \nPress kit (documents, images, videos): \nReference\nLin Xue, Qiuliyang Yu, Rudolf Griss, Alberto Schena, Kai Johnsson. \nBioluminescent antibodies for point-of-care diagnostics.\nAngewandte Chemie\n 16 May 2017.

{"id": 1150, "text": "From 18 to 22 June, EPFL Rocket Team took part in the 2019 Spaceport America Cup in the New Mexico desert – the third year the School has competed in this university challenge. The student teams have to design, build and launch a rocket, and they’re judged on a number of criteria, including whether their rocket reaches a target altitude, how clever their design is and the craftsmanship used in constructing the payload.\nEPFL was one of 120 universities from around the world to compete at this year’s event. The School’s rocket, called Eiger, came in 12th place overall and fifth place in the 10k-COTS category, where the rocket had to use a commercial off-the-shelf motor and reach an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 meters). “Our category was the most popular, with around 50 teams,” says Albéric De Lajarte, a Master’s student in microengineering and a member of EPFL’s team. “Of course we would’ve liked to end up in the top three, but we’re still really happy with the result. Next time we’ll make it – we know exactly what we need to improve.”\nEiger reached the target altitude with an error of only 6% – a brilliant performance – but had problems on the descent. “The first part of the flight was great with a really straight trajectory. But there was a problem in the second phase of the parachute’s deployment, and the rocket came down faster than expected,” says De Lajarte. That cost the team precious points.\nA launch pad for a career in aerospace\nEiger took nearly 18 months to develop, and the most enthusiastic students spent 20–30 hours a week on it. “We built on the work done by last year’s team for their Matterhorn rocket,” says De Lajarte. “But since our rocket is slightly bigger – three meters long and weighing 23 kilograms – we had to scale up their design. I think we ended up with a slightly more advanced and streamlined rocket. The integrated payload had to be designed from scratch, however. That was an interesting lesson in fluid dynamics – how non-Newtonian fluids can be used as shock absorbers, for example.”\nOverall the team members are pleased with their performance – and with the experience as a whole, which was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “The competition allowed us to develop our skills, meet both volunteers and professionals who are passionate about rockets, and get valuable experience in our fields – all while having fun,” says Jules Triomphe, a Bachelor’s student in mechanical engineering on the EPFL team. De Lajarte adds: “For me it was a chance to get first-hand experience with aerospace engineering through a real-life project. As we went along, I realized this is what I’d like to pursue as a career.

{"id": 1153, "text": "Geigy’s former agricultural research center covers an area of 125 hectares. For two semesters, EPFL architecture students used this impressive setting, in the town of Saint-Aubin in Fribourg canton, as a blank canvas for their creative ideas.\nDuring the academic year, undergraduates supervised by Anja and Martin Fröhlich, directors of EPFL’s Laboratory of Elementary Architecture and Studies of Types (EAST), researched potential new uses for the site, which has been disused since 2016 (see ). On 1 and 2 September, they will present the final phase of their work in the form of an exhibition and guided tour, as part of the European Heritage Days event in partnership with Fribourg Canton’s culture department.\n“The exhibition has been devised and developed by our students to appeal to all audiences. It aims to show visitors how to appreciate the site and to highlight its interesting features. Our students will present the results of their research into ways of converting and reusing the space. The exhibition also looks at the site’s industrial heritage and future potential. This is the first time that the site has been opened to the public,” explained Tiago P. Borges, researcher at EAST and joint organizer of the exhibition.\nFour rooms\nVisitors will be able to take a tour around four rooms: Origin, Vision, Anthology and Module. The first room, Origin, looks at the history of the site, which was built between 1967 and 1970 based on a design by Zurich-based architects Jakob Zweifel and Heinrich Strickler. The architects behind the concept later designed buildings at EPFL using the same model. In that room, visitors will be able to see a scale model of the site and photos showing the various stages of its construction.\nNext, in the Vision room, visitors will be presented with ideas for converting the site that EPFL students devised in the winter 2017 semester. It also shows the site’s potential, not just at the local level but regionally and internationally as well. The four scenarios developed by the students will be on display: an agribusiness center specializing in brewing beer using potatoes, an Olympic sports center, a hub for recovering and reusing materials, and a waste sorting and recovery site.\nOrder forms\nThe third room, named Anthology, displays all items found at the site that could be reused in their current state, including hooks, shelves, lamps, sinks, handles, doors, thermometers, soap dishes, clothes horses and faucets. To raise visitors’ awareness about circular economy concepts in the construction industry, the students have developed fake order forms for each item, addressed to the Canton of Fribourg, the owner of the site.\n“It’s slightly provocative, but the idea is to show the potential to reuse the site and its contents instead of demolishing it: a sustainable approach that’s still underused. Most of the items on display have a lot of life left in them. Some can still be used for their original purpose and others can take on new functions, ranging from door handles to prefabricated concrete elements,” says Borges.\nBus stop or diving board\nThe final room, named “Module,” looks at the site’s ingenious architectural design. The design features three modular elements made from prefabricated concrete: pillars, beams and U-shaped roof sections. These elements fit together throughout the whole site like Lego pieces, depending on the building’s intended size and function. The Module room will also show the students’ ideas for repurposing the site’s modular elements. They involve taking elements that are still in good condition and using them for new purposes, for example a bus shelter, a covered market and a diving board.\nHowever, the Saint-Aubin site may not end up being broken down for parts, because the Fribourg authorities have recently launched an international invitation to tender to find a potential occupants for the site.

{"id": 1154, "text": "What was so exciting about yesterday's LIGO press announcement?\nThey announced that the LIGO-Virgo Consortium had made the first direct detection of gravitational waves using the Observatory’s advanced technology. Scientists have been trying to track down gravitational waves for decades. In the past, they have found hints of their presence, but through indirect methods of detection. We now have the first direct detection, which means we know for sure that gravitational waves exist. It is very exciting.\nScience is about collaboration – and I find this to be a great aspect of the discovery. Like so many projects in physics today, the detection involved a a large international collaboration: over 1000 members representing 15 different countries have been working together since the beginning of the project in 1997. \nWhat are gravitational waves and why are they so difficult to detect?\nGravitational waves are “ripples” through space-time, which can be caused by violent events in the universe, e.g. the merging of two black holes, or could even be created in early times, just after the Big Bang. Gravitational waves were first proposed by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, based on his theory of gravity – what is known as his theory of general relativity.\nTo detect gravitation waves, scientists use laser interferometers like LIGO’s. These systems bounce lasers over several kilometers and look for tiny, infinitesimal changes in the laser light across the length of the interferometer – think one part in 1021 (that is a 1 followed by 21 zeroes). That would be a sign that a gravitational wave passed through the instrument. It’s an amazing technological challenge, and extremely difficult to measure. \nWhat does the discovery mean for science? How does it change the way scientists observe the universe?\nThis is a breakthrough for science. Gravitational waves will help astrophysicists understand how gravity and black holes work. It also means we now have a whole new window in the universe: instead of observing the universe only with “standard” light (electromagnetic waves, which can be in the microwave, the infrared or the visible parts of the spectrum), we could hopefully now also use gravitational waves.\nWill this affect your own research?\nGravitational waves might also exist in the very early universe, in which case they are called “primordial” gravitational waves. If we can observe these, we can learn more about the very early universe. My colleagues working on the very early universe are thrilled by this discovery.\nWe live in a very special time for science. A hundred years after Einstein worked out his famous theory of gravity, we finally have the technological tools to study the night sky and understand his theory better. There are many things about his theory that scientists are testing today, and its centennial is very exciting for scientists worldwide.\nTo spread the excitement of Einstein’s theory, I collaborated in making a 3-min animation narrated by former “Dr Who” David Tennant on Einstein's theory, with award-winning animator Eoin Duffy and the director Jamie Lochhead.

{"id": 1156, "text": "If you tap the neck of a bottle of beer, it overflows with foam. But where do all these bubbles, which did not exist a split second before, come from? Pierre-François Conzelmann, mechanical engineering student specializing in aero and hydrodynamics, carried out his master's thesis on the subject. The young researcher performed various experiments at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities (LFMI) with a high-speed camera capable of recording 35’000 frames per second. He also compared the reactions of beer with those of sparkling water.\nActually, there are very small gas bubbles almost invisible to the naked eye already in the beer before the impact. \"They're called cavitation nuclei, explained Pierre-François Conzelmann. Their origins and exceptional stability are not completely understood yet. They also occupy micro glass cracks or cling to very fine dust particles which act as the nucleation sites originating the bubble columns observed in a glass of soft drink.\" For the experiments, the student tried to minimize the number of such sites by using a sterile container. Then, he artificially created two of them in the form of tiny incisions so he could observe and film the bubbles nesting there.\nPierre-François Conzelmann\nThe stiff blow to the mouth of the container generates a drop in the pressure inside. This causes micro-bubbles to grow, allowing the CO2 dissolved in the beer to penetrate inside them. Soon, they reach a critical point, implode and then break up into thousands of new bubbles that grow larger and rise more quickly to the surface. This is the same principle of cavitation, thoroughly studied in the field of navigation. The movement of boat propellers creates many bubbles, the bursting of which causes many micro-jets that accelerate the erosion of metal parts.\nStabilized surface\nThe same thing happens to sparkling water, said Pierre-François Conzelmann. By using a precision scale, he could establish that the liquid, either water or beer, under similar circumstances loses 20 mg of carbon dioxide with each blow. \"However, in the case of water, the bubbles merge very quickly into a new larger one which then bursts on the surface, whereas in the case of beer, the presence of surfactants prevents smaller bubbles from merging.\"\nSurfactants, also known as amphiphilic compounds, contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. They stabilize the surface tension of each of the bubbles, which as a result are preserved and form a compact cluster. This density, coupled with the heavy pressure exerted by the carbon dioxide towards the top of the bottle, is the reason why even the slightest shock usually provokes the discharge of a large amount of foam.", "summary": "Summer Series - Student Work (6): For his master's thesis, Pierre-François Conzelmann, mechanical engineering student, wanted to understand the reason behind the formation of a “foam volcano” after tapping the neck of a bottle of beer.

The prosthesis has been successfully tested on several patients and works by stimulating the nerves in the amputee’s stump. The nerves can then provide sensory feedback to the patients in real time – almost like they do in a natural hand.\nThe findings have been published in the journal \nScience Robotics\n. They are the result of ten years of scientific research coordinated by Silvestro Micera, a professor of bioengineering at EPFL'School of Engineering and the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, and Paolo Maria Rossini, director of neuroscience at the A. Gemelli University Polyclinic in Rome.\nSensory feedback\nCurrent myoelectric prostheses allow amputees to regain voluntary motor control of their artificial limb by exploiting residual muscle function in the forearm. However, the lack of any sensory feedback means that patients have to rely heavily on visual cues. This can prevent them from feeling that their artificial limb is part of their body and make it more unnatural to use.\nRecently, a number of research groups have managed to provide tactile feedback in amputees, leading to improved function and prosthesis embodiment. But this latest study has taken things one step further.\n\"Our study shows that sensory substitution based on intraneural stimulation can deliver both position feedback and tactile feedback simultaneously and in real time,\" explains Micera. \"The brain has no problem combining this information, and patients can process both types in real time with excellent results.\"\nIntraneural stimulation re-establishes the flow of external information using electric pulses sent by electrodes inserted directly into the amputee's stump. Patients then have to undergo training to gradually learn how to translate those pulses into proprioceptive and tactile sensations.\nThis technique enabled two amputees to regain high proprioceptive acuity, with results comparable to those obtained in healthy subjects. The simultaneous delivery of position information and tactile feedback allowed the two amputees to determine the size and shape of four objects with a high level of accuracy (75.5%).\n\"These results show that amputees can effectively process tactile and position information received simultaneously via intraneural stimulation,\" says Edoardo D'Anna, EPFL researcher and lead author of the study.\nContributions:\n Prestigious European research centers contributed to the study.

{"id": 1159, "text": "“We wanted to put people back at the center of the power grid,” said the three students who created the website ThinkEE. Their site, only accessible on the campus at the moment, is becoming a virtual forum for discussions on energy management. It has three objectives: to help consumers become aware of their energy consumption and allow them to share their experience, and to connect suppliers with consumers.\nTaking their cue from Switzerland’s goal of reducing electricity consumption by 35% between now and 2035 while at the same time limiting the impact of electricity generation on the environment, Jean-Charles Fosse, Johann Bigler and Alexandre Ringwald, long-time friends, wondered how consumers could be made to change their habits. “We spent a lot of time on this one question,” said Johann. “Preliminary work demonstrated that if people are aware of how much energy they consume, this alone will encourage them to find ways to cut back.” A sort of personal challenge.\nAnd the website suggests a number of ways to encourage the right mind-set. ThinkEE users can, for example, compare their electricity consumption with that of their neighbors, in addition to interacting and exchanging ideas with them and other users. Something like Facebook focused on electricity consumption.\n‘Experience points’ are awarded not for reducing watts consumed but rather for the useful tips that users share with others. And users can create groups, to ensure the confidentiality of their data. Only general feedback from multiple users is made public.\nMotivated by comfort\n Comfort can also be a source of motivation. Or rather discomfort, such as: an overheated classroom, hallway lights that are always on, and a building that’s cold in winter. “Let's look at EPFL: if a lot of students feel it’s too hot in an auditorium and mention it on our website, the facility management can reduce the temperature, which will at the same time reduce electricity consumption,” said Jean-Charles. Connecting users of the electrical grid will encourage them to propose changes to energy suppliers, to property managers in the case of rental apartments, and to facilities managers in office buildings.\nIn an environment where outlets and devices are equipped with sensors, as is the case in some EPFL buildings, users can see how much energy their devices use in real time. So they can simply have a look at the sensor, modify their behavior and share their observations on the new energy social network. Until this sensor technology makes its way into their homes, people can manually enter the various types of consumption.\nNew developments in 2016?\n The three students, who are now in their internship semester, are thinking about what’s next for their website. Maybe they’ll turn it into a start-up when they come back in 2016.\nFor Alexandre, this project gave them a taste of engineering in the real world. “Taking the initiative, meeting deadlines and working as a team will be fundamental aspects of our future profession. And the methods we had to learn to create the website will be put to good use in future projects.”", "summary": "Summer series on student projects: Three future micro-engineers have developed an interactive website – a sort of social network about energy – in order to link grid operators with users and encourage users to reduce their electricity consumption and share their ideas.", "claim": "Summer series on student projects: Three future micro-engineers have developed an interactive website – a sort of social network about energy – in order to link grid operators with users and encourage users to reduce your electricity consumption and share their ideas.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [38, 38], "noise": false}

There is a critical need in many countries for reliable incubators able to maintain a constant temperature around babies even if the electricity goes out.\nThis situation led Benjamin Rime, a materials science student at EPFL, to devote a semester project and then his Master’s project to developing a heat reserve based on the principle underlying phase-change materials.\nEnergy from the transformation process\nInstead of heating a simple material (water, stone or metal) in order to recover the heat later, the system that Benjamin developed uses a synthetic polymer. It is solid at room temperature and turns to liquid when heated. “Large quantities of energy are involved when changing state,” said Benjamin. “Throughout the phase in which the material solidifies back, it releases heat at a constant temperature of 52°C.”\nIn order to put this principle to work in a concrete and useful way, Benjamin created a prototype thermoregulator for incubators with support from the  program at EPFL’s Cooperation and Development Center.\nThe  project, which also includes students from the University of Yaoundé in Cameroon together with industry and academic partners, aims to design a sturdy, reliable and easy-to-use incubator capable of maintaining a sufficient temperature even during blackouts lasting several hours. “It works by melting the phase-change material when the electricity is on,” said Benjamin. “If the power goes out, a small battery-powered fan connected to a simple and rugged electronic regulator takes over and maintains a constant temperature in the incubator.”\nShocking conditions\n Benjamin spent two months in Cameroon this past spring to work on his project. “I visited hospitals and met with medical staff and mothers of premature babies,” he said. “I was shocked to see the way the temperature was maintained in incubators – often by simply placing hot-water bottles a few inches from the baby.”\n The hospital staff and the mothers seemed convinced, showing real interest in Benjamin’s project. “The part I dealt with – the regulator – is ready, and my colleagues in Yaoundé still need to finalize the overall design of the incubator and the small electronic regulator for temperature and humidity. Apart from the polymer, all the materials needed can be found there. A completed prototype should be ready this fall.”\nNow that Benjamin has graduated from EPFL, (lien vers le factsheet) is in the hands of the  team and its Swiss and African partners. “It is crucial to have local contacts to make this type of project work,” said Klaus Schönenberger, head of the EssentialTech program. “We have enlisted the support of some 200 African pediatricians and have a solid working relationship with numerous researchers.”", "summary": "Summer series: student projects.\n For his Master’s project in materials science, Benjamin Rime came up with a sturdy and innovative thermoregulation system for incubators in southern countries.", "claim": "Summer series: student projects.\n For our Master’s project in materials science, Benjamin Rime came up with a sturdy and innovative thermoregulation system for incubators in southern countries.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [8, 8], "noise": false}
{"id": 1165, "text": "A closed door is just one of many obstacles that no longer pose a barrier to the small flying robots developed jointly by Stanford University and Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. Equipped with advanced gripping technology – inspired by gecko and insect feet – and able to interact with the world around them, these robots can work together to lasso a door handle and tug the door open.\nThese FlyCroTugs – flying, micro, tugging robots – came out of the laboratories run by Mark Cutkosky, the Fletcher Jones Chair in the School of Engineering at Stanford University, and Dario Floreano, at EPFL’s School of Engineering.\nFlyCroTugs are micro air vehicles that the researchers modified so that they can anchor themselves to various surfaces using gecko adhesives and microspines. Thanks to these mechanisms, FlyCroTugs can pull objects up to 40 times their weight, such as door handles or, in a rescue scenario, cameras and water bottles. Similar vehicles produced by other researchers can tug objects only about twice their weight.\n“When you're a small robot, the world is full of large obstacles,” says Matthew Estrada, a graduate student at Stanford. Estrada worked on this project in Floreano’s  at EPFL and is the lead author of a paper published in \nScience Robotics\n. “By combining the aerodynamic forces of our vehicle and the interactive forces generated by the attachment mechanisms, we were able to come up with something that is very mobile, very strong and very small.”\nThe researchers note that the FlyCroTugs, because of their size, can safely navigate through tight spaces and fairly close to people. This makes them a good candidate for search and rescue missions. And by holding on tightly to surfaces as they tug, the tiny robots could potentially move pieces of debris or position a camera to evaluate a dangerous situation.\nTaking a cue from nature\nFlyCroTugs were inspired by nature. When the researchers began working on an air vehicle that would be fast, small, highly maneuverable and able to move large loads, they first looked at wasps.\n“Wasps fly quickly to a piece of food, and if it’s too heavy to carry off, they drag it along the ground. This observation was the genesis of our approach,” said Cutkosky, a co-author of the paper.\nBy analyzing studies on how wasps capture and transport prey, the researchers were able to identify the ratio of flight-related muscle to total mass that determines whether a wasp carries its prey or drags it. Wasps also inspired them to develop various attachment options depending on where the FlyCroTugs land. For smooth surfaces, the robots have gecko grippers, a non-sticky adhesive that mimics a gecko’s intricate toe structures. They hold on by creating intermolecular forces between the adhesive and the surface. For rough surfaces, these robots are equipped with 32 microspines, a series of fish-hook-like metal spikes that can individually latch onto small pits in a surface.\nIn order to tug a payload, each FlyCroTug has a winch with a cable and either microspines or gecko grippers. Those are its only fixed features; the rest are highly modifiable. The location of the grippers can be moved, depending on the expected landing surface, and the researchers can add parts – such as wheels – for ground locomotion. Packing all these features onto a small air vehicle that weighs just a few ounces was not easy.\n“People tend to think of drones as machines that fly and observe the world. But flying insects do many other things, such as walking, climbing, grasping and building. Social insects can even work together and combine their strength,” says Floreano, the study’s lead senior author. “Through our research, we show that small drones are capable of anchoring themselves to surfaces around them and cooperating with fellow drones. This enables them to perform tasks typically assigned to humanoid robots or much larger machines.”\nInteracting with the world\n At a time when drones and other small flying robots are all the rage, the FlyCroTugs – with their ability to perch, climb, push and pull – really stand out, according to Cutkosky.\nUsing two FlyCroTugs, the researchers were able to open a door. They also had one haul a camera to the top of a crumbling structure to peer inside. Next, they hope to work on autonomous control and the logistics of flying several vehicles at once.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and Stanford have developed small drones that can land and then move objects that are 40 times their weight, with the help of powerful winches, gecko adhesives and microspines.", "claim": "Researchers from EPFL and Stanford have developed small drones that can land and then move objects that are 40 times my weight, with the help of powerful winches, gecko adhesives and microspines.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [20, 20], "noise": false}
{"id": 1168, "text": "In the world of materials science, sometimes main discoveries can be found in unexpected places. While working on the resistivity of a type of delafossite – PdCoO\n2\n – researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Quantum Materials discovered that the electrons in their sample did not behave entirely as expected. When a magnetic field was applied, the electrons retained signatures of their wave-like nature, which could be observed even under relatively high temperature conditions and appeared in relatively large sizes. These surprising results, obtained in collaboration with several research institutions*, could prove useful, for example in the quest for quantum computing. The research will be published today in the prestigious journal \nScience\n.\nTo grasp the significance of this discovery, we need to imagine ourselves on the tiny scale of atoms. At that scale, we see that metals – even though we normally think of them as quite dense – actually consist of a great many empty spaces around the atoms. When electrons move in these interstitial spaces, they have a twofold nature, behaving both as particles and as waves. Usually their movements in a metal wire are captured well by their particle-like aspects, since their wave-like nature is far too faint and masked by various other interactions. Only under highly specific laboratory conditions, particularly at very low temperatures, experiments by Richard Webb and coworkers had famously uncovered the wave character of electrons in metals.\nThe sample studied was PdCoO\n2\n, whose electronic structure is nearly two-dimensional and extremely pure, and which is used as a catalyst in chemistry. The researchers were surprised to observe a new type of oscillations that exhibited significant coherence lengths when the sample was subject to a magnetic field. This coherence is important when trying to preserve quantum states and the conditions under which it occurred should not have been possible under the basic principles of physics. In this case, they were noted at temperatures up to 60 Kelvin and at length scales of up to 12 microns.\n\"It is gigantic!\"\n“This is truly surprising,” says Philip Moll, who heads EPFL’s Laboratory of Quantum Materials. “It’s the very first time this quantum effect has been observed in such a large piece of metal. 12 micrometers may seem small, but for the dimensions of an atom, it is gigantic. This is the length scale of biological life, such as algae and bacteria.”\nThe next step will be to try and better understand how this phenomenon is possible at this scale.

{"id": 1169, "text": "Since the discovery of Prontosil in 1932, sulfonamide antibiotics have been used to combat a wide spectrum of bacterial infections, from acne to chlamydia and pneumonia. However, their side effects can include serious neurological problems like nausea, headache, dizziness, hallucinations and even psychosis. In a recent , EPFL researchers have shown for the first time how sulfonamides can interfere with a patient’s nervous system.\nThe problem is that, even though we know how sulfonamides work, we do not understand the actual molecular mechanics behind their side effects. Consequently, it is difficult to modify drug structure or customize therapeutic regimes in order to better serve the needs of patients. That is the critical issue addressed by a team of EPFL scientists led by Kai Johnsson at EPFL’s .\nThe team drew from previous research showing that blocking the activity of a certain enzyme (sepiapterin reductase) affects the levels of an important molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in cells. BH4 is critical for the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and BH4 deficiency causes similar neurological problems to those associated with sulfonamide side effects.\nThe EPFL scientists showed for the first time that sulfonamides actually bind to the part of the enzyme that makes BH4. Using a high-throughput drug screening system, the researchers identified ten sulfonamides that strongly inhibit the enzyme. Taking advantage of the expertise of Florence Pojer at EPFL’s Global Health Institute, the scientists were able to solve the enzyme’s molecular structure and determine how sulfonamides bind to it.\nSulfonamides also seem to act on the actual biochemical pathway that synthesizes BH4, as increasing doses of the drugs decreased BH4 concentrations in cultured human cells. The critical finding, however, was that along with BH4, sulfonamides also reduced the actual production of dopamine. By giving cultured human nerve cells different sulfonamides, the researchers found that their natural production of dopamine decreased in proportion to the sulfonamide doses. In addition, it was clear that the impact on dopamine production was different between sulfonamides.\nThe group’s work shows for the first time that sulfonamides interfere with the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, which can account for their reported neurological side effects. It also helps us understand how the activity of these drugs relates to their molecular structure, and suggests ways of improving their clinical use.\n“Once you know what’s happening you can begin to think about strategies to address the problem – and that is the impact of this work”, says Kai Johnsson. “Historically, I don’t think that there is a more important class of drugs than sulfonamides, and now we can understand them better. It also reminds us that surprising discoveries can be made even for drugs this old.”\n---\n This project represents a collaboration between EPFL’s  and , and was further supported by the S and the , who also provided the high-throughput drug screening system.", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have uncovered the molecular basis behind some of the neurological side effects of sulfonamide antibiotics, providing doctors with possible means to minimize them in patients.", "claim": "Scientists at EPFL have uncovered the molecular basis behind some of the neurological side effects of sulfonamide antibiotics, providing doctors with possible means to minimize us in patients.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [26, 26], "noise": false}
{"id": 1170, "text": "A team of EPFL researchers has developed an unconventional way of microscopically cutting diamonds into a particular shape and smoothing them at an atomic level. This new technique, which will be presented at the International Conference on Diamond and Carbon Materials DCM2017 on 5 September, makes it possible to manufacture diffraction gratings out of pure diamond, which has unique properties that are ideal for both spectroscopy and the optical components used in high-powered lasers.\nDiffraction gratings are made up of parallel grooves that break up light into its spectral components, kind of like a prism. These gratings are usually made out of glass and silicon, materials that have already been used in spectrographs and to alter the color emitted by lasers.\nThe team, led by Niels Quack, a SNSF-funded professor at the School of Engineering, has now found a way to make these gratings out of single crystal diamond as well, opening up the field to an array of new possibilities. Diamonds are unmatched in terms of their thermal conductivity, which is between five and ten times greater than that of any other material used for this purpose. Diamonds are also extremely hard and work well with UV rays, as well as infrared and visible beams. \"Diamonds are chemically inert, which means that even the most aggressive chemical substances can't attack them. But it also means that they are very difficult to machine,\" explains Dr. Quack. \"So this new way of carving diamonds could prove very useful.\"\nUsing oxygen to cut diamonds\n The technique developed by the researchers is groundbreaking because it allows them to etch well defined shapes into millimeter sized single-crystal diamond plates, with the grooves separated by just a few microns and with incredibly smooth surfaces. To develop their technique, the researchers used diamonds created synthetically through chemical vapor deposition.\nThe diamonds are etched in several stages. First, a hard mask is deposited and structured on the surface of a diamond plate, which is then exposed to an oxygen plasma. The oxygen ions in the plasma are accelerated onto the surface of the diamond by an electric field. Where not covered by the hard mask, the oxygen ions remove carbon atoms from the diamond’s surface one by one. \"By adjusting the intensity of the electric field, we can alter the shape we etch into the diamond,\" explains Dr. Quack. \"For the diffraction gratings, we carve out triangular grooves that are just a few microns apart from each other. We adjust the process parameters to selectively reveal a set of well-defined crystal planes, allowing us to create V-shaped grooves that are smoothed down almost to the atomic level. It is impossible to get this kind of precision when the diamonds are simply cut with a laser.\"\nThis new technology, which was developed using the facilities in the Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMI), is the subject of a recent patent application.

{"id": 1171, "text": "Hydraulic fracturing has a wide range of applications, such as improving the productivity of wells used for fluid extraction and injection in porous rock formations. It is a routine part of hydrocarbon extraction but also of deep geothermal power operations, underground CO\n2\n storage and gravity-assisted mining. Engineers use the technique to re-level buildings via compensation grouting, prevent cracks from spreading around dams, and even improve safety in deep underground tunnels. These fractures also occur in nature, such as when magma rises in the earth crust near volcanoes or at glacier beds due to the sudden release of surface meltwater lake.\nThe industrial process involves the injection of fluid under high-pressure to create cracks in underground rock formations. “There’s a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the effect of turbulent flow when a low-viscosity liquid is used as a fracturing fluid,” says Brice Lecampion, who heads EPFL’s Geo-energy Laboratory (GEL). “We wanted to develop an accurate open-source model that ends this uncertainty once and for all.” Lecampion’s paper, which he co-authored with researcher Haseeb Zia, was published in \nJournal of Fluid Mechanics\n in October 2019. In January 2020, this leading journal in the field of fluid mechanics has chosen it for a \nFocus on Fluids\n publishing an extended comment of the paper from an expert, in a testament to the relevance of the model developed at EPFL.\nSafety and energy cost\n In order to inject or produce fluid deep underground, engineers drill a well of about ten centimeters in diameter and often extending two to three kilometers below the surface. Next, they inject a mixture of water and sand into the well over the course of 30 to 45 minutes. This creates a fracture in the rock that can reach up to 500 meters long and 100 meters high. The sand acts as a proppant – a solid material used to keep the fracture open so fluids can flow between the well and the rock. Half of the injected water is typically recovered, filtered and re-injected in subsequent pumping phases, while the other half remains underground.\nEngineers need to be able to calculate how these fractures propagate so they can determine precisely how much liquid to inject, and estimate the geometry – or length – of the resulting fractures. Improved estimation of the propagation is also vital to ensure the safety of the process, and helps engineers estimate its energy cost. \nThe hydraulic fracture process. © iStock\nImproving predictions\n For shale gas well stimulation, the injected fluid is 99% water. The remaining 1% is a friction reducer additive, a special polymer that drastically reduces turbulent flow by stopping the formation of eddies. The additive, which is widely used in industry, substantially reduces the amount of energy required for high-pressure pumping. Until now, however, its effect on fracture propagation had not been quantified.\n“We found that the additive significantly alters fracture propagation under turbulent flow conditions,” explains Lecampion. “Yet the effect only lasts for the first five to six minutes of injection and has little bearing on the final fracture geometry.” The model developed at EPFL allows engineers to more accurately predict the size of the induced fractures and, therefore, how much water can be pumped in and out of the rock, and at what rate. “Very few models of this type are open-source,” adds Lecampion. “The industry is dominated by private firms who tend to keep their calculations and assessments for themselves.”", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a new model to calculate hydraulic fracture propagation.

They also represent nearly half of the ten drugs that generated the largest revenues in 2012. But their relatively large size both prevents their effective dissemination in some tissues and requires administration by injection. In addition, they cannot be chemically synthesized, which, for the pharmaceutical industry, complicates their manufacturing. Bicycle Therapeutics is developing a new class of therapeutic agents approximately 100 times smaller. These molecules, termed bicyclic peptides, have similar binding qualities as monoclonal antibodies without sharing their limitations. Based in Cambridge, this start-up is supported with knowhow developed at the EPFL and is also licensing a patent from here.\nBicyclic peptides are named as such because they contain two loops of amino acids. They can uniquely bind to almost any biological structure and act on the target while leaving healthy cells intact. For example, they can connect to proteins of a tumor cell and inhibit its growth without affecting the surrounding tissues. The therapeutic agents are isolated from large combinatorial libraries of bicyclic peptides using a technique called phage display.\nChristian Heinis, currently a professor at EPFL, got the idea during his post-doc at the MRC (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). He sought to develop a molecular structure similar to that of the antibody that is capable of binding the target proteins, but much smaller, allowing efficient tissue distribution and production by chemical synthesis. This new molecular structure would also be compatible with techniques leading to the identification of structures that specifically bind the target proteins.\nThe researcher, in collaboration with Sir Greg Winter, has developed a technique to isolate bicyclic peptides that effectively bind a range of clinically relevant targets. Currently, Heinis is pursuing his research at EPFL’s Laboratory of Therapeutic Proteins and Peptides (LPPT). His research group has recently demonstrated the therapeutic effect of a bicyclic peptide in vivo. They have also shown how bicyclic peptides bind to their targets.

The darker blue surface illustrates where a Xe atom sits in the pores of SBMOF-1 when it adsorbs.\nNuclear energy is one of the cheapest alternatives to carbon-based fossil fuels. But nuclear-fuel reprocessing plants generate waste gas that is currently too expensive and dangerous to deal with. Scanning hundreds of thousands of materials, scientists led by EPFL and their US colleagues have now discovered a material that can absorb nuclear waste gases much more efficiently, cheaply and safely. The work is .\nNuclear-fuel reprocessing plants generate volatile radionuclides such as xenon and krypton, which escape in the so-called “off-gas” of these facilities – the gases emitted as byproducts of the chemical process. Current ways of capturing and clearing out these gases involve distillation at very low temperatures, which is expensive in both terms of energy and capital costs, and poses a risk of explosion.\nScientists led by  and colleagues in the US, have now identified a material that can be used as an efficient, cheaper, and safer alternative to separate xenon and krypton – and at room temperature. The material, abbreviated as SBMOF-1, is a nanoporous crystal and belongs a class of materials that are currently used to clear out CO\n2\n emissions and other dangerous pollutants. These materials are also very versatile, and scientists can tweak them to self-assemble into ordered, pre-determined crystal structures. In this way, they can synthesize millions of tailor-made materials that can be optimized for gas storage separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and optics.\nThe scientists carried out high-throughput screening of large material databases of over 125,000 candidates. To do this, they used molecular simulations to find structures that can separate xenon and krypton, and under conditions that match those involved in reprocessing nuclear waste.\nBecause xenon has a much shorter half-life than krypton – a month versus a decade – the scientists had to find a material that would be selective for both but would capture them separately. As xenon is used in commercial lighting, propulsion, imaging, anesthesia and insulation, it can also be sold back into the chemical market to offset costs.\nThe scientists identified and confirmed that SBMOF-1 shows remarkable xenon capturing capacity and xenon/krypton selectivity under nuclear-plant conditions and at room temperature.\nThis work involved a collaboration between EPFL’s Laboratory of Molecular Simulation, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Washington), the University of California Berkley, Stony Brook University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the IMDEA Materials Institute (Spain).

{"id": 1177, "text": "Superconductors are materials that allow electrical current to flow with no energy loss, a phenomenon that can lead to a vastly energy-efficient future (imagine computers that never overheat). Although most superconductors work close to absolute zero (0°K or -273.15°C), some can operate at higher temperatures (around -135°C) – but how that happens is something of a mystery. Publishing in , Fabrizio Carbone’s  at EPFL has developed a method that can shed light on “high-temperature” superconductivity.\nHow conventional superconductivity works\nWhen electricity passes through a conductor, e.g. a wire, some energy is lost because of resistance. This is not always a bad thing, since it can be used for heat (radiators) or light (light bulbs). But when it comes to things like national energy grids and high-voltage cables, electrical resistance (up to 7% in some grids) can mean money and constant wear.\nThis is where superconductors come in. These are materials that, when cooled down enough, conduct electricity with no resistance – and therefore no loss. How? As superconductors cool below a certain temperature, their atoms fall in line and “nudge” charge-carrying electrons together to make new particles called Cooper pairs. These electron pairs observe quantum physics and form an unusual state of matter (a Bose-Einstein Condensate) that is not affected by electrical resistance.\nSuperconductors can revolutionize the way we use and distribute energy, change modes of transportation (e.g. Japan’s magnetic levitation trains) and give us 100% energy-efficient technology. So why hasn’t that happened yet? The problem is temperature: Most superconductors only work when they are cooled close to the forbidding absolute zero. The solution lies with those that work at higher temperatures.\nA new method for exploring high-temperature superconductivity\nRecently, the lab of Fabrizio Carbone at EPFL addressed the issue by developing a novel method that can advance our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) show promise because they can operate at temperatures around -135°C – still low, but considerably cheaper and more feasible than for conventional superconductors. However, progress in HTS is limited because, even though we know that Cooper pairs are involved in high-temperature superconductivity, there is no consensus as to how they are formed.\nCarbone’s group was able, for the first time, to directly observe the formation of Cooper pairs in real time in a superconducting HTS and determine how the process affects the optical properties of the superconductor. Using a novel approach, the scientists cooled an HTS to its superconducting temperature and then repeatedly fired laser pulses on it to break up the Cooper pairs back into single electrons. As the Cooper pairs broke and re-formed, they caused a periodical change in the color spectrum of the superconductor. By measuring the color change, the researchers were able to directly study what happens in a superconducting HTS. What they discovered was that Cooper pair formation follows a completely different path than in conventional superconductors.\nCarbone’s findings mark the first direct observation of Cooper pair formation in HTS superconductivity. They also provide scientists with a powerful tool to observe the phenomenon in real time. The hope is that by extending this innovative approach to different materials, we can begin to understand how high-temperature superconductivity really works.", "summary": "Superconductors can radically change energy management as we know it, but most are commercially unusable because they only work close to absolute zero.

{"id": 1179, "text": "Soon budding artists will be able to create animated films without a Hollywood-sized budget. That’s thanks to Mosketch, software being developed jointly by EPFL and start-up . With just a few pen strokes, artists can make cartoon characters, animals, and other figures jump, run, swim, and dance. And even though Mosketch delivers performance on par with the most expensive animation applications, it doesn’t require any advanced 3D know-how. “The strength of our software is that it easily transforms 2D sketches into 3D, letting artists create 3D animation seamlessly and naturally,” said Benoît Le Callennec, co-founder and CEO of Moka Studio.\nMosketch works by bringing together and improving two major animation methods: direct kinematics, in which artists change each of a character’s joints individually; and inverse kinematics, in which artists can guide any part of a character’s body. The software lets artists transparently switch from one method to another – unlike the current market heavyweights – and model a complete posture with just a few sketches. What’s more, most applications out there lack flexibility because they require arduous preparation for each specific character. “Thanks to our advanced mathematical models, artists can animate any 3D character without a lot of up-front work. That makes our software much easier to use,” said Ronan Boulic, head of the immersive interaction research group at EPFL.\nAnother Mosketch innovation is the enhanced algorithm used to calculate 3D characters’ postures. The algorithm runs in parallel – making it 10 to 150 times faster and letting artists shape a character’s posture in real-time. And it has potential for use in other research applications, such as virtual reality and robotics. “A key challenge in virtual reality is shortening the time lapse between a user’s movement and the corresponding shift in what he sees.

{"id": 1182, "text": "The environmental impact of human activities must be reduced if we want to preserve our planet. Climate change has become a growing concern for people around the world – including many students at EPFL. To help promote sustainability, the School has introduced a new certification system for Master’s internships that indicates which opportunities adhere to strict sustainability standards. \nAll EPFL Master’s students must complete an internship of between two and six months depending on their field of study. This requirement was introduced ten years ago to help students acquire professional skills in addition to the theory and hands-on experience they get at the School. EPFL has set up a dedicated website where hundreds of businesses post internship opportunities every year; last year more than 1,100 companies posted around 3,000 internships, and 1,285 students made the most of them. Over 70% of the internships were in Switzerland; the rest were mainly in France, the US, Germany, the UK and Belgium.\nThe idea for the certification came in 2019, when climate change moved to the top of the global agenda. Young people concerned about the future held large protest rallies around the world, Greta Thunberg became a household name and citizens everywhere became aware of the urgent need to protect the environment and tackle the climate crisis. EPFL’s management stepped up its own effort by developing a new strategy and setting up a task force to draft a Climate 2030 action plan that addresses the School’s educational, research and innovation activities as well as campus operations.\nThe internship sustainability certification was rolled out this summer. Companies can obtain official EPFL recognition that their internship involves developing technology or meeting some other goal that is eco-friendly or contributes to protecting the environment. For example, interns could be asked to develop a program for modeling and subsequently reducing a building’s energy use, calculate how much solar power can be generated for a remote heating system so as to minimize the use of fossil fuels, or come up with software that lets companies measure the environmental impact of their operations.\nGetting used to thinking green\nCompanies wishing to certify their internships must fill out a questionnaire based on the United Nation’s , although modified slightly to meet engineers’ needs and background. The questionnaire responses are reviewed by Tech4Impact – an EPFL platform created to accelerate the development of innovative, sustainable technology – which then selects which internships to certify.\nThe certified internships are indicated with a colored circle – corresponding to the Sustainable Development Goals’ color wheel – on EPFL’s internship website, so that students can spot them easily.\n“With this certification system, we wanted to draw attention to sustainability-oriented internships so that companies are more likely to offer them and students are more inclined to select them,” says Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship program coordinator. “That also aligns with our School’s sustainability strategy and social responsibility approach.”\nTo prevent greenwashing, companies must provide detailed, comprehensive information, which is checked by experts. “Companies must describe the sustainability aspect of their internships in full and outline coherent sustainability objectives,” says Davor Kosanic, a Tech4Impact project manager. “It’s also a way to prompt companies to take environmental issues more seriously.”\nThe certification system is still in the testing phase. Students will be asked for feedback once the internships are completed to evaluate whether the sustainability criteria were indeed met and whether students found the certification useful. So far the system has been popular among businesses – several tens of internships had already been certified since early September.\nThe next internship season will run from February to September 2021. Students have until the end of November to select the ones they’re interested in.

{"id": 1183, "text": "The mission of the EPFL+ECAL Lab, a unit of Lausanne's Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, is to explore the potential of emerging technologies through design. Some of its recent achievements are being featured in exhibitions abroad: last summer, the Seeds of Colors installation for the Melissa Showroom In New York; in the near future, the Sous Pression exhibition for the Musée des arts décoratifs in Paris. Vaudoise Insurance decided to set the Lab a challenge for the Lausanne urban area, or more precisely for its new agency in Epalinges. At a time when everything digital is all the rage, how is the relationship between an insurance agency and the general population to be redefined? What role can the agency play in the urban fabric? The challenge applies not only to one particular agency; it raises the fundamental question of how the information society can avoid creating a dematerialized, dehumanized lifestyle and instead reconnect with the concrete realities of daily life. Vaudoise Insurance has allowed EPFL+ECAL Lab great freedom to experiment in this project, which also involves the Atelier de la conception de l’Espace (ALICE ). The two organizations are hardly beginners in this area, having been awarded a Swiss design prize last November for their work in designing the Montreux Jazz Heritage Lab.\nThe agency's physical location has been a determining factor in their thinking: it stands beside the Metro departure point for Lausanne's university institutions, in the heart of Biopôle, a vast complex devoted to medical research and new technologies. The fact is that an insurance company's mission is not only to cover risks, but to support people in the key decisions of life, to help them to plan, to look ahead. It must necessarily be immersed in the knowledge produced by society and help to disseminate this knowledge.\nDigital, architectural and human\nThe Porte des Savoirs installation is an embodiment of this objective. A system of screens and mirrors amplifies the agency space so that it is possible to display the principal new developments at EPFL, the University of Lausanne, CHUV and ECAL. The information flows at different speeds, like Metro trains, on a floor consisting of more than 18,000 LEDs, made by UTRAM, the project's official supplier. Reflections on the ceiling and in the mirrors enables people to view these information flows from outside the agency. As visitors enter, there is a change in perspective: they now see the texts right in front of them, conveying more detailed content. And they can then access even more in-depth information by using the agency's interactive tables, developed by the Lausanne-based company Atracsys, as well as interacting with Vaudoise Insurance services. These arrangements, taken as a whole, foster dialogue and create social connections between visitors and with the agency's advisors, who are always on hand to assist.\nThe purpose of the system, which is both informative and good fun, is in fact to encourage discussion and sharing. It also gains from the transparency which is a key aspect of the building, especially in terms of free circulation. This deliberate openness, based on the indoor-outdoor lighting effects, overturns the negative image that often dogs the service industry. The agency has redefined its role, becoming an actor in public space. \nRisk management, planning, innovation\n\"The Porte des Savoirs is an embodiment of Vaudoise Insurance's triple commitment to innovation, architecture and culture\", says Philippe Hebeisen, the company's Chief Executive. Back in 1956, Vaudoise Insurance made a big impact on the townscape of French-speaking Switzerland with its Jean Tschumi-designed building on the Avenue de Milan, now regarded as a cultural asset of national importance. This building regularly provides a setting for the work of artists and designers. Vaudoise's commitment to innovation was recently exemplified once again at the Comptoir Suisse by the Vaud Futur cube, which it sponsored. Innovation it is one of the primary concerns of an insurance company: guarding against risks, providing support in making vital decisions requires the ability to look into the future. And consequently to be involved in taking up the new challenges presented by our society.\nThe Porte des Savoirs will be operational from 13 March 2014. It will function in different modes, depending very much on the agency's opening hours.

{"id": 1184, "text": "On June 23rd, 2015, a primate with spinal cord injury regained control of its paralyzed leg with the help of a neuroprosthetic system called the “brain-spine interface” that bypassed the lesion, restoring communication between the brain and the region of the spinal cord. The results are published today in \nNature\n.\nThe interface decodes brain activity associated with walking movements and relays this information to the spinal cord ­– below the injury – through electrodes that stimulate the neural pathways that activate leg muscles during natural locomotion.\nThe neuroprosthetic interface was conceived at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, and developed together with an international network of collaborators including Medtronic, Brown University and Fraunhofer ICT-IMM. It was tested in collaboration with the University of Bordeaux, Motac Neuroscience and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV).\n“This is the first time that neurotechnology restores locomotion in primates,” says neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine who led the collaboration and holds the IRP chair in spinal cord repair. “But there are many challenges ahead and it may take several years before all the components of this intervention can be tested in people.”\nDecoding brain signals and activating leg muscles\nThe brain is a huge network of cells called neurons. Information is processed in the brain by transmitting spikes of electricity from one neuron to the next. This electrical spiking gives rise to brain signals that can actually be measured and interpreted.\nThe lumbar region of the spinal cord also contains complex networks of neurons that activate leg muscles to walk. Bundles of nerves coming from the brain carry the relevant information to the spinal cord about the intended activation of leg muscles.\nFor intact nervous systems, signals about walking come from a small region (about the size of a dime for primates) of the brain called the \nmotor cortex\n. Signals from the motor cortex travel down the spinal cord, reach the neural networks located in the lumbar region, and these in turn activate muscles in the legs to produce walking movements.\nSpinal cord lesions partly or completely prevent these signals from reaching the neurons that activate leg muscles, leading to paralysis. But the motor cortex can still produce spiking activity about walking, and the neural networks activating muscles in the paralyzed leg are still intact and can still generate leg movements.\nHow the brain-spine interface works\nThe brain-spine interface bridges the spinal cord injury, in \nreal-time a\nnd \nwirelessly\n. The neuroprosthetic system decodes spiking activity from the brain’s motor cortex and then relays this information to a system of electrodes located over the surface of the lumbar spinal cord, below the injury. Electrical stimulation of a few volts, delivered at precise locations in the spinal cord, modulates distinct networks of neurons that can activate specific muscles in the legs.\n“To implement the brain-spine interface, we developed an implantable, wireless system that operates in real-time and enabled a primate to behave freely, without the constraint of tethered electronics,” says Courtine. “We understood how to extract brain signals that encode flexion and extension movements of the leg with a mathematical algorithm. We then linked the decoded signals to the stimulation of specific hotspots in the spinal cord that induced the walking movement.”\nFor partial lesions of the spinal cord, the scientists showed that the primate regained control of its paralyzed leg immediately upon activation of the brain-spine interface. The interface should also work for more severe lesions of the spinal cord, according to the scientists, likely with the aid of pharmacological agents. Note that for these partial lesions, the primate is initially paralyzed and then spontaneously regains full mobility after about three months.\n“The primate was able to walk immediately once the brain-spine interface was activated. No physiotherapy or training was necessary,” says neuroscientist Erwan Bezard of Bordeaux University who oversaw the primate experiments.\nClinical Trials\n“The link between the decoding of the brain and the stimulation of the spinal cord – to make this communication exist – is completely new,” says neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch of the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) who leads the functional neurosurgery department at the Lausanne University Hospital and surgically implanted the brain and spinal cord implants.\nShe continues, “For the first time, I can imagine a completely paralyzed patient able to move their legs through this brain-spine interface.”\nIn collaboration with EPFL, Bloch is currently leading a clinical feasibility study that evaluates the therapeutic potential of this spinal cord stimulation technology, without the brain implant, to improve walking in people with partial spinal cord injury affecting the lower limbs.\nFunding Parrtners: European Community's Seventh Framework Program, International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia, European Research Council, The Wyss Centre in Geneva, Marie Curie Fellowship, Marie Curie COFUND EPFL fellowships, Medtronic, Morton Cure Paralysis Fund fellowship, NanoTera.ch Programme (SpineRepair), National Centre of Competence in Research in Robotics, Sinergia program, Sino-Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation, Swiss National Science Foundation.", "summary": "Non-human primates regain control of their paralyzed leg ­– as early as six days after spinal cord injury – thanks to a neuroprosthetic interface that acts as a wireless bridge between the brain and spine, bypassing the injury.

The mission is crucial for the future of the space industry. Now Swiss Space Systems – S3 has joined the project. The Swiss company is developing a new method to launch satellites weighing up to 250 kg, and will take charge of CleanSpace One’s launch, now scheduled for 2018. EPFL and S3 announced their partnership publicly on September 10, 2013. \nCleanSpace One, a satellite to clean up Earth’s orbit\nThe debris orbiting Earth is accumulating. Although collisions with functioning satellites are rare, each collision can generate several thousand new bits of debris. The problem is becoming increasingly serious and making space missions more complicated. \n CleanSpace One’s mission is to grab hold of a piece of space junk – in this case an out-of-commission Swiss nanosatellite measuring 10cm on each side – and thrust it into the atmosphere, where it will burn up. Navigating to and seizing the ex-satellite is a formidable feat of engineering. \nA three-phase launch\nSwiss Space Systems – S3 is now the Prime partner in this project. The company, headquartered in Payerne, Switzerland, is developing a new launch method for small satellites up to hundreds of kilograms in weight. A small shuttle rides piggyback atop an A300 jetliner. When the plane reaches cruising altitude, this Suborbital Reusable Shuttle (SOAR) lights its engines and takes off upwards. When it reaches an altitude of 80km, it ejects a vessel, which after reaching an altitude of 700 km, releases the satellite into Earth’s orbit. Both the Airbus and the shuttle are reusable and use standard fuels, making the system very cost-effective.\n The goal of this three-phase process is to make space more accessible – it cuts launch costs by a factor of four. And to make sure that this doesn’t end up putting even more space debris in Earth orbit, S3 will ensure that all the elements in the chain – including the satellites – include their own re-entry systems. In this context, their partnership with CleanSpace One makes perfect sense.\n “You can’t democratize space access without having a responsible attitude,” says Pascal Jaussi, CEO of Swiss Space Systems. “If we don’t deal with the problem of orbiting space debris and its accumulation, future generations’ access to space will be compromised.”\n The company will take care of launching CleanSpace One, which in 2018 will be the first satellite launched into orbit using the new method. All told, Swiss Space Systems will invest at least CHF 15 million in the project – CHF 10 million for the launch itself and CHF 5 million for assembling and testing satellite components and ground-based command operations.\nThe satellite design is on the right track \nAt EPFL, the project has made considerable progress since its public announcement in 2012. The design is slightly different – it’s a bit bigger than originally planned, and will weigh about 30 kg. Scientists have tested many technologies that could potentially be integrated into the satellite, some that are already on the market, and others still in the development stages in companies and universities.\n Finally, as part of a partnership with the European Space Agency, researchers are developing many key technologies targeting space debris – propulsion, navigation and reconnaissance systems and, above all, a device that can anchor itself to pieces of debris. ETH Zurich, CSEM and the Swiss Universities of Applied Science are participating in this as well.

However, conventional microscopes, the workhorses for many biological studies, can only resolve details on the order of the wavelength of light. In the past two decades, several super-resolution microscopy concepts helped researchers to overcome this diffraction limit and to make new discoveries. These new methods are only slowly finding their way into routine biological applications. For some of the new techniques, this is due to complex microscope hardware, but also increased demands on sample preparation and fluorescent labels pose significant hurdles. The requirements for successful super-resolution imaging are even more challenging to meet for multicolor applications.\nEPFL’s Laboratory of Biomedical Optics headed by Theo Lasser has been extensively working on Super-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) to increase the spatial resolution and sampling in 2D and 3D. SOFI is an alternative to Single-molecule Localization Microscopy techniques such as STORM and PALM. It analyzes higher order spatio-temporal statistics of a time-series of blinking fluorophores and does not require the isolation of individual fluorophores′ emissions. SOFI is compatible with a wider range of labeling and imaging conditions, which simplifies fluorophore selection and experiments. In their new study, researchers in the School of Engineering led by Theo Lasser and Aleksandra Radenovic (head of the Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology) extended the statistical analysis into the spectral domain to pave the way towards a new approach for multicolor super-resolution imaging.\nThe number of colors is not limited by the microscope’s spectral channels or Exploiting spectral crosstalk\nThe idea behind the multicolor SOFI approach is the following. In classical multicolor imaging crosstalk between different spectral channels of the microscope should be avoided. Here, the researchers exploit the crosstalk for generating additional color channels. They apply cross-cumulant analysis between multiple simultaneously acquired spectral channels. The statistical analysis allows them to supplement the physical detection channels provided by the microscope with additional virtual spectral channels. “Only the signals that are spatially and temporally correlated in the different spectral channels will appear in the virtual channels. We are picking up exactly the crosstalk that everyone else wants to get rid of.” explains Kristin Grußmayer, one of the lead authors of the study. The additional computationally generated spectral channels together with linear unmixing allow the imaging of more distinct fluorophore colors than recorded physical detection channels.\n The publication provides the theory behind spectral cross-cumulant multicolor SOFI and includes a framework to optimize the spectral channels of the microscope for a given combination of fluorophores that should be imaged. Simulated datasets helped the team to verify that their new multicolor approach should work for a wide range of labels with different photophysical properties, even for those with strongly overlapping emission spectra. “We could show that our approach works for three color imaging in fixed and in living cells for a variety of dyes and fluorescent proteins. The imaging can be performed using commercial widefield setups with two-channel image splitting units that are widely available. In principle, we are not limited to 3 colors.” says Kristin Grußmayer.\nInstructions for performing multicolor spectral cross-cumulant SOFI analysis are available on the webpage of the Laboratory of Nanoscale biology under https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lben/sofi-packages/ and the software package can be downloaded at", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have developed robust and easy-to-implement multicolor super-resolution imaging.

{"id": 1191, "text": "Biofuels produced using microalgae could play an important role in the transition from a fossil fuel-based to a sustainable economy. While researchers have optimized the transformation of microalgae into biogas, harvesting and drying the algae continue to consume too much energy, accounting for 20-30% of the cost of biofuel production. Now, scientists from EPFL and the Universities of the Western Cape and Stellenbosch in South Africa have come across a filamentous fungus that could cut the cost of biomass harvesting. They  in the journal \nBioresource Technology\n in June.\nBurning biogas made from microalgae only releases as much carbon into the air as the algae absorb during their growth, making algal biogas a potential carbon neutral substitute for natural gas. Curiously, the bottleneck to making the technology competitive is not in the technologically challenging process of transforming the algae into biogas, a mixture of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Researchers have  using a highly efficient process called hydrothermal gasification as part of the  . Instead, the bottleneck lies in the technologically much simpler step of harvesting the algae.\nResearchers Stephan Mackay and Eduardo Gomes may have serendipitously stumbled a potential solution to harvesting problem. When testing different types of microalgae, they noticed that in one of their samples, the algae lumped together into little pellets. Upon close investigation, they identified the culprit: a filamentous fungus, Isaria fumosorosea that had contaminated their samples. The pellets that they observed were in fact lichens, hybrid structures made up of algae and fungi. A few millimeters in diameter, the pellets are large enough to be harvested from the water with a simple filter, with much lower energy expenditure than conventional approaches such as drying and dewatering.\nAccording the Jean-Paul Schwitzguébel from EPFL’s Laboratory for Environmental Biotechnology and the principal investigator of the study, the next steps would be to assess the energy savings that could be made using the approach if it were to be scaled up.\nThis work builds on the output of the SunCHem project, carried out by the  (CCEM), in collaboration with EPFL, the  (PSI) and other partners.", "summary": "Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuels, but current methods of harvesting and dewatering them are unsustainable.

{"id": 1193, "text": "Diabetes can lead to dangerous complications that all too often end in amputation of the foot or even death. To avoid these eventualities, a team of researchers from EPFL is collaborating with the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) on a smart shoe. The technology is based on actuators that electronically control the stiffness of the sole in order to reduce the onset of diabetic foot ulcers and prevent existing ones from worsening. An initial prototype has just been completed.\nEvery year in Europe, 250,000 diabetics have a leg amputated, and the mortality rate is 30% at 30 days and 50% at one year. Foot ulcers are the root cause of most of the amputations. These wounds, which are the result of vascularization and excess pressure, easily worsen in part because they are not painful. Many diabetics are unaware of how serious they are and continue to walk normally, preventing the ulcers from healing. They don’t see their doctor until the lesion reaches the bone, at which point the risk of secondary infection and then gangrene is high.\nControlling viscosity\nThe challenge for doctors is threefold. They need to find a way to remove all pressure from the ulcers as soon as they appear, keep it off as long as necessary for them to fully heal, and quickly react to new ulcers, which can reappear at any time elsewhere on the arch of the foot.\nIn response to this challenge, researchers from EPFL’s Integrated Actuators Laboratory (LAI) in Neuchâtel came up with an idea: embed the sole of a shoe with around 50 small electromagnetic valves filled with magnetorheological material. “We can control the viscosity of the material, which is made up of suspended iron microparticles,” said Yves Perriard, the director of LAI. “When we apply a magnetic field, the particles react immediately and align themselves with it, causing the material to change from liquid to solid state in a fraction of a second.”\nThis means that the rigidity in different parts of the shoe sole can be controlled separately depending on where the sensitive areas and wounds are. The system should not only help the wounds heal quickly but also prevent the onset of new ulcers.\nFewer constraints\nThis invention offers a number of advantages, such as considerably simplifying diabetics’ day-to-day life. “A number of other solutions exist, such as bandages and pressure-relief insoles,” said Zoltan Pataky, an internal medicine specialist at HUG who started the project. “But they are very restrictive and need to be constantly adjusted, and so patients are often reluctant to use them and doctors hesitate to prescribe them. The advantage of this shoe is that, in addition to relieving the arch of the foot wherever necessary, it immediately adjusts the pressure as some ulcers heal and others appear.” The lab is currently searching for industry partners to further develop the project.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a shoe sole with valves that electronically control the pressure applied to the arch of the foot.

{"id": 1197, "text": "A number of studies have compared various energy-transition scenarios for Switzerland in terms of CO\n2\n emissions and final energy and electricity consumption. But few studies have looked at the economic impact of the country’s energy transition. Researchers at EPFL have addressed this shortcoming by looking at how three realistic scenarios would affect Switzerland's energy situation in 2050.\nUnder the first, “status quo” scenario, the federal government's 2011 energy policy remains in place with no additional measures. The second scenario looks at what the situation will be like in 2050 if measures recently adopted by the Federal Council are fully implemented. And the third scenario is based on the federal government's new 2050 energy policy (a vote on the first round of measures already took place, on 21 May 2017).\nUsing , the online calculator developed by  and the Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering (IPESE) laboratory, the researchers analyzed the impact that each of these scenarios would have in terms of jobs, energy-related costs and Switzerland’s energy independence.\nRenewable energy and increased energy efficiency boost energy independence\nThe third, “new energy policy” scenario turned out to be the best in terms of Switzerland’s energy independence. The use of locally sourced renewable energy – such as solar, wind, hydro and wood-based power – combined with an improvement in the energy efficiency of cars and buildings would result in a sharp decrease in energy imports such as heating oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas. The country’s energy independence would increase from 26% today to around 72% by 2050 under this scenario. With the second scenario, in which the Federal Council's energy measures are brought in, the level would increase to just 46%. And unsurprisingly, Switzerland’s energy independence would remain at 26% under the first, “status quo” scenario (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Energy independence \nEnergy efficiency creates jobs\nThe energyscope.ch calculator also now includes a new tool for analyzing the impact of energy-efficiency measures on jobs, recently developed by the Energy Center and the Laboratory of Environmental and Urban Economics (LEURE).\nThe results show that there would be 35% more jobs in Switzerland’s energy-related sectors under the “new energy policy” scenario than under the other two scenarios. “This is mainly because new measures to increase energy efficiency would create jobs, particularly when it comes to building renovation, where a large part of the value added would be generated by local companies in Switzerland,” says Professor Philippe Thalmann from LEURE. “The other scenarios rely more heavily on fuel imports, which would account for a larger proportion of costs and produce fewer jobs locally” (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Employement \nWhat’s more, under the “new energy policy” scenario, the number of jobs in the transport sector would increase as the focus shifted more towards public transportation. However, the rise in the number of electric cars, which require much less maintenance than gasoline- and diesel-powered cars, would probably result in fewer jobs in the automobile sector.\nIn their study, the researchers looked at each sector directly linked to energy production and distribution. They used an input-output model to estimate the number of jobs created as a result of the energy transition, looking at the structural impact on the economy based on current energy prices.\nSimilar costs for all three scenarios\nUnder all three scenarios, the calculator put the annual costs of each energy system at around 24 billion francs (excluding taxes). This figure includes infrastructure costs (such as the power grid, production units, etc.), the costs of enhancing energy efficiency, and the cost of importing petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.\nThe investment needed for the three scenarios varied by less than 10% (see Figure 3). So after factoring in a margin of uncertainty, no one scenario stands out as being more expensive than the others. However, the future costs of the scenarios that rely more heavily on fossil fuels are more uncertain; such energy systems are exposed to oil and gas prices, which are more difficult to forecast over the long term than clean tech prices are.\n“This is not really all that surprising,” says Professor François Maréchal from IPESE. “Renewable energy, coupled with greater energy efficiency, would of course require additional investment, but this would be offset by the decrease in fuel imports. On top of that, renewable energy – and especially photovoltaic solar power – and energy-efficient solutions like electric cars will keep getting cheaper.”\nFigure 3: Costs", "summary": "A handful of EPFL laboratories teamed up to compare three energy-transition scenarios that vary in their use of fossil fuels and renewable energy and their energy efficiency.

{"id": 1200, "text": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 70% of medical devices acquired by developing countries, or donated, will never actually be used! This is due to, for example, insufficient knowledge or expertise to install the device, missing electrical cables, or the absence of qualified personnel. And the remaining 30% often can no longer be used when it becomes necessary to order accessories or spare parts. The vast majority of the inhabitants of these countries has no access to such essential equipment as X-ray machines, incubators for newborn babies or equipment for anesthetics. EssentialMed, a start-up established in September 2010 at the Science Park at Ecublens, is working to improve this situation.\n This is indeed a vast project since, to be effective, the device must be adapted to the context in which it is to be used. “This means we have to completely re-think each device, integrating in its design effective solutions to the recurring problems in these countries. These can include: an electricity network that is often defective, resulting in excessive voltages that damage the device; a lack of financial resources for the purchase of the device and the accessories necessary for its functioning; complexity of utilization for poorly trained personnel; or theft”, emphasizes Klaus Schönenberger, one of the founders, who has spent around ten years in the management team of a multinational company manufacturing medical devices. This is the context to the signing of a cooperation agreement with EPFL.The cooperation unit and the UNESCO chair in technology for development are working in close collaboration with this rather special start-up, which is constituted as a foundation and is a not-for-profit organization. “We must not only support progress, but also access to these inventions”, insisted Patrick Aebischer, President of EPFL, at the launch of the start-up in the Science Park. \n Three EPFL laboratories involved\n The first target is an X-ray machine. “We often speak about infectious diseases when we’re thinking about health problems in developing countries, but road accidents are unfortunately among the main causes of death or handicap. In fact, 90% of these accidents take place in the southern hemisphere”, explains Klaus Schönenberger. Two-thirds of humanity has no access to medical imaging equipment, although it is obviously essential in such circumstances. The development work has been broken down into different “technological modules”: the X-ray source (the tube), the X-ray detector (creation of the image), the electric power unit, the mechanical stand, the image-treatment system, and the user interface. The device will include a solution that will enable it to continue functioning in spite of frequent electricity cuts. It must also be robust and require only a minimum of maintenance, while enabling the creation of images in high temperatures, as well as high levels of humidity and dust.\n Three EPFL laboratories are providing their know-how to respond to some of the challenges involved: the Laboratory of Industrial Electronics, the Laboratory of Composite and Polymer Technology, and the Audio Visual Communications Laboratory. The Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen is providing know-how in X-ray technology, and is treating the project with high importance. The HEIG-VD school in Yverdon will also be contributing to the project, as will the Institute of Tropical Medicine and Public Health in Basel. “The objective is to create a prototype that can be operational three years from now. However, the foundation is still looking for financial partners – foundations, sponsors or philanthropists – who are equally motivated by the challenges of this project.” The goal is to ensure that the device is adapted to developing countries, but also to reduce its price and that of its accessories by a factor of ten. The installation of the equipment in the target countries will include the device itself, plus a follow-up on site, training of the users from the commissioning of the device until the end of its life.

{"id": 1203, "text": "Some places are avalanche magnets; consider the Vallée de la Sionne on southern flanks of the Sex Noir in Valais, where about one hundred avalanches come rumbling down every year. But evaluating which slopes are most prone to avalanches remains as much an art as it is a science. Today’s most advanced models simulate the physics of avalanches and aim to provide a short-term estimation of the risk for specific slopes. Two years ago, researchers from EPFL proposed a  to assesses long-term avalanche activity and quantify the statistical link between snowfall and avalanches. Using observations of close to 550 avalanches collected in the Vallée de la Sionne over six years, the researchers have now validated their model. They  in the Journal of Geophysical Research – Earth Surface.\nAccording to Benoît Crouzy, co-author of the study, the long-term assessment of the avalanche activity requires statistical methods. Today’s physics-based models are particularly suitable to make operational predictions several days into the future. But like weather forecasting models, they need to be fed with vast amounts of data and their accuracy tapers off after a few days. The statistical model Crouzy and his colleagues validated seeks to answer questions of a different nature. Rather than simulating the detailed mechanics of avalanches and the events that lead up to them, it focuses on their frequency and on their synchronization with snowfall. It further quantifies the degree of certainty associated to avalanche prediction from snowfall.\nThe model simplifies the dynamics behind avalanches as much as possible, says Paolo Perona, who initially developed the model two years ago. As opposed to methods that simulate the detailed physics of avalanches, this statistics-based approach needs only few parameters to calibrate: the average amount of snow per snowfall, the average time between them, and the rate at which the snow is compacted. The triggering of avalanches is modeled using probabilities, taking into account snow depth and a measure of the steepness of the terrain.\nData gathered by the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF in the Vallée de la Sionne provided Crouzy and his collaborators with the above-mentioned values needed for calibration. Combining this information with photographs taken before and after around 550 avalanches geo-referenced on a highly accurate 3D model of the topography, the researchers obtained previously unavailable data on the frequency of avalanche detachment, the expected time delay between snowfall and natural avalanches, and their long-term incidence in a given terrain.\nStatistical approaches to evaluate avalanche risk require observations of hundreds of individual avalanches to be calibrated accurately. But because avalanches are relatively rare – only few occur at the same place in a given year –, this data is often not available, which is one reason why these methods are less common than for the analysis of conventional hydrological hazards such as floods, says Crouzy. The availability of webcams and weather stations could now change that.\nReferences:\nPaolo Perona, Edoardo Daly, Benoît Crouzy, Amilcare Porporato (2012), Stochastic dynamics of snow avalanche occurrence by superposition of Poisson processes, Proc.

Five autonomous robots, developed by EPFL students, which took turns strutting their stuff in the arena. Their mission was to collect recyclable plastic bottles scattered around the floor and deliver them to a collection point, while navigating around various obstacles. Each bottle represented a certain number of points depending on its position in the arena.\nThe robot named Baby won with pizzazz: it shot the bottles directly at the collection point with its integrated cannon while AC/DC music pumped in the background. Baby racked up 100 points, using its four sensors - three at ground level and one on top - to tell the bottles from the obstacles. Its approach is simple. When it encounters a bottle, its adhesive mechanical arm swings down, picks it up and drops it into its bin. Then, it shoots the bottles through the air towards the collection point with a cannon. \"The robot has an electronic compass to aim its cannon,\" said Chiara Ercolani, one of Baby's designers. \"And the power of the cannon is adjusted for the distance between the robot and the collection point.\" Antoine Tardy added: \"We thought it would be a waste of time for the robot to go back and forth to the collection point.

These ion channels play a fundamental role in how neurons, muscular cells and cardiac cells in particular function.\nIon channels are extremely complex, and many questions remain unanswered. How do the channels select the ions allowed to pass through? What accounts for the channels' high conductivity?\nResearchers in EPFL's Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology, which is headed by Aleksandra Radenovic, have demonstrated that ion transport could be described by a law of physics called Coulomb blockade. This finding has been published in Nature Materials. Their observation could improve our understanding of how these channels work.\nAn island of ions\n To carry out their tests, the researchers created an artificial ion channel by making a hole less than a nanometer in size in a two dimensional material molybdenum disulfide. Then they put this material into a device consisting of two electrodes together with ionic solution on each side. When they applied a voltage, they were able to measure variations in the current between the two chambers. In contrast to the conventional ion transport in larger nanopores (>1 nm), where the flow of ions never completely stops, they observed at low voltage energy gaps- strips without any current - which showed that the ions were held up in the nanopore until the applied voltage was high enough to facilitate their crossing from one side of the hole to the other one.\nIn order to interpret these energy gaps, the researchers carried out other tests, such as playing with the liquid's pH , which modulates the charge of the pore. pH-induced conductance oscillations were also found. All these measurements led to the same conclusion: the manner which the ions are transported can be explained in terms of Coulomb blockade, a law of physics commonly associated with electron transport in quantum dots.\nUntil now, the mechanism characterized by Coulomb blockade was observed in electronics, particularly in semiconductor particles called quantum dots that tightly confine either electrons or electron holes in all three spatial dimensions. These ‘islands' are only able to hold a certain number of electrons, before giving way to the newcomers. The experiment led by EPFL researchers showed that the same phenomenon was happening with ion transport, when there was a nanopore involved.\n\"A number of theorists had predicted that Coulomb blockade could also be applied to ion channels.

The Innocell builds on a formal relationship that dates back to 2014, when EPFL and SBB signed a cooperation agreement. That arrangement, known as SBB Hub, has given rise to a series of major research projects, including some funded by Innosuisse.\nExpertise and creativity\n The benefits of the relationship flow both ways. “We’re constantly sharing knowledge and ideas with our counterparts at SBB, even when we’re not working towards actual research projects,” says Simone Amorosi, who serves as deputy director of EPFL’s TRACE, the body responsible for liaising with industry and the public sector on passenger and freight transportation research. “And because SBB’s expertise is so broad, our labs often end up exploring novel solutions to practical problems that, on the face of it, have little to do with rail transportation.” One such example is the “On the fly” project, which uses building information modeling (BIM) software to create a digital twin of SBB’s network.

The blood work that medical staff rely on is generally a snapshot indicative of the moment the blood is drawn before it undergoes hours – or even days – of analysis.\nSeveral EPFL laboratories are working on devices allowing constant analysis over as long a period as possible.

A group of electrochemical sensors works with or without enzymes, which means the device can react to a wide range of compounds, and it can do so for several days or even weeks.\nThis one-centimetre square device contains three main components: a circuit with six sensors, a control unit that analyses incoming signals, and a radio transmission module. It also has an induction coil that draws power from an external battery attached to the skin by a patch. “A simple plaster holds together the battery, the coil and a Bluetooth module used to send the results immediately to a mobile phone,” said Dr Carrara.\nContactless, in vivo monitoring\n The chip was successfully tested in vivo on mice at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) in Bellinzona, where researchers were able to constantly monitor glucose and paracetamol levels without a wire tracker getting in the way of the animals’ daily activities. The results were extremely promising, which means that clinical tests on humans could take place in three to five years – especially since the procedure is only minimally invasive, with the chip being implanted just under the epidermis.\n“Knowing the precise and real-time effect of drugs on the metabolism is one of the keys to the type of personalised, precision medicine that we are striving for,” said Dr Carrara.", "summary": "It’s only a centimetre long, it’s placed under your skin, it’s powered by a patch on the surface of your skin and it communicates with your mobile phone.

Anton Schleiss, director of EPFL’, is participating in the project. “Glaciers store water and transfer winter precipitation into summer runoff. Once they have disappeared, we will need to manage these new reservoirs, which will take over this water storage role.”\n For his Master’s thesis project, EPFL Civil Engineering student David Zumofen studied several different options for how we can take advantage of these new natural reservoirs to produce electricity. \n In the first scenario, the lake water would go through turbines on site, as part of the construction of a future Gletsch-Oberwald hydroelectric power plant. This would yield less energy, but would not require altering any existing structures between the Rhone and Lake Geneva. \n The second scenario would use the existing hydroelectric structures in place in Oberhasli, on the other side of the Grimsel Pass, at the drainage divide between the Rhine and Rhone watersheds. Because the water can pass through existing turbines several times on its journey downstream, this solution is much cheaper and could generate more electricity. The only problem is that the water will end up in the Rhine, depriving the Rhone of an important source of water.\nThe Rhone glacier is visibly melting\n Over the past ten years, the Rhone glacier has lost 6% of its mass.

{"id": 1218, "text": "What impressed you about NeighborHub?\nThe whole project fascinated me. I learned about it after the Swiss team’s “famous” victory in Denver, and had the honor of taking Germany’s president on a tour of the building during his visit to Switzerland. NeighborHub’s success shows that a cross-disciplinary approach can be highly effective for resolving complex issues – and that such an approach is one of the strengths our country can leverage. The project brought together experts in fields ranging from energy and ecology to design, mobility and even food production. The project also shows the added value in bringing together EPFL, the University of Fribourg and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Each one added essential skills and experience to the project.\nHow can this type of research initiative help foster progress in your department’s areas of focus?\nEvery field of research has not only its own body of knowledge, but also its own methods. This type of cross-disciplinary approach can bring fresh ideas to discussions that experts from the same field might have among themselves. Also, we’re interested in tangible results, and that’s something NeighborHub delivers. We can market the building and integrate it into our society. This is the kind of initiative that can help effect change.\nWhat advice would you give to the current generation of students?\nThat they need to take a proactive role if they want to advance their fields. According to EasyPark’s Smart Cities Index – which ranks cities according to criteria such as mobility, sustainability, energy, quality of life and digital infrastructure – Zurich comes in fourth place and Geneva, ninth. So we’re not on top, and still have progress to make in the areas that today’s youth are concerned about.\nHow important is the research done by Switzerland’s specialized universities for public policymakers?\nYou are our gems! You do excellent work that bolsters our country’s economy and global reputation. The Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne and Zurich are ranked among the best universities in Europe. You drive innovation and are at the forefront of the latest developments. For us it’s very important to stay updated on what your researchers are doing – what international projects they’re working on. We need to bring initiatives like NeighborHub out into the spotlight. They harbor useful new technology that should be shown and promoted to small businesses and society in general. Our talks with universities are a source of inspiration for us and point the way forward, including in terms of funding.\nTransportation – especially by air – isn’t exactly good for the environment, but people today are traveling more than ever. What are your priorities for responding to this growing need? Planes, trains or automobiles?\nI believe it’s dangerous to set priorities for specific means of transportation. Today’s lifestyles are shifting towards multimodal systems, and that trend is set to accelerate. Our strategy is to identify investment opportunities in various forms of transportation and infrastructure based on their environmental impact, energy use and the number of people they carry. Trains are clearly the best choice for long-distance travel, but when it comes to visiting other countries, flying is an inexpensive, quick and easy solution. All we can do there is question whether those low fares are appropriate or disconnected from the market. And there are the issues of CO\n2\n emissions and the use of kerosene-based versus gasoline-based fuel.\nSwitzerland is behind other countries such as Norway when it comes to electric vehicles. Do you have any measures planned to encourage EV use?\nWe do fairly well when compared with other European countries. Norway clearly comes out on top, but that’s thanks in large part to subsidies – something we want to avoid. Our country’s car importers have set themselves the target of having 10% of new cars be electric by 2020 [the figure is currently 0.4%]. We could do more, but that would depend on three key variables: the vehicles’ range, their cost – which is increasingly in line with that of standard cars – and our country’s charging station infrastructure. We are in the process of building that infrastructure, but we need the support of cantonal and municipal governments as well as the private sector. The Swiss Federal Roads Office is encouraging the installation of charging stations at highway rest stops. For now, electric cars in Switzerland are exempt from taxes and duties, except for the highway pass. But given that these cars are driven on our roadways, it would make sense to eventually ask their drivers to contribute to the cost of maintaining those roadways. However, the timing for that is still very much up in the air.\nDoris Leuthard during one of her visits at EPFL, in 2013. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL\nHow do you feel about self-driving cars? Do you think they could help alleviate traffic congestion and bottlenecks?\nI’m not sure if they could be part of the solution, but I do know that the technology is advancing at a rapid pace. In any case, those cars still need road infrastructure, so that doesn’t change our plans or investment objectives. It will be interesting to see the day when all cars on the road are autonomous. But in the meantime, as long as there’s a mix of driver and driverless cars, that won’t change traffic flows, speeds or safety. Plus there’s a number of legal and ethical issues that still need to be sorted out.\nThis summer EPFL students will compete in the Hyperloop competition. Do you see a future for this technology?\nI see it as a visionary concept, like Solar Impulse. These ideas typically strike us as eccentric, or even unrealistic, but sometimes we need to think outside the box. Such large-scale programs usually result in many smaller projects that churn out genuine solutions. In research, including at EPFL, you need vision and a sense of daring. It would be a mistake to focus only on research where we know the outcome. We have to push boundaries, conceive the unconceivable. But that’s harder in politics, where we have to be pragmatic.\nAnd how do you feel about the planned underground freight system?\nWe’ve been behind this project from the start. There are clear benefits to reducing the amount of freight traffic on our national highways, especially if the funding comes from the private sector. The idea seems feasible and I think the costs can be managed. Now it’s up to the project investors to decide – they will have to submit their plans to the Swiss Federal Council since a special law would need to be passed for the project to go through.\nThe days for nuclear power as we know it are numbered. But Switzerland still has five operating nuclear plants that will need to be decommissioned. Do you think there’s much of a future for careers in nuclear engineering?\nNuclear engineers, physicists and other such experts are still very much needed, and the dwindling appeal of this field is worrying. A nuclear power plant can run for 50 years and takes ten years to decommission, meaning we’ll need qualified personnel for our Leibstadt plant, for example, until 2045. That’s a long career for someone just starting out. But on top of decommissioning, there’s also R&D. We’re still involved in the ITER project because who knows – maybe we’ll see a major breakthrough ten years from now. Not to mention the possible applications in healthcare.\nYou’ve had a lot of success championing various political issues. Which were you the most enthusiastic about?\nProbably Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050. That was especially tough in the months right after Fukushima. I asked myself a lot of questions – what should we do? What’s feasible? Do I have the courage to go through with it? To help find the answers, I worked with businesses, cantons and cities, as well as EPFL and ETHZ, which was all extremely interesting. The EPFL and EPFZ scientists did a lot to support us, providing expertise in areas like energy efficiency, renewable energy and economic feasibility studies. As a politician, I often have a hard time getting my head around the technical details, so it was nice to be able to draw on that network. Thanks to their support, I had the courage to stand behind the strategy, knowing that experts have confirmed that our plans are technically feasible. That left me with the political part of the job – getting the various parties, the Swiss parliament and eventually the Swiss people on board.\nWhat do you plan to do after you leave the Swiss Federal Council?\nThere are a lot of things I’m interested in, but the first thing I plan to do is take some vacation. I promised my husband we’d go on a long trip and get a closer look at the wonders of this planet.\nAfter you go, there could be just one woman remaining on the Federal Council, down from four in 2010. Does that worry you?\nYes, because in politics, as elsewhere, women are underrepresented. I plan to continue to defend women’s issues after I step down from the Federal Council. It’s true that there may be just one or two women on the Federal Council for a while. But I think there is already pressure to change that, especially on the PLR and the UDC which each have two seats. The women are there, but we shouldn’t look only at the federal level; there are also many female political leaders at the cantonal level who could serve on the Federal Council. Parliament just needs to elect them.\nBrief bio\n1963\n Born in the Canton of Aargau\n1991\n Admitted to the bar\n2006\n Elected to the Swiss Federal Council\n201\n0 & 2017 Served as president of Switzerland\n2017\n Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050 approved in a referendum", "summary": "Doris Leuthard, head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, takes a hands-on approach.

{"id": 1225, "text": "With its 500 km diameter, the asteroid Vesta is one of the largest known planet embryos. It came into existence at the same time as the Solar System. Spurring scientific interest, NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft on Vesta’s orbit for one year between July 2011 and July 2012.\nData gathered by Dawn were analyzed by a team of researchers from EPFL as well as the Universities of Bern (Switzerlanf), Brittany (France) and Arizona (USA). Conclusion : the asteroid's crust is almost three times thicker than expected. The study does not only have implications for the structure of this celestial object, located between Mars and Jupiter. Their results challenge a fundamental component in planet formation models, namely the composition of the original cloud of matter that aggregated together, heated, melted and then crystallized to form planets.\nAt EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory (EPSL), led by Philippe Gillet, Harold Clenet had a look at the composition of the rocks scattered across Vesta’s ground. \"What is striking is the absence of a particular mineral, olivine, on the asteroid’s surface,\" said the researcher. Olivine is a main component of planetary mantles and should have been found in large quantities on the surface of Vesta, due to a double meteorite impact which, according to computer simulations, \"dug\" the celestial body’s southern pole to a depth of 80 km, catapulting large amounts of materials to the surface.\nThe two impacts were so powerful that more than 5 % of Earth's meteorites come from Vesta. « But these cataclysms were not strong enough to pierce through the crust and reach the asteroid's mantle,» Harold Clenet continued. The meteorites originating from Vesta and found on Earth confirm this since they generally lack Olivine, or contain only minute amounts compared to the amount observed in planetary mantles. Also, the spacecraft Dawn did not find olivine in the vicinity of the two impact craters. « This means that the crust of the asteroid is not 30 km thick, as suggested by the models, but more than 80 km. »\nComposition of planets\nThese discoveries challenge models that describe the formation of Vesta, and consequently the formation of rocky planets in the Solar System including planet Earth. Cooling theory and \"re- melting\" phenomena in the depths of previously solidified elements would also need to be reviewed. \"The crust might have been thickened by the formation of \"plutons\", that is: igneous rock intrusions, hundreds of meters large, some of which emerged to the surface,\" explained the scientist.\nIf Vesta has less of a (olivine-rich) mantle and more of a (pyroxene-rich) crust, then the proportion of materials making up Vesta, and probably the Earth and other telluric planets (Mars, Venus, Mercury), is different from what was previously expected.\nA more complex model of planet formation therefore has to be considered, one that takes into account not only the original composition of planets, but also their orbits, sizes and related cooling times. Vesta is the only known asteroid that has an earth-like structure - with a core, mantle and crust – making it an incredible laboratory for testing hypotheses and theories.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have a better understanding of the asteroid Vesta and its internal structure, thanks to numerical simulations and data from the space mission Dawn.

{"id": 1226, "text": "Twenty years ago, each research laboratory within the Chemistry Department trained its own technician, which was a drain on resources. So it was decided that a joint training unit for preparative and analytical chemistry would be created in order to improve efficiency and ensure consistency. Francis Perritaz, now head of technician training at EPFL, was put in charge of setting up the training lab. Four budding young technicians made up the first class in 1997, and each year since 2006 there have been 24 trainees across the three years of the course.\nCéline Henzelin runs the Training Laboratory now and also trains the first-year students. \"They're taking their first steps as lab technicians – they’re rookies, so they’re curious and have a fresh perspective. They can easily get hooked very quickly and go far.\" Her colleague, Luke Harris, takes the second-year trainees under his wing, while the third years work with the various research groups.\nHenzelin studied at the University of Lausanne. She completed her doctoral thesis at EPFL before going to work in the pharmaceutical industry. Later on, she did a teacher training course and then applied for the job at the Training Laboratory six years ago. \"What first interested me about this job was being at EPFL and the importance placed on practical training.\"\nBeing a chemistry lab technician is a very demanding job that requires great rigor and strong technical skills. Trainees specialize in preparative and synthetic chemistry. They have to be able to synthesize and characterize known and new molecules for therapeutic or research purposes. They also have to be able to use their know-how in other laboratories, which is what they learn when they work with the research groups for their third-year internships.\n\"Our relationship with the professors, doctoral students and post-doctoral students is very important. We are in regular contact with them so that we know what they'd like us to improve in our training. That way, when the trainees arrive in the laboratory for their final year, they are already autonomous and prepared to further strengthen their skills,\" explains Henzelin. Trainees come out of the course with versatile skills and the know-how they need to work in the chemistry industry.\nAnd even if the training is conducted in an academic setting, the two trainers are always thinking ahead to what the industry will need: \"Both Luke and I know that world well because we came from there.\"\nSo what do the trainees do once they've finished the course? It may sound surprising but the Training Laboratory is also a stepping stone to further studies: a third of trainees end up enrolling in an engineering school and around 2% go on to EPFL or another university – some even finish by doing a PhD. \"One of the first trainees who went through the program is now a research and teaching associate in the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering,\" says Henzelin. \"In each year, there's at least one trainee who goes on to study at the university level.\"\nThe Training Laboratory's 20th anniversary is also an opportunity to look to the future. Starting this September, the laboratory will offer new training prospects for young lab technicians. They will be able to do an in-company internship lasting between six months and a year in the UK, Ireland or elsewhere in Europe to fine-tune both their linguistic and their technical skills once they've earned their qualification.\nSo what's next? Céline Henzelin has a ready answer: \"Keep training motivated young technicians who love their work. And here's to the next 20 years!\"\nAlec Gagnebin, Sarah Mikami and Xavier Volet are in their second year. Their week is divided up into two days of classes and three days in the lab – they all say they prefer the practical training to the theory.\nAlec enjoyed math and wanted to learn more about chemistry. He couldn't really see himself staying in school, sitting in class five days a week. What does he like best about the training program? Making new things and contributing to research.\nSarah decided to follow the training program after doing a chemistry internship.

Marco Bakker was at first assistant to Prof. Vincent Mangeat at EPFL. Then, in 2009, he was hired with his associate, as visiting professor in the Architecture section of EPFL.\nThe two architects propose an original “outside of the box” approach, very much open to experimentation. Their vision and their teaching methods will thus enable students to explore, from an “non-conformist” viewpoint, innovative architectural solutions to the problems caused by the requirements of sustainable development.\nhas been appointed as Associate Professor of Architecture at 80% (Design Communication) at the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC)\nNicola Braghieri has entered many architectural competitions in Italy and abroad. In 2002, he won the international competition to design a new residential district in Settimo Milanese. A year later he was finalist of the international competition for the Professional Training Center in Sasso Marconi; and in 2007 finalist in the prestigious competition for the extension of the Stockholm Library. In 2011, he won the competition to design a housing complex in the canton of Geneva. He is currently Associate Professor at the University of Genoa.\n In the course of his teaching activity, Nicola Braghieri has developed an “elementary” pedagogical method based on the close relationship between theory and practice, aiming as much at technical accuracy as at “poetic” intensity.\nMichele Ceriotti \nhas been appointed Tenure Track Assistant Professor of Materials Science at the School of Engineering (STI)\nMichele Ceriotti’s research focuses on the development of molecular dynamics methods and digital simulation of complex problems at the atomic level, and their application to chemistry and materials science problems. \n Recently, he developed a generalized Langevin equation that is useful for improving and manipulating the sampling properties of molecular dynamics, and an algorithm for analyzing the large amount of data resulting from the simulation of complex systems.\n These methods have been applied to problems concerned with surface sciences, water and hydrogen binding systems, the determination of free energy at interfaces, the study of complex hydrides, and to simple biochemical problems.\n At EPFL, his multidisciplinary knowledge will be appreciated at the STI School when teaching at Bachelor and Master levels in the field of materials science.\nSean Hill\n, “Blue Brain” Project Scientist at the School of Life Sciences (SV), has been authorized to bear the title of Adjunct Professor. \n Sean Hill has developed a large-scale neuroinformatics model capable of simulating the spontaneous activities of a large number of thalamocortical neurones, and to summarize the activities in the transition phase between the waking state and sleep. \n During the time he spent as a researcher at IBM in relation to the Blue Brain Project, he has demonstrated his considerable abilities in defining a strategy for organizing and analyzing primary data, and in setting up “in silico” experimentation. He has coordinated important work in these fields and supervised PhD theses at the Blue Brain Project.\n Clément Hongler\n has been appointed as Tenure Track Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the School of Basic Sciences (SB)\n Clément Hongler works in a field combining complex analysis, probability theory, discrete mathematics and statistical mechanics. More specifically, he is one of the world’s foremost specialists of the (rigorous) mathematical study of the Ising model, a static physics model. This is an extremely important research field, in which two mathematicians – Werner in 2006 and Smirnov in 2010 – were recently awarded the Fields medal, the most prestigious reward for the recognition of work in mathematical research. Further to the work of his mentor, Stanislas Smirnov, Clément Hongler has been able to rigorously demonstrate the existence of several phenomena linked to the concept of “conformal invariance” which had been “predicted” by the physicists working on the conformal field theory.\nHoai-Minh Nguyen \nhas been appointed as Tenure Track Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the School of Basic Sciences (SB)\nHoai-Minh Nguyen is an expert in real analysis. In particular, he has had major breakthroughs in the study of Sobolev inequalities as well as in the study of the Jacobian determinant, solving problems which until then had puzzled the most renowned experts, in particular his thesis director, Haim Brezis, and Fields medal holder Jean Bourgain. \n These difficult questions belong to the realm of pure analysis, but Hoai-Minh Nguyen has also made important contributions in applied analysis, especially in the rigorous mathematical study of several physics-related phenomena: for example, the study of materials with negative refraction indices and the study of the optical phenomenon called “cloaking” (which aims to make objects invisible). He has also obtained significant results in the fields of calculation of variations and differential equations and their applications.\nDominique Perrault \nhas been appointed as Full Professor of Architecture at 50% (Theory and critical approach to projects) at the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC)\nDominique Perrault won international recognition in 1989 after winning, aged 36, the competition to design the National Library of France. This immense project was the starting point for many large commissions such as the velodrome and Olympic swimming pool in Berlin (1992), the extension of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg (1996), the Olympic tennis center and the redesigning of the Manzanares park in Madrid (2002), the campus of Ewha Women’s University in Seoul (2004) and the Fukoku tower in Osaka, Japan (2007).\n The specific theme he will be teaching will be underground architecture as a tool of transformation and densification of existing towns. This issue, which will benefit from competencies available within ENAC, will be explored in close collaboration with the Institutes of Civil Engineering and that of Environmental Engineering within the same school.\nFelix Schürmann\n, “Blue Brain” Project Manager at the School of Life Sciences (SV), has been authorized to bear the title of Adjunct Professor\nGerman-born Felix Schürmann studied physics at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (“Vordiplom”) and at the State University of New York at Buffalo (“M.S.”) between 1997 and 2000.

{"id": 1229, "text": "The Bridge City project archives – comprising five models, twelve rolls of plans and dozens of drawings, photographs and files – have just been transferred from New York to their new home at EPFL’s Modern Architecture Archives (ACM). New York-based architect Bernard Tschumi donated the archives to ACM, where they will join those of his father Jean Tschumi, founder of the Lausanne School of Architecture and the architect behind Swiss insurer Vaudoise’s headquarters in Lausanne, the World Health Organization’s buildings in Geneva and Nestlé’s headquarters in Vevey.\nThe Bridge City designs were commissioned by the City of Lausanne in 1988 and were developed jointly by Bernard Tschumi and fellow architect Luca Merlini. Their concept won the City’s request for proposals to redevelop the Flon district, which was then an abandoned industrial zone. Their idea was to build four inhabited bridges between Chauderon Bridge and where Place de l’Europe is currently, in order to link the two sides of the Flon river valley. They also planned to demolish all but four of the industrial warehouses and create a park at the southern end of the site, on the slopes of Montbenon.\nThe bridges would hold residences, shops, a theater, a museum and an auditorium for the University of Lausanne and the Lausanne University of Art and Design (ECAL). Diagonal stairways and ramps would provide passageways between the upper and lower areas.\nBut none of that happened. The designs spent eight years collecting dust in the city hall, as urban planners faced opposition from the property’s owners – LO Holding – as well as a coalition of the right, green and workers’ parties. The Bridge City project was eventually abandoned. Instead, Tschumi and Merlini, along with architect Emmanuel Ventura, built only the Flon interface, which included a pedestrian bridge, Place de l’Europe, the Flon metro station and the LEB station, and was opened in 2001. LO Holding developed the rest of the Flon district on its own.\nTschumi, a dual French-Swiss citizen, is today a prominent figure in the global architecture community. He spoke to a packed room at EPFL on 11 October as part of Archizoom’s \nIsle of Models\n exhibition. We sat down with him for a look back – and ahead – at his field.\nThirty years on, what lessons can EPFL students and researchers learn from the Bridge City archives?\nThere were two aspects to our Bridge City project. The first was architectural and urbanistic in the conceptual sense – we aimed to understand how a site’s characteristics can lead to an abstract idea. And how we can then transform this idea so it becomes an integral part of the site itself. The Flon valley’s topography suggested an approach that was at once architectural and urbanistic. We no longer saw any distinction between the two; the concept and the context blended together. The second aspect concerned versatility. We wanted to transform bridges into places where people can also live, study and shop. We weren’t the first ones to come up with the idea of turning infrastructure into architecture – just look at Ponte Vecchio in Florence. This approach could interest researchers today, especially since – as far as architecture is concerned – culture and usage haven’t changed much from one century to the next. Architects in the 15\nth\n and 21\nst\n centuries face largely the same challenges because we still work in three dimensions, we work with mostly similar materials and we work on the scale of the human being.\nWhat do you think of the Flon district as it stands today?\nI’ve always felt that our Bridge City project was a missed opportunity. The way the Flon river valley has been developed doesn’t take advantage of Lausanne’s topography. The district currently has a lower part, in the bottom of the valley, and an upper part. But the diagonal – passing from the lower to the upper part – is completely ignored. However, Lausanne is one of the world’s few 3D cities – like \nMetropolis\n in the film by Fritz Lang. If you look at drawings by Futurist Italian architect Antonio Sant'Elia [b. 1888, d. 1916], where he imagined a vast network of bridges – that’s Lausanne. I know of no other city with such a high density of bridges. Bridges in Lausanne have an urbanistic function; they are not solely infrastructure. The inhabited bridges in our Bridge City project would have been arteries connecting the upper and lower areas.\nCouldn’t high-rise buildings serve this purpose in Lausanne?\nHigh-rise buildings are a cliché, a lazy concept. And there’s no logic behind simply throwing up high-rises arbitrarily. Manhattan has a lot of high-rises because its surface area is small and narrow, because the ground conditions make it possible and because someone was clever enough to invent elevators. But if an architect told me he was going to build a high-rise in Chavannes, I would ask him “Why? What’s the underlying concept?” The smartest high-rise in Lausanne is still the Bel-Air building because it connects the bottom of the Flon valley with the street level above and is cleverly placed at the end of Grand Pont. A 20-story building rising from the river-valley floor up to and above Pont Bessières would also be a good idea.\nYou were Dean of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture from 1988 to 2003 and ran your own architecture firm. In both of these roles you showed an interest in digital technology. How do you believe the digital transformation has affected the teaching of architecture and the architecture profession? \nWhen I started as Dean in 1988, I never set out to make Columbia a research center for architecture software. But three or four years later I saw that architects were not using the new modeling programs that were out there – programs to create special effects, like those developed for \nJurassic Park\n (1993), and programs used in biology and fluid mechanics. This also has to do with the idea of versatility. So we started looking at how the new software could be used in more versatile ways and applied to architecture. Here we began blurring the lines between different disciplines. AutoCAD had been around since 1985 but wasn’t very exciting. With the newer software being released at the time we entered into an experimental period. We saw that we could invent new types of spaces and tried to apply them to actual projects. It was an exciting time. But software developers soon began adapting their programs to market demand, making them more “civilized.” Now you can easily build a house or a set of shelves or design a landscape, for example.\nWhy is this a loss? \nBecause instead of sparking new ideas, the software mimics reality as it already exists. It creates a kind of hyperrealism that is completely at odds with the experimental mindset I mentioned earlier. And that leads to another problem: today the people commissioning architecture projects want to see images of what the structures will look like, and rather than evaluating designs with their heads, they just take them at face value. They’re interested only in “what it’ll look like.” That means architects have to cater to developers who don’t know how to read a blueprint or a cross-section, or how to comprehend anything abstract. In my view that has done great prejudice to the architecture profession. We can group all these hyperrealistic images into a kind of dictionary of clichés; it’s all become very pedestrian. The tools we use have a big influence on how we think. Mediocre tools lead to mediocre thinking. Today’s architects need to rise above that. Some of the designs for our Bridge City project took abstraction to the extreme. Today our proposal wouldn’t even make it to the shortlist.\nHow do you fight against this standardization of the profession in your teaching at Columbia?\nMy colleagues and I try to bring back the system of representation, such as by deforming computer images or not using them at all. We try to force software to do things it wasn’t designed to do, in an effort to move the concept forward in a way that goes beyond hyperrealism.\nKey dates\n25 January 1944: Born in Lausanne to a Swiss father, Jean Tschumi, and a French mother\n1969: Studied in Paris, London and Zurich; obtained an architecture degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich\n1969–1980: Taught at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London\n1975: Moved to New York\n1981 and 1994: Published \nThe Manhattan Transcripts \n(Academy Editions and St. Martin’s Press\n1983: Won the contract to design La Villette park in Paris and opened an architecture firm in France\n1988: Founded Bernard Tschumi Architects (BTA) in New York; won the contract to redevelop the Flon district in Lausanne with his Bridge City concept\n1988–2003: Served as Dean of the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University, New York\n1994–2010: Published \nEvent-Cities Series\n (MIT Press)\n1994: MoMA exhibition \nBernard Tschumi: Architecture and Event\n, New York\n1997: Fresnoy National Studio for the Contemporary Arts, Tourcoing, France\n1999: Lerner Hall Student Center, Columbia University, New York\n1999: Ecole d’architecture de Paris, Marne-la-Vallée\n2001: Flon interface, Lausanne\n2001: Zénith concert hall in Rouen, France\n2003: Florida International University’s School of Architecture, Miami\n2002: Founded Bernard Tschumi urbanistes Architectes (BTuA) in Paris\n2004: Vacheron Constantin Headquarters and Manufacturing Center, Geneva\n2007: Richard E.

{"id": 1236, "text": "Numerous researchers are looking at the impact of climate change on the Alps. And one of the most obvious effects is the low snowfall observed in recent years. EPFL researchers have discovered that this lack of snow also has an impact on mountain streams. We have known for some ten years now that these streams, together with the Alps’ lakes and rivers, release a large amount of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) into the atmosphere as a naturally occurring phenomenon. But the study shows that a warm winter with little snowfall can change all this. The lack of snow means that once spring comes, the streams release more CO\n2\n than they absorb. “This is the first study that shows the impact of climate change on the global carbon cycle in alpine streams,” explains Tom Battin, director of the Stream Biofilm and Ecosystem Research Laboratory (SBER) and co-author of the study, which has just been published in the journal \nEcosystems\n.\nComparing two winters\n This phenomenon was reported after researchers compared data from two consecutive winters – the winter of 2012-2013, which was considered normal, and that of 2013-2014, which was exceptionally warm. “After a normal winter, our study showed that during a 70-day ‘magic window,’ the streams absorb more carbon dioxide through photosynthesis than they produce naturally,” explains Amber Ulseth, a researcher at SBER and lead author of the study. “After a warm winter with very little snowfall, more production of CO\n2\n takes places during the spring, which means that the streams release more carbon dioxide than they absorb. There is no magic window, and the alpine streams become a net producer of CO\n2\n.”\nAt this stage, it is still hard for the researchers to measure the exact quantity of CO\n2\n released into the atmosphere. They can, however, determine some of the potential consequences. The rivers fed by these small alpine streams will, for example, receive less organic carbon with less snowmelt to drive their metabolism. Less snowmelt could have a worrying impact on the entire ecosystem, as it may end up altering the water flow. The study’s authors also think it would be worth studying the impact that this is likely to have on the hydroelectric network that relies on these rivers – particularly the dams – and the potential consequences to the carbon cycle within these alpine streams.\nHigh-tech sensors\n To better understand how these mountain streams behave, the latest generation of environmental sensors were deployed for 18 months in 12 streams that run into the River Ybbs in the Austrian foothills. The sensors were placed between 700 and 1,500 meters above sea level and measured the region’s water ecosystem – a first in this kind of study. Every five minutes they measured three parameters: light intensity, streamwater temperature and oxygen levels. With this data, it was possible to observe the photosynthesis process and the ecosystem’s “carbon respiration,” which in turn provided information on the carbon flux. “This research couldn’t have been conducted ten years ago because the sensors we used didn’t exist,” says Ulseth. “By collecting data every five minutes, we could really take each stream’s pulse and measure the metabolism of the entire ecosystem.”\nNew Valais study and big data\nBattin’s teams are now going further in their research. For the past year, they have been working on 12 streams located in Valsorey, Champéry and the Val Ferret in Valais Canton, and in the Vallon de Nant in Vaud Canton. The researchers have been taking more in-depth measurements across this region, which is higher and larger than the region in the Austrian foothills used for the previous study. And instead of three parameters, ten parameters are being measured every ten minutes using new sensors. This phase of the research project is being supported by EPFL Valais-Wallis, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the European “C-Cascades” project, which is aimed at better understanding the role of the carbon cycle in regulating the climate.\nFor around three years, the researchers will collect millions of data – a method that has become essential in environmental science. To process the data, Battin’s team is working closely with the new Swiss Data Science Center, a joint venture between EPFL and ETH Zurich with offices in both Lausanne and Zurich.\nReference", "summary": "An EPFL study has for the first time measured the impact of climate change on alpine streams, and the results are quite worrying: after a low-snow winter, these streams release more carbon dioxide than they absorb.", "claim": "An EPFL study has for the first time measured the impact of climate change on alpine streams, and the results are quite worrying: after a low-snow winter, these streams release more carbon dioxide than he absorb.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [39, 39], "noise": false}
{"id": 1239, "text": "Even on the scale of everyday life, nature is governed by the laws of quantum physics. These laws explain common phenomena like light, sound, heat, or even the trajectories of balls on a pool table. But when applied to a large number of interacting particles, the laws of quantum physics actually predict a variety of phenomena that defy intuition.\nIn order to study quantum systems made of many particles, physicists must first be able to simulate them. This can be done by solving the equations describing their inner workings on supercomputers. But while Moore’s Law predicts that the processing power of computers doubles every couple of years, this is a far cry from the power needed to tackle the challenges of quantum physics.\nThe reason is that predicting the properties of a quantum system is enormously complex, demanding a computational power that grows exponentially with the size of the quantum system – an “intrinsically complex” task, according to Professor Vincenzo Savona, who directs the  at EPFL.\n“Things become even more complicated when the quantum system is open, meaning that it is subject to the disturbances of its surrounding environment,” Savona adds. And yet, tools to efficiently simulate open quantum systems are much needed, as most modern experimental platforms for quantum science and technology are open systems, and physicists are constantly in search of new ways to simulate and benchmark them.\nBut significant progress has been made thanks to a new computational method that simulates quantum systems with neural networks. The method was developed by Savona and his PhD student Alexandra Nagy at EPFL – and independently by scientists at Université Paris Diderot, the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, and the Flatiron Institute in New York. The total body of work is being published across three papers in \nPhysical Review Letters\n.\n“We basically combined advances in neural networks and machine-learning with quantum Monte Carlo tools,” says Savona, referring to a large toolkit of computational methods that physicists use to study complex quantum systems. The scientists trained a neural network to represent simultaneously the many quantum states in which a quantum system can be cast by the influence of its environment.\nThe neural-network approach allowed the physicists to predict the properties of quantum systems of considerable size and arbitrary geometry. “This is a novel computational approach that addresses the problem of open quantum systems with versatility and a lot of potential for scaling up,” says Savona. The method is set to become a tool of choice for the study of complex quantum systems, and, looking a bit more into the future, for assessing the effects of noise on quantum hardware.\nLinks to related papers on arXiv\n Vicentini et al \n Hartmann and Carleo", "summary": "A new computational method, based on neural networks, can simulate open quantum systems with unprecedented versatility.

{"id": 1240, "text": "The increase in road traffic is only one problem factor in terms of making the roads safe in winter. “The maintenance services often end up stuck in traffic, and completely incapable of fulfilling their mission”, explains Professor André-Gilles Dumont of the EPFL . To address these kinds of problems, some sections of freeway – for example the Lausanne bypass – have been equipped with valve systems: “They work like automatic lawn sprinklers, and enable us to deliver a preventive salting, which is also ecological, since this method only uses 2 grams of salt per square meter, instead of 15.” Professor Dumont’s laboratory has been working on the method of application of this concept for more than ten years. Today, the use of salt remains the preferred method: studies performed in Berne have shown that the use of gravel or sand is not a solution. Their production, retrieval from the drains, and their decontamination, results in a considerable ecological impact, and although sugar is less abrasive, its current price is too high.\n However, solutions will have to be found. Minus 10° Celsius on Tuesday; 8° on Thursday – these sudden changes in temperature around zero degrees are particularly interesting for the laboratory: “When the climate approaches an exotic kind of model, with sudden temperature changes and such rapid differences, road surfaces can be badly affected, with ruts appearing, and the alternate freezing and thawing can alter the characteristics of the surface.” A thesis project has therefore been launched, financed by the Federal Roads Office, in order to understand the effects of these cycles, using a model that simulates the temperatures both on the surface and underneath. “We can observe speeds of variation of surface temperature of the order of 5 degrees per hour”, adds Professor Dumont.\n And what if the problem of black ice could be resolved by a heated road surface? Professor Lyesse Laloui, responsible for the EPFL studying the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of soils, is exploring this question. The laboratory has been working for around 10 years on a new, renewable energy source – energy-generating geo-structures. It consists of using the foundations of a concrete building to collect and store heat : “After having worked on exchanging energy in buildings, we recently began to look at the problem of black ice on bridges. The idea is to capture the heat on the bridge-deck in summer, and then to use abutments to retrieve it and store it in the earth.” By installing a circuit of tubing under the blacktop surface, like underfloor heating, and then circulating water mixed with a heat-retaining fluid thru it, a temperature is obtained that prevents the formation of a fine layer of black ice.\n Professor Laloui’s ideas on the subject go even further: to use the heat of the tunnels, where there is a constant temperature of about 25° Celsius! “This energy is there, and readily available. Our idea is to use the anchoring bars of the tunnel as heat-exchangers. For us, it involves a genuine transfer of knowledge; the solutions used for the buildings now enable us to perform digital simulations and determine their feasibility.”\n Auto-cleaning road surfaces, heated bridges, energy-producing tunnels – it’s also on our roads that we will find solutions to future climatic challenges.

{"id": 1244, "text": "Peptides are biological molecules, made up of short sequences of amino acids. Because they are easy to synthesize, show low toxicity and high efficiency, peptides such as insulin and other hormones can be used as drugs. But peptides are quickly cleared by the kidneys, which means that we can only use peptide drugs that act within minutes. This problem can be overcome by connecting peptides to ligands that bind blood-serum proteins such as albumin, allowing the peptide to linger in the bloodstream longer. EPFL scientists have now developed such a ligand, which is easy to synthesize and has a high afﬁnity for human albumin. Published in \nNature Communications\n, the new ligand could potentially extend the half-life of peptides from minutes to several days. \nPeptides combine a number of attractive features for drugs: low toxicity and immune reactions, high affinity and efficacy for their targets, and accessible chemical synthesis. The only problem is “renal clearance”: peptides are generally cleared by the kidneys within a few minutes of entering the patient’s blood. For example, one of the most common peptides, insulin, has a bloodstream half-life of only 4-6 minutes. Another hormone, oxytocin — given intravenously to induce or accelerate labor — has a half-life of 10-15 minutes.\nSuch short timeframes imposed by renal clearance severely limit the therapeutic potential of these potentially ideal drugs. One promising way to increase the half-life of peptides is to “piggy-back” them onto blood-serum proteins, such as albumin, which is the most abundant protein in the blood serum and has a half-life of nineteen days. This however, requires an intermediate ligand molecule that can be attached to the peptide during synthesis, and also have a high affinity and selectivity for human albumin.\nThe lab of  has now developed such a ligand, which has a high affinity for human albumin and — more importantly — is easy to synthesize and attach to a peptide. The ligand is made by fusing a fatty acid with another peptide. The resulting molecule is referred to as a “chimera” and combines the best of two worlds from the field of albumin ligands. \nPrevious efforts built ligands based on either fatty acids or peptides, and have tried them on insulin. But whereas fatty acids somewhat extended the half-life of insulin, they generally didn’t bind albumin very strongly. On the other hand, peptide-based ligands bind albumin well, but showed low solubility, meaning it didn’t distribute insulin in the blood very well.\nThe new ligand literarily brings together the advantages of both fatty acids and peptides. The researchers searched for an amino acid sequence that would complement the fatty acid’s weak binding of albumin. Using an elegant “iterative” synthesis and screening method they discovered a peptide sequence that increases the binding of the fatty acid twenty-seven times. The final chimera ligand binds human albumin with high affinity (Kd = 39 nM), is highly soluble, and can be appended to peptide drugs using standard synthesizing techniques.\nThe researchers demonstrated \nin vivo \nthat the ligand prolongs the half-life of several bioactive peptides more than 25-fold. They then appended the ligand to an actual peptide developed to treat pathogenic thrombosis, which has a notoriously impractical short half-life. The ligand was shown to extend the effectiveness of the peptide by several hours, inhibiting the disease in rabbits.\n“We expect that the tag presented in our work will interest a larger research and business audience because it is applicable to virtually any peptide moiety, including small proteins,” says Heinis. “The ligand can be appended to any peptide during solid-phase peptide synthesis on standard synthesizers, making it easily accessible for academic and industry labs.”\nThe innovative technology can potentially also be applied to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of bicyclic peptides developed by , a startup co-founded by Christian Heinis and  in 2009, and of which EPFL is a shareholder. On June 1 this year, Bicycle Therapeutics r.

{"id": 1247, "text": "Nothing in biology is static; everything is fluid, dynamic and ever-moving. Often, this movement occurs in repeating patterns — regular, measurable cycles that tick just like \"clocks\".\nTwo of the most important such cycles are the circadian clock, which regulates our sleep/awake rhythm, and the cell cycle, which regulates the growth, life and death of virtually every cell in our body. Considering things like sleep abnormalities, cancer, ageing and other related problems, it's not hard to see why both of these cycles have gained enormous interest from researchers.\nOne of the big questions in the field has been that of synchronization, a phenomenon first observed by Dutch physicist — and clock-maker — Christian Huygens. In synchronization, the rhythms (phases) of two oscillators match up in lockstep.\nNaturally, the circadian clock takes up a daily rhythm, but it turns out that also the cell cycle in many systems involves a similar time scale. In addition, there is some evidence that suggests that both clocks might actually influence each other.\nNow, scientists from the  have found that the circadian and cell-cycle clocks are actually synchronized. The breakthrough study is , and is also featured on the journal's .\nTo carry out the study, the scientists developed a ‘small data’ methodology to build and identify a mathematical model of the coupled clocks from time-lapse movies of thousands of single cells from mice and humans.\nThe model allowed them to predict and measure phase shifts when the two clocks were synchronized in a 1:1 and 1:2 pattern, and then look at how system noise influences this synchronization. Finally, the researchers investigated as well how it might be modeled in a randomized way (\"stochastically\"), which would better capture what happens in real cells.\nThe synchronization was also found to be remarkably robust against temperature changes, which is known to affect the cell-cycle clock, changing the rhythm of cell divisions. The team found that this circadian-cell cycle synchronization is common across different species including human, suggesting a fundamental biological mechanism behind it.\n“This interaction might play a physiological role,” says Felix Naef. “It can explain why different body tissues have their clocks set at slightly different times, a bit like world time zone wall clocks in an airport.”\nThe implications of the study are significant, which Nature’s News & Views describes as \"a new chapter in the story of how non-linear coupling mechanisms can be of fundamental importance to our understanding of living systems.\"", "summary": "Scientists from EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering have discovered that our circadian clock and our cell-cycle are in fact, synchronized.", "claim": "Scientists from EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering have discovered that our circadian clock and its cell-cycle are in fact, synchronized.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [14, 14], "noise": false}
{"id": 1248, "text": "In response to a request from the French-speaking Switzerland chapter of the Swiss Architects’ Federation (FAS), EPFL agreed to study how to better protect architectural heritage even outside of Switzerland. The School launched a project where around 150 first-year architecture students took a fresh look at the Lake Geneva region as a whole from both an environmental and heritage standpoint, with a particular focus on two sites: Patrick Bouchain’s La Grange au Lac, dedicated to the cellist Rostropovitch, and La Buvette d’Evian, which was built in 1957 by French architect Maurice Novarina, structural engineer Serge Ketoff and builder Jean Prouvé.\nBringing La Buvette back to life\n Under the project, the students first spent the winter semester learning about the role architects can play in helping to preserve a local ecosystem. Then in the spring semester, they built the wooden structures that will be assembled near the two heritage sites in Evian. The students’ architectural designs include stages, a projection screen, a garden, a lookout area, a greenhouse, water swings and a bird wall. The project is being spearheaded by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE) with the goal of reviving the La Buvette refreshment area, which, despite being listed as a French historical monument, has been lying abandoned for nearly 30 years. \n After successfully testing their designs in Switzerland, the students will cross Lake Geneva on 27 May to build the structures on site. The structures will be inaugurated at a ceremony on 28 May attended by representatives of the City of Evian, FAS and Evian Resort. In addition, concerts by Zéphyr and Tuorka – two quartets from the Lausanne Conservatory, a play entitled “Paysages Impossibles” by Sébastien Grosset and a sound performance by Louis Jucker on the subject of landscapes will be held on 28 and 29 May.\nPart of a broader initiative \n The French-speaking Switzerland chapter of FAS has been studying options for renovating La Buvette d’Evian since 2014. “Through this renovation project, which EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM) had already worked on, students from ALICE are contributing to a broader initiative to redevelop the whole site. The initiative includes Lausanne’s and the Lake Geneva region’s bid to host the International Union of Architects’ 2023 World Congress, as well as the 2020-2023 Leman Architecture Connection (LAC) – a Franco-Swiss program carried out in association with the Haute Savoie office of architecture, urban planning and the environment. Each of these projects has its own strengths and aims to turn La Buvette and the surrounding area into a high-caliber cultural center that forms an integral part of the Lake Geneva landscape,” say Jeanne della Casa and Sarah Nedir, the two presidents of the French-speaking Switzerland chapter of FAS. \nUntapped cross-border potential \n According to Dieter Dietz, an architecture professor at EPFL and the director of ALICE, the renovation of La Buvette, an icon of modern architecture, could also help forge closer ties between Switzerland and France. “I don’t see the “La Buvette” project as specific to Evian, but rather as part of an infrastructure that encompasses the whole Lake Geneva region. La Buvette could help strengthen ties that, while they do already exist, are not very visible. Things may have changed since the 1970s, when each side of the lake clearly represented two separate countries, but this relationship could still be taken much further. Through our various partnerships on this project, we are trying to build a coherent cultural and territorial narrative,” says Dietz.\n The City of Evian is proud to be a part of the project. “By hosting students from EPFL and showcasing their work, we hope to illustrate how the two sides of the lake are in fact connected. For us, it is important to protect our unique cultural and architectural heritage and enable people to enjoy it – which is the essence of the La Buvette project,” says Evian Mayor Josiane Lei.\nThe evolving nature of architecture \n The work of EPFL’s students in Evian is part of a new ALICE project called Becoming – a three-part exploration patterned on the HOUSE 1, HOUSE 2 and HOUSE 3 series of wooden homes constructed in turn in Lausanne, Zurich and Brussels. With Becoming, Dietz advocates a concept of architecture in constant flux and that upholds the new value system our society must adopt if we are to save our planet. “Our goal now is to learn how we can situate ideas and spatial constructions, in relation not just to our society but to life in general and our natural resources, and how we can anchor architecture so that it can both be and ‘become’ – hence the name for this new three-part series,” he says. \n (pictures and program)\nFrom June 29 to July 6, the Rencontres musicales d'Evian will take place in the structures built by EPFL.

The program, which was officially launched today in Zagreb, was developed by EPFL, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education, the Croatian Science Foundation (CSF) and various academic institutions in Croatia. This ambitious program, which has a budget of 4.7 million francs, aims to drive innovation in Croatia and limit brain drain.\nFollowing a selection process that began in March, four young and highly promising Croatian researchers will be awarded tenure-track professor status. They will each receive a budget of one million francs to set up a laboratory, hire a team and put a research program in place – all within four to five years.\n“Not only do we want to encourage the talented pool of Croatian scientists living abroad to return home, but we also want to give young researchers a real chance, responsibilities and future prospects in their own country so they will no longer need to go abroad in order to have a successful career,” says Olivier Küttel, head of International Affairs at EPFL. To achieve this, the program will offer a package that includes a team, equipment, lab space, administrative support and, most importantly, a free hand in managing these resources. If, after four years, the pilot program is a success and the researchers live up to expectations, they will be given tenure.\nTome Antičić, State Secretary for Science and EU funds at the Ministry of Science and Education, describes the importance of this project for his country: “Croatia is home to very talented scientists, and we must offer the best of them career prospects so that we can retain them. The tenure-track program proposed by EPFL, funded by Switzerland and implemented by the Croatian Science Foundation is a very promising model, and we as a Ministry will closely monitor its success. In fact, the Ministry is in the process of establishing a new research system based much more on international excellence, and this model could form the basis for a much larger initiative in the near future.”\nSuccessfully tested\nThe idea dates back four years, right after Croatia joined the European Union. The project, which was even more ambitious at the time, was submitted to the European Commission for funding through the Horizon 2020 program. Then, on 9 February 2014, the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative passed in Switzerland, and the project had to be re-thought and scaled back. In the end, the project will be funded through the one billion francs that Switzerland has contributed to the EU for Eastern European countries. The Croatian government will cover 15% of the project's cost in addition to providing appropriate research facilities.\nThis pilot program presented EPFL’s Senior Management with an opportunity to promote its widely hailed tenure-track system. EPFL is one of the only universities in Europe to use this system, which it put in place in 2000. A total of 171 people have benefited from this status at EPFL, and many of them have won ERC Starting Grants, which are the most prestigious awards bestowed on young researchers by the European Council.\nEPFL experts have played an active role in designing Croatia’s pilot project from the outset. They are also closely involved in evaluating the applicants. The winners will be announced this fall.\n“This initiative is meant to attract and retain the best scientific minds. We also hope that it will have a multiplier effect over the longer term,” says Küttel. “These talented young scientists will certainly attract others like them, create jobs and startups, and ultimately give Croatia’s economy a real boost. And since it’s a pilot project, it could be quickly rolled out in other European countries.”", "summary": "Under a pilot project that draws on EPFL’s expertise, four highly promising young Croatian researchers will be awarded tenure-track professor status and receive a million francs to set up a research program in their country.

{"id": 1257, "text": "Materials all come with their own set of properties – they can be insulating, semi-conducting, metallic, transparent or flexible, for example. Some combine several very useful properties, which is the case for 2D materials. Made up of just one or few layers of atoms, these materials are highly promising for the manufacture of next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.\n“In our field, silicon is still king. But it’s reaching its limits for some electronic devices, like those that need to be flexible or transparent. 2D materials could be a viable alternative,” says Jürgen Brugger, the professor who heads the  at EPFL’s School of Engineering.\nCustomizing properties for specific applications\nBefore 2D materials can be used, they need to be structured, which means cutting them into the right size and shape for the given application. Their physical properties (such as the bandgap) also need to be adjusted, both throughout the material and at specific locations. Scientists at the Microsystems Laboratory 1, working in association with ETH Zurich and IBM, have developed a new method for altering the properties of these materials.\nDeforming materials with a nanometric tip \nThe research team used thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL), which entails placing a heated nanometric tip on the material and exerting pressure to create the desired shape – in this case, wavy – while carefully controlling the force and temperature. “Several methods already exist for deforming 2D materials globally and locally. But our thermo-mechanic approach can create larger deformations and therefore produce wider variations in a material’s physical properties,” says Ana Conde-Rubio, a scientist at the EPFL lab. More specifically, the new method can change the energy gap between the valence band and conduction band, consequently altering the material’s electronic and optical properties. And this change in bandgap can be performed locally with a spatial resolution down to 20 nanometers.\nA single tool for cutting and modifying 2D materials\nThe scientists had already developed a method for cutting 2D materials with high precision. Now their aim is to combine that method with this new way of changing the material’s properties. “Using the same tool, the t-SPL, we will be able to manufacture devices with the desired shape, dimensions and physical properties, with a resolution down to the 10 nanometers scale” says Xia Liu, another scientist at Brugger’s lab. The team’s findings have been published in \n.\nTheir work forms part of a larger research project to develop new processes for manufacturing and modifying polymer materials for wearables and implantables.

The team have demonstrated success treating a range of viruses in the lab – including respiratory infections to genital herpes. Although at an early stage of development, the broad-spectrum activity of this compound could also be effective against new emerging viruses such as the recent coronavirus currently of concern in China.\nSo called ‘virucidal’ substances, such as bleach, are typically capable of destroying viruses on contact but are extremely toxic to humans and so cannot be taken or applied to the human body without causing severe harm. Developing virucides from sugar has allowed for the development of a new type of antiviral drug, which destroys viruses yet is non-toxic to humans.\nCurrent antiviral drugs work by inhibiting virus growth, but they are not always reliable as viruses can mutate and become resistant to these treatments.\nUsing modified sugar molecules the team showed that the outer shell of a virus can be disrupted, thereby destroying the infectious particles on contact, as oppose to simply restricting its growth. This new approach has also been shown to defend against drug resistance.\nThe research published in the journal \nScience Advances \nshows that the team successfully engineered new modified molecules using natural glucose derivatives, known as cyclodextrins.

Tri- for three legs and -bot for robot, this super-light critter fits in the palm of your hand, is cheap to build, runs on less than one watt of power, and may one day be deployed in mass for search and rescue missions.\n“Hundreds of Tribots could be dropped from the sky into remote areas, and reach places using their three types of locomotion that more expensive and larger robots cannot,” explains EPFL scientist Jamie Paik, head of the Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory. “It only weighs a few grams, so it’s the perfect robot when weight is a constraint.”\nLike a Swiss Army knife, tribots are multi-functional : they crawl, roll, and hop to get around obstacles ­– with a prototype jumping repeatedly as high as 25 centimeters, seven times their size.

After an injury, these amphibians are able to “magically” regrow their spinal cords and regain locomotion.\nA team of scientists led by Ijspeert along with András Simon, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, and Dimitri Ryczko, an assistant professor at the Université de Sherbrooke’s laboratory of motor control in Canada, is looking into exactly how the process works through a project that has just received a .\nDeciphering neural mechanisms\nThe scientists plan to combine methods from genomics, neuroscience, computer modeling and biorobotics to decipher the neural mechanisms underpinning spinal-cord regeneration. “A salamander’s nervous system has all the same functional elements as that of a mammal, but in a relatively simplified structure,” says Ryczko. “That makes salamanders the ideal animals for studying motor control networks in vertebrates.”\nTheir research also aims to better understand how the central and peripheral nervous systems interact during locomotion. “The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system, serving as the control room for locomotion,” says Ijspeert. Scientists had already observed how neural networks in an isolated spinal cord oscillate on their own and provide the right commands for movement. “That’s surprising because it means the spinal cord automatically knows what signals it should send to muscles to regulate their movement, without needing input from the rest of the body.” But the spinal cord is not alone in the control room. The peripheral nervous system is also there, transmitting sensory information about the body’s surroundings to the central nervous system and participating to movement control. The research team believes that this redundancy, along with the physical interaction between a salamander’s body and its surroundings, plays an important role in the process of functional recovery.\nAuke Ijspeert, head of EPFL's BioRobotics Laboratory © 2020 Alain Herzog/EPFL\nThe benefits of cross-disciplinary research\nTo test their hypothesis, the scientists will combine their know-how in their respective fields. Ryczko will draw on his knowledge of the biological mechanisms of motor control to study how neural networks are structured. He will use optogenetics – a method that involves making neurons more sensitive to light and then stimulating specific types of neural cells – to measure neuron activity before and after a spinal cord injury. Simon, an expert in neural regeneration, has characterized the salamander genome; he will supply the optogenetic tools needed for Ryczko’s work and examine the molecular proprieties of regenerated neural networks.\nFinally, Ijspeert and his team will develop computer models of the neural networks and provide biorobotics expertise so that the models can be tested not just through simulations, but also on an enhanced version of the Pleurobot robot salamander. “We will create a sort of tactile skin for the robot,” says Ijspeert. “Since it’s difficult to model the interactions of a salamander’s body with its surroundings – sand, water, mud, etc. – we will replicate them with the robot. That will show us how the animal’s surroundings affect its locomotion and provide valuable insight into the body’s interactions with the nervous system.”\nBridging a gap\nSimon adds: “Salamanders are the only vertebrates that have both the locomotor circuit of a tetrapod and the ability to regenerate neurons. The evolutionary position of salamanders gives us a unique opportunity to bridge discoveries made in regenerative but legless vertebrates, such as fish, and non-regenerative, terrestrial mammals.”\nAlthough this project focuses mainly on fundamental research, Ijspeert still sees potential applications in his field. “We hope that one day the concepts of robust mechanisms and regeneration can be transferred to robotics, so that engineers can build fault-tolerant machines that keep on working despite damages to their electronic and mechanical hardware,” he says.\nRead also: \n Sylvie Roke, another researcher at EPFL's , was also awarded a Synergy Grant from the European Research Council for a joint project with Aurélien Roux from the University of Geneva.

They have developed a method based on fluorescence microscopy that gives them a very precise image of the composition of the membrane and the exchanges taking place there. Their results are published July 26 in an article in Plos One, an online journal specializing in science and medicine, as well as in a June 12, 2011 letter to the journal Nature Methods.\n“It is important to study the membrane because it is an exchange platform between the cell and its environment,” explains Aleksandra Radenovic, Professor in the Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology and one of the study’s authors.\nPermeable to some molecules but closed off to others, the membrane controls the movement of substances and nutrients between the interior and the exterior of the cell. The proteins in the membrane play critical roles in the cell, particularly in energy transfer, gene expression and nutrient transport.\nUsing the method they developed, the scientists can now count these proteins very accurately. In so doing, they obtain valuable information on their interactions and their evolution. It allows them to know more about how a cell reacts to the administration of a drug or exposure to an external agent (such as a pollutant), and why a given cell behaves differently from another cell. “Eventually, this technique could thus help us develop more effective drugs,” Radenovic says.\nCapturing light\t\nThis research is based on very high resolution data provided by a special fluorescence microscopy technique called Photo Activated Localization Microscopy (PALM). Developed just under five years ago, this technology has revolutionized molecular imaging. It works on the principle of capturing light that is emitted – either naturally or upon combination with a fluorescent substance (fluorochrome) - by certain bodies at the nanometer scale.\nOnce the biological sample is placed under the microscope, the scientist “illuminates” the molecules with a series of successive flashes. The assemblage of images then forms a very high resolution image, which allows the scientists to pinpoint the location of proteins at extremely small scales.\nThe Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology is continuing its investigations, in order to refine the use of this technology and the quantification of elements present in the membrane in the most reliable manner possible. In particular, they are working on a “photoactivatable” protein called mEos2.

{"id": 1269, "text": "Terahertz (THz) waves fall between microwave and infrared radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, oscillating at frequencies of between 100 billion and 30 trillion cycles per second. These waves are prized for their distinctive properties: they can penetrate paper, clothing, wood and walls, as well as detect air pollution. THz sources could revolutionize security and medical imaging systems. What’s more, their ability to carry vast quantities of data could hold the key to faster wireless communications.\n THz waves are a type of non-ionizing radiation, meaning they pose no risk to human health. The technology is already used in some airports to scan passengers and detect dangerous objects and substances.\nDespite holding great promise, THz waves are not widely used because they are costly and cumbersome to generate. But new technology developed by researchers at EPFL could change all that. The team at the \n, \nled by Prof. Elison Matioli, built a nanodevice (1 nanometer = 1 millionth of a millimeter) that can generate extremely high-power signals in just a few picoseconds, or one trillionth of a second, – which produces high-power THz waves.\nThe technology, which can be mounted on a chip or a flexible medium, could one day be installed in smartphones and other hand-held devices. The work first-authored by Mohammad Samizadeh Nikoo, a PhD student at the POWERlab, has been published in the journal \nNature. \nHow it works \nThe compact, inexpensive, fully electric nanodevice generates high-intensity waves from a tiny source in next to no time. It works by producing a powerful “spark,” with the voltage spiking from 10 V (or lower) to 100 V in the range of a picosecond. The device is capable of generating this spark almost continuously, meaning it can emit up to 50 million signals every second. When hooked up to antennas, the system can produce and radiate high-power THz waves.\nThe device consists of two metal plates situated very close together, down to 20 nanometers apart. When a voltage is applied, electrons surge towards one of the plates, where they form a nanoplasma. Once the voltage reaches a certain threshold, the electrons are emitted almost instantly to the second plate. This rapid movement enabled by such fast switches creates a high-intensity pulse that produces high-frequency waves.\nConventional electronic devices are only capable of switching at speeds of up to one volt per picosecond – too slow to produce high-power THz waves.\nThe new nanodevice, which can be more than ten times faster, can generate both high-energy and high-frequency pulses. “Normally, it’s impossible to achieve high values for both variables,” says Matioli. “High-frequency semiconductor devices are nanoscale in size. They can only cope with a few volts before breaking out. High-power devices, meanwhile, are too big and slow to generate terahertz waves. Our solution was to revisit the old field of plasma with state-of-the-art nanoscale fabrication techniques to propose a new device to get around those constraints.”\nAccording to Matioli, the new device pushes all the variables to the extreme: “High-frequency, high-power and nanoscale aren’t terms you’d normally hear in the same sentence.”\n“These nanodevices, on one side, bring an extremely high level of simplicity and low-cost, and on the other side, show an excellent performance. In addition, they can be integrated with other electronic devices such as transistor. Considering these unique properties, nanoplasma can shape a different future for the area of ultra-fast electronics”, says Samizadeh.\nThe technology could have wide-ranging applications beyond generating THz waves. “We’re pretty sure there’ll be more innovative applications to come,” adds Matioli.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a nanodevice that operates more than 10 times faster than today’s fastest transistors, and about 100 times faster than the transistors you have on your computers.

{"id": 1270, "text": "The pandemic-related uncertainty doesn’t seem to have dampened investor appetite or the determination of fresh entrepreneurs. EPFL startups had an excellent year in 2020 when it came to fundraising – they attracted a record CHF 293 million, and four of them raised over CHF 20 million each. What’s more, 21 startups completed their first fundraising round with proceeds of CHF 1–5 million. Also in 2020, 25 new EPFL spin-offs were created, which is close to the previous year’s figure. In addition, 34 business plans are in the works by EPFL researchers who have already received first funding. André Catana, the head of EPFL’s startup unit, says: “The startup world is a unique microcosm where the payoff is long term. And it held up well in 2020 despite the economic fallout from the pandemic, although we did see a decline in the CHF 5–20 million funding range.”\nThe CHF 293 million – which rises to CHF 351 million if the total includes companies that are based on campus but not direct spin-offs of the School – was collected by around 30 young businesses, including four that brought in over CHF 20 million each. These four include Kandou, a maker of high-speed data transfer systems that raised CHF 32 million on top of an already successful round in 2019, and Sophia Genetics, a fast-growing company that develops data-driven medicine technology and that signed up CHF 100 million at the end of the year – the most of any Swiss business in 2020. Other EPFL startups raised a hefty CHF 5–25 million each, such as Lightbend, Lunaphore, CREAL and Insolight. Clearspace also deserves special mention, as it won a CHF 93 million contract from the European Space Agency to conduct further development work on its space debris removal system.\nThe rest of the CHF 293 million went to the 21 firms that carried out their first fundraising round in 2020, bringing in CHF 1–5 million each. This underscores investors’ confidence in and appetite for deeptech startups, which could require many years before the technology they develop in a lab is turned into a market-launched product. “This funding comes in when the businesses have just been spun off, and provides a solid foundation for them to grow and attract more investors,” says Catana.\nA total of 410 startups have come out of EPFL labs and accelerators in the past 50-odd years. Many of them received assistance from the various programs run by the School’s startup unit within the Vice Presidency for Innovation. This assistance includes not just financing to help the engineers reduce risk, accelerate their path to market and build teams but also advice, training, networking opportunities and forums for sharing their experience. The goal is to quickly teach them the ins-and-outs of starting a business and give them a boost in getting their ideas off the ground. 25 new EPFL spin-offs were created in 2020, down slightly from the previous year (27) but not far from the record set in 2018 (29). In addition, with 34 new business ideas being incubated at EPFL, the startup future looks bright.\nA higher number of female entrepreneurs\nA record number of EPFL women started their own businesses in 2020, continuing the positive trend of the past three years. Over a third of EPFL startups created in 2020 had at least one female founder. This trend is also reflected in the many startup awards that women have won recently. For example, Depoly and Oxyle (from ETH Zurich) won the >>venture>> startup competition in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and Xsensio won a 2020 CES Innovation Award at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.\nCleantech and sustainability\nMajor technological advancements have been made in critical areas such as sustainability, the environment, energy and social responsibility. Nearly a third of the EPFL spin-offs created in 2020 (seven of the 25) are developing solutions to address these global challenges. Examples include DePoly and Plastogaz, which have designed innovative plastic recycling systems; Comppair and Inergio, which have invented new solutions for materials and clean fuel cells; Sohhytec, which is exploring green-energy sources; and Urbio, which has developed software to support more sustainable urban planning.", "summary": "EPFL startups raised CHF 293 million in 2020 – the highest they’ve achieved so far.

{"id": 1273, "text": "Proteins inside a cell are in constant motion, changing shape continuously in order to carry out their functions. In addition, their multiple component atoms each have individual patterns of motion, making the entire protein a system of non-stop highly complex movement. Understanding how a protein moves is the key to developing drugs that can efficiently interact with it. But because of this complexity, protein motion has been notoriously difficult to study. Scientists at EPFL, IBS-Grenoble, and ENS-Lyon, have developed a new method for studying protein motion by first freezing proteins and then slowly “waking them up” with increasing temperature. The breakthrough method, which was developed at EPFL’s advanced NMR facility, is published in \nScience\n.\nProtein motion is highly complex\nMotion is part of a protein’s function, allowing it to adjust its 3D shape and interact with other molecules like biological molecules and synthetic drugs. These “functional” motions however are complex, and can be thought as the mechanism of a watch, where motions between interlocking cogs and springs, at different timescales, result in the smooth movement of the hands.\nIn a protein the cogs and springs are the molecules that make it up: amino acids form its backbone each with side-chains of different molecules branching out on all sides in three dimensions. In addition, water molecules on the protein as well as the solution where it exists, e.g. the cell’s cytoplasm, add even more layers of motion complexity to the system. But unlike a watch, whose individual movements are all well defined, each of the component motions in a protein are actually random. As a result, protein motion seems almost chaotic, and is practically impossible to study.\nFreeze, sleep, wake up, and move\nA team of scientists at EPFL, IBS-Grenoble, and ENS-Lyon led by Lyndon Emsley and Martin Blackledge developed an innovative solution to the motion problem: freeze the proteins and then watch them “wake up” from deep sleep. Protein motion depends on energy, and temperature is basically a measurement of the energy of a system. By freezing proteins down to temperatures of -168°C, the researchers were able to completely stop all the motions of interest in the molecules. Then, they slowly raised the temperature to the point where the proteins could regain their natural motions, but at a much slower pace. This way, it was possible to look at each motion a protein makes individually and – more importantly – in sequence.\nIn order to detect the individual motions of proteins, the scientists used a spectroscopic technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which exploits the magnetic properties of certain atoms like hydrogen and carbon. NMR works by placing the sample of the protein to be studied inside a device with a strong magnetic field, and observing how they respond to different radio frequencies. This response is registered on a computer that produces a diagram of peaks, each representing energy transitions in specific atoms. Depending on the properties of the peaks on the diagram, scientists can determine the degree of motion of each atom in the protein, e.g. its backbone, a side-chain etc.\nBecause the proteins in this study needed to be frozen down, the team had to adjust their NMR methodology to work with samples at very low temperatures, and keep doing so as the researchers slowly raised the temperature to “wake the proteins up”. In addition, samples that are frozen solid are difficult to read in NMR, so the tube containing the proteins had to also be constantly spinning at a specific (“magic”) angle to the NMR’s magnetic field, to improve resolution. Finally, every NMR experiment took days to perform.\nThese complications were overcome by using a newly developed device that had been specifically designed to work with NMR at low and changing temperatures. To achieve the necessary high resolution, the scientists combined this device with a precise rotor system that could spin the sample over long periods of time.\nA hierarchy of motion\nUsing their innovative approach, Emsley’s team found that the sequence of protein motions follows a specific hierarchy as temperature increases: first the protein’s solvent molecules, then the protein’s side-chains and water molecules, and finally the protein’s backbone. The sequence culminates with a functionally active protein at temperatures even as low as -53°C, well below physiological levels. This means that the “waking up” method is very effective for studying the motions of a protein individually and sequentially.\n“Our work shows that we can use this technique, which is called ‘variable-temperature solid-state NMR’, to gain unique and novel insights into the role of protein dynamics in biology,” says Lyndon Emsley. The team is now interested in using this method to find out just how universal this hierarchy of motions is, and what might cause variations between different molecules.\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance with ENS-Lyon and the CEA/CNRS at University of Grenoble Alpes. \nReference\nLewandowski J.R, Halse ME, Blackledge M, Emsley, L. \nDirect observation of hierarchical protein dynamics.\nScience\n 01 May 2015. \n348\n(6234): 578-581.

{"id": 1274, "text": "“We noticed there was a lot of wood waste, especially pallets, in EPFL’s recycling bins. This wood isn’t earmarked for any particular purpose, but it could be useful. So we decided to base our project on it,” says Alexis Barrou, who is studying environmental sciences and engineering.\nBarrou, along with five other undergraduate students from EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) – Léo Benjamin, Elise Hautefaye, Doriand Jaton, Delphine Klumpp and Thomas Vila – came up with a plan to transform the wood from discarded pallets on the EPFL campus into everyday furniture by creating a catalog of easy-to-make designs. They dubbed their project CHEAP, for \nCatalog of Handmade Elements Assembled from Pallets\n.\nThe CHEAP catalog presents seven easily replicable designs – a table, chairs, a bar and stool set, a lounge chair, a bench, a coffee table and planters – based on the most widely used type of pallets in Switzerland. The pieces are designed to leave behind the least amount of wood scrap possible – the students kept this constraint in mind as they spent hours researching and experimenting. The result is a series of unique pieces.\nBasic tools\nThis project stands out for another reason too: there’s no need to be an accomplished do-it-yourselfer to bring these designs to life. All the pieces can be built using standard tools, and the catalog even estimates how long it will take. The first few pages of the catalog guide the users on how to select the right type of pallet so that their furniture won’t expose them to toxic paint or become moldy.\nThe catalog was enough to convince EPFL’s Act 4 Change Lab, a platform that encourages sustainable projects at EPFL, to support a series of furniture-building workshops on campus in conjunction with CHEAP. The Lab agreed to provide the designers with space for the workshops, so that interested students can come together to build their low-cost and sustainable furniture.\nA virtuous circle\nThe idea for the design manual came out of the Student Kreativity and Innovation Lab (SKIL), which gives ENAC undergraduate students of all backgrounds a chance to explore a research topic of their own. That’s where the six students – who are studying either architecture or environmental engineering – pooled their expertise to develop the CHEAP catalog: “While the environment students cut up the pallets and tried out different designs, the architecture students modeled them using their 3D software and told us what they thought would work,” says Elise Hautefaye proudly. “We learned together every step of the way.” Hautefaye has already used the pallet wood to create a nightstand, bed slats and balcony furniture.\nServing students’ various needs\nThe students behind CHEAP will attempt to awaken the DIY spirit in their peers when they run the furniture-building workshops at the start of the school year: “We want students to see that there’s no need to buy new furniture, which they’ll simply sell after graduating,” says Barrou. “Our approach is more sustainable.” The team also feels that the workshops will serve other purposes, such as helping students who are short on cash, interested in meeting new people or keen to get their hands dirty. A number of finished pieces will be displayed at strategic spots on campus, including during EPFL’s open doors event on 14 and 15 September. This will help to raise awareness of the problem of wood waste and the many ways it can be given a new life.

{"id": 1275, "text": "More than two months ago, EPFL researcher Julia Schmale joined the crew of the \nPolarstern\n, a German research icebreaker that has been drifting slowly through the frozen waters starting north of Siberia towards Svalbard since September last year. The vessel is carrying an international team of scientists on a year-long research expedition, working in unusual and often challenging conditions: changeable weather, temperatures plummeting as low as –40°C, interminable darkness giving way to endless daylight, and ice as far as the eye can see.\nThe crew is carrying out research as part of a major expedition titled Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, or MOSAiC for short, which aims to gain fundamental insights into conditions in the Arctic, the impact of climate change on the region and vice versa the region’s influence on global climate change.\nSchmale, an atmospheric scientist, is leading the observatory’s atmospheric research team. She and her PhD student Ivo Beck had planned a mid-April return to Switzerland, where she was recently appointed head of the brand-new Extreme Environments Research Laboratory at EPFL, but the COVID-19 crisis means both will remain on board until early June. Schmale is no stranger to polar environments, having taken part in the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) in 2017. Her role in this latest expedition is to study how airborne molecules and particles influence cloud formations in the Arctic. In this interview, she talks to us from the front line about living and working in this extreme environment, what it’s like to head out onto the ice floe, and the aims and methods of her research. The complete interview is available on the EPFL Out there website.\nWhat’s it like living and working on the ice?\n“Unpredictable. The icescape changes frequently and new cracks, leads and ridges form overnight, often preventing us from reaching our research sites on the ice. Depending on how severe the changes are, we might need to go scouting \nfor a new route or reschedule whatever activities we had planned. Sometimes the ice becomes dynamic during the day while we’re out. When that happens, we either have to keep a close eye on our path back to the ship or we get called back by the bridge, where the on-board team coordinates and monitors activities out on the ice. Before we head out, we always complete a trip log detailing who’s going where, what gear they’re carrying and – importantly – who’s acting as the polar bear guard. Most of us are qualified polar bear guards, a role that involves keeping a permanent lookout while our colleagues are working. We carry a flare gun to scare any bears away, as well as a rifle to use if an animal approaches us too quickly. On 23 April, we saw the first bear on our floe since we arrived in early March.\nThe environment is just beautiful. It was still dark when we arrived, with only a slither of daylight on the horizon. The research sites on the floe looked far away, but they were easy to reach across flat ice. Now, with the sun up 24 hours a day, everything seems much closer. But moving about is much harder because \nmany leads and cracks have formed, especially between the ship and our team’s main research site. With temperatures at around –20°C, open leads freeze over relatively quickly – about 6 cm in one day. Sometimes, ridges form when open leads close and we can end up surrounded by ice rising up to 6 meters high in just a couple of hours. On occasion, we can hear the ice moving and, if it happens fast, we can also see it. It’s also fascinating to watch frost flowers grow. We sample them to learn about their biogeochemistry.\nAnd what about the weather?\nWe’ve experienced the full range of Arctic weather conditions in our time here. We’ve had persistent low temperatures of –40°C, which makes working outdoors very challenging and renders some of ship’s equipment unusable. March was particularly stormy, with strong winds and a few complete whiteouts. Conditions have settled down recently, though. We have clear skies, sunshine and light winds – very much like winter in the Alps. Now that we’ve drifted below 84°N, warm air mass intrusions from the Atlantic are pushing temperatures as high as 0°C, bringing surface melt and rain.\nWhat samples are you collecting and why?\nI’m studying the extent to which natural and human emissions modify low-level Arctic clouds. These clouds play a vital role in maintaining the Arctic’s energy and mass balances because they reflect and absorb radiation, and because they contribute to snow cover through precipitation. In general, clouds only form in the presence of cloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles. These are a subset of aerosol particles that can originate from natural sources such as sea spray, phytoplankton emissions or blowing snow, but also from human activities such as fossil-fuel combustion, other industrial emissions and agriculture.\nWe can use our on-board instrumentation to characterize aerosol particles in terms of their microphysical and chemical properties. Variables such as number concentration, particle size distribution, hygroscopicity, chemical composition and fluorescence help us to understand their origin – natural or human – and their potential effects on clouds. Our end goal is to understand how far natural versus human-made processes contribute to cloud formation and to the energy balance in the Arctic, and how this might change as the so-called “New Arctic” evolves and human emissions change in the future. Ultimately, this information can be used in Arctic climate change scenarios.\nWhat have you learned about the Arctic air so far?\nBy looking at the data, I get an almost real-time picture of the composition of the atmosphere. When air masses come from the north – from the High Arctic – the aerosol population is aged, meaning several days to weeks old, and consists mainly of sulfuric acid. This is a common winter phenomenon known as Arctic haze, when sulfur dioxide emissions – mostly from human activity in the mid and high latitudes – accumulate over the wintertime. The haze began forming back in November. Initially, the concentration was about 50 particles per cubic centimeter. Now it’s risen to 200.\nDuring stormy conditions, salty snow is lifted into the air where it forms aerosol particles. The number of particles depends on several factors, including the microstructure of the snow, how wind-pressed it was, and its surface roughness. Because these particles make up a significant share of the overall aerosol population, they likely play an important role in cloud formation.\nWhen air masses arrive from the south, however, all these variables are different. The particles have been processed by clouds, and differ in origin, size and chemical composition. Mid-April is the time when phytoplankton blooms happen in the Atlantic. These blooms emit dimethyl sulfide, which is transformed to methanesulfonic acid – a tracer that we’re now seeing in the aerosol particles. We’ve also found halogens – iodic acid and bromine – in the aerosol population. These are more local in origin, and are connected to snow chemistry and UV radiation. And, of course, we also see exhaust particles from the ship, skidoos and helicopters. They carry a distinctive signature that sets them apart from other aerosol types.\nHave you personally observed changes in the Arctic climate?\nThat’s a difficult question. I don’t have a reliable benchmark because this is the first time that I, like many other members of the team, have been this far north at this time of year. Generally speaking, we didn’t anticipate observing so much mobile ice so early in the year. We expected to see a much more consolidated ice pack. But this might not necessarily be a sign of climate change. What was striking, however, was that precipitation fell as rain instead of snow when Atlantic air masses arrived in mid-April.\nIs the COVID-19 crisis affecting life on an Arctic research vessel? \nYes, definitely. It’s affecting us in two main ways. First, we’re all hearing news from home about how the world has changed and what it means for our families, friends and colleagues. It’s a real cause for concern and we talk about the pandemic a lot. Second, the outbreak has disrupted the crew changeover schedule. It’s taken us several weeks to figure out our options, given the travel restrictions in force around the world. Despite the delays and uncertainty around when we’ll \nreturn home, I’m happy to report that crew morale is high. We’ve grown together as a fantastic team of scientists who communicate openly and look out for each other. It’s also made my job much easier, as one of the five science team leaders on board.\nAs someone who’s used to spending long periods on boats, how are you coping with living under lockdown?\nI’d hardly call this a lockdown. We have a lot more freedom than people back at home. We can still work, go out, hold social gatherings, exercise and eat together. Of course, we can’t travel far from the ship and our activity options are limited. But you don’t really notice those things when you’re surrounded by such a fascinating environment, making friends and building new working relationships. All in all, it’s been an immensely satisfying and rewarding experience.\"", "summary": "The German research icebreaker Polarstern has been drifting through the frozen waters of the Arctic Ocean since September last year.

The rapid decisions involved, based mainly on images, are far from trivial given their commercial importance and the economic revolution represented by the advent of on-demand economy websites like Airbnb. But what is it about an image that prompts us to describe an interior as “trendy”, “colorful” or “practical”? To answer that question, researchers at  and at EPFL have been working with psychologists from the University of Lausanne. They want to gain a better understanding of social media users’ perceptions and behavior and then use this knowledge to program computers capable of making decisions in a more human way. “In the era of big data, machines are increasingly behind a large number of decisions,” explains Daniel Gatica-Perez, adjunct professor at EPFL School of Engineering and Digital Humanities Institute. “Our aim is to make them as similar as possible to human decisions.”\nA collaboration between psychologists and engineers\nTo understand how a first impression is formed, researchers first carried out interviews with guests and travelers, asking them how they select accommodations. They used 350,000 images of 22,000 properties listed on Airbnb in Switzerland and Mexico, and applied to them an algorithmic analysis to check that they were images of interiors. They then selected 200 properties at random and sent a list of adjectives to online observers. Those observers had to decide how accurately the adjectives described each property, on a scale of 1 to 7. Some adjectives were more factual (such as “clean” and “cluttered”), while others were more subjective (such as “bohemian” and “charming”). That stage, carried out in collaboration between psychologists and engineers, revealed which characteristics all participants agreed on and which ones they disagreed on. For properties described as “colorful” or “dark,” most respondents agreed with those adjectives and the scores were very similar. Scores for other adjectives, such as “relaxed” or “traditional,” varied widely depending on the property.\nAnalyzing human perception online\nThe scientists then carried out modeling based on the data obtained. They tried to detect which characteristics of the photos prompted the participants to describe them using a given adjective, in order to program computers to recognize them. Next, they looked at the extent to which the adjectives were interrelated. Will people describing a property as “colorful” also associate the adjective “clean” with that property? What is the connection between “pretentious, “trendy,” “organized” and “large”? How are positive and negative adjectives, and factual and subjective adjectives, interrelated? And why is the adjective “romantic” more closely associated with “sophisticated” than with “trendy”? “We might expect ‘large’ and ‘spacious’ to be very close together in people’s minds, and ‘cluttered’ and ‘empty’ to be very far apart,” says Gatica-Perez. “But the relationships are more complex. Using our system, if we recognize one characteristic, we can also associate other adjectives connected to them in people’s minds.”\nMachines helping humans\nFinally, the researchers took the property images and applied algorithms used in the field of deep learning, comparing the results with those obtained from humans. Eventually, professionals such as architects or designers could apply the results to photos of interiors. The laboratory is also monitoring the development of image sharing sites which, for a given place, display very different photos – professional and amateur – leading to widely varying perceptions. However, the scientists’ main goal is to understand the characteristics of images and the connections that determine the way we form impressions, so that they can program computers to imitate them. “We often hear that machines perform better than humans,” concludes Gatica-Perez. “Our aim is different: we want to train machines to recognize these subtleties that humans perceive and express in their day-to-day lives, and to use them to support people’s real needs.”\n“Check Out This Place: Inferring Ambiance from Airbnb Photos”\n, Laurent Son Nguyen, Salvador Ruiz Correa, Marianne Schmid Mast and Daniel Gatica-Perez.

And this is a field where Switzerland could figure prominently in the coming years. “Long known for its neutral status among nations, Switzerland has a golden opportunity to put the same concept to work in virtual space,” said Bryan Ford, an EPFL professor who specializes in decentralized systems, internet security and anonymity, and is also \nIn the post-Snowden digital age, mutual mistrust among the world’s major powers is growing. “Efforts by some countries, including the USA, to have backdoors installed in programs automatically raises suspicions among other nations,” said Ford. The frequency and impact of cyber attacks are increasing – Swiss technology company RUAG is a recent victim – and the USA, Russia and China are engaged in a virtual war combining espionage and sabotage. It is no surprise that governments, businesses and the scientific world recognize the need to protect their sensitive data. This neutral virtual space could thus be applied not only to intergovernmental and international arbitration, but also to the commercial and industrial world, as well as any type of exchanges where mutually distrustful parties must find a means and venue to cooperate.\nCommon ground for exchange and negotiation \nData-protection measures are being enhanced, but the need to share data across borders remains a challenge. “Encrypted data can be exchanged through a cloud, but for that you have to trust the service provider in Silicon Valley. Switzerland, on the other hand, has built a track record in creating common ground for exchange and negotiation, and could use this to play a leading role in this field,” said Ford. He believes that “Switzerland can and should develop a neutral virtual space.” This is a technological niche that would give the country a clear edge over other countries providing the same service.\nThis neutral space could be developed through distributed databases called blockchains, which are already being aggressively developed in the field of finance. “Just like with the virtual currency Bitcoin, all transactions are public and verifiable by all participants,” said Ford. Cryptographic technologies that allow transparent validation and processing of data that remains encrypted (unlike Bitcoin) already exist. Several EPFL and ETHZ labs are hard at work developing safer decentralized systems and seeking to improve the methods used for encrypting data, detecting attacks and safely sharing biometric data.\nProgress in this field will be crucial in the coming years, with the rise of the Internet of Things and the advent of self-driving cars. “The security risks raised by these phenomena will be a real challenge for society in the next five years,” said Ford.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nThe Swiss Cyber Research Initiative\nOne of the goals of the conference is to launch the Swiss Cyber Research Initiative, aimed at fostering a community of experts in this field in Switzerland. “This initiative was developed by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation in partnership with other federal entities,” said Karl Aberer, vice president of EPFL and the conference co-organizer. “By bringing together industry, research and government experts, we can enhance the level of collaboration in the field of IT security in Switzerland.”", "summary": "The first Swiss Cyber Risk Research Conference, being held today at EPFL, brings together Swiss and international IT security specialists.

{"id": 1285, "text": "From above, it almost looks like part of the Great Wall of China. Lignon, a massive architectural complex built between 1963 and 1972, is now part of Geneva’s cultural heritage. The longest building in Europe – 1.5 km – today houses some 6,500 people.\nBut the entire architectural design, audacious at the time, no longer meets current energy consumption standards. The 100,000 square meters of thin exterior “curtain walls” have no structural role; they only protect apartments from climatic extremes, but at a level that is now considered substandard. Because they are a fundamental element of the building’s character, however, it was unthinkable to change their outward appearance when it became necessary to update the buildings’ insulation.\nThe government of Geneva and the Lignon property owners’ group thus approached EPFL to study options that would improve the buildings’ energy consumption while still preserving its unique character.\nTwo variants\n Franz Graf, head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM), led this extensive research project, which began in May 2008. “We were lucky to be able to do this in a very systematic and in-depth manner, to reunite all the stakeholders around the same table, and to outline various scenarios,” he explains.\nOf the four options initially considered – from simple maintenance work to complete replacement of the curtain walls – two were seen as feasible: overhauling the existing facades while increasing the level of insulation and replacing windows, for energy savings of about 33%; or their complete renovation, which would involve installing brand new insulation on the opaque panels, for energy savings of 38-40%.\nThese results, delivered in mid-2011 and compiled in an impressive book*, allowed the property owners to make an informed decision about the way they chose to renovate. Above all, since the work had to be done from inside the buildings, they were able to plan the work in the way they saw fit. Over the next six months, 23 apartments will be renovated.\nCommunal areas – hallways and entrances – will also undergo a facelift. And the installation of solar collectors on the roofs will enable the complex to reach a level of energy efficiency compatible with the Minergie standard, as well as reducing CO2 emissions by thousands of tons.

{"id": 1287, "text": "The human genome is fascinating. Once predicted to contain about a hundred thousand protein-coding genes, it now seems that the number is closer to twenty thousand, and maybe less. And although our genome is made up of about three billion units – “base pairs” – many of them don’t seem to belong to specific genes, and for that reason they were delegated to the dustbin of genetics: they were literally called “junk DNA”.\nBut as it turned out, junk DNA is actually critical in coordinating and regulating the work of actual genes. For example, there are sequences of DNA that “jump” around the genome and influence gene expression. These jumping units are called “transposable elements” and their number is estimated at over 4.5 million in a single genome.\nTransposable elements frequently contain sequences that are binding sites for transcription factors – proteins that regulate the rate of transcription of DNA to RNA, marking the first step of gene expression. By moving around the entire genome, transposable elements renew the pool of binding sites for transcription factors, becoming a “motor” of genome evolution.\nBut at the same time, transposable elements can also be very dangerous to the host; they are genotoxic, meaning that they can cause mutations that can incapacitate genes, leading to severe diseases and even death. The question is, how is the genotoxic potential of transposable elements kept in check without compromising their ability to regulate the genome?\nNow, scientists from the lab of  have found that a family of proteins known as KZFP (for Krüppel-associated box-containing zinc finger proteins), act as “key facilitators” by domesticating regulatory sequences embedded in transposable elements themselves.\nWhen the genome of the human embryo is activated shortly after the egg is fertilized by the sperm, transposable elements are among the first sequences to be expressed. The researchers found that KZFPs quickly “tame” these elements, minimizing their transcriptional impact during the earliest stages of early embryogenesis. This allows transposable elements to be subsequently used later in development and in adult tissues. In this way, KZFPs play a key role in defining how the human genome is regulated, by facilitating the incorporation of transposable element-based controlling sequences into transcriptional networks.\n“Our results reveal how a family of proteins that was long considered an oddity of nature, turns foes into friends,” says Didier Trono. “They show that KZFPs do not just sentence transposable elements to perpetual silence, but domesticate their formidable regulatory potential for the benefit of our genome. But our findings also imply that anomalies in the completion of this process would fatally compromise the earliest phases of human embryonic development.”\nOther contributors\nWhitehead Institute for Biomedical Research", "summary": "EPFL scientists have discovered how a family of proteins that regulates the activity of transposable elements in the genome allows them to make inheritable changes to the growing fetus.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have discovered how a family of proteins that regulates the activity of transposable elements in the genome allows him to make inheritable changes to the growing fetus.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [20, 20], "noise": false}
{"id": 1293, "text": "A number of Switzerland’s ski resorts are reaching a point of saturation, with peak-time traffic jams, buildings popping up in avalanche zones, and general encroachment upon the natural surroundings. While the current trend is to stop construction, an EPFL doctoral thesis suggests that the opposite might actually be necessary: we need to invest in these regions, increase their density, and ensure seamless public transportation to and from them.\nAt the Architecture and Urban Mobility Laboratory (LAMU), Fiona Pià, from the Principality of Andorra, studied and compared the challenges faced by the Swiss resorts Verbier, Zermatt, and Andermatt Swiss Alps, as well as France’s Avoriaz and Canada’s Whistler-Blackcomb. Her thesis highlights the persistent myth of an isolated chalet surrounded by nature and claims that this idyllic image is responsible for the saturation of alpine towns. Using Verbier as an example, Pià puts forward a series of solutions to safeguard the future of this Valais resort while at the same time preserving its natural environment.\nYou began your PhD in architecture just before the Weber initiative was passed on 11 March 2012, which limited second homes to 20% of all construction. What do you think the outcome will be for the Alps? \nThe initiative made the public aware of the need to slow the urban sprawl encroaching upon the alpine landscape. But unfortunately its only solution was to criticize the economic model of having a second home. The images from the 2012 campaign highlighted the issue using ambiguous communication ploys that stigmatized dense construction and the urbanization of mountain resorts. But the campaign oversimplified matters. \"Density\" became something that was harmful to nature and created ugliness, while \"urbanization\" was responsible for the sprawl encroaching upon the landscape. Yet the problems that alpine towns currently face are actually caused by their low density, which results from the growing number of single chalets. Nobody dares to criticize this model, considered so idyllic. But it should be condemned because it is just this model that leads to urban sprawl and encourages people to use their cars. Yet Franz Weber presented it as the ideal: the poster thanking people for accepting the initiative showed Zermatt with an isolated chalet below the Matterhorn, claiming that by stopping all new construction we could return to this alpine \"authenticity\". Weber's remarkable paradox can be summed up as follows: he accepts that urban sprawl exists and condemns it, yet, at the same time, he glorifies the same urban model that caused it and absolves it of all blame.\nSo how can we escape this paradox?\nWe can't keep maintaining this false impression. The initiative’s implicit goal of keeping the status quo will not simply make the large alpine towns above 1,400 meters disappear. Instead of trying to go back to how things were, which is impossible, it would be better to focus on the serious problem of urban saturation and the climate issues that these regions face today. Unless we increase the density of these towns over the long term, they will quite simply fall into decline, and the consequences for the “unspoiled” nature nearby would be catastrophic. The initiative totally ignores this aspect, which is nevertheless essential for protecting the alpine landscape.\nYou used Verbier as a case study. What would you recommend to that resort in terms of future development? \nTo solve the traffic problems, the municipality of Bagnes plans to build two new ring roads, one of which will run through an avalanche red zone. They will further encroach upon the landscape by building more housing on the almost untouched hillsides in Bruson, which will require more new infrastructure. Yet Verbier already has numerous roads and other infrastructure. It would be better to increase the density of the resort to extend its \"lifecycle\" and avoid colonizing untouched areas.\nHow could the density be increased?\nTen percent of public building land is still available. Based on this, I developed a new urban model that brings together housing and public transport. The aim is to resolve current mobility problems caused by everyone using their cars and rationalize how the last plots of land are used. I recommend building five cable-car stations as infrastructure that could be up to 500 meters long. This would be a new type of building that contains housing, real pedestrian areas – often missing in the mountains – public facilities, and transport interfaces. The inhabited infrastructures would have a density of 1.7 compared to 0.3 for a single chalet and would take up six times less land than a chalet. This model would add 250,000 m\n2\n to the 963,000 m\n2\n of existing accommodation, without increasing the urban sprawl on the alpine landscape. An expanded cable-car network could sustainably serve the whole of Verbier without people having to use their cars. I found this form of public transport to be the most appropriate because it’s eco-friendly, relatively quiet and cheap, and it is suited to the alpine terrain while taking up very little land. And it allows people to enjoy the alpine scenery.\nSo we have to give up our dream of a mountain chalet, but how do you convince people to live in this kind of infrastructure? \nInhabited infrastructures meet two requirements that a chalet cannot: that of being able to live in the open air and be at one with nature – without destroying it. We may think that chalets are a part of nature but in fact they just swallow it up. Inhabited infrastructures occupy the land in a rational way and can therefore help us to control our footprint on the natural environment. And it will be through green mobility and respect for natural dangers that we will be able to preserve the unspoiled environment over the long term. What's more, these buildings offer a new way of living at altitude. Without leaving the infrastructure, you can go directly from the cable car to your home or to see a concert at the Verbier Festival, go skiing, go for a drink along the pedestrian area in the middle of the building. Then you can take the cable car over the landscape to go to the market in Verbier village, take a class at the international school or go back down into the valley. There's no need for a car, so you really get to breathe the alpine air.\nWhy is this project so relevant for Verbier? \nThe project is not just about Verbier as a ski resort. It looks ahead to what Verbier will become: an extension of the \"real\" town that is at one with the natural environment at altitude. The municipality of Bagnes intends to draw visitors ten months of the year by 2035. So the future of Verbier's natural environment is being decided today.\nFiona Pià, \"Developing the Swiss Alps: strategies to increase the density of high-altitude towns\", \nsupervised by Inès Lamunière, Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Mobility (LAMU).

{"id": 1299, "text": "A shower typically uses around 10 liters of water per minute and lasts an average of 10 minutes. That makes it a veritable luxury in places where water is scarce – and that includes some developed countries. Two Bachelor’s students at EPFL decided to address this problem by developing an open-source kit called Showerloop that lets people in arid parts of the world take a full and proper shower.\nTheir device consists of a closed-loop system where the first 10 liters of water are purified and recirculated throughout the shower, which can consequently last 10, 15, 20, 25 minutes – as long as you want. The students have been awarded a grant for their project and in September will install three Showerloop prototypes at a university campus in Colombia.\n10 liters is all you need \nThe Showerloop needs just 10 liters of water to operate, instead of the 100 liters used on average. When you take a shower with Showerloop, the necessary amount of water comes out of the showerhead, and the dirty, soapy water exits through a drain at the bottom just like in a conventional shower. But the water then goes through three different types of filters to be purified.\nThe first type is a mesh filter that blocks particles like hair and dust that could plug up the pipes. The second contains sand and activated carbon to remove pollutants. And the third uses ultraviolet light to sterilize the water and kill harmful bacteria and other pathogens. The purified water is then fed back into the showerhead, and the loop begins again. At the end of the shower, the 10 liters of water are discharged into the regular wastewater system.\nSwiss materials\nThe two EPFL Bachelor’s students behind the project – Judith Capron in civil engineering and Jean-André Davy-Guidicelli in environmental engineering – were inspired by a standard open-source eco-friendly shower kit that a Finnish engineer, Jason Selvarajan, presented at the COP 21 Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015.\nCapron and Davy-Guidicelli took Selvarajan’s model and created a version using materials available in Switzerland. They carried out their work at the Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory (SKIL), a new facility offered by the School of Architecture, Civil, and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) where students can design and build their own prototypes. Constructing their Showerloop turned out to be more challenging than expected, since neither Capron nor Davy-Guidicelli is a natural-born do-it-yourselfer. But that made them even more proud of the end result.\nNew version\nThey also wanted to make a version of the Showerloop that could be used on a larger scale than Selvarajan’s, which requires taking down an existing shower in order to be installed. Rather, they envisioned a system that would require simply adding new parts to an existing shower. So they made the necessary adjustments to Selvarajan’s model with materials they found right here at home.\nThe students calculate that a Showerloop would pay for itself quickly thanks to cost savings on both electricity (since water would not have to be heated continuously) and water (since consumption would be slashed by 90%). According to their initial rough estimates, installing a Showerloop would cost 1,000 francs and have a payback period of around 11 months, depending on the price of electricity. The system’s filters last 1 to 2 years and cost around 40 francs to replace.\nThree prototypes in Colombia\nCapron and Davy-Guidicelli have just been awarded a Development Impact Grant created by the Coopertion and Devlopment Center (CODEV) from EPFL to further their research. These grants fund projects that contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. And the Showerloop fits that bill – it targets major water consumers like public institutions and hotel chains and could represent an important step towards Goal 6, “Ensure access to water and sanitation for all.”\nThe students will use the grant money to develop, test, and install three Showerloop prototypes in the sports centers’ locker rooms of Universidad del Valle in Colombia when the school year starts this September. They chose Universidad del Valle because it’s located in a water-poor part of the country, and because their project fits in with a sustainable development program at the university, which is eager to test this kind of shower on its campus.\nA journal publication \nTo carry out the tests in Colombia, Davy-Guidicelli will team up with Marisa Boller, also a Bachelor’s student in environmental engineering at EPFL, rather than with Capron. That’s because Boller and Davy-Guidicelli will already be spending the 2018–2019 school year in the country for their required internship year, where they will work on a water treatment system for a cassava processing plant. In parallel, they will develop a version of the Showerloop suited to the materials available in Colombia and to other local constraints, and perform a complete life-cycle analysis of their device.\nTheir goal will be to make the Showerloop as attractive as possible from an environmental and financial perspective, and to publish an article illustrating its cost benefits in order to attract interest from businesses and organizations. Selvarajan, the engineer behind the very first Showerloop, fully supports the students and will be following their progress closely.\nBut the student’s plans for the Showerloop don’t stop there. Once back in Lausanne in September 2019, they intend to draw on the lessons learned in Colombia to roll out their system across the EPFL campus as part of their Master’s studies.\n (Copyright: © Jamani Caillet / EPFL 2018)", "summary": "Summer series.

Making matters worse, women are frequently assaulted when they have no other choice but to relieve themselves in the open. These observations spurred Marc-Edouard Schultheiss and Alexandre Bouchet, two students in the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), to head to India for a three-month humanitarian project supported by Engineers of the World, a student association at EPFL.\nOnce there, they focused on teaching villagers – especially women – how to build a shower and toilet connected to a pit. But the two students quickly ran into illiteracy problems and the language barrier: it simply wasn’t possible to provide instructional videos in 18 different dialects. “And since the women never went to school,” said Marc-Edouard, “understanding a diagram and using numbers – even for measuring things out with a meter stick – was a challenge for them.”\nTo resolve this dilemma and enable the women to pass along their skills far into the future, they came up with a surprising idea: that of using LEGO blocks to create a model. The kit comes complete with bamboo sticks and strings with colored markers to use as a measuring instrument. “We also prepared an animated drawing to remind them of the key steps in the building process,” said Alexandre.\nThis fun and innovative project has been undergoing testing since the summer by other volunteers on the ground.

Credit: L. Symul (EPFL/Stanford)\nFor many women of reproductive age, the most common way of assessing their menstrual health and fertility means regular visits to a gynecologist or another clinician. When it comes to evaluating changes in fertility, menstrual health, and quality of life, these visits typically rely on remembering, which can lead to significant inaccuracies in evaluation.\nOn the other hand, many women today are turning to so-called “fertility awareness method” (FAM) apps to support them in tracking their menstrual cycles. There is a multitude of such apps available, which only demonstrates how popular they’ve become in recent years.\nBut how accurate are FAM apps? What do users track? Can they help them and their gynecologists? These are hard to answer for a simple reason: Neither visits nor app use have been systematically studied on a population level to determine and compare their accuracy in evaluating menstrual health and fertility in a meaningful way.\nThis is what Laura Symul at EPFL’s  has done. Working with Stanford University (), Symul led a large-scale study on 200,000 users of two FAM apps, Sympto and Kindara. Both apps support the “Sympto-Thermal Method” and facilitate the identification of the fertile and infertile times of a woman’s menstrual cycle by taking into account recordings of cervical fluid, body temperature at wake-up, and other biological signs.\nThe scientists tracked more than 30 million days of observations from over 2.7 million menstrual cycles. The overall study had two aims: First\n,\n to see how and what users voluntarily track on FAM apps. Second, to find out if these records allow an accurate detection and estimation of ovulation timing.\nIn terms of user demographics and behavior, the study found that the typical FAM app user is around 30 years old, lives in a western country (in Europe or Northern America) and has a healthy BMI. App users log their observations more frequently when they also log sexual intercourse, and when you look at them on a population level, reported fertility awareness body signs exhibit temporal patterns that follow very closely those that have been found in small-scale clinical studies.\nAnalyzing the data, the scientists found that women who were seeking pregnancy recorded Sympto-Thermal measurements every single day for up to 40% of their menstrual cycles. Then, by modeling the data, they found that the average duration and range of the follicular phase, which begins the menstrual cycle and ends at ovulation, were larger than previously reported. In fact, the modeling showed that only 24% of ovulations occur at days 14 to 15 of the cycle. On the other hand, the data showed that the duration and range of the luteal phase – the latter part of the menstrual cycle – matched previous studies.\nThe findings offer an affordable means for studying the interactions between the menstrual cycle and other physiological systems on a large scale. “Our study provides a common ground for users and their doctors to incorporate digital records in their visits, evaluate their own menstrual patterns and compare them with the statistics we report,” says Laura Symul.\nShe continues: “New technologies, and in particular self-tracking, are changing the way we perceive our bodies and health. Both users and doctors wonder about the opportunities and the usefulness of digital self-tracking. Our study shows that users voluntarily track their menstrual cycle and fertility-related body signs very frequently, and what they track is aligned with what is expected in the vast majority of cases. While these measurements and observations are noisy and not perfectly regular, they provide valuable information for inferring the underlying hormonal changes and timing of ovulation in a way that is scalable both in time and in number of participants.”\nMarcel Salathé, director of the Digital Epidemiology Lab adds: “The digital epidemiology approach presented here can help to lead to a better understanding of menstrual health and its connection to women’s health overall, which has historically been severely under-studied.”\nOther contributors\nUniversity of Geneva", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and Stanford have carried out an analysis of the largest datasets from fertility awareness apps.

{"id": 1305, "text": "Our state of consciousness changes significantly during stages of deep sleep, just as it does in a coma or under general anesthesia. Scientists have long believed – but couldn’t be certain – that brain activity declines when we sleep. Most research on sleep is conducted using electroencephalography (EEG), a method that entails measuring brain activity through electrodes placed along a patient’s scalp. However, Anjali Tarun, a doctoral assistant at EPFL’s Medical Image Processing Laboratory within the School of Engineering, decided to investigate brain activity during sleep using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. According to Dimitri Van De Ville, who heads the lab, “MRI scans measure neural activity by detecting the hemodynamic response of structures throughout the brain, thereby providing important information in addition to EEGs.” During these experiments, Tarun relied upon EEG to identify when the study participants had fallen asleep and pinpoint the different stages of sleep. Then she examined the MRI images to generate spatial maps of neural activity and determine different brain states. \nDifficult data to obtain \nThe only catch was that it wasn’t easy to perform brain MRIs on participants while they were sleeping. The machines are very noisy, making it hard for participants to reach a state of deep sleep. But working with Prof. Sophie Schwartz at the University of Geneva and Prof. Nikolai Axmacher at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Tarun could leverage simultaneous MRI and EEG data from around thirty people. The brain-activity data were covered a period of nearly two hours while participants were sleeping in an MRI machine. “Two hours is a relatively long time, meaning we were able to obtain a set of rare, reliable data,” says Tarun. “MRIs carried out while a patient is performing a cognitive task usually last around 10–30 minutes.”\nDimitri Van De Ville and Anjali Tarun © Alain Herzog / 2021 EPFL\nBrain activity during sleep\nAfter checking, analyzing and comparing all the data, what Tarun found was surprising. “We calculated exactly how many times networks made up of different parts of the brain became active during each stage of sleep,” she says. “We discovered that during light stages of sleep – that is, between when you fall asleep and when you enter a state of deep sleep – overall brain activity decreases. But communication among different parts of the brain becomes much more dynamic. We think that’s due to the instability of brain states during this phase.” Van De Ville adds: “What really surprised us in all this was the resulting paradox. During the transition phase from light to deep sleep, local brain activity increased and mutual interaction decreased. This indicates the inability of brain networks to synchronize.”\nThe role of default-mode networks and the cerebellum \nConsciousness is generally associated with neural networks that may be linked to our introspection processes, episodic memory and spontaneous thought. “We saw that the network between the anterior and posterior regions broke down, and this became increasingly pronounced with increasing sleep depth,” says Van De Ville. “A similar breakdown in neural networks was also observed in the cerebellum, which is typically associated with motor control.” For now, the scientists don’t know exactly why this happens. But their findings are a first step towards a better understanding of our state of consciousness while we sleep. “Our findings show that consciousness is the result of interactions between different brain regions, and not in localized brain activity,” says Tarun. “By studying how our state of consciousness is altered during different stages of sleep, and what that means in terms of brain network activity, we can better understand and account for the wide range of brain functions that characterize us as human beings.”", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL and the Universities of Geneva, Cape Town and Bochum have joined forces to investigate brain activity during sleep with the help of MRI scans.

While on the trail of steel, he uncovered the mechanisms of this spontaneous city that has been built along the sea due to the 14.4 km long dismantling site.\nMetal is the anchor of this research. Many questions and multiple avenues of exploration all revolve around it. What is the origin of the 270 ships that are cut up each year? How is the recovery, processing and redistribution of the steel organized? What are the causes and conditions of employment for those 25,000 to 50,000 required personnel, depending on the season, who are responsible for the proper functioning of this industry? A number of points analyzed by civil engineers provide the first answers.\nThe Alang shipyard, built 30 years ago, has had a significant impact on neighboring villages. They have rapidly prospered, and their people were the first to invest in ship-breaking. Steel is a developing economy for India. It constitutes up to 90% of the vessels, and the rest of the pieces – down to the door hinges – are also recycled in local markets. The steel is used as is or can be fused to produce structural components.\nAll the removed metal heads for the domestic market. Alang shipyard alone provides 4% of India’s steel. However, the environment pays a heavy price for this rapid and chaotic development. Ships are full of heavy metals, asbestos or organic waste that are handled incorrectly and pass, for the most part, directly into the sea.\nToday, Alang is the fastest growing city in India.

{"id": 1311, "text": "Imagine being able to track the development of diseased cells in real time, simply by having patients drink a glass of water containing millions of tiny electronic biosensors. Once the microscopic sensors have been ingested, they would travel to diseased tissue in a patient’s body and send out a continuous stream of diagnostic data via telemetry.\nThat’s the ambitious goal that Sandro Carrara from EPFL’s Integrated Systems Laboratory (School of Engineering/ Computer and Communication Sciences) and Pantelis Georgiou from Imperial College London have set for themselves. Such technology seems now possible thanks to advancements in nanofabrication processes for integrated circuits. Berkeley researchers had discussed a  where they suggested to sprinkle CMOS circuits into the human cortex to monitor neural activity.\nAt EPFL, the researchers intend to use body dust for a more general purpose. They have already shown how a CMOS cube of around 10 µm on each side could theoretically be created. They presented these findings at the . The theoretical feasibility of the concept has also been discussed in a preprint on .\nThe scientists hope to revolutionize diagnostic methods and give doctors a better understanding of diseases like cancer. “Today doctors give drugs to cancer patients and wait to see whether the tumor cells go away. But having continuous feedback on how the cells respond to a given treatment would be of unprecedented value,” says Carrara.\nThe microscopic sensors would be cube-shaped and have three complementary electrodes on their surfaces. After a patient swallows them, they would pass through the intestinal walls via the natural process of endocytosis. But that process can happen only if the patient’s body thinks the sensors are bacteria or red blood cells. So the scientists plan to cover the sensors with a special coating and shrink them to 10 µm on each side. Once the sensors enter the blood stream, they would travel to the affected area and attach to diseased cells using targeted ligands such as antibodies. From there they could track the disease’s progress.\nThe sensors would act like spies, supplying information on a cancer cell’s metabolism, for example, or on the local concentration of a drug that had been administered. “The electrodes on the sensors’ surfaces would be able to identify the right protein or drug molecule they come into contact with, because each type of molecule would alter the current in a different way,” says Carrara. The data would be collected using a wireless energy transmission system. “An electromagnetic field or ultrasound waves would be generated outside a patient’s body to charge the sensors and collect data. The sensors won’t contain batteries,” adds Carrara.\nTo flesh out their idea, the scientists drew from concrete examples in the literature, such as glucose sensors of around 10 µm that use CMOS circuits, and a simple glucose sensor with a diameter of just 2.5 µm. In addition, a 10 mm telemetric diagnostic device that is covered with a biocompatible epoxy resin was successfully already tested on mice in 2016. However, the research team still has considerable hurdles to overcome. First, the scientists must shrink the sensors to below 10 µm on each side, so that they are about the same size as red blood cells. Then they will have to demonstrate the feasibility of both their technology and the charging system.\nWould these miniscule sensors have any side effects? For now, it’s too early to say. The scientists believe the sensors could be easily eliminated from a patient’s body, either when the tumor itself is removed or, if it turns out there is no diseased tissue, then through the patient’s urine or stool.\nThis research project brings together scientists from universities across Europe: Catholic University of Leuven, University of Glasgow, Politecnico di Torino, Imperial College London and EPFL.", "summary": "Thanks to an unorthodox approach being proposed by EPFL researchers, patients may soon be able to track their illness simply by drinking a solution containing millions of tiny electronic sensors disguised as bacteria.", "claim": "Thanks to an unorthodox approach being proposed by EPFL researchers, patients may soon be able to track his illness simply by drinking a solution containing millions of tiny electronic sensors disguised as bacteria.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [18, 18], "noise": false}

{"id": 1322, "text": "Biological processes occurring in our bodies are far from static, but instead the rhythm of most of them is dictated by an internal, 24-hour biological metronome called the ‘circadian clock’. During each day-night cycle, many physiological processes follow oscillatory waves orchestrated by this clock, allowing them to adapt and anticipate the body’s demands at a given time of day. EPFL scientists have now used cutting-edge proteomics to monitor the temporal accumulation of over 5,000 different proteins in the nucleus of mouse liver cells, and have identified over 500 that are connected to the 24-hours cycle. The study, , is the first in this field in terms of scale and resolution, and has significant implications regarding our understanding of the interconnections between rhythmic metabolism and nutrition.\nBiology is affected by time\nOur bodies follow the day-night, or “diurnal”, cycle, by finely tuning metabolic processes to time of day — this is why we can sleep for hours without going hungry through the night but can barely stand eight hours after breakfast, or why jet lag can sometimes cause digestive problems. Such oscillations are the focus of “chronobiology” a research field that looks at how biological functions are organized in time and how disease could arise when this time organization is disturbed.\nThis regulation of metabolism is connected to how our genes produce proteins. Many genes follow our circadian clock by adjusting the rate at which they produce proteins, and knowing which genes do this would help us understand how metabolism changes over the course of a day. Unfortunately, even though the human genome was mapped out more than a decade ago, investigating how genes control the production of proteins on a time-dependent scale is still difficult, mostly because of the sheer number of proteins present in a cell.\n500 liver proteins affected by the day-night cycle\n and , have now made a breakthrough in our understanding of time-dependent metabolism. Working only the nuclei of liver cells, the scientists identified 5000 proteins of which more than 500 were affected during the diurnal cycle; more specifically, the proteins entered and left the nucleus over the course of the day. In addition, they found that key cellular functions such as DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle and chromosome regulation (polyploidy) were also affected by diurnal regulation.\nTo counteract the huge complexity of the proteome, the researchers only focused on the cell’s nucleus instead of the entire cell. The nucleus is where genes produce proteins that are then sent to various locations around the cell. As such, the nucleus is very sensitive to environmental and biochemical signals, and can translate these into molecular responses by controlling protein production.\nThe scientists used biochemical techniques to isolate the nuclei from liver cells taken from mice with and without a functioning circadian clock. Having isolated the nuclei, they extracted all the proteins from them and analyzed them with mass spectrometry.\nCutting-edge proteomics\nLike genomics for genes, proteomics is the field of digital biology where computers are used to create detailed databases and maps of the complete set of an organism’s proteins. The scientists used a technique called SILAC coupled with high-resolution proteomics, which can efficiently quantify proteins — in this case, the proteins are quantified in the nucleus at different time-points throughout a 24-hour cycle. By doing this, they were able to get a global picture of how the diurnal cycle affects protein accumulation in the liver-cell nucleus.\n“While many studies approach physiological functions statically, our temporal approach gave us unprecedented insights into how metabolism cycles over a day,” says Felix Naef. “We were surprised by how pervasively nuclear functions in liver are influenced by the day and night and feeding cycles.”\n“The study also shows that this quantitative proteomics approach is an excellent tool for systematic analysis of cell functions,” says Frédéric Gachon. “This would not be feasible with conventional proteomic techniques.”\nThis work involves a collaboration between EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering and the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, with contributions from the University of Lausanne, and the Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier.

{"id": 1323, "text": "“We are trying to collect as many sound recordings made all over Canton of Geneva as possible – both pleasant and unpleasant sounds. Even nature sounds are useful, as they will help us learn more about the canton's biodiversity,” said Stéphane Joost, a geographer at EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG). Thanks to a new app called NoiseCapture, the general public can help map Canton of Geneva’s soundscape. Users just need to be in Canton of Geneva to make the recordings using an Android smartphone.\nNoiseCapture came out of a European open-data research project called ENERGIC OD. The app parameters were developed by Lab-STICC – a multi-disciplinary research lab that is part of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and based in Vannes (Brittany) – and acoustic specialists at the French Institute of Science and Technology for Transport, Development and Networks (IFSTTAR). The app is just one component of a larger project called NoisePlanet, which offers a number of open-source noise-measurement tools.\nAt EPFL, Stéphane Joost is responsible for analyzing the data, which are displayed on a map. “The Swiss government already has a sound map of Switzerland called SonBASE. What's different about NoiseCapture is that it lets people describe sounds using key words.”\nHow does it work? \nWhen the app is installed, it calibrates the microphone so that recordings from all smartphones are comparable regardless of the brand. The app's recording function geolocates the sound and logs the number of decibels, frequencies, date and time of the recording. Users can also take a picture of the location, evaluate the sound’s ‘pleasantness’ and add a comment.\nDescriptive categories let users provide further details on the recording, such as whether it's a mechanical sound, like traffic or construction, or a natural one, like birds or a stream. The minimum suggested recording time is 20 seconds.\nTutorial\nOne spot, several contributors\n“We’ll use an artificial-intelligence based algorithm to crunch the data. The more data people send in from all over Canton of Geneva, the more accurate and meaningful the sound map will be,” said Joost. In the best-case scenario, several contributors submit data on the same spot. To encourage this, the app’s designers hold NoiseCapture parties where people make simultaneous recordings on a certain street or in a given neighborhood.\nTeaming up with the Geneva University Hospital\nThe physiological effects of noise on the human body are numerous and well documented. They include heart problems, stress, insomnia and hearing damage. In November 2016, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) reported that Geneva was the noisiest city in Switzerland, followed by Basel and Lausanne. EPFL’s LASIG has been working for many years with the Unit of Population Epidemiology, led by Idris Guessous, at the Geneva University Hospital. NoiseCapture is among their joint projects. “We analyze the spatial distribution of health-related data on people participating in the Bus Santé study,” said Joost. “We are looking for links between this data and environmental factors, including the soundscape. The more we know about various disorders in specific areas of Canton of Geneva, the better equipped we will be to address them.”\nAnother of LASIG's projects, Urbangene, studies how urbanization affects biodiversity. This project is jointly funded by Greater Geneva, Canton of Geneva and the Gelbert Foundation. Researchers working on this project will also be able to use data produced by the sound-map project.\n2014 crowd-mapping project at LASIG\nIn the spring of 2014, the LASIG researchers launched a crowd-mapping project for residents of the greater Geneva area to map the region’s ponds.

{"id": 1329, "text": "Switzerland has launched a broad-ranging  on the energy transition (NRP70). Two researchers from EPFL will be heading two joint research projects. Christophe Ballif, from EPFL's  will direct \nPV2050\n, which aims to improve photovoltaic technologies and transfer them to the construction industry. Emmanuel Rey, from the , will direct \nActive Interfaces\n, which will identify and solve problems related to the integration of photovoltaic systems into buildings. Combining two complementary perspectives, the two projects will bring together developers, engineers, architects, and end-users.\nWe met with the two researchers to discuss what lies ahead.\nTogether, you are responsible for a large portion of the new national research program. What are your objectives? \nChristophe Ballif: \nThe main objective of this program is to develop tomorrow’s solar cell technology. We’ve seen dramatic progress in this field, but we would like to continue pushing the envelope. First, we aim to increase the efficiency of solar panels: we would like to develop a new class of devices that can reach 30% efficiency. Today the limit is close to 25% for terrestrial setups. This will be particularly interesting in Switzerland, as it is a small country and a large portion of its roofs would have to be covered to supply only one fifth of its electricity needs. But the higher the efficiency of the solar panels, the smaller the surface needed. As part of this aim, we will also assess the impact of these future technologies on domestic power production. The second objective will be to incorporate new photovoltaic technologies into the façades of buildings, which would increase the available area.\nEmmanuel Rey: \nOnly a small fraction of photovoltaic potential is currently being exploited in today’s buildings, and we cannot take successful implementation of photovoltaic technologies as a given. Our first mission will be to understand the obstacles and bottlenecks in the way of their integration into buildings. There is a gap between end-user demand and available products, as well as other considerable challenges in terms of their architectural integration.\nTo what extent can we improve existing buildings? \nER:\n One of our goals is, in fact, to better integrate photovoltaic panels in urban renewal projects. Many of today’s buildings will be renovated in the coming decades, and we have to make these renovations coincide with the energy transition. Design and technology have to be closely linked and coupled with social and cultural considerations to ensure that projects incorporate solar technologies harmoniously. This is still largely absent today.\nYou plan on working together closely to combine your expertise in technological development and architectural integration. What do you expect to gain from such a multidisciplinary partnership?\nCB:\n We engineers and manufacturers have made tremendous progress in terms of the fabrication of solar panels and their cost, which is why we are often \nER: \nBy adopting an interdisciplinary and coordinated approach between engineers and architects, we bring together elements from both worlds. One is predominantly focused on efficiency, the other on aesthetics and integration. If we include these new technologies early on, we can transform the project into a form of “raw material” that can help the architecture evolve. The premise is no longer to just attach a solar panel onto a building’s façade; instead, a photovoltaic panel could replace an entire element of it. This qualitative and quantitative challenge forces us to work more closely together as designers and technological experts.\nWhat can be done to further increase the efficiency?\nCB:\n We hope to develop new setups with improved efficiencies by adopting new approaches – specifically, stacking multiple layers of solar cells, each able to absorb a different part of the solar light spectrum. This requires coupling together completely flawless components for which we have yet to develop compatible production procedures. Each layer can also be sensitive to temperature, humidity, or structural flaws, so we are up against a considerable challenge.\nBut it seems that are other aspects that have to be improved as well to continue to develop the industry…\nCB: \nThe potential of photovoltaic technologies is immense. But because their energy production is intermittent, managing it leads, in the short term, to a number of problems that can be overcome by adopting smart grids, dams, or local storage solutions. Then there is the challenge posed by the seasons. But drops in energy production during winter could be mitigated by integrating solar panels directly into building façades. In this case, electricity could still be generated at the levels of the summer months.\nER:\n The challenge is to speed up the transfer of academic research to the people implementing the technologies on the actual construction site. We are planning to model actual projects and submit them to those interested for evaluation. We would like to forge ties between various disciplines to grow a new culture in Switzerland. Getting there will require improving the aesthetic integration of projects and developing the best designs for each element. Today, the technology provides us with panels in a wide range of colors, including white. To meet our objectives, we will have to work on color options, but also on finishing elements, construction details, the size of the modules, and even the texture of the solar panels.\nWhat are the limits of solar power or the technical, social, cultural, or economic challenges that will have to be met? \nER:\n Simply installing solar panels on rooftops can lead to blockages, particularly from municipalities that are, rightly, afraid that their townscapes would be defaced. Integration is therefore essential. That is why our ambition is to develop new paths to achieve both qualitative and quantitative improvements, without losing the identity of our cities.\nCB: \nCommunication between engineers and the other construction-related professionals sometimes just doesn’t exist. Let me cite an example of this that I experienced myself, where we had to remove the all the gravel from a brand-new rooftop just to set up the support structure for solar panels, simply because there had not been enough coordination or effort into the integration during the early stages of the project. Generally, I think that people are still reluctant, for all kinds of reasons – good and bad. But the change will come; buildings with lower energy requirements will all have photovoltaic setups. In the Canton of Vaud, all new buildings are by law required to produce some of the power their residents will consume. So now, all of the trades involved in construction will have to face up to this reality.", "summary": "Fifteen joint research projects have received funding to prepare Switzerland’s energy transition.

{"id": 1330, "text": "In 2014, two researchers produced a detailed map showing the  in Geneva. The map, which revealed parts of the city with a high body mass index (BMI), was compiled by Prof. Idris Guessous, head physician, Department of Primary Care and Emergency Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and associate professor, Department of Community Health and Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva (UNIGE), and by Dr. Stéphane Joost, senior scientist, Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG), EPFL.\nA new study by Prof. Guessous and Dr. Joost, using similar analytical methods and an even larger sample size, demonstrates a significant spatial overlap between weight problems and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The findings reveal that 43% of people residing in neighborhoods with a higher-than-average BMI also live in areas where excess SSB consumption is an issue.\nThe causes of obesity are many and complex, but in recent years a number of international studies have pointed to sugary drinks as one of the culprits behind the growing prevalence of the condition. This body of research has nevertheless sparked intense global debate. The paper published today strengthens the link between SSB consumption and body weight at the local level.\nOver 15,000 participants\nThe paper’s authors analyzed data on 15,767 residents of Geneva Canton between the ages of 20 and 74. The dataset, spanning 1995 to 2014, was compiled as part of the  study by HUG’s Population Epidemiology Unit (UEP), led on behalf of the Geneva State General Directorate of Health t. Each year, 500 men and 500 women – a representative sample of the canton’s population – attended an appointment at the UEP, where they completed a health, exercise and diet survey, had their height and weight measured, and underwent a blood test.\nPrecision spatial analysis\nMost spatial epidemiology studies involve predefined geographical units or zones, such as towns or neighborhoods. In this case, the researchers adopted a different approach, choosing instead to map participants solely by the precise coordinates of their place of residence. They then measured the distance between places of residence and looked for similar patterns of behavior between participants, to produce the maps shown below.\nUsing this precision analysis method, the researchers found that differences in BMI among Geneva’s residents are not randomly distributed. As the maps below reveal, there are areas of the city where BMI is above the canton-wide average of 25. The researchers then used the same method to map SSB consumption. When they compared the two maps, they observed a significant overlap between areas of above-average BMI and excess SSB consumption.\nMore targeted prevention campaigns\nThe study also underscores the importance of targeted public health programs, as recommended by the . For instance, focusing efforts on areas where BMI and SSB consumption are high and tailoring interventions and prevention campaigns to the target audience could potentially deliver better outcomes.\nWhat are sugar-sweetened beverages?\n Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are drinks with added sugar, including soft drinks, flavored juice drinks, sweetened tea and coffee, energy drinks and electrolyte replacement drinks. While SSBs have different sugar contents, some – especially soft drinks – can contain as much as 39 grams per 330 milliliters. SSB consumption has increased steadily in Switzerland and Europe in the past 20 years. The average Swiss person drinks 80 liters a year, below the European average of around 95 liters.\n In addition to contributing to weight gain, SSBs contain high levels of fructose, a substance that can provoke potentially harmful metabolic responses. Excessive fructose intake is associated with increased visceral fat, lipid metabolism disorders and reduced insulin sensitivity.  (see ref. 10 to 16) have also found that even moderate SSB consumption could increase the risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.", "summary": "In a groundbreaking study published today, scientists used precision geospatial analysis techniques to show that obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are more prevalent in some parts of Geneva than others. The study, a collaboration between HUG, EPFL, UNIGE and CHUV, is the first of its kind to establish a link between place of residence, SSB consumption and high body mass index (BMI).", "claim": "In a groundbreaking study published today, scientists used precision geospatial analysis techniques to show that obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are more prevalent in some parts of Geneva than others. The study, a collaboration between HUG, EPFL, UNIGE and CHUV, is the first of their kind to establish a link between place of residence, SSB consumption and high body mass index (BMI).", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [58, 58], "noise": false}

In partnership with the Bühler Group and the Junior Enterprises of EPFL and ETH Zurich, you’re invited to come up with ideas for limiting the losses and waste that occur between the field and consumers. \n A third of the world’s food supply never makes its way into human stomachs. Losses and waste occur all along the production chain, from farms to households. If this situation persists, arable land will not be able to support the 8 billion humans that will populate the Earth by the year 2025.\nThe family-run Bühler Group, a major supplier of food processing solutions, soon to be present in EPFL’s Innovation Park, would like to innovate and re-think the food value chain to solve this pressing problem. At the end of the online Fusebox challenge, the best “ideators” will be invited to company headquarters in Uzwil to participate in a workshop that has a CHF 10,000 prize at stake. Fusebox has given itself a facelift for the occasion, with a more engaging interface. This challenge will be an opportunity to bring EPFL and ETH Zurich together, and because of this the contest will be run in English.\nFrom farm to plate the food chain is long and fraught with difficulties. Conditioning, storage, transport, processing of agricultural commodities into food products, management of the flow between suppliers and consumers via retailers – these are some of the stages on a journey in which innovation is necessary in order to reduce loss. How can storage be improved? Will new information technologies allow us to manage stocks better? How can we re-value losses? How can we reduce the amount of transport needed or encourage more local production and consumption?\nFive times the surface of India\n Losses all along the value chain lead to the disappearance of a third of all the food that is produced agriculturally in the world. According to estimates done by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the amount of arable land needed to produce this food would be five times the size of India.

All this information, and much more, will soon be displayed on the lenses of “augmented” glasses via a mini-projector placed on the frames - and on the condition that you’re also wearing a specially designed pair of contact lenses.\nEPFL scientists in the Laboratory of Photonic Devices are currently working on a prototype that’s similar to the project announced this spring by Google. The applications envisioned for this eagerly awaited invention run the gamut – games, GPS, teaching enhancement, support for the deaf and hard of hearing, and myriad other kinds of augmented reality.\nWith contact lenses\nIn order to finalize a project like this, the team will have to overcome a number of technological challenges, the most formidable of which is finding a way to allow the user to simultaneously see the information displayed on the lenses – which are too close to the eye for it to be able to focus naturally on it – as well as see his or her surroundings. The researchers solved this problem by developing a specially designed contact lens with a micro-lens in its center that allows the eye to focus on the images. “This technology has many advantages,” says professor Christophe Moser. “It provides high-definition, precise images. And unlike other models of the same kind, it conserves the entire field of vision and allows us to use existing eyeglasses design.”\nMost users don’t relish the idea of having to put on contact lenses in addition to wearing a pair of glasses, however. “For the majority of users, it would be possible to make glasses that don’t require the use of contact lenses, but the high definition would be somewhat reduced,” adds Moser.\nHolographic process\nThe Laboratory is working closely with EPFL start-up company Lemoptix, which specializes in miniaturized projection systems, to develop a high definition micro-projector that will blend discreetly into the right arm of the glasses. From this projector, images and information will be sent to the specially treated glasses lens via holography. This is a process in which the light scattered off of an object is recorded and then later reconstructed in 3D in the absence of the object. In the case of augmented glasses, the hologram will be projected on the lenses in such a way that the image is reflected in the direction of the eye, while the lenses still appear transparent. The user thus can still see through the glasses.\nBefore this invention can be commercialized, however, all these technologies must be refined, tested, and put together.

{"id": 1335, "text": "After more than two years of intense preparation, the Swiss team can be proud of the performance of its students. All in all, over 250 students contributed in the design and construction of their solar house called , big winner of the international sustainable housing competition . The 44 solar decathletes surpassed themselves on the competition site in Denver to build and show visitors around their house. «During the construction phase, I was impressed by the team’s determination. It was really hard, we were wet, tired, and cold, but everyone was driven by the project, because deep down, we believed in it.», says Florian Meyer, telecommunications student. The house travelled over 10'000 kilometers through the ocean, rail and road; a perilous route made even more difficult by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Architecture students, Axelle Marchon and Sarah Sauthier, say: «At the beginning we were scared because of the missing container. During the construction phase, we were in survival mode. And finally, regarding the community house concept, we thought we could either make it or completely break it! We started believing in it when the first results were announced. At that moment, the house was up and running, and we said to ourselves that we are really participating in the competition!»\nA risky bet that paid off\nThe NeighborHub, a solar community house, convinced the jury, and was awarded eight contests out of ten - six of them in the first place! One interesting conclusion about the competition is the fact that the juries either loved our unusual concept and granted us awards for it or considered it off-topic and penalized it. As a reminder, the Swiss team made the audacious bet of coming up with a different concept, proposing a house at the service of a community, rather than a family home. Most members of the jury appreciated the boldness of the concept, by granting the first place on the following contests: architecture, water management, health and comfort, home life, energy, and engineering, that is to say, six contests out of ten! The team was awarded the second place in appliances, and the third place in communications.\nThe bet is won, and the Swiss team wins the competition with a solid lead of 50 points. «Such a big gap is rare!», says Linda Silverman, Solar Decathlon 2017 director.\nTeam cohesion, the greatest triumph\nA natural explanation of this great success, would be the synergy and convergence of people from different backgrounds towards a shared goal: architects, engineers, as well as communicators and economists. Joëlle Baehr-Bruyère, civil engineering student says: «Everybody was curious about one another’s disciplines. There was a strong intellectual energy! This dynamic, this emulation, was extremely rewarding».\nThey all looked for and found a common language. That was the greatest challenge during these three years of co-creation : «It took time to put in place a common language, but once we made it, everything started flowing, even though there was over 40 of us working together!», says Marin Thaller, architecture student. «Everybody struggled to make themselves heard and to have a chance to bring what mattered to them in the project. So yes, we all had to make concessions, but now we are all very proud, because the project is consistent, everything is well integrated, and everything’s been pushed to the limit», adds Alexandre Rychner, architecture student.\nValues put to the test\nThis adventure could not have been possible without the expertise provided by the four partner schools (EPFL, HEIA-FR, HEAD and UNIFR), the unfailing support from 48 partners with their expertise and know-how. Students were well aware of their chance to have such generous partners. Marin Thaller, architecture student, explains: «We made powerful connections with our partners, and that may lead to employment.»\nThe strength of the Swiss team consists in its multidisciplinary cohesion; everybody went along with it, regardless of their background. Joëlle Baehr-Bruyère, civil engineering students says: «We worked together, and we succeeded together. We helped and carried each other.» The Swiss team applied the NeighborHub values all the way through by making the sharing element the key of their success.\nThis project also provided the students with a unique, unforgettable, and inspirational learning opportunity.

This center of excellence addresses the clear need for a research platform that can anchor trust in digital technologies.\nWhat will you bring to the ICRC?\n I'll bring my expertise in digital technologies, which are thoroughly and rapidly changing our lives. Digitization affects the ICRC's work in three ways. First, the ICRC – like all organizations – is itself moving into the digital era. Second, the digital needs of those receiving assistance from the ICRC, particularly refugees and prisoners, have become essential in terms of both communication and safety. Finally, although the digital infrastructure is used for civilian purposes and necessary to the work of humanitarian organizations, it can be the target of military or spy attacks.\nWhat is your view on an international framework to protect civilians against misdeeds in cyberspace?\n These days, there's a lot of talk about creating a digital Geneva Convention. But the focus has been on protecting consumers in times of peace – this is what Microsoft President Brad Smith first championed. Let’s not forget that the ICRC is the guardian of the Geneva Conventions, which seek to protect anyone not actively involved in hostilities during conflicts. So intellectuals are engaged in an open debate as to whether, on the one hand, traditional law should be modified to meet the challenges of digitization in times of peace and, on the other hand, whether humanitarian law, which governs relations in wartime, should be updated in the same way. My role in all this is to support the ICRC, in particular by drawing on my connections in the IT industry, where I worked for 15 years.\nEdouard Bugnion in a few dates:\nEdouard Bugnion was born in 1970 and grew up in Neuchâtel and Geneva.

{"id": 1342, "text": "Bikes take up less space and don’t make any noise… and they’re gaining in popularity! For the first time since 2003, when EPFL started to analyze how students and staff get to and from campus, bikes now outnumber cars. 2,489 versus 2,288, to be precise. According to EPFL’s Sustainable Campus team, which conducted and analyzed the 2016 survey, this is a meaningful development that corroborates efforts to promote sustainable transport.\n“In 2014, the number of people using eco-friendly transports was higher than the number of car users,” said Luca Fontana, who handles mobility-related questions on campus. “Now this trend is borne out in absolute figures.” According to the latest study, cycling and walking gained 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively, between 2015 and 2016. The survey had 3,582 respondents – a quarter of all staff and students.\nHigher parking fees in 2016 led to a 1.66% decrease in the number of people who commute to campus by car. “This mainly concerns staff members, since the number of parking spaces for students is extremely limited,” added Fontana.\nPublic transport also saw a decline in use (-0.8%). Rush-hour crowds have something to do with this. As does the construction work on the Renens train station and the fact that inter-city trains no longer stop there. At the same time, the number of people with a public transport pass is falling, especially among those who use several means of transport on a daily basis or as a function of the weather. More than one out of 10 commuters opts for a combination of transports, a solution that offers greater flexibility.\nThis year, for the first time, the Mobility Survey looks at commuter behavior at EPFL's other campuses. These figures now establish a baseline.\n“These results encourage us to further expand the measures we use to support the Mobility Plan,” said Philippe Vollichard, who is in charge of Sustainable Campus. And there certainly is room for improvement. For example, in terms of support for those who use public transport or carpooling: 40% of students said that they could carpool, but only 6% do it. Among staff, 33% of respondents say they could carpool, while only 2.5% actually do.", "summary": "The surprise result of EPFL’s 2016 Mobility Survey is that, for the first time, the campus has more bikes than cars in its parking lots.

{"id": 1343, "text": "Leukemia affects 350,000 people worldwide. It is a cancer of the white blood cells, which are the cells of the immune system and are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow. There are two types of chronic and two types of acute leukemia. One chronic type, chronic myeloid leukemia accounts for ~20% of all cases, and is caused by a mutated enzyme with unregulated activity. This enzyme comes in two sizes, the second of which is associated with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Being the focus of current leukemia treatment, understanding the role of the enzyme is critical. EPFL scientists have now used proteomics to compare the two forms of the enzyme extensively, uncovering a much clearer view of how it may give different forms of leukemia. The work, , opens up possibilities for improved drug development and therapy. \nChronic myeloid leukemia is caused when two chromosomes in bone marrow stem cells swap specific parts. The resulting chromosome is called “Philadelphia”, and now contains a fused gene that produces an abnormal enzyme called Bcr-Abl. \nThis enzyme, which is constantly on, comes into two different sizes, or isoforms: the bigger (p210) is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, while the shorter one (p190) is linked with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a fast-developing form that is very difficult to treat leading to death of patients within a few months. The data on the differences of the two Bcr-Abl isoforms is inconsistent and confusing, meaning that we need more clarity as to its role in the development of this type of cancer. \nThe lab of , in close collaboration with the Proteomics Core Facility at the School of Life Sciences, used a proteomics approach to study the two isoforms of Bcr-Abl. Proteomics is a cutting-edge field that uses mass spectrometry analysis, which enables to map the entire set of proteins of an organism, termed the proteome.\nThe researchers looked at two factors: First, all of the ways each Bcr-Abl isoform interacts with other molecules in the cell, or its “interactome”. This allowed them to map out how the two isoforms work with other molecules.\nSecond, the team looked at the isoforms’ phosphoproteomics. This refers to a modification — phosphorylation— that many proteins, including Bcr-Abl undergo in the cell, whereby they are “turned on” with the addition of a phosphate group. Using mass spectrometry, the researchers were able identify and compare hundreds of phosphorylated proteins in leukemia cells. \nScheme depicting the different signaling networks of the two Bcr-Abl isoforms determined in this study (credit: Sina Maren Reckel/EPFL)\nBy comparing the two, the researchers were able to map out that there are “surprisingly large” differences between the interactome and phosphoproteome of the two isoforms, even though they are both “turned on” in much the same way. These differences in interactions and activation could be related to how each isoform drives an entirely different form of leukemia, and opens up possibilities for targeting Bcr-Abl in more efficient and effective ways to treat the disease. \nThis study involved a collaboration of EPFL’s Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC), its Proteomics Core Facility.

{"id": 1347, "text": "Silke Pan – a former acrobat who lost the use of her legs after a trapeze accident – arrives at the lab in a wheelchair. Using her considerable arm strength, she lifts herself out of the wheelchair and into a small stool, but on which sits a device consisting of two “legs” finely crafted from carbon fiber and aluminum. She carefully places one leg, then the other, inside the device, closes the Velcro fasteners around her feet, locks the fasteners around her thighs and straps the battery pack onto her back. With the help of crutches that provide stability and house the controls for the device, she pulls herself up to her feet. Then, thanks to the device – the latest version of the TWIICE exoskeleton – she starts to walk.\nPan, who is Swiss, became a handcycling champion after her accident. In 2016 she began working with scientists at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory (LSRO) to develop the TWIICE lower-limb exoskeleton that can help paraplegics walk again. Her valuable input allowed the scientists to create a robotic structure that can fully support the weight of a human body and guide the person’s steps. Their TWIICE design won 4\nth\n place at the 2016 Cybathlon in Zurich and took home the gold medal at the 2017 Cybathlon in Dusseldorf.\nA crucial advancement \nIn 2018, two years after the initial exoskeleton was developed, the scientists introduced a new version called TWIICE One. It is narrower and lighter, twice as efficient and most importantly “gives us even greater independence,” says Pan. That’s because patients can now put on and take off the exoskeleton by themselves. This enhanced autonomy is a crucial step forward for Pan, who – even though she almost always has someone by her side for safety reasons – appreciates being able to do things on her own.\nLike the previous version, TWIICE One has two electric motors on each leg that enable patients to move their hip and knee joints. But in the new design the actuators are integrated into the structure, making it less cumbersome and easier to manipulate. The new design also delivers twice as much torque as the old one and is half as voluminous.\nHowever, it weighs the same – 16 kg – and has the same three-hour battery life. A control device in one of the crutches allows patients to choose among three walking speeds and go up and down stairs. “Walking requires less strength, but you still need to concentrate fairly hard to keep your body upright,” says Pan.\nPromising initial trials\nTwo companies have teamed up with EPFL to develop the prototype. “This project with LSRO and the TWIICE research team challenged us to develop powerful yet ultra-compact actuators for moving the exoskeleton,” says Olivier Pajot, Sonceboz Innovation Cell Manager at EPFL’s Innovation Park. “The solution we came up with is integrated into this new version, which Silke tested and which has already delivered promising results in the initial trials.”\n“We’re proud to have been working with EPFL and the TWIICE research team for the past three years now on exoskeleton development,” says Jonathan Brossard, CEO of Fischer Connectors, a manufacturer of high-performance connectors. “This project is particularly important to us because it can improve people’s day-to-day lives. It also shows how we are able to conceive new applications for connectors and develop systems jointly with our customers that can enhance the quality of life of thousands of individuals.”\nA startup and the 2020 Cybathlon\n“Now we need to put our technology to the test and find a way to give more people access to these kinds of walking-assistance systems,” says Mohamed Bouri, head of the research project at LSRO. PhD student Tristan Vouga adds: “We need to test the system’s robustness and strategy, and measure the improvements in patients’ independence and ability to get around on a day-to-day basis.” The scientists also want to enhance the TWIICE user experience, such as with more seamless walking methods and sensors that can detect obstacles in front of a patient.\nThe next step for the research team is to develop and market this technology. They are in the process of creating a startup – also called TWIICE – to produce and sell the exoskeletons, which for now are still being made on a customized basis. The goal is to reach as many people in need of such walking-assistance systems as possible. The project is supported by the NCCR Robotics Spin Fund.

{"id": 1354, "text": "EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab), led by professor Pascal Fua, now has a new tool that makes it possible to follow multiple players at once on a field or court, even when they’re buried under a pile of bodies in a rugby match or crouched behind another player. The athletes are represented on a screen with a superimposed image bearing their jersey color and number, so spectators, referees, and coaches can easily follow individuals without mixing them up. And there’s no need for the players to wear extra gear or RFID chips.\nAt the International Conference on Computer Vision in Barcelona today, Fua and his team describe their method for tracking players continuously from the time they enter the field. The system is made up of eight standard cameras - two on each side of the field or court, two that film from above and two that zoom – and three algorithms. After a tackle, goal, basket, or pileup, the system reattributes the jersey number to each player automati-cally. No more getting lost in the crowd.\nThree algorithms developed by Jerôme Berclaz, Horesh Ben Shitrit, Engin Turetken, and Pascal Fua in collaboration with François Fleuret from Idiap make the system work. The first detects individuals at a specific moment in time, independently of where they were the moment before or after. To do this, it slices the playing area into small 25 cm2 squares, removes the background in all the images simultaneously, and from this deduces the probability of the presence of a player in each of the small squares. The other two al-gorithms connect the results obtained for each moment in order to establish individual trajectories. All three use global optimization methods, resulting in a very robust system capable of tracking people in real time in a reliable manner.\nHoresh Ben Shitrit, a Ph.D. student in the CV Lab, improved on a prototype of the tracker that had been installed in Lausanne’s Olympic Museum. In the process, he and his collaborators have created a marketable tool that can be used for international sporting competitions. A student in the lab is now making final adjustments that will allow television cameras to provide direct input to the system.

But EPFL President Martin Vetterli – as passionate about photography as he is about research – wanted to create something new: a sophisticated book of photographs, or rather photographers, that capture EPFL as it stands today. The result, \nPerspectives on EPFL\n, has just been published by EPFL Press, in association with EPFL and the Musée de l’Elysée. The museum’s director Tatyana Franck chaired the committee that selected the photographers, and subsequently the photographs, for the book.\nFree rein for three photographers\nLeutenegger – originally from Lausanne and winner of the Prix Culturel de la Photographie (awarded by the Fondation Vaudoise pour la Culture) and Swiss Federal Design Awards – takes us behind the scenes for an unorthodox view of scientific research. Konopka, who in 1998 won the second Vevey International Photo Award given by Festival Images, took still-life images of EPFL’s buildings. And Christinat – also from Lausanne – captured the simple, subtle gestures that constitute campus life. Christinat is known for being one of the 28 photographers featured in \nPhoto Suisse\n, an international production by the Swiss broadcasting corporation (SSR SRG Idée Suisse) that included a series of artist documentaries, a book and a travelling exhibition.\nThese three photographers had free rein to depict our School as it is currently and how they see its future. Throughout 2018 they crisscrossed our campus, going behind closed doors and exploring all the angles to capture rare, revealing moments. In addition to the book \nPerspectives on EPFL\n, their work will also be presented in a contemporary exhibition titled \nInfinity Room I.\nInfinity Room I\n: an augmented version of the book\nInfinity Room I\n is inspired by the book as well as the mathematical concept of boundlessness, especially in the context of scientific exploration and innovation at our School. It will be held in the ArtLab building from 12 April to 28 July.\nThe exhibition will invite visitors to experience the three photographers’ works from new perspectives, which spring both from the unique staging developed by Professor Sarah Kenderdine, director of ArtLab and head of EPFL’s Laboratory for Experimental Museology (eM+), and from the visitors themselves. “The idea was not to take the book and put it on the walls, but to augment the book, and to work with each photographer to reframe their images,” explains Kenderdine. “\nInfinity Room I\n opens up the space for interpretation and contextualization in different ways, but the real interpretation resides in the viewer.”\nThree artists, infinite perspectives\nVisitors will enter the exhibition by “walking through” the pages of a giant book. On one side will be displayed Konopka’s black-and-white portraits of EPFL’s iconic buildings from the Lausanne, Fribourg, Neuchâtel, Valais-Wallis and Campus Biotech sites. These photographs will be displayed in the wall-mounted format of traditional photography museums.\nFurther along in the exhibition, visitors will discover Christinat’s images, which capture the energy and emotion of study, research and life at EPFL. To convey the complexity of campus life, his images will be presented on a 30-meter movie screen stretched along the ArtLab’s southwest wall, like a window onto EPFL.\nFor her contribution to the book, Leutenegger ventured inside some of EPFL’s laboratories to capture images – from the digital to the microscopic – that bring EPFL research into focus. To contextualize the complexity of research spaces, she employed augmented reality technology: a panoramic video, spherical gigapixel images that allow visitors to “explore” the labs captured in her photographs, and an augmented animation of a blood sample from Professor Vetterli himself. A walk-in “aquarium” will also provide information on the ethical implications of using animal subjects, such as zebrafish, in scientific research.\nA second part of the exhibition, \nInfinity Room II\n, will open in September. This part will focus on EPFL research, and will feature interactive augmented reality installations and full-dome data visualizations, as well as an image archive in honor of our School’s 50th anniversary.\nPerspectives on EPFL\n, published by EPFL Press, will be available at Librairie La Fontaine starting today and in all bookstores from 23 April.

{"id": 1356, "text": "The city of Berne constitutes a model in terms of public transport and sustainable mobility. It is even an ideal for Lausanne and Geneva. The good news is that both cities are in the right path according to a study performed by the Urban Sociology Laboratory at EPFL and the University Mobility Observatory at UNIGE. The study compared data from 1994 and 2011 showing that Lausanne and Geneva’s active urban groups are no longer reliant on a single mode of transport as they now combine their transportation modes according to their purposes. As a result, car usage has decreased in favor of public transportation, two wheels or even two feet.\n In order to better understand what determines the choice of transportation mode, the researchers focused on three major cities: Geneva, Lausanne and Bern, as well as a smaller town, Yverdon-les-Bains. They based their study on a survey of 2,500 motorized active groups and evaluated the major developments that took place over the last fifteen years.\n The study was led by Vincent Kaufmann (LASUR) and coordinated by EPFL’s Transportation Center. It was financed by the cantons of Vaud and Geneva, the city of Lausanne, the town of Yverdon and Lausanne and Geneva’s Public Transport network.\nPublic transport and two-wheelers are the most popular\n In the 1990s mobility mainly revolved around the use of cars in French-speaking Switzerland. Today, the active groups’ choice depends on their context or purpose. The majority opts for a public transport subscription (PT) and a two-wheeler (motorized or not). However, the disparities among the studied cities are significant: 81% of respondents had PT subscriptions in Berne. In the case of Lausanne they were 55% and in Geneva and Yverdon-les-Bains they were 48%.\n The diversity of this portfolio is explained by the choice of means of transport. \"Fifteen years ago, we would mainly use our cars, a bus from time to time and the bike on Sunday. At present, people are more likely to move by train and public transport and to use their cars on Sundays,\" explained Sébastien Munafò, researcher at LASUR and OUM.\n Car use has been relegated in favor of public transport. In 1994, a third of the people surveyed in Geneva and Lausanne were frequent PT users (more than twice a week) whereas they are almost half at present. \"If the people surveyed in Geneva use PT to go to work almost as frequently as the ones in Berne, at an individual level, the chosen mode of transport is in some cases more of a constraint -more or less accepted- than an actual choice,\" explained Sébastien Munafò.\n Researchers analyzed a number of factors to explain these behavioral changes: the traffic increase, the restrictions in parking choices, the improvement of public transport, federal incentives and all efforts carried out in favor of pedestrians and cyclists... \"The population of the studied cities appears very willing to using other means of transportation than cars. This is an advantage for carrying out policies aimed at developing eco-mobility,\" summarized Vincent Kaufmann.\nA matter of image\n The changes observed are related to means of transport that have themselves too, changed dramatically. Cars are now perceived as polluting and sometimes more harmful than beneficial. The reputation they’ve lost has been public transport’s gain. For example, PT’s positive image has doubled from 30% to 61% in Lausanne. \"The improvement of public transport’s image is unprecedented,\" said Christian Liaudat, in charge of mobility projects at the State of Vaud. He sees the construction of the M2 metro line combined with a better RER offer as the reason behind this increase in popularity. In Geneva, the image of public transport has also improved from 39% to 52% positive perceptions.\n The study’s recommendations confirm the strategy proposed by the Canton of Geneva, says Damien Cataldi, engineer on analysis and mobility projects at the Directorate-General for Mobility in Geneva. \"The \"Mobility 2030\" strategy pursued by the canton on Geneva aims at facilitating the practice of multimodality and in fact responds to the changes in people’s observed behavior.\"\n For its part, Lausanne is required to \"avoid a two-tier development of public transport as all of its areas are not equally equipped, and to \"reduce the parking availability at work.\" In the case of Yverdon-les-Bains, it is a fast growing town and its inhabitants are still quite attached to using their cars. Its strategy should \"bet on soft mobility for travelling within the city.\"\nThe study and a synthesis of \"Typology and evolution of modal choices logics behind motorized urban groups” are available, in French, at:", "summary": "A study carried out by EPFL and UNIGE and conducted in Lausanne, Geneva, Bern and Yverdon-les-Bains reports the way active urban groups have greatly diversified their modes of travel over the past two decades.", "claim": "A study carried out by EPFL and UNIGE and conducted in Lausanne, Geneva, Bern and Yverdon-les-Bains reports the way active urban groups have greatly diversified your modes of travel over the past two decades.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [31, 31], "noise": false}

To simulate extreme environments like the Moon, their prototypes and experimental designs were to be installed on Mount Pilatus and piloted from a control room at the Swiss Museum of Transport.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, however, forced the team to rethink the event. “We were caught off guard and had to learn as a group how to organize a virtual campaign,” says Benavides. She and her team provided support for participants as things changed, giving them advice and tips for their presentations.\nThe new format, however, had a silver lining: the online presentations not only allowed everyone to take part, but also fostered greater student involvement. “In 2019, due to time constraints and the distance between the two campaign sites in Zermatt, some people were unable to see the other projects,” says Eva Buchs, IGLUNA communications officer. “This year, the teams could connect via YouTube live chat and see what everyone else was up to!”\nOutstanding results \nEach team was given one hour to present its project to the general public as well as aerospace professionals. The  team from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences unveiled its system for growing plants without soil, a technique known as hydroponics, or soilless culture. The students used human waste to provide plants with necessary nutrients, while a closed loop ensured that water was used sustainably. They developed customizable LED lighting and created an environment conducive to plant growth, all of which is monitored by sensors and controlled by an intelligent system.\n“We believe the time has come to reuse satellites, in the same way as rockets,” says Mayank, head of the  project. At the Technical University of Berlin, Mayank and his team have been developing their own antennae and satellites fitted with a communication system that is operable in space and that can be remotely reconfigured for various missions.\nIs there life in outer space? To find out, the  team from the University of Bern has been working on ORIGIN, a compact, lightweight and easy-to-use instrument that detects biosignatures and performs chemical analyses of planetary surfaces. The team also built the rover that will carry ORIGIN and installed a cryogenic cooling system on the device to simulate the extreme conditions of space.\nRounding out the 2020 edition, three teams were honored during the IGLUNA Space Awards ceremony. ,  and  distinguished themselves by the excellence of their accompanying documentation, their ability to find sponsoring, their team spirit, the structure of their presentations and their involvement across the ten days of the campaign.\nBack to the future\n“Students take part in IGLUNA not only for the experience, but also with an eye to their own future,” says Benavides. “There is the educational side, as well as a chance to network with aerospace professionals, and lastly, technology transfer.” For example, the Celestial team just launched a startup, and  (now an EPFL association) has been fine-tuning its prototype – a robot that grows and harvests plants automatically and without human intervention – since last year.\nIGLUNA 2021 will be even more demanding, with an expanded “business” component. The Swiss Space Center is currently reviewing applications and will announce the list of participants in mid-August.", "summary": "Due to the ongoing health crisis, the 15 international teams taking part in IGLUNA 2020 had to forget this year’s field campaign.

Given the drastic reduction on the cost of DNA analysis, it may even be possible before long to know each person’s predisposition to certain diseases, allergies, and food intolerances. Riding on this wave in medicine, Jurgi Camblong, Pierre Hutter and Lars Steinmetz have founded a start-up to securely store this data, which promises to be considerable (one genome contains 3 billion letters or nucleotides!). Reading the data will be made easier with new software.\nLaunched in September 2012, this new bioinformatics tool is already being used by a dozen hospitals and laboratories in Switzerland.

{"id": 1361, "text": "“For nearly 100 years, scientists have been trying to name cells. They have been describing them in the same way that Darwin described animals and trees. Now the Blue Brain Project has developed a mathematical algorithm to objectively classify the shapes of the neurons in the brain,” explains Professor Henry Markram, Blue Brain’s Founder and Director. “This will allow the development of a standardized taxonomy [classification of cells into distinct groups] of all cells in the brain, which will help researchers compare their data in a more reliable manner.”\nThe team, with lead scientist Lida Kanari, have developed an algorithm to distinguish the different shapes of the most common type of neuron in the neocortex – the pyramidal cells. Pyramidal cells are distinctively tree-like cells that make up 80% of the neurons in the neocortex and, like antennas, collect information from other neurons in the brain. Basically, they are the redwoods of the forests of trees in the brain. They are excitatory, sending waves of electrical activity through the network, as we perceive, act, and feel. \nThe father of modern neuroscience, Ramón y Cajal, first drew pyramidal cells over 100 years ago, by looking at them under a microscope. Yet, up until now, scientists have not reached a consensus on the types of pyramidal neurons. Anatomists have been assigning names and debating the different types for the past century, while neuroscience has been unable to tell for sure which types of neurons are subjectively characterized. Even for visibly distinguishable neurons, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types.\nSeventeen types of pyramidal cells\nThe study from Blue Brain proves for the first time that objective classification of these pyramidal cells is possible, by applying tools from algebraic topology, the branch of mathematics that studies the shape, connectivity, and the emergence of global structure from local constraints.\nBlue Brain has pioneered the use of algebraic topology to tackle a wide range of neuroscience problems, and with this study has once again demonstrated its effectiveness. In collaboration with Professors Kathryn Hess at EPFL and Ran Levi from the University of Aberdeen, Blue Brain developed an algorithm, which they then used to objectively classify seventeen types of pyramidal cells in the rat somatosensory cortex. The topological classification does not require expert input, and is proven to be robust.\nThe structure of most neurons resembles a complex tree, with multiple branches connecting to other neurons and communicating via electrical signals. If we keep the longest (persistent) components of the neuron structure and decompose the smaller branches, we can transform its tree-like structure into a barcode – a mathematical object that can be used as input for any machine-learning algorithm that will classify the neurons into distinct groups.\n“Species” of brain cells\nAny neuron classification process is plagued by this question: are two cells that look different just part of a continuum of gradually changing differences (like different “strains” of a species, e.g. different types of dogs) or are they really different “species” of neurons (e.g. dogs, cats, elephants, etc.)? In other words, are they discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other? This can be answered by using the new topological classification and grouping the different “species” of brain cells, each with its own characteristic “strains”.\n“The Blue Brain Project is digitally reconstructing and simulating the brain, and this research provides one of the solid foundations needed to put all the types of neurons together,” explains Kanari. “By removing the ambiguity of cell types, the process of identifying the morphological type of new cells will become fully automated.”\nThis breakthrough can benefit the entire neuroscience community, as it will provide a more sophisticated understanding of cell taxonomy, and a reliable comparative method. The objective definition of morphological types is an essential first step towards a better understanding of the brain’s basic building blocks: how their structure is related to their function, and how local properties of neurons are connected to their long-range projections. This method provides a universal descriptor of trees, meaning that it can be used for the consistent description of all cell types in the brain, including neurons of all brain regions and glia cells.", "summary": "In a front-cover paper published in Cerebral Cortex, EPFL’s Blue Brain Project, a Swiss Brain Research Initiative, explains how the shapes of neurons can be classified using mathematical methods from the field of algebraic topology.

{"id": 1364, "text": "Growth continues in the student numbers enrolled at EPFL. The new academic year started last Tuesday in the atmosphere of a heartening increase in the number of enrollments for the fourth consecutive year—a record. Across all the study courses, the new enrollments recorded on September 9th are 9.5% higher than for the same period in 2010. Because of inevitable withdrawals resulting from multiple enrollments or accommodation problems, particularly acute this year, the final figures will not be established till the end of October.\nThe provisional figures show that 1467 new students, 28% of whom are women, have been accepted on to one of the Bachelor’s courses.\n In parallel, 296 students (+11%) coming from other institutions or the higher education college (HES) pathway, 30% of whom are women, will begin a Master’s course at EPFL. There they will rub shoulders with the 636 students who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree at EPFL this summer and are continuing their program of studies here.\nAll these newcomers to the lecture-halls are joining students who are following a continuous program at EPFL. Their total for the academic year 2011–2012, allowing for probable disenrollments, will exceed 8000 students (an increase of around 10% on the final figures for last year). The Bachelor’s students will increase by around 10%, those on Master’s courses between 10% and 20% and, finally, there will be 5% to 10% more doctoral candidates than in 2010–2011.\nAn increase in almost all the courses\nAlmost all the Bachelor’s courses are anticipating an increase in their student numbers. At this stage of enrollments, it’s mainly courses in civil engineering (+67 students, +75% on the final figures for 2010), mathematics (+29 students, +38%) and mechanical engineering (+32 students, +30%) that account for the increase in the number of new faces that will be seen at EPFL this year.\nAt the Master’s level, despite the risks of making comparisons given the small numbers, there is evidence of a strong attraction for students from outside EPFL to the computer science section (+21 students, +48.8%). The College of Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship also has a full house, with 25 new students enrolled (+400%). Finally this year 20 students, 17 of whom are from other institutions, are starting the new Masters in Energy Management and Sustainability, which they will partly attend at EPFL Middle East in Ras Al Khaimah (United Arab Emirates).\nWorking in small groups is becoming standard in the first year\nThe students who are starting at EPFL this year will benefit substantially from an innovative educational system specific to this institution: the “tutorial” principle, designed to reinforce the supervision of exercise sessions in the analysis and physics lessons. In this system, a group of eight students is presented with exercises to solve under supervision of a “tutor” recruited from the more advanced students. The emphasis is on problem solving, which the participants debate together. “This system, which we tested out four years ago, has proved its merits”, states Nadine Stainier, Teaching Advisor for Pedagogical Research and Support (CRAFT). It gives the students the opportunity to be much more active in seeking solutions and teaches them to argue their standpoint with their colleagues. It helps them to build their network and to integrate into the academic community.’\nAnother new feature is the requirement for Master’s students on engineering courses to carry out a minimum of eight weeks’ work experience in a company to obtain their diploma. This means they are confronted very early on with the realities of the working world.\nThese two examples demonstrate EPFL’s dynamism also in terms of its primary mission, teaching. They occur in the context of a major review that will ultimately lead to a fundamental reorganization in Bachelor’s courses.

{"id": 1365, "text": "Viruses multiply by injecting their DNA into a host cell. Once it enters the intracellular fluid, this foreign material triggers a defense mechanism known as the cGAS-STING pathway. The protein cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS), which is also found inside the fluid, binds to the invading DNA to create a new molecule. This, in turn, binds to another protein called Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), which induces an inflammatory immune response.\nSometimes, the material contained inside the fluid – and in contact with the cGAS protein – comes not from a virus but from the cell itself, for instance after the nucleus has accidentally ruptured. When this happens, the cGAS-STING pathway isn’t activated. Scientists at EPFL have demonstrated how cells are able to respond differently to their own DNA and to genetic material from a pathogen – and avoid attacking the wrong target. Their discovery, published in a paper in the journal \nScience\n, sheds new light on the complex processes at work in the body’s inflammatory response.\nThe team, led by Prof. Andrea Ablasser and working with colleagues from the laboratories of Prof. Beat Fierz and Prof. Selman Sakar, uncovered new insights into the key role of a small protein known as Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF). They showed that, by binding to the inoffensive DNA, BAF prevents the cGAS protein from doing the same, thereby stopping the cGAS-STING pathway in its tracks.\nBAF strengthens the cell nucleus, connecting the nuclear envelope (or membrane) to the DNA inside. Experiments have shown that when this protein is removed from lab-grown cells, the nucleus ruptures. This breach releases the genetic material into the intracellular fluid, where it comes into contact with the cGAS protein and triggers the cGAS-STING pathway – just as if it were foreign DNA.\nThere are various ways to cause a nucleus to rupture, such as by applying mechanical pressure. But according to Baptiste Guey, one of the paper’s lead authors, only one of these methods – removing the BAF protein – induces an immune response. “We can therefore conclude that BAF plays a key role in preventing the cell from attacking its own DNA,” says Guey.\nThe protein’s inhibitor role is vitally important: although the cGAS-STING pathway helps the body fight off infections, it also needs to be kept in check. “Nuclei do occasionally rupture, but cells are able to repair the damage,” says Marilena Wischnewski, another lead author of the paper. “If cGAS bound to the DNA every time that happened, the consequences would be more serious.”\nThe dangers of an overactive cGAS-STING pathway can be seen in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome: a rare and usually fatal genetic disorder that induces an excessive inflammatory response as if the body’s cells were under constant attack from invading pathogens.\nBAF is also believed to play a role in some types of tumor. According to Wischnewski, a high concentration of the protein in cancer cells may be associated with a poorer prognosis. “It could be that BAF makes tumors more resistant,” she explains. “By preventing activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, it might allow cancer cells to evade the body’s immune system.”\nThe protein is found in varying quantities in different types of cells. The team is planning to dig deeper into these variations as they seek to understand how different tissue types respond to infection and inflammation.", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have demonstrated the mechanism that allows cells to fight off viral DNA without triggering an immune response against their own genetic material.", "claim": "Scientists at EPFL have demonstrated the mechanism that allows cells to fight off viral DNA without triggering an immune response against my own genetic material.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [21, 21], "noise": false}
{"id": 1368, "text": "Motivated by extraordinary requirements for neuroscience, IBM Research, EPFL, and ETH Zürich through the Swiss National Supercomputing Center CSCS, are exploring how to combine different types of memory – DRAM, which is standard for computer memory, and flash memory that is akin to USB sticks – for less expensive and optimal supercomputing performance.\nThe Blue Brain Project, for example, is building detailed models of the rodent brain based on vast amounts of information – incorporating experimental data and a large number of parameters – to describe each and every neuron and how they connect to each other. The building blocks of the simulation consist of realistic representations of individual neurons, including characteristics like shape, size, and electrical behavior.\nGiven the roughly 70 million neurons in the brain of a mouse, a huge amount of data needs to be accessed for the simulation to run efficiently.\n“Data-intensive research has supercomputer requirements that go well beyond high computational power,” says EPFL professor Felix Schürmann of the Blue Brain Project in Lausanne. “Here, we investigate different types of memory and how it is used, which is crucial to build detailed models of the brain. But the applications for this technology are much broader.”\n70 Million Neurons for the New IBM Blue Gene/Q\nThe Blue Brain Project has acquired a new IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer to be installed at CSCS in Lugano, Switzerland. This machine has four times the memory of the supercomputer used by the Blue Brain Project up to now, but this still may not be enough to model the mouse brain at the desired level of detail.\nThe challenge for scientists is to modify the supercomputer so that it can model not only more neurons—as many as the 70 million in the mouse brain—but with even more detail while using fewer resources. The researchers aspire to do just that by engineering different types of memory. The Blue Gene/Q comes equipped with 64 terabytes of DRAM memory. But this type of memory, which is ubiquitous in personal computers, loses data almost instantaneously when the power is turned off.\nThe scientists plan to boost the supercomputer’s capacity by combining DRAM with another type of memory that has made its way into everyday devices, from cameras to mobile phones: flash memory. Unlike DRAM, flash memory can retain information, even without power, and is much more affordable. The Blue Brain Project’s new supercomputer efficiently integrates 128 terabytes of flash memory with the 64 terabytes of DRAM memory.\n“These technological advancements will not only help scientists model the brain, but they will also contribute to future evidence-based systems,” says IBM Research computational scientist Alessandro Curioni, who is based in Zurich.\nTo take full advantage of this novel mix of memory, IBM has been developing a scalable memory system architecture, while EPFL and ETH Zürich researchers are working on high-level software to optimize this hybrid memory for large-scale simulations and interactive supercomputing.\n“The resulting machine may not necessarily be the fastest supercomputer in the world, but it will certainly open up new avenues for data-intensive science,” says ETH Zürich professor and CSCS director Thomas Schulthess. “The results of this collaboration will support scientific investigations across all types of data intensive applications including astronomy, geosciences and healthcare.”\nTowards the Human Brain\nThe Blue Brain Project has recently become the core of an even more ambitious project, the European Flagship Human Brain Project, also coordinated by EPFL. The Human Brain Project faces the daunting task of providing the technical tools to integrate as much data as possible into detailed models of the human brain by 2023. Estimated at 90 billion neurons, the human brain compared to that of a mouse contains roughly a thousand times more neurons. The new strategy to use hybrid memory is an important step towards helping the Human Brain Project meet its 10-year goal.\nAs it goes with research and innovation, a scientific pursuit is pushing the boundaries of technology, leading to new and more powerful tools. The Blue Brain and Human Brain Projects have brought into perspective the need to deal with complex and unusual calculations, requiring supercomputer technology where speed\n is simply not enough.", "summary": "To handle large amounts of data from detailed brain models, IBM, EPFL, and ETH Zürich are collaborating on a new hybrid memory strategy for supercomputers.

{"id": 1370, "text": "Imagine reaching the Moon using just a fraction of a liter of fuel. With their ionic motor, MicroThrust, EPFL scientists and their European partners are making this a reality and ushering in a new era of low-cost space exploration. The complete thruster weighs just a few hundred grams and is specifically designed to propel small (1-100 kg) satellites, which it enables to change orbit around the Earth and even voyage to more distant destinations – functions typically possible only for large, expensive spacecraft. The just-released prototype is to be employed on CleanSpace One, a satellite under development at EPFL that is designed to clean up space debris, and on OLFAR, a swarm of Dutch nanosatellites that will record ultra-low radio-frequency signals on the far side of the Moon.\nThe motor, designed to be mounted on satellites as small as 10x10x10 cm3, is extremely compact but highly efficient. The prototype weighs only about 200 grams, including the fuel and control electronics.\n“At the moment, nanosatellites are stuck in their orbits. Our goal is to set them free,” explains Herbert Shea, coordinator of the European MicroThrust project and director of EPFL’s Microsystems for Space Technologies Laboratory.\nSmall satellites are all the rage right now because their manufacturing and launch costs are relatively low – about half a million dollars, compared to conventional satellites that run into the hundreds of millions. But nanosatellites currently lack an efficient propulsion system that would render them truly autonomous and thus able to carry out exploration or observation missions.\nA motor that doesn’t burn fuel\n Instead of a combustible fuel, the new mini motor runs on an “ionic” liquid, in this case the chemical compound EMI-BF4, which is used as a solvent and an electrolyte. It is composed of electrically charged molecules (like ordinary table salt) called ions, except that this compound is liquid at room temperature. The ions are extracted from the liquid and then ejected by means of an electric field to generate thrust. This is the principle behind the ionic motor: fuel is not burned, it is expelled.\nIn the motor developed at EPFL, the flow of ions is emitted from an array of tiny silicon nozzles – over 1,000 per square centimeter. The fuel is first guided by capillary action from a reservoir to the extremity of the micro-nozzles, where the ions are then extracted by an electrode held at 1,000 volts, accelerated, and finally emitted out the back of the satellite. The polarity of the electric field is reversed every second, so that all the ions – positive and negative – are ejected.\nSystematIC Design, a MicroThrust project partner, designed the motor’s electrical system. The ion ejection system requires a high electrical voltage, but the available energy aboard a 1-liter nanosatellite is limited to a few small solar cells – in practice, about four watts of power. The Dutch company was able to develop a system that overcame this difficulty.\nCruising speed: 40,000 km per hour\n After six months of acceleration, the microsatellite’s speed increases from 24,000 km/h, its launch speed, to 42,000 km/h. The acceleration is only about a tenth of a millimeter per square second, which translates into 0-100 km/h in 77 hours. But in space, where there is no friction to impede motion, gentle but steady acceleration is the way to go.\nThe ionic motor will power CleanSpace One – a nanosatellite whose mission is to tidy up space by grabbing space debris and pulling it into the Earth’s atmosphere to be safely incinerated. According to the Swiss Space Center, CleanSpace One will take two to three months and more than 1,000 terrestrial revolutions to reach one of its targets, the decommissioned Swisscube cubesat or Tlsat-1 cubesat. Scientists have just over a year to finalize their system.\nResearchers have a bit more than a year to finalize the ionic motor.

He came from Jura Canton every week to share his passion with the younger generation.\n\"We'll see you all at the start of 2022 academic year!\" joked Martin Vetterli to the 200 9-to-13 year olds who quite possibly discovered a new passion or a future career during the sessions. And even if they didn't, the workshops will have taught them new skills that they won't get to learn at school. So, mission accomplished. The ceremony was followed by a \"science discovery day,\" with the children and their parents coming from Jura Canton by bus to learn more about various scientific experiments.\nThe Science Outreach Department organizes other courses, camps and workshops for young children and teenagers. They are given across French-speaking Switzerland and aim to promote science and technology among young people, whetting their appetite for science early on in life.

{"id": 1374, "text": "Flocks of birds, schools of fish, and groups of any other living organisms might have a mathematical function in common. Studying aquatic microorganisms, Andrea Giometto, a researcher EPFL and Eawag, showed that for each species he studied, body sizes were distributed according to the same mathematical expression, where the only unknown is the average size of the species in an ecosystem.  was published in PNAS in March 2013.\nSeveral observations suggest that the size distribution function could be universal. Giometto made his observations in the lab on 14 species of aquatic microorganisms, including unicellular and multicellular ones that are very distant from an evolutionary point of view. The microorganisms he studied varied by four orders of magnitude, the difference in size between a mouse and an elephant.\nFurthermore, the mathematical function describing the size distribution remained unchanged even when the species adapted to new environments - changes in water temperature, the presence or absence of competitors - by changing their average size.\nBased on these observations, Giometto and his collaborators suggest that two separate factors work in tandem to shape the size distribution of a species. First, environmental factors influence the average size of a species. Second, physiological factors, or genetics, cause the observed variability of species sizes around the average size.\nFrom species to communities\nSo far the focus has been on the size distribution of individuals of a single species. But Giometto’s findings become particularly interesting in light of an observation that is well known to ecologists. “If you take a cup of water from the sea and analyze all of the microorganisms it contains, you find that in an ecological community no size tends to be over or underrepresented,” says Andrea Giometto. Mathematically, the sizes can be described by a power-law distribution. \n Taken together, these observations of size distributions within a species and within all the species in a given ecological community have interesting implications. If in an ecosystem several species begin to converge around the same size, a balancing force will kick in to restore the power-law distribution, either by acting on the abundance or size of each species.\nIf, as Giometto and his co-authors speculate, their observations are valid beyond the species they studied, they may provide additional evidence for the existence of universal laws that govern natural ecosystems. These laws would regulate not only the size and abundance of organisms in an ecosystem, but also other properties, such as the number of species that co-exist.\nFinding power-laws and using them to describe complex systems already has a successful track record. “In physics, the observation that systems followed power-laws was instrumental in understanding phase transitions. We believe that power-laws can be similarly helpful to gain a deeper understanding of how systems of living matter work,” says Giometto, a physicist, who is seeking to apply methods from his field to understand biological ecosystems.", "summary": "Researchers discovered what might be a universal property of size distributions in living systems.

{"id": 1377, "text": "Tracking individuals in a large group, be they ants or humans, is no trivial task. By applying statistics to mobile phone signals picked up in a large crowd, Master’s student Elisaveta Kondratieva developed a way to more accurately follow and understand the behavior of the individuals that make up the crowd, revealing the potential and the pitfalls of this new approach. For her semester project, she evaluated an extensive dataset gathered at the 2010 Paléo music festival in a campaign entirely planned and carried out by researchers in the research groups of Patrick Thiran and Martin Vetterli in collaboration with Olivier Dousse at Nokia.\nEvery year, the Paléo music festival attracts well over 40,000 music aficionados per day. Many carry mobile phones with activated bluetooth devices. In 2010, ten “agents” were part of the crowd, equipped with special mobile phones programmed to pick up and store the identity of all detectable bluetooth devices in their vicinity. The data they gathered provides a list of all of the detectable bluetooth devices surrounding each of the walking agents at any given time throughout the evening.\nOften, these data are not enough to discriminate between different nearby locations. Were the detected individuals at the Asian food stall, the stand right next to it, or were they on the way to their next concert? Detecting the presence of bluetooth signals narrows down the position of the mobile phone that emits it, and that of its owner, to a radius around 10 to 20 meters around the agent. The inaccuracy of the agent’s GPS adds up to 10 more meters of uncertainty. Furthermore, many devices were only detected a handful of times in the course of the evening.\nThis is where statistics come in handy. “Using an approach based on Bayesian statistics, that is by taking into account certain pieces of available information, the accuracy of the outcome can be improved,” she says. Concert schedules, a detailed map of the festival grounds, and other sources of information can help fill in the gaps between separate detections and provide likely estimates of the exact locations of the individuals.\nFor such an approach to work, a significant fraction of the audience have to have their bluetooth devices set to be detectable. Fortunately, this turned out to be the case: fixed detectors at the entrance to the festival  - just over 8% of the 40,500 people that attended the festival that day.\nThe quality of the results depends largely on how effectively the agents fan out across the festival grounds. “Two of our agents basically spent the entire evening at the festival together,” says the student, “so the data they obtained overlapped. Also, none of our agents ever went to one of the more remote stages.” To fix these loopholes, future campaigns could involve a larger number of fixed detectors and mobile agents. Additionally, a similar approach could be adopted to follow individuals using their WiFi signals.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES (4) - For her semester project, an EPFL Master’s student applied a different approach to tracking the flow of the crowds at the Paléo music festival – using cell phone data and statistics.", "claim": "SUMMER SERIES (4) - For our semester project, an EPFL Master’s student applied a different approach to tracking the flow of the crowds at the Paléo music festival – using cell phone data and statistics.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [8, 8], "noise": false}

They will participate in the \nACE Maritime University\n, a 25-day voyage that will bring them to Cape Town, South Africa. The aim of this initiative, organized under the auspices of the Russian Geographical Society, is to give Master’s and early PhD students with an interest in the natural and marine sciences the opportunity to expand their knowledge and work on interdisciplinary projects.\nFollowing this transit voyage, the ship will head off on the \nAntarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE)\n. This major expedition was organized by the EPFL-based Swiss Polar Institute, which is set to leave Cape Town on 20 December. Some 50 researchers from 30 different countries will take over from the students on a three-month circumnavigation of Antarctica. They will conduct 22 research projects during this voyage. The projects will touch on a wide range of fields, such as glaciology, climatology, biology and oceanography, and the overall aim is to measure and quantify the impact of climate change and pollution in the Southern Ocean.\nA demanding program\nThe \nACE Maritime University \nwill be anything but a pleasure cruise. Every morning, the students will take intensive classes followed by practicals on deck in the afternoon. The students, grouped by area of interest, will become familiar with handling and calibrating basic instruments in oceanographic, atmospheric and biological analysis. They will also learn about trawling for samples and analyzing the data that they collect. In addition, each of the students will work on an individual project, choosing a topic related to the research being carried out on the ship. In the evening, the participants will gather to present and discuss their work.\nAll these activities will be run under the guidance of some 15 researchers, who will remain on board for the ACE expedition, and three coordinators. Manon Fruschti, a laboratory technician in EPFL’s Environmental Microbiology Laboratory, is one of the coordinators. “The program will be demanding and our schedule will be packed, but there will also be the challenge of being at sea, which means living in a compartmentalized space, far from loved ones, and in constant motion,” says Fruschti, who already has several marine expeditions under her belt. The coordinators will have to deal with whatever problems arise, including seasickness, which will affect many participants, and homesickness.\n“For me, it’s really an extraordinary opportunity in terms of practical experience, contacts and multidisciplinary work.” Oriane Etter is one of six Swiss students who were selected for the Maritime University, and the only one from EPFL.

Students from the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences and HEC Lausanne of the University of Lausanne (), and the Lausanne School of Art and Design () also participated.\nWith their diverse backgrounds, the volunteers formed four groups that each included a designer, an engineer, an economist, and a social scientist. Over the school holiday from February 1-13, each group used a bottom-up design approach to develop and field-test four sustainable  to energy and housing challenges in Bangalore – one of India’s fastest-growing cities.\n“This first experience in social entrepreneurship altered my perspectives, and creating social impact will have strong priority in my future activities,” says Jelena Dolecek, a master’s student in materials science and engineering at EPFL who worked on the  project. “The development of solutions was very interesting because our interdisciplinary backgrounds highlighted different problems and thus solution approaches, which gave rise to intense and inspiring discussions.”\nHEC Lausanne student Yasmine Benkirane, who worked on the  prototype, said: “This experience was by far the most enriching that I’ve had in every respect thanks to a total immersion in Indian culture, intense work on an exciting subject, and unforgettable encounters. We were in the shoes of a social entrepreneur, who identifies needs by going into the field to design a prototype solution. This allowed me to develop a new perspective, and especially “Jugaad” – a term taken from Hindi that means approaching a problem using limited resources in an innovative way.”\nEducation innovation\nINSSINC’s organizers emphasize that the prototypes – which also included a  and a  – are innovative tools, but not necessarily the program’s final product.\n“At the end of the day we are developing different educational formats and innovating on that level,” says Marc Laperrouza, a researcher and lecturer in the EPFL  (CDH).\n“This is a learning experience, and the topic of this learning experience is social innovation,” adds Marius Aeberli, head of education at the EPFL + ECAL Lab.\nFor the past five years, Laperrouza has been leading the CDH  (CHIC) – a similar educational initiative in which student projects focus on developing connected devices. While the theme changes, for both CHIC and INSSINC the ultimate goal is to explore new problem-solving and pedagogical approaches in different cultural contexts.\nCurrently, Laperrouza and his colleagues are documenting and analyzing the educational outcomes of the INSSINC pilot via student evaluations, in collaboration with UNIL. He says that in light of its success thus far, there are plans to continue the program, potentially in other countries.\nSwiss-Indian partnership\nINSSINC is a collaboration with a local partner in India, the , which works to bring sustainable energy solutions to under-served communities. The program is also made possible thanks to funding from the Canton of Vaud, as well as collaborations with  and the EPFL Vice Presidency for Innovation (VPI)  program.\n“From the students’ points of view, I saw first-hand how empathy was key to understanding the context in which they were operating, and to understanding how best to design prototypes and solutions by eliminating assumptions. Moreover, from SELCO’s perspective, I observed that the co-creation process with EPFL students greatly contributed to helping them understand the communities in a more holistic manner,” observes Tech4Impact project collaborator Beatrice Scarioni.\nAeberli also emphasizes that at both the student and partner level, the process of developing the prototypes is one of the program’s most valuable aspects.\n“The sweet spot is reaching our learning objectives and creating value for the partners. The prototypes allowed us to develop a more sustainable relationship with SELCO by exchanging knowledge, and by bringing fresh perspectives to problems through discussions with our students,” he says.\nDesigning innovative learning experiences \n The INSSINC pilot program and China Hardware Innovation Camp are part of a wider initiative that also integrates several courses in the EPFL College of Humanities  (SHS) program. This initiative, summarized below, aims to design new learning experiences and explore different teaching formats.\nInterdisciplinarity\n: Students from different disciplines, universities, and countries work together. In mixed teams, students from engineering, design, and social sciences experience how different perspectives, strengths, and tensions can be beneficial in grasping volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous realities.\nA project-based approach, in the field, with real life applications\n: Students are encouraged to always keep reality in mind. Partners (investors, companies, NGOs and other organizations) provide briefs, problem statements, reality checks and feedback. Students must test their ideas, pitch, make a live demo or even negotiate. They are encouraged to consider their project from an end-to-end perspective, from problem scoping to implementation.\nHuman-centered design\n: Students are incentivized to alter their points of view to create through the eyes of someone else. Using designers’ research methods, students are asked to observe contexts, question people and exercise empathy. Their assumptions are challenged, pushing them to reframe problems and opportunities.\nPossibility to fail\n: An environment is created to make failure acceptable and productive. This requires building trust, psychological safety, and providing students with formative feedback.

Their project, which has been awarded CHF 650,000, aims to gain insight into the causes and effects of an overactive innate immune system in people with autoimmune diseases. The team’s research will initially focus on three autoimmune skin diseases: psoriasis, lupus and scleroderma. The team then hopes to use its findings to develop new therapies for a wider range of autoimmune disorders, including chronic inflammatory diseases affecting other organs as well as neurodegenerative diseases.\nOur innate immune system plays an essential role in protecting us against infections. It’s designed to keep intruders at bay and can recognize a range of molecules that don’t belong in our bodies, like the DNA of viruses and bacteria. The research conducted by Prof. Ablasser focuses on these fast-reacting defense mechanisms and what happens when they are triggered by mistake. When an intruder’s molecules are very similar to our own, our innate immune system can attack our own molecules by accident, causing perfectly healthy tissue to become inflamed and even self-destruct.\nAssessing therapeutic potential\nA world-renowned expert, Prof. Ablasser already made a major breakthrough in her earlier research: she discovered the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, which contains two molecules that act together to trigger particularly strong inflammatory reactions against viruses in the body. Prof. Ablasser and her team then went in search of a molecule that could block this process and found a substance capable of eliminating one of the molecules making up the signaling pathway. “We’re now looking at the therapeutic potential of this inhibitor in different pathological models, including autoimmune diseases,” she explains.\nThe prize-winning project will involve three main phases. In the initial phase, the aim is to gain more insight into the causes and effects of our innate immune system’s intrinsic hyperactivity, which is responsible for autoimmune diseases. The researchers will then test the physiopathological hypotheses resulting from the initial lab phase and develop new therapeutic strategies based on human tissue models. Finally, the team will test the beneficial effects of new STING-system inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, so that they can then be applied therapeutically.\nHope for other diseases\nBoth researchers hope that the results obtained from their models, like that for psoriasis, will help to improve therapies for a large number of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and even Parkinson’s disease.", "summary": "EPFL Professor Andrea Ablasser shares the Prize with Professor Michel Gilliet from the CHUV.

It can film moving electrons through the combination of an ultrafast laser with a scanning electron microscope. Its applications include the quality control of chips, LEDs and photovoltaic cells. At a global scale, Asia constitutes the main region where these devices are manufactured; hence its market is showing great excitement about Attolight’s novel tool.\nWhy did you aim at Asia?\n We began by exploring the market of United States’ laboratories, but we felt an unfavorable economic environment. Purchasing our machines requires a significant investment, which wasn’t easy to get approved. At the same time, some researchers from Chinese and Japanese companies contacted us as they were interested in this new generation tool for quality testing. Even though these initial contacts were not successful, we started to feel that there were more business opportunities for our products in the east.\nHow do large Asian institutions or companies get to trust a Swiss start-up to the point of purchasing high cost equipment from it?\n Firstly, we tackled the language and cultural barrier by hiring a Chinese consultant that had carried out her PhD studies at EPFL’s Institute of Quantum Electronics and Photonics. In the autumn of 2011, she established the first contacts with potential representatives. Then, in spring 2012, we travelled to meet them, together with Olivier Gougeon, one of our colleagues. We met about fifteen companies and chose Quantum Design, a U.S. company with a subsidiary in China, to represent us. It was key to be able to find the right people, understand the company’s structure and the financing specifics. Obviously, this would have been impossible without a way of understanding Chinese. Furthermore, EPFL’s excellent reputation helped us enormously. Without the support of Adrienne Corboud-Fumagalli, Vice President for Innovation and Technology Transfer, as well as Benoît Deveaud-Plédran, professor at the Laboratory of Quantum Optoelectronics, it would have been a lot more difficult to break into the Asian market.\nWhat is your advantage in the market, what is a company looking for when it approaches you?\n Our device allows testing miniaturized integrated components, which are commonplace in the market of semiconductors, where we are positioned today. It provides information on the material’s structure and the problems that can reduce its long-term durability or influence its effectiveness. We have a big edge over our competitors in terms of ease of use and on-screen image quality.\nHow is the current economic situation in China?\n The current context is quite favorable for us. China has decided to invest in renewable energy. Therefore, this is a great opportunity for start-ups like ours. I am frequently impressed when I see the equipment they use at their research and development establishments, especially among LED manufacturers.\nWhat are your sales expectations in the Asian market?\n This year, we are hoping to sell a machine. Then, the idea is to double our sales every year through the applications that our equipment can provide today. At the same time, we are developing new usage scenarios and we are carrying out technical analysis in our laboratory. Some companies send us samples of their material and tell us what to measure. Others send us their specialists, who come to do the measuring themselves.\nWhat are the next markets that you aiming at and how are you going to do so?\n Each country has its own culture. We'll adapt our way of doing things. In China, our representatives will contact prospective clients, but the sale will go through us. In Japan, a major scientific instruments company wishes to sell our devices, the main reason being that their customers require having a stock at hand. In Singapore, we also have a representative and we are thinking to do the same with India, Taiwan and South Korea, where we are expected to expand by next summer.\nHow can you control the work done at the other end of the world when you're a small start-up of 6 employees?\n We have our requirements: we demand for a representative to be dedicated to our machine. We are planning to make at least two trips with each representative in order to meet the contacts they’ve established and to ascertain the links they have with potential customers. For example: is he dealing with a technician or a laboratory manager? How does he present the product? Additionally, we ask our potential partners to finance a trip for our representative to come to Switzerland to do a first week of training and for follow-up training each year afterwards.

{"id": 1384, "text": "It’s no secret: when it comes to space launches, less mass generally translates into lower cost. It is no surprise, then, that the antennas developed by SWISSto12, a start-up housed at EPFL’s Innovation Park, have attracted the attention of the European Space Agency (ESA). SWISSto12’s antennas are ten times lighter and significantly less expensive than the metal antennas currently in use.\nThe non-stop growth in data transfer – driven by TVs, telephones, surveillance, GPS and the internet – requires ever-more bandwidth in satellite communications. To expand this capacity, increasingly high wave frequencies are being used: the microwave threshold has been crossed. Yet high frequencies become more and more difficult to control, and this is where the quality and shape of antennas play a crucial role.\nThe ground-breaking system developed by SWISSto12 can take many forms. It looks like a plastic sculpture of a few tens of centimeters high with evenly spaced holes in it. It contains a network of narrow channels that is the result of an extremely precise design and production process. To achieve this level of precision, it is easier and significantly less expensive to print an object in three dimensions than it is to assemble a number of little machined parts. SWISSto12’s antennas are made with polymers and then coated in metal using a patented process. It is an entirely new approach. “When we talk to customers about our products, it’s almost as if we were talking science fiction at first. But when they see the antennas and the test results, they start to come around,” said Emile De Rijk with a laugh. De Rijk is the CEO of the company, which is collaborating with EPFL’s Laboratory of Electromagnetics and Acoustics.\nFeather-light antennas\n Thanks to this innovation, these antennas weigh only a tenth as much as metal ones. Considering that a large geostationary satellite can carry up to 100kg of this type of equipment and that the launch cost is generally between 10,000 and 20,000 francs per kilo, the calculations are quick: remarkable cost savings are at stake. Particularly since the new technologies currently set to take over – stratospheric drones – will have the same weight concern.\nThis contract is part of an ESA programme aimed at developing high-tech products for space that could also have commercial uses, especially in the connectivity-on-the-move market. This contract is the ESA’s first in this area and has the support of the Swiss Space Office (the Swiss delegation to the ESA). The eventual goal is to contribute to high-speed internet solutions via satellite that will allow passengers using various modes of transport – planes, trains, automobiles and boats – to have better internet access during their travels.\nAirplanes will save on kerosene\n Thanks to their precision and design, high-frequency antennas could even reduce the size of the domes above the airplane fuselage. “Improved aerodynamics also mean saving on kerosene,” said De Rijk.\nThe start-up, founded four years ago, recently became a member of the Swiss Space Center in order to encourage synergies with the Swiss space community.

{"id": 1385, "text": "What is the best size of a parliament? That is a question at the center of many countries today, including the 2020 referendum in Italy where almost 70% of voters selected to slash the number of members of parliament by about a third. Among others, the complex issue involves matters of governing efficiency, logistics, and financial costs.\nBut one thing many people might not realize is that there is a science behind all this. In 1972, political scientist Rein Taagepera published  proposing that the ideal size of a parliament corresponds to the cube root of the country’s population: \nA=αP\no\n1/3\n, where A is the parliament size, P\no\n is the population size, and α is a constant. In general terms, the bigger a country’s population, the bigger its parliament ought to be.\nTaagepera’s famous “cube-root law” was quickly taken up by governments, but hasn’t been without critics: In 2007 and 2012, researchers used empirical data to come up with a square-root relationship rather than a cube-root, while another paper in 2019 questioned the actual cause-effect sequence that lies at the foundation of Taagepera’s law. So while all agree that a bigger parliament would be needed for a bigger country, the exact relation has remained a matter of dispute.\nNow, physicist Giorgio Margaritondo, Professor Emeritus with EPFL’s School of Basic Sciences, has published a paper analyzing Taagepera’s model. , his findings challenge the math behind the paper and the accuracy of its predictions, and raises concerns about the way the data was used.\n“I was astonished,” says Margaritondo. “The law has been, – and still is – widely used, but the paper’s flaws have gone undetected for half a century.” He points out that Taagepera’s original paper actually evaluates the actual size of a parliament not its “optimal” size.\nFour fatal flaws\n“The original derivation of the ‘cube-root law’ is affected by fatal mistakes, unnoticed for half a century,” says Margaritondo. Taking a physicist’s view, he analyzed the 1972 paper, and discovered four flaws.\nFirst, that the cube-root law was not derived from the paper’s data and that the corresponding trend that led to the formula was “arbitrarily forced”.\nSecond, that the theoretical steps used to derive the formula incorrectly evaluated one of its key factors.\nThe third flaw has to do with real-world politics: Taagepera’s model assumes that each member of parliament spends on average an equal amount of time communicating inside and outside parliament, which Margaritondo describes as a “an arbitrary hypothesis that has unrealistic consequences.”\nFinally, there is generally no evaluation of “optimal” size based on a power law that can reach meaningful accuracy, and that includes the cube-root law.\nSquare, not cube\nMargaritondo’s suspicion was that the paper’s data could better fit a broader, more “general” formula that the cube-root law. But in the paper, Taagepera challenged this notion by claiming that the it would be a “dead end” and that it would be “\nmore fruitful to look for a plausible theoretical model which would fit the observed general trend\n”.\n“This argument is fundamentally flawed from a physicist’s point of view,” writes Margaritondo. “It considers only one hypothesis, renouncing \na priori\n to demonstrate its superiority with respect to others.” Spurred on, Margaritondo used the paper’s original data and applied to them the same statistical fitting method that Taagepera had in 1972. Except that here, he used a similar, but more general formula to fit the data: \nA=αP\no\nn\n.

However, as a colony, they can use complex strategies to complete sophisticated tasks and evade larger predators.\n At EPFL's School of Engineering, robotics researchers in Professor  have reproduced this phenomenon, developing tiny robots that display minimal physical intelligence on an individual level but that are able to communicate and act collectively. Despite being simple in design and weighing only 10 grams, each robot has multiple locomotion modes to navigate any type of surface. Collectively, they can quickly detect and overcome obstacles and move objects much larger and heavier than themselves. The related research has been published in \nNature\n.\n(photo: Marc Delachaux / EPFL)\n Robots inspired by trap-jaw ants\n These three-legged, T-shaped origami robots are called Tribots. They can be assembled in only a few minutes by folding a stack of thin, multi-material sheets, making them suitable for mass production. Completely autonomous and untethered, Tribots are equipped with infrared and proximity sensors for detection and communication purposes. They could accommodate even more sensors depending on the application.\n “Their movements are modeled on those of Odontomachus ants. These insects normally crawl, but to escape a predator, they snap their powerful jaws together to jump from leaf to leaf,” says Zhenishbek Zhakypov, the first author. The Tribots replicate this catapult mechanism through an elegant origami design that combines multiple shape-memory alloy actuators. As a result, a single robot can produce five distinct locomotion gaits: vertical jumping, horizontal jumping, somersaulting to clear obstacles, walking on textured terrain and crawling on flat surfaces – just like these creatively resilient ants.\n Roles: leader, worker and explorer\n Despite having the same anatomy, each robot is assigned a specific role depending on the situation. ‘Explorers’ detect physical obstacles in their path, such as objects, valleys and mountains. After detecting an obstacle, they inform the rest of the group. Then, the ‘leader’ gives the instructions. The ‘workers,’ meanwhile, pool their strength to move objects. “Each Tribot, just like Odontomachus ants, can have different roles. However, they can also take on new roles instantaneously when faced with a new mission or an unknown environment, or even when other members get lost. This goes beyond what the real ants can do,” says Paik.\nZhenishbek Zhakypov and Jamie Paik.

The disease-spread geography is modeled in 107 provinces and metropolitan areas – the most granular level of detail available.\nThe team calibrated the model to account for human mobility, using census data from Italy’s National Institute of Statistics to estimate pre-epidemic mobility, and the findings of an independent study based on cell phone geolocation data to ascertain the extent to which the government-imposed restrictions had reduced people’s movements.\nAfter confirming the model’s accuracy by comparing the map of infections with observed data, the researchers used it to study the effects of the early containment measures.\nCaption:\n The map on the left shows the spread of the epidemic as simulated at the municipal scale.

{"id": 1411, "text": "How does the body produce fat cells? EPFL scientists have uncovered the role of SMRT, a protein involved in regulating this phenomenon. And in the process of investigating this, they discovered another critical role played by SMRT in a variety of cell division and differentiation processes. This double discovery was published online April 19, 2012, in the journal \nMolecular Cell\n.\n The production of fat cells, known as adipocytes, is the outcome of a long and complicated molecular process. Given the right conditions, certain stem cells can differentiate into bone, cartilage, or fat cells. It has been known for quite some time that a protein known as SMRT is a critical part of this transformation. But the exact, molecular role it plays has remained a mystery. \n SMRT is a so-called “co-repressor” protein; it doesn’t act alone, but by binding with another protein that in turn has the ability to bind with a strand of DNA. As long as SMRT stays bound to its host, the stem cell won’t transform into a fat cell. EPFL professor Bart Deplancke and his team were able to pry apart the details of this process and reconstruct the origins of adipogenesis.\nThe birth of a fat cell; a play in three acts\nAct I. SMRT is bound to its host, another protein, C/EBPβ, which is in turn bound to a strand of DNA. SMRT acts as a plug or kind of umbrella, preventing other proteins from binding with the host or anywhere in the vicinity. The stem cell is still undifferentiated at this stage. \n Act II. Certain substances secreted by our bodies, such as insulin, activate the protein. SMRT detaches from its host, making way for other proteins to come onto the stage and attach themselves in the area. \n Act III. Once these proteins are assembled, they activate the genes responsible for differentiating the stem cell into a fat cell. SMRT thus plays a critical role: it prevents premature differentiation. “It’s through this protein that insulin, among other components, is involved in the regulation of fat cell production,” explains Deplancke. “If we remove SMRT from our cells in culture, they transform more rapidly into fat cells, without waiting for the right signal.” \n At the moment, the scientists don’t know to what extent a malfunction in this process could be responsible for cases of congenital obesity. But according to Deplancke, the hypothesis is highly plausible and deserves further investigation. \nSMRT’s other unexpected starring roles – a second discovery\nThe scientists also made an unexpected discovery while conducting the research outlined above. While tracking its presence in cells, they found that the protein was often in the vicinity of a specific DNA sequence, one that had been of interest to the scientific community for quite some time.\n “We know two things about this DNA sequence,” explains Deplancke. “First, it appears more frequently than statistics would predict, and in all the mammals whose genomes are well understood. Second, it is systematically located inside promoters of genes implicated in cell division, in other words, the basic function of any multicellular organism.” Biologists thus have good reason to suspect that it plays a critical role in this cell function. \n Deplancke’s team discovered that SMRT could bind with a protein called KAISO, which in turn binds to this mysterious DNA sequence, but only in very specific conditions. “The sequence must be methylated (NLDR: methylation is a chemical transformation that modifies the properties of DNA) in order for KAISO to bind with it. This explains why biologists, who have been searching for the proteins that bind to this sequence for years, have never been able to find anything.” \n By removing SMRT from KAISO, the scientists observed something very interesting: the cell divided much more rapidly than it should have. Without technically meeting the definition of a malignant cell, it did nonetheless exhibit certain fundamental behaviors of one. \n Whether for the production of fat cells by binding with C/EBPβ, or for regulating cell division by binding with KAISO, SMRT is clearly a protein that plays a critical regulatory role in the cell. “We know that for most cells to be able to differentiate, it needs a certain number of division cycles,” explains Deplancke. “This leads us to believe that SMRT plays a critical guardian role, by regulating the processes of division and differentiation of the cell, and that its function is much more far-reaching than just the production of fat cells.”\nPublication: \nSunil K.

{"id": 1413, "text": "Molecules that accumulate at the tip of chromosomes are known to play a key role in preventing damage to our DNA. Now, researchers at EPFL have unraveled how these molecules home in on specific sections of chromosomes—a finding that could help to better understand the processes that regulate cell survival in aging and cancer.\nMuch like an aglet of a shoelace prevents the end of the lace from fraying, stretches of DNA called telomeres form protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. But as cells divide, telomeres become shorter, making the protective cap less effective. Once telomeres get too short, the cell stops dividing. Telomere shortening and malfunction have been linked to cell aging and age-related diseases, including cancer.\nScientists have known that RNA species called TERRA help to regulate the length and function of telomeres. Discovered in 2007 by postdoc Claus Azzalin in the team of EPFL Professor Joachim Lingner, TERRA belongs to a class of molecules called noncoding RNAs, which are not translated into proteins but function as structural components of chromosomes. TERRA accumulates at chromosome ends, signaling that telomeres should be elongated or repaired.\nHowever, it was unclear how TERRA got to the tip of chromosomes and remained there. “The telomere makes up only a tiny bit of the total chromosomal DNA, so the question is ‘how does this RNA find its home?’”, Lingner says. To address this question, postdoc Marianna Feretzaki and others in the teams of Joachim Lingner at EPFL and Lumir Krejci at Masaryk University set out to analyze the mechanism through which TERRA accumulates at telomeres, as well as the proteins involved in this process. The findings \nFinding home\nBy visualizing TERRA molecules under a microscope, the researchers found that a short stretch of the RNA is crucial to bring it to telomeres. Further experiments showed that once TERRA reaches the tip of chromosomes, several proteins regulate its association with telomeres. Among these proteins, one called RAD51 plays a particularly important role, Lingner says.\nRAD51 is a well-known enzyme that is involved in the repair of broken DNA molecules. The protein also seems to help TERRA stick to telomeric DNA to form a so-called “RNA-DNA hybrid molecule”. Scientists thought this type of reaction, which leads to the formation of a three-stranded nucleic acid structure, mainly happened during DNA repair. The new study shows that it can also happen at chromosome ends when TERRA binds to telomeres. “This is paradigm-shifting,” Lingner says.\nThe researchers also found that short telomeres recruit TERRA much more efficiently than long telomeres. Although the mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear, the researchers hypothesize that when telomeres get too short, either due to DNA damage or because the cell has divided too many times, they recruit TERRA molecules. This recruitment is mediated by RAD51, which also promotes the elongation and repair of telomeres. “TERRA and RAD51 help to prevent accidental loss or shortening of telomeres,” Lingner says. “That’s an important function.”\nGiven the role of telomeres in health and disease, it will be important to see how the newly discovered mechanism—which was deduced from observations in living cells and reproduced in test tubes—is regulated in the very complex cellular environment, Lingner says. “We put forward a model, which is supported by the data we have—but often in science, it turns out that the model must be modified,” he says. “There can certainly be additional surprises.”\nNext, his team plans to address other key questions, including whether RAD51 mediates the association of other noncoding RNAs with chromosomes. The researchers also aim to better characterize the machinery that mediates the association of TERRA with chromosomes, and work out the functions that this association enables. “There are a lot of questions that remain open,” Lingner says.", "summary": "A new study by EPFL researchers shows how RNA species called TERRA muster at the tip of chromosomes, where they help to prevent telomere shortening and premature cell aging.", "claim": "A new study by EPFL researchers shows how RNA species called TERRA muster at the tip of chromosomes, where we help to prevent telomere shortening and premature cell aging.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [20, 20], "noise": false}

Anyone with an interest in science can come tour the school’s labs, attend workshops and talks, view shows and demonstrations, or take part in any of the 300 other activities that will be run at the School’s main campus in Lausanne. Around 1,000 EPFL employees will be on hand to greet the 30,000 visitors expected at the event. Don’t miss this unique opportunity to get a first-hand view of the research being carried out at the School and learn more about its missions and its important role in the community. To top things off, the open house is a zero-waste event.\nFrom drones to super heroes\nOf the many entertaining and informative activities to choose from, we would note the impressive physics and chemistry demonstrations by Fred Courant, the French host of \nL'Esprit Sorcier\n; the “Drone Days” races and demos showing the exciting potential of these flying robots; and the workshop given (in English) by \nPhysics Girl \n– the YouTuber whose channel on the fun facts of physics has attracted millions of followers. You can also learn interesting new things in the “How it works” area, and children can discover the magical world of science at the Scientastic Festival workshops. Comic-book fans will get a treat, too – Aleksi Briclot, the French artist who worked for Marvel comics, will give a presentation, and a workshop will be held on digitizing comic strips.\nBut it’s in EPFL’s many labs, testing rooms, and fablab-like prototyping workshops where you’ll get to see hard-core science taking place. Researchers will explain the cutting-edge work they’re doing, on topics ranging from concrete, protein and fruit flies to internet traffic, nuclear fusion, robots, the periodic table, the art and theory of graphs, intellectual propriety and micro power grids. And they will do so in a clear and simple way, so anyone can grasp even the most advanced concepts. Finally, the event will include a series of talks and panel discussions addressing key issues such as artificial intelligence, animal testing and personalized medicine.\nAn eco-friendly event \nAs a forward-looking school, EPFL has taken a number of steps to ensure this event is as carbon-neutral as possible.

If a ray of light comes close to a mass (e.g. a galaxy), the light will be distorted as it would if it went through a lens.\nThis phenomenon can distort the images of objects hidden behing other celestial bodies. \"If you look at a light source hidden behind a galaxy, the light rays that reach us will bend and produce mirage images,\" says Frédéric Courbin, Senior Scientist at LASTRO. The length of the optical path that each of these mirages follows to Earth differs, and measuring this over time teaches us about the geometry of the universe and how it is expanding.\" These measures and calculations have been done at LASTRO for the past ten years. \"The aim of our project is to reduce the uncertainty of the measurement of the Hubble Constant,\" says Laetitia. This number is used to describe the rate at which the universe is expanding at a given point in time, which is crucial to understanding the mysterious dark matter discovered in the 2000s (and earned the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics). \n This summer, Laetitia is working together with Eric Paic, a 20-year-old French student about to start the third year of his Bachelor’s degree.

This marks a new stage for Michael Graetzel's discoveries at the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces.\nA Bright Idea\nNot only are the dye-sensitized solar cells relatively inexpensive, but also they are of particular interest for their finesse and efficiency: they work equally well in ambient light as in artificial light and can produce sufficient energy even without directly facing a light source. These characteristics make them ideal for developing essential accessories to use in current nomadic technologies.\nThe performance of these solar cells comes from an operating principal that mimics photosynthesis.

{"id": 1425, "text": "Solar cookers – or solar-powered ovens – can be used to cook foods at low temperatures (60–120°C) for anywhere from 30 minutes up to four hours. This makes them perfect for a range of dishes, such as potatoes, vegetables, rice, stews and even cupcakes. EPFL scientists have been working on an enhanced version of the conventional solar cooker since 2018. In research that appeared in Solar Energy, the scientists show how their design can operate in Switzerland’s sunniest areas, such as Valais Canton, for 240 days per year – or two thirds of the year. And in the country’s cloudiest areas (such as Zurich), it can operate for 155 days per year, a figure that surprised even the researchers.\nThe scientists in question work at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB). But how did building experts come to be interested in cookers? “It all started with a chocolate cake – and it’ll all end with a chocolate cake,” says Andreas Schüler, a research associate at LESO-PB. One day, Olivia Bouvard – a scientist at the lab – arrived at work with a cake she’d baked in a solar cooker. That got her colleagues interested in how these devices work. They ordered one from Solemyo, an association based in Geneva, and began to reverse-engineer its design. \nLike a miniature building \n “A solar cooker is actually like a tiny building with glazed facades,” says Schüler. Which is right up his alley, since he has been working on advanced window-glazing technology for the past few years. Schüler and his colleagues at LESO-PB made improvements to the size of the cooker they’d ordered and added more glazing – using, of course, their innovative type of glass. That boosted the amount of sunlight entering the cooker, but it did not increase the amount of heat loss, thanks to their glass’s superior insulating properties. The scientists worked with the Swiss Design Center to create a prototype of their model, and they filed for a patent in 2018. Then, using an EPFL Enable grant and an ENAC InnoSeed grant awarded the same year, they teamed up with TZ Menuiserie SA – a carpentry firm based in Valais – to manufacture ten prototypes.\nThe EPFL model is designed specifically for Switzerland. In addition to glass, it uses pine wood and is surrounded with aluminum to reflect and guide the sun’s rays. The cooker’s shape and glazing are engineered to create a “sunlight trap” so that it doesn’t have to be moved during cooking to follow the sun’s rays. With dimensions of 33 cm x 33 cm, it is large enough to hold a standard casserole dish. “We also looked into the idea of creating a collapsible, portable cooker, along with a fold-up casserole dish, that people could use when they go hiking or to the beach,” says Schüler, who himself is a proud owner of one of the prototypes. \n“We believe our cooker could help reduce the load on Switzerland’s power grid during the peak lunch and evening hours. Cooking is the third-biggest use of household power in Switzerland, behind heating systems and water boilers. With our cooker, you could put all the ingredients in before going to work, for example, and have a meal ready for you when you get home – without using gas or electricity,” says Schüler. \nDesigns for other countries, too \n The method for calculating how many days a year the solar cooker could work was developed by Dasaraden Mauree, an LESO-PB scientist specialized in modelling techniques. “We combined climatic data for Switzerland with our cooker’s operating data to develop a mathematical model that can subsequently be used for any other region in the world,” says Mauree. The scientists tested their model by collecting data from their cooker over one month, on the roof of their lab, and comparing the data with the model’s predictions. In addition to validating the model, these tests showed that their solar cooker, when equipped with aluminum reflectors, can deliver 55% more cooking days per year than the same cooker without reflectors. \nToday the scientists are working on further increasing their cooker’s efficiency and on making it a “smart cooker” by incorporating an app that would let users monitor the oven when they’re not at home and that would send an alert when a meal is ready. They are also thinking about adjusting their design so it can be used in other countries through a technology-transfer approach. “We’ve had Master’s students work with us on this project, and their ideas and enthusiasm really helped us move it forward. We owe them a lot!” says Schüler. Now they can apply the lessons learned while developing the cooker to their research on making buildings tighter. So after shifting their focus from buildings to cookers, the researchers can now apply what they learned on cookers to buildings.\nJérémy Fleury, Dasaraden Mauree, Andreas Schüler and Olivia Bouvard. © Alain Herzog / EPFL", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a glass-paneled solar cooker that delivers exceptional performance.

{"id": 1426, "text": "Femoral neck fractures occur frequently among the elderly, and are usually caused by osteoporosis – a disease that weakens the bone structure. “250 million people around the world have osteoporosis,” says Professor Dominique Pioletti, the head of the Biomechanical Orthopedics Laboratory (LBO) at EPFL’s School of Engineering. “It manifests as a reduction in bone mass and a deterioration of the bone microarchitecture, leading to increased fracture risk.” Ulrike Kettenberger, a post-doc researcher at LBO, adds: “It’s a big problem in our society. 40% of people who fracture their hip can never walk again without assistance and 33% become no longer self-sufficient. One out of five patients dies in the year following the fracture. These figures are alarming.”\nHip bones, vertebrae and wrist bones\nDrugs are available to strengthen the bones of people suffering from osteoporosis. But it’s a silent disease, meaning many people don’t know they have it. “Doctors generally discover it only after the first fracture, which is already too late,” says Pioletti.\nThe drugs currently available have two drawbacks. The fact that they act on all bones of the body – a good thing in itself – unfortunately means the secondary effects also affect the entire body. Osteoporosis-related fractures typically occur in the hip bones, vertebrae and wrist bones. Second, the benefits are only visible 12 months after treatment begins. “This window is critical,” says Kettenberger, “because that’s when people who have an initial fracture often have a second one. We need to strengthen their bones quickly to prevent this from happening.”\nLocalized injections\nThe LBO scientists came up with a novel compound called Flowbone to address this problem. “We developed a biomaterial in the form of a gel that contains a hyaluronic acid matrix, calcium phosphate particles and a tiny dose of a bisphosphonate,” says Kettenberger. Doctors can inject the gel directly in a patient’s bone under local anesthesia. The gel penetrates the bone structure without damaging it. “Flowbone is only administered where it’s important to prevent a fracture,” she adds. “It could serve as a minimally invasive treatment to help avoid systemic secondary effects. The local bone structure would show a marked improvement three or four months after the injection, and the effect would last around three years.” A radiologist could perform the injection through an outpatient procedure. Flowbone would be useful mainly for preventing subsequent fractures, since osteoporosis often goes undetected before an initial fracture.\nA Venture Kick startup\nThe scientists entered their Flowbone startup in the Venture Kick competition for Swiss entrepreneurs and have just made it through the second round with a prize of CHF 50,000 in funding. “We plan to use this money to conduct pre-clinical trials,” says Pioletti. They expect to launch their Flowbone gel on the market within five or six years.\nA disease that afflicts mostly women\nOsteoporosis is a disease that affects mainly the elderly – and especially women. “One out of three women over 50 has it, as opposed to one out of every five men,” says Ulrike Kettenberger, a researcher at EPFL’s Biomechanical Orthopedics Laboratory. Bone mass naturally starts declining after the age of 30, but that process accelerates in people with osteoporosis. Young people can develop the disease too, such as those suffering from anorexia, a disorder that – like osteoporosis – afflicts women more than men.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a gel that can locally reinforce bones weakened by osteoporosis.

Switzerland has unique skills in solar energy but needs to intensify its efforts, explains David Stickelberger, Swissolar director.

{"id": 1429, "text": "The UN Climate Conference ended with a promising deal to reduce our impact on the climate, ratified by all 190 participating countries. It remains to be seen if and how these ambitious goals will be met. But one thing is for sure: technology will certainly be part of the solution. For example, underground carbon sequestration is among the most mature and proven technologies that could play a crucial role during the transition period that lies ahead until renewable energy becomes the norm, according to Lyesse Laloui, the director of the Petrosvibri Chair in Geoengineering and CO\n2\n Storage. The idea he advocates involves burying our CO\n2\n emissions underground until we are able to get by without them.\nWill the decisions taken during the global climate conference boost the development of CO\n2\n sequestration technology?\nMy first general and positive observation is that there is now a unanimous agreement that the atmosphere is warming, and that, consequently, we have to do something about carbon. In terms of my work, this consensus creates an opportunity. The solution we are working on is not the only one, but it is one that addresses the commitments that were made.\nToday, it is the only technology capable of addressing the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Over 70 projects have proven its feasibility, and since about 15 years, large industrial projects each sequester about one million tons of CO\n2\n underground each year. And unlike oil and gas extraction, CO\n2\n can be sequestered anywhere on the planet.\nHow would you explain that we don’t rely more on CO\n2\n sequestration, even though it is a mature technology? \nThe obstacles are primarily financial. Capturing and storing one ton of CO\n2\n costs about 60-70 euros. But it only costs 10 euros to buy certificates to emit a ton of CO\n2\n on the European carbon exchange market. We cannot significantly bring down the cost of carbon capture and sequestration anymore, which his why it will either take a lot of political will or an increase in the price of carbon certificates.\nSwitzerland expressed its political will by announcing the shutdown of its nuclear power plants. Could CO\n2\n sequestration help facilitate the transition? \nUntil renewable energy technologies are able to replace nuclear power, Switzerland will not be able to produce enough indigenous power. Gas-powered thermal power plants are being considered to step in, but these emit CO\n2\n. Swiss legislation requires that 50% of CO\n2\n emissions produced in such a scenario be compensated on Swiss soil. An efficient transitional solution could be to set up a CO\n2\n capture and storage facility right next to the power plant.\nAre the Swiss authorities taking this idea seriously? \nFor the time being there are no concrete plans to move in this direction. But with support from the Swiss Federal Department of Energy, we are currently working on selecting potential sites to run a full-scale pilot test – 5 to 10,000 tons of CO\n2\n per year – to prove the feasibility of the technology in Switzerland. But we are far from knowing at what pace this will develop.\nTechnically, how exactly does the technology work? \nThere are three steps. First, the CO\n2\n has to be captured from the emission source. Next, it has to be concentrated and transported to the storage site. Then comes the final step, in which the CO\n2\n is sequestered underground. To do so, we take advantage of a particularity of CO\n2\n: when it is injected into low enough depths, the high temperature and pressure transform it into a so-called “supercritical state”, where it occupies 500 times less volume than when it is a gas!\nAs in all human activities, there are both short- and long-term risks. The short-term risks are primarily due to the pressure at which CO\n2\n is injected underground. This can, for example, lead to the activation of faults that might trigger small earthquakes or allow gas to potentially leak out. We control these risks by understanding the physical mechanisms involved in these processes as well as possible and by developing predictive tools. A longer-term risk is that supercritical CO\n2\n, which is highly acidic, could destabilize the geological layers sealing the storage site. But we have technological solutions to prevent such events, either through real-time monitoring or by appropriately designing the projects.\nThis is also what much of your recent research focuses on. \nIndeed. For example, we are investigating the impact of supercritical CO\n2\n on the geological reservoir into which it is injected, in terms of both permeability and resistance of the rock. Aside from that, we are also focusing on the impact on the cap-rock, which is the rock layer that seals the reservoir. In both cases, we are interested in how these rocks react when they come into contact with the acidic supercritical fluid. We are one of the few groups in the world that are able to carry out these types of experiments in the lab. To do so, we developed facilities in which we can reproduce the conditions encountered in depths down to seven kilometers. In another project, we developed tools to appropriately design the installations used to sequester CO\n2\n, and to predict the behavior of the rock layers over several years after the gas is injected.\nLyesse Laloui is organizing an international conference at EPFL at the SwissTech Convention Center on greenhouse-gas control technologies in partnership with the International Energy Agency, which will take place in November 2016.

Born in Ticino in 1943, he studied architecture in Venice in the late 1960s and – like many architects of his generation – made a name for himself building villas for wealthy families. We spoke with him while he was on campus this November to give a talk at the “\nHabiter la modernité : villas de style internationales sur la Riviera vaudoise\n” [“Living in Modernity: International Style Villas in the Swiss Riviera”] exhibition held by EPFL’s Modern Architecture Archives Department (ACM) at the Archizoom exhibit hall.\nEarly on in your career, you said that a home should be a shelter, like a “mother’s womb.” Is building these types of villas still feasible in Switzerland today?\nIt’s true that land isn’t used in the same way as it was, and we therefore can’t build villas like we used to. Lifestyles have changed and we need to pay attention to the collective values governing how land is managed. But the expression “home sweet home” is just as valid as it ever was. We all need a shelter, a safe haven where we feel at peace yet connected to a larger community. And I still believe a home should be a womb where we can rest and replenish our strength, ready to face a new day. The challenge faced by architects is finding a way to create spaces that give users greater enjoyment – while fitting those spaces within the contradictions of today’s society.\nYou helped found the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture in 1996 and served as its dean from 2002 to 2003 and 2011 to 2013. What makes your Academy different from other architecture schools? \nFirst of all, we called it an “Academy” because we wanted to distinguish it from technical schools. We believe architects should be trained more in the human sciences than in technical fields, so that they can address the complicated challenges facing modern society and the rapid pace of change in land use. The human sciences should be the cornerstone of architectural work, as it was during the Italian Renaissance. We want our architectural students to be the ones who point out problems instead of providing solutions – they’ll learn how to come up with solutions later, when they start working. In our view, a school’s role is to teach students how to identify problems.\nWhat advice would you give architecture students?\nArchitects need time and a lot of experience before they can master their trade. So I’d tell students to be patient. I’d also give them the advice that my mentor, Louis Kahn, gave me when I graduated with my architecture degree: there are three things you must do to become a good architect: work, work and work.\nWould you say there’s a typically Swiss architectural style, like there is a French or American style?\nThe construction process is more complicated here than in other countries, due to Switzerland’s 26 cantons. But all Swiss buildings are built with the same two goals in mind – to be sturdy and to last. Those are important values here.\nYou often say that of all your work, your favorite is the San Giovanni Battista church in Mogno, in the canton of Ticino – your very first religious building.\nYes, it’s my first love! Designing this church showed me the strengths and fundamental elements of the architectural construct. Even though it’s a place of worship, I was able to explore secular themes, such as the importance of gravity, of light and of the threshold separating the interior from the exterior. Building a church helped me understand all of that.\nYour portfolio of architectural work is quite impressive. Is there any kind of building you haven’t yet done but would like to do?\nI’d really like to create a monastery. That’s the ideal city because every building is built in response to a spiritual need. Residents are there because it’s a life choice they have made. They need to be surrounded by the beauty, nature and landscapes that inspire study and introspection. And, just like cities, monasteries provide services and have areas for recreation. They are at once tucked away in the country and a centralized workplace.

{"id": 1434, "text": "At first glance, the foosball table located in the middle of the Automatic Control Laboratory looks perfectly normal. Looks can be deceiving. In defense, one of the levers has a mechanical arm capable of propelling the ball into the opposing goal at a speed of 6 meters per second. “This is already enough to beat the average player,” said the researcher Christophe Salzmann, who heads the project. And this is only the beginning. The robot should eventually prove to be more accurate, faster, and more strategic than any player.\nA high-speed camera to detect the ball\n Made from start to finish by several student groups, the robotic arm depends on two computers: one to control the mechanical movement of the arm and the other to provide information about the position of the ball. In order to position itself correctly, the robot must have a clear idea of the location of the ball in real time.\nSo students replaced the bottom of the foosball table with a transparent material. They then placed a high-speed camera on the ground to film the game board. “Through image processing algorithms, we can analyze the movement of the ball in real time. This information is transmitted to the computer that controls the movement and positioning of the arm,” says masters student Martin Savary, who participated in the project.\n“We still have some problems coordinating the two processes, but we are going to work on it,” added Cyril Picard, another student working on the robot. “It will eventually condense into a single computer.”\nChallenges of an industrial project\n For now, the robot cannot perform complex moves, but its kicking power is already formidable. Christophe Salzmann welcomes the results. “This is a very good exercise for the students. They controlled the materials, assembled the robot, programmed it and developed the algorithms. The work is comparable to any industrial project. It must be accomplished by working in a group, and sometimes,” he smiles, “they end up banging their heads against the wall.”\nThe goal: robots playing against each other \n The robot will continue to be developed by other groups of students until it works perfectly. “Potentially, the computer can simultaneously analyze many more parameters than a human and process information faster.

{"id": 1437, "text": "Computing eats up energy – and it’s not a trivial matter! All the datacenters in the USA put together use as much energy as all the households in Switzerland. We have reason to believe that this phenomenon will continue exponentially, in line with our growing needs. Among the teams at EPFL that are working to reduce the energy consumption of electronic chips, the Parallel Systems Architecture Laboratory (PARSA) is exploring a solution that could reduce it by a factor of 100!\nDark computing opens up new perspectives. The idea is this: chips composed of hundreds of cores, each with its own specialization. Instead of a single processor that does everything, there is an assembly of specialized circuits, in which only the cores being used are activated, and the others disactivated.\nIn current computing models, one existing paradigm anticipates this concept: graphic circuits, specialized in display-related tasks. They provide a good example of how dark computing will affect our futures. “In the near future, network, storage and research functions will have their own, dedicated circuits, integrated in a single chip”, explains Babak Falsafi, Director of PARSA.\nThe concept is especially interesting for servers. “A datacenter represents millions of dollars of investment. Optimising power consumption becomes a real economic challenge.”\nThe hardware installed in datacenters requires enormous data processing. For example, during a simple translation request via Google. “The procedure doesn’t depend on grammatical analysis, but rather on a comparison of thousands of existing translations; these are stored, compared and sorted according to a statistical method. The same is true of many services, and as a result basic data management will therefore use more and more resources.” Such a task, if assigned to a specialized circuit, would require rather less energy.\nThe work performed in Babak Falsafi’s laboratory is part of the Eurocloud server program. Begun in 2010, it is expected to produce new prototypes two years from now.", "summary": "How can we reduce the power consumption of computers?

{"id": 1438, "text": "Magnets are everywhere; stuck to our fridges, used in electric motors, built into the hard disks on our computers. Scientists have studied them for centuries, but it’s only recently that a team from EPFL’s Laboratory for Quantum Magnetism has probed the details of their innermost structure. This fundamental discovery will pave the way for both new research and a host of promising applications, particularly in the area of miniaturized hard disks.\nA magnet that isn’t magnetized…\nEPFL professor Henrik Ronnow and his team found a strange material: a magnet that’s not magnetized. How can this be? The needle of a compass is made up of a number of magnetized elements that arrange themselves into a crystalline network. Like so many miniature compasses, the magnetic fields of all these atoms all point in the same direction. Trapped in this structure, the magnetic field of each atom adds itself to that of all the other atoms, producing the total magnetic field of the compass.\n In the material studied at EPFL, the atoms are arranged in pairs in a very particular way: the magnetic field of one atom is the opposite of that of its neighbor. As a result, the total magnetic field of each pair is practically nil. The entire material thus loses its magnetization.\nTo unveil the secrets of this strange magnet, the scientists bombarded a lithium-erbium-fluoride sample with neutrons. The radiation allowed them to measure the structure of the crystalline network and its magnetic properties at very high resolution. The experiment had to be conducted at very low temperatures in order to prevent the atoms’ Brownian motion from obscuring the results.\nUnexpected results and a promising future\nThe atoms of a magnetic material are arranged in a three-dimensional structure. The physicists’ models can predict magnetic properties based on the characteristics of this structure, for example if the magnet is made up of a thin layer of atoms, known as a 2D structure. bidimensional structure. But when they measured the magnetic properties of their sample, the physicists obtained an unexpected result. In this experiment, even though the sample was much thicker, it had the magnetic properties of a single layer. “It could be due to the fact that the material is made up of a series of very thin layers piled on top of each other, each of which maintains its individual properties,” explains Ronnow.\nEven though these results are purely the stuff of basic research, they could nonetheless eventually have an impact in the area of hard disk technology, which is exploiting magnetic properties at increasingly miniaturized scales. Data are stored in binary form by changing the magnetic polarity of an area of the disk. With miniaturization, however, the problem is that sectors close to one another can influence each other, and spontaneously change polarity. The data would then be lost. “With these special materials, miniaturization could continue; each sector of the disk could be one of these magnetization-free pairs. The probability that the magnetic field of one atom would influence the magnetic field of its neighbor is practically nil.” There’s just one intrinsic obstacle that must be overcome, however, with these materials: creating a read/write head sensitive enough to decode a magnetic field that is, by definition, extremely weak.\nLink:", "summary": "EPFL physicists studying magnetic materials have discovered that they have some unexpected properties.

{"id": 1439, "text": "Switzerland’s very first Certificates of Open Studies (COSs) were handed out this past Thursday at a ceremony at EPFL. These certificates were granted to participants who completed a new continuing education program that the school has made available to anyone, with no previous degrees required. “These first COSs mark a major step forward for our school. We had to fight to get this program off the ground because nobody thought it could work. We met with a lot of resistance – but we believe that education is a lifelong endeavor,” said Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at the ceremony on Thursday. He handed out the certificates alongside Marcel Salathé and Laura Downhower, the academic director and executive director, respectively, of the EPFL Extension School. They too worked hard to roll out the new program. “This is a historic moment for EPFL,” said Salathé.\nThe currently offers COSs in two areas – Applied Data Science: Machine Learning and Web Application Development. The courses are given online and participants get personalized feedback from their instructors and can request a videoconference. To obtain the certificate, participants must plan, carry out and present a significant individual project showing that they have acquired all the requisite skills.\n“In a fast-moving field like IT, you have to continually refresh your skills. I usually learn new things on my own,” said Germain Hugon, an electrician by training who currently works as an IOS-Web Developer. “But when it came to machine learning, there were some concepts I was having trouble grasping. That’s why I decided to take an online course. And I selected EPFL’s program since the school is nearby.” Hugon, the father of two small children, completed the COS program in eight months while continuing to work at his regular job. “That required a big commitment since it’s a demanding program. I think my family is happy that I’ve finished!” he says. Hugon doesn’t have a university degree so is happy to have the EPFL certificate in his pocket.\nParticipants from a variety of backgrounds\n21-year-old Valentin Kaelin is also a COS program graduate without a university degree. “I had three months free before starting my civil service, and I’ve always been interested in web development. This program is really well designed with lots of exercises. And the certificate will look good on my CV,” he says. With its new program, the EPFL Extension School aims to encourage people to learn more about digital technology, enable existing professionals to refresh their skills or change careers, and help job-seekers find employment. Zuriati Balion, who holds a Bachelor’s degree in information technology, is a stay-at-home mom proud to have completed the COS program – especially after all the late nights of studying. “I want to return to work and I hope this certificate will help,” she says.\nThe 20-odd graduates of this first year of the COS program come from a variety of backgrounds and ages. Philippe Terrier, who holds a PhD in biomedical engineering and works as a research scientist on clinical trials, takes an avid interest in continuing education. So when he saw the new program on offer at EPFL, he jumped at the chance. “The program was really intense, but it’s good to be able to walk away with a diploma recognized by EPFL.”\nMany other students pointed to this benefit of the program, especially since those who complete it earn 15 ECTS credits. Daniel Müller, who worked as a doctor before an accident forced him to change careers, has discovered a talent for IT. He wrote a program that can predict the amount of solar power a station will generate based on weather forecasts. “The program works – I tested it out on my own solar panels. Some of the exercises and projects we had to do were quite challenging, but the important thing is we learned a lot. I plan to get a COS in another field next year,” he says.

{"id": 1440, "text": "Mid-sized cities around the world are facing a real threat of decline in their downtown areas, and Switzerland is no exception. EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) was commissioned by the Neuchâtel branch of Cobaty, an international building-industry association, to study possible options for the future of downtown Neuchâtel. The researchers were asked to find concrete urban solutions that would ensure downtown Neuchâtel remains vibrant and attractive. We spoke with Emmanuel Rey, an architect and urban planning expert and the head of LAST, who just published a book on this project.\nHow are the challenges faced by downtown Neuchâtel typical of those faced by other European cities?\n The areas surrounding mid-sized cities are growing and expanding, but paradoxically, their downtowns are at a standstill, losing their energy and vitality. That means downtowns must increasingly compete with suburbs to attract residential, cultural and business activity. These cities are also grappling with costs that exceed their spending capacity – yet they struggle to raise funds and generate enthusiasm for renovation projects. But many of their public spaces, especially pedestrian areas, are partially obsolete because they were designed with a car-centric vision of city life.\nIn your book, you give three strategies that cities can adopt to revitalize their downtown. What are they? \n Becoming the home of a prestigious building or high profile social or cultural event, like the Théâtre de Carouge or the Images Vevey Festival, can help rejuvenate a city by giving it a strong identity and character. Bilbao is often cited as a prime example: its once desolate downtown area was turned around completely by the opening of the Guggenheim Museum. Another strategy is to build housing in strategic areas and using innovative architecture – such as urban villas, apartments with rooftop gardens and residential buildings with novel features. An example here would be the recently completed Kalkbreite cooperative, which is a multigenerational housing complex in Zurich. And the third strategy is to renovate public spaces and promote green transportation. This is where we see the biggest gap between city residents’ expectations and what mid-sized cities currently offer. Downtown Sion, which has been remodeled to allow cars and pedestrians to coexist peacefully, is an example of this type of strategy.\nWhat approach did you take for the city of Neuchâtel?\n Cobaty – which is an international association of individuals and organizations involved in construction, urban planning and the environment, and that aims to improve the quality of today’s buildings – gave us free rein on this project. But we didn’t want to outline a utopian vision. Based on a Master’s project being carried out at our lab, we developed projections looking one generation ahead – that is, to the 2030s–2040s. We first had to redraw the contours of the city’s downtown, because by then it will extend well beyond the historical center and probably stretch from the tram yard in the west to Microcity, EPFL’s Neuchâtel campus, in the east. That’s what’s now called the greater downtown area. Then we identified the city’s main points of interest, which attract lots of people: the Ecoparc district near the train station, the university, Microcity, the Jeunes-Rives park and La Maladière stadium. Even though these sites are relatively close to each other, it’s not easy for pedestrians to get from one to another. Obstacles arising from road traffic make moving between them on foot less appealing. Then we looked at projects already underway and ideas that people had brought up, even casually, and decided to use some of them.\nA main pillar of your recommendations for Neuchâtel is extending the lakeshore tram line (Littorail) by 2030...\n We believe this tram line could become the backbone of a revitalized downtown. Our idea is to build attractive public spaces around the new tram stops, and to replace the underground link between Place Pury and the lakeshore with an above-ground one. Investing in this rail-line expansion would also enable the city to create new hubs, such as at Quai Philippe Godet and Rue de la Pierre-à-Mazel, with innovative residential buildings and spaces for shops, offices and cultural activities.\nWhat additional measures do you think the city should take alongside the extended rail line?\n Neuchâtel could use the opportunity created by building the new transportation infrastructure to make green transportation seamless across the city center, thereby making it more attractive. It could also build more housing in the downtown area. Other options would be to build park-and-ride stations around the city limits and create 30 km/h zones along the tram line so that different transportation methods can function smoothly and effectively side by side. In our approach we talk about urban “intensity” rather than “density,” since density is often purely quantitative. Our research aims to not only increase the urban density of Neuchâtel, but also enhance its quality of life and make it easier for people to meet and make the most of their city under the best possible conditions. And our approach can obviously be applied to other European cities of the same size.\nReference\nIntensities Urbaines: Une vision prospective pour le centre-ville de Neuchâtel\n, \npreface by Thierry Oppikofer, Federal President of Cobaty\n, \nLausanne: EPFL, Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies, 2017, 78 pages.\nA copy of the book can be obtained from Cobaty at", "summary": "Downtown areas of mid-sized cities are facing a growing challenge in maintaining their appeal.

{"id": 1442, "text": "One out of two CHESS satellites\nDesigning a satellite and launching it into space is no run-of-the-mill project. Rather, it’s one that forever marks the early careers of the students who take part – just ask the EPFL students who designed the SwissCube, a 1U CubeSat (a small standardized unit measuring 10 cm x 10 cm) launched in 2009. Today, a new group of students, the EPFL Spacecraft Team, is taking on a new challenge. With the support of the EPFL Space Center (eSpace), they are developing a constellation of two satellites, called CHESS, that will be launched in two years. The team is currently seeking additional members and sponsors.\nThis ambitious project has already signed on six universities, three companies, 15 professors and 53 students.* The two satellites will work in concert; each one will be a 3U CubeSat bearing primary and secondary payloads. They will orbit at different altitudes – one will travel in a circular orbit at the low altitude of around 550 km, and the other will travel in an elliptic orbit at an altitude oscillating between 400 km and 1,000 km. The constellation will be launched in March 2023 and remain in flight for at least two years.\nThis project will give the students who participate each year a chance to learn about complicated space technology and gain experience working on a cross-disciplinary team. “It’s a way to learn the real-world skills required in our industry, like team management, coordination, communication and fundraising,” says Emmanuelle David, the deputy director of eSpace. “These are skills you can’t learn only from a book. And they will let the students become operational as soon as they start their first job or when and if they decide to start their own business.”\nOne satellite will be placed in a circular orbit at around 550 km, while the other will travel in an elliptic orbit between 400 km and 1,000 km.\nUnderstanding the exosphere’s chemistry\nIn addition to giving students valuable experience, the CHESS mission will have several other objectives. The first is scientific. As the two satellites orbit around the Earth, they will collect detailed information about the exosphere – the outermost layer of the atmosphere, starting at 400 km above the planet’s surface. Since the satellites will follow separate orbits, they will collect complementary spatial and temporal datasets.\n“The last time this layer of the atmosphere was analyzed in detail was nearly 40 years ago,” says Dr. Rico Fausch, a physicist at the University of Bern’s Space Research & Planetary Sciences Department. “So these updated data will be very useful in helping us better understand the exosphere’s chemistry and how it has changed over time, especially in light of global warming. They will also let us check whether the upper layers of the atmosphere are indeed cooling as recent studies have suggested – which would be another direct consequence of the accumulation of greenhouse gases around our planet.”\nThe satellites will collect detailed data on the various gases in the exosphere – nitrogen, oxygen, ozone, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, etc. – and their isotopes. The overall goal is to study temperature fluctuations, the processes and mechanisms by which atmospheric gases escape into space, and how many free-floating electrons and ions there are in the exosphere. Molecules are much harder to find at high altitudes than low ones, since individual particles collide and bind together much more slowly.\nTechnological advancements\nThe CHESS mission also aims to spur technological innovation. The satellites will be equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, such as the new mass spectrometers being developed jointly by the University of Bern and the company Spacetek Technology AG – two pioneers in this field. The spectrometers will be used to identify specific compounds and their chemical structures by taking mass measurements, and will be lighter and more efficient than the ones used back in the 1980s.\nNew technologies will be tested thanks to the CHESS mission.\nThe satellites will also feature next-generation Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers that are lighter, less expensive, and more accurate than existing models. These receivers are being developed jointly by ETH Zurich and u-blox. They will not only record extremely precise data on the satellites’ positions (on the order of ±1 cm), but also measure air density and the number of free-floating electrons. In addition, the CHESS mission will perform \nin situ\n tests of a new kind of solar panel designed specifically for spacecraft, based on technology developed at RUAG. And because the two satellites will send radio communications to ground stations, they will help create a Swiss-wide X-band network – a communications network using an ultra-high-frequency radio band.\nSwitzerland’s growing space industry \n“I was lucky enough to work with the team that designed, built and launched SwissCube – which is still operational today, some 11 years later,” says Muriel Richard, an aerospace engineer and the co-founder & CTO of ClearSpace. “I’ve been following the CHESS project closely for the past two years, and I see that these students are just as skilled, smart and motivated – and are worth believing in and investing in. They’ll send these satellites into orbit, that’s for sure!”\nCHESS forms part of a broader trend of growing interest in space-industry R&D, both at EPFL and in Switzerland as a whole. The project will help train the next generation of aerospace engineers, pull together skills from a wide range of fields, expand the existing space-industry network and forge ties among the scientific community.\n*\nPartner organizations\n: University of Bern, Hochschule Luzern, HES-SO Valais-Wallis, ETH Zurich, Haute École ARC, Spacetek, u-blox and RUAG\nPresskit\n: \nIllustrations\n:\n ©E.Nardini /EPFL Spacecraft Team", "summary": "The EPFL Spacecraft Team has set itself the ambitious goal of launching two satellites by 2023.

{"id": 1444, "text": "Influenza is one of the most widespread viral diseases and constitutes a major public health problem. For some, it means spending a week in bed; for others, it could lead to hospitalization or, in the most severe cases, death. Scientists at EPFL’s Supramolecular Nano-Materials and Interfaces Laboratory (SuNMIL) within the School of Engineering, working in association with the team headed by Caroline Tapparel, a professor at the University of Geneva’s Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, have synthesized a compound that can kill the virus that causes influenza. Their discovery paves the way to effective drug therapies against the seasonal disease. The research has been published in \nAdvanced Science.\nSymptoms appearing too late\n“With the flu virus, the risk of a pandemic is high,” says Francesco Stellacci, the EPFL professor who heads SuNMIL. “Scientists have to update the vaccine every year because the strain mutates, and sometimes the vaccine turns out to be less effective. So it would be good to also have antivirals that could limit the effects of large-scale infection.” Antiviral drugs already exist, and Tamiflu is the most well-known. But it has one major drawback – it has to be taken within 36 hours of infection or it loses its efficacy completely. And with influenza, symptoms generally start appearing 24 hours after infection. “By the time patients seek medical treatment, it’s often too late for Tamiflu,” Stellacci. “In addition, for antivirals to really work, they have to be virucidal – that is, they have to irreversibly inhibit viral infectivity. But today that’s not the case.”\nEffective and non-toxic\nDeveloping a flu drug is no mean feat – not only does the virus mutate, but the drug has to be innocuous to the human body. “The chances of survival with influenza are high, so any drug has to have little or no side effects. Otherwise it wouldn’t be worth taking,” notes Stellacci. \nFrancesco Stellacci in his lab © 2020 EPFL\nThe flu virus attaches to a cell membrane in order to infect a human body; it then detaches and goes on to infect other cells. Existing antiviral drugs work by attacking the virus inside a host cell and temporarily blocking viral replication. The EPFL scientists took a new approach with their antiviral compound in order to make it both effective against influenza and non-toxic. They developed a modified sugar molecule that mimics a cell membrane, tricking the flu virus into attaching to it. “Once the virus is attached, our molecule exerts pressure locally and destroys it. And this mechanism is irreversible,” says Stellacci. \nBecause this process occurs outside the body’s cells, this synthetic compound demonstrates constant efficacy during the first 24 hours after infection, based on tests conducted on mice. This suggests that in humans, the compound’s efficacy could last beyond 36 hours. According to Stellacci: “The efficacy of oseltamivir” – the active ingredient in Tamiflu – “in mice is almost completely lost after 24 hours.” What’s more, the EPFL-developed compound could be used to create broad-spectrum antivirals – that is, drugs that act against many different kinds of flu viruses. This research focuses mainly on seasonal influenza and does not address efforts to develop a treatment for Covid-19.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a synthetic molecule capable of killing the virus that causes influenza.

{"id": 1446, "text": "“Where is He who has been born King of the Jews, who has just been born? For we saw His star when it rose…” The Gospel according to Matthew is the only one to mention the presence of a bright star that guided the Three Magi to the stable where Jesus was born. This statement is the starting point for our inquiry: was there an extraordinary astronomical phenomenon around year 1 that could be identified with the biblical text?\nThe Bible itself already provides a few clues. Firstly, we can read that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod. Yet, the latter died shortly after a lunar eclipse which happened in the year 4 B.C. Secondly, the census commanded by Cesar, and which was the reason Marie and Joseph fled toward Bethlehem, took place in the year 8 B.C. Thus Jesus’ birth is calculated as being between years 8 B.C. and 4 B.C.\nDid something extraordinary happen in the sky during those four years?\nA supernova, a violent explosion of a star at the end of its life, could provide a good explanation. Unfortunately, these explosions are very rare in our galaxy, and do not remain visible for very long – just two to three weeks. And yet the legend states that the Magi set off after they had observed a luminous phenomenon. They observed the same phenomenon a few weeks later in the sky over Jerusalem, which guided them toward Bethlehem. The unique characteristic of a supernova gives little credence to this hypothesis – it’s estimated that there are only three per century in our galaxy.\nComets have the advantage of coming back in a recurrent manner, since they orbit around the sun. It is a spectacular event which could therefore have made an impact on observers. Besides, according to some Chinese texts, two comets were visible to the naked eye in 5 B.C. and 4 B.C. But if the Christmas star was indeed a comet, why not describe it as such?The scriptures make clear reference to a star, discrediting the theory of the comet.\nThere remains the hypothesis of a conjunction: that is, the apparent convergence of two bodies in the sky. When two planets are practically in the same line of vision, the eye is no longer capable of distinguishing them, and only sees one object, but brighter. A simple astronomic calendar software enables us to see that during the year 7 B.C it was possible to observe, on three occasions, conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn.

{"id": 1449, "text": "The \nAkademik Treshnikov\n, the Russian research ship carrying the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE), is now docked in Punta Arenas, Chile, some 13,000 kilometers from Switzerland. The ship’s arrival in this small city, at the southern tip of South America, marked the end of the expedition’s second leg. The \nTreshnikov\n left Cape Town, South Africa at the end of December on a 90-day voyage around Antarctica. The ship is carrying 50 international researchers who are conducting 22 research projects.\nThe second leg of the journey, which began on 22 January in Hobart, Australia, was action-packed and filled with scientific discoveries. It’s the only leg with a stop on the continent itself, on the Mertz Glacier. This glacier lies to the east of Antarctica, and its tongue reaches into the Southern Ocean – where an 80-kilometer-long chunk of ice broke off in 2010.\nWhile some teams took ice cores on top of the glacier in order to find out more about our climate’s history (owing to the presence of gases and other particles), others had a look at the glacier’s underbelly. Operating a submersible equipped with cameras and robotic arms, the researchers saw what was hidden below the glacier tongue and collected various samples. By analyzing these organisms – sponges, plankton, brittle stars and krill, to name just a few – scientists hope to learn more about how these ecosystems evolve and adapt to climate change.\nThe researchers also ventured onto several totally uninhabited islands, including the Balleny Islands and tiny Scott Island, where they took numerous samples and conducted both cartographical and ornithological surveys.\nAll did not go as planned during this leg, however. The scheduled stop on Macquarie Island was cancelled because of a storm, and the visit to Peter I Island had to be cut short. To make up for this, an impromptu stop was made on Siple Island, a volcanic island located close to the continent and partly embedded in its ice. This island is rarely visited and not well documented, which made the measurements and samples taken there even more valuable.\nOne more leg, three more islands \nThe \nTreshnikov\n reached Punta Arenas on Wednesday and will head back to sea tomorrow for the third and final leg of the expedition. The submersible is no longer on board, and there are no plans to stop on the continent. Most of the projects will nevertheless continue: visits to three subantarctic islands will give the researchers plenty of opportunities to take both ocean and land measurements.\nThe first island, South Georgia, is the largest of the three to be visited. This mountainous island is a British territory. The second island is actually a group of volcanic islands: the Sandwich Islands. The flora and fauna on these two sites are of significant scientific interest, and these islands are important nesting grounds for many bird species.\nThe third stop will be on Bouvet Island, a Norwegian dependency. This 50-square-kilometer island, entirely covered in ice, is one of the most remote places on earth. It is inhabited by elephant and other seals, birds and penguins and can only be reached by helicopter.\nOn 19 March, the ACE expedition will reach Cape Town, completing its trip around Antarctica. But the work will not stop there. A recap of the expedition and preliminary scientific results will be presented to the press the following day. And other, more extensive results will be discussed in conferences throughout the year.\nKeep up with the expedition on .\nSpecial envoy in the heart of the action\nEPFL’s communications team jumped at the chance to send one of its journalists to join the expedition at the edge of the world.

Equipped with a notebook, camera and motion sickness pills, she will report back on how the researchers and crew members spend their time during the three weeks of the expedition’s final leg.

{"id": 1450, "text": "The bacterium responsible for anthrax develops a strategy reminiscent of the Trojan horse tale. Its pathogenic factor is able to penetrate inside a cell in such a way that it becomes completely invisible to both the immune system and medical analysis. Furthermore, it manages to exit the cell several days later, and then it continues to poison other cells.\nThis mechanism was discovered by researchers from EPFL, the University of California at Berkeley and the National Institute of Health in Washington. It finally explains the reason why some living organisms succumb to the disease up to two weeks after the disappearance of the last signs of bacterial presence. \"This remained a mystery for more than 50 years, said Gisou van der Goot, who heads a research unit at EPFL's Global Health Institute. The bacteria would disappear after the administration of antibiotics, but the subject still died a few days later.\"\nUnder the host cell’s skin\n The researchers focused in the way the anthrax toxin was able to get inside the cell. Composed of two elements – a \"protective antigen\" and a \"lethal factor\", the toxin does not merely create a passage across the cellular membrane. Instead, it introduces itself by endocytosis, a process by means of which the pathogen is \"swallowed\" by the cell.\nThe intoxication does not stop there. Once inside the cell, anthrax’s lethal factor is sheltered by the cell’s membrane, forming an \"endosome\", in which it can wait for several days. Then, it can either be released inside the cell, causing it to malfunction, or it can be released towards the external environment inside small vesicles – called exosomes – and get into another cell. \"The immune system has no reason to react, since it only detects exosomes whose membrane is composed by the very same molecules making up the cell’s endosomes.\" explained Gisou van der Goot.\nThis is the first time that scientists have been able to describe the transmission of a pathogen agent for an extended time period and throughout a long distance within the living organism. Their work has been subsidized by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the NCCR \"Chemical Biology\". It was published today in the \nCell Reports\n journal. \"There is still much to learn about exosomes.

{"id": 1452, "text": "Paralysis of an arm and/or leg is one of the most common effects of a stroke. But thanks to research carried out by scientists at the Defitech Foundation Chair in Brain-Machine Interface, in association with other members of EPFL’s Center for Neuroprothetics, the Clinique Romande de Réadaptation in Sion, and the Geneva University Hospitals, stroke victims may soon be able to recover greater use of their paralyzed limbs. The scientists’ pioneering approach brings together two known types of therapies – a brain-computer interface (BCI) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) – and has been published in \nNature Communications\n.\n“The key is to stimulate the nerves of the paralyzed arm precisely when the stroke-affected part of the brain activates to move the limb, even if the patient can’t actually carry out the movement. That helps reestablish the link between the two nerve pathways where the signal comes in and goes out,” says José del R. Millán, who holds the Defitech Chair at EPFL.\nTwenty-seven patients aged 36 to 76 took part in the clinical trial. All had a similar lesion that resulted in moderate to severe arm paralysis following a stroke occurring at least ten months earlier. Half of the patients were treated with the scientists’ dual-therapy approach and reported clinically significant improvements. The other half were treated only with FES and served as a control group.\nFor the first group, the scientists used a BCI system to link the patients’ brains to computers using electrodes. That let the scientists pinpoint exactly where the electrical activity occurred in the brain tissue when the patients tried to reach out their hands. Every time that the electrical activity was identified, the system immediately stimulated the arm muscle controlling the corresponding wrist and finger movements. The patients in the second group also had their arm muscles stimulated, but at random times. This control group enabled the scientists to determine how much of the additional motor-function improvement could be attributed to the BCI system.\nReactivated tissue \nThe scientists noted a significant improvement in arm mobility among patients in the first group after just ten one-hour sessions. When the full round of treatment was completed, some of the first-group patients’ scores on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment – a test used to evaluate motor recovery among patients with post-stroke hemiplegia – were over twice as high as those of the second group.\n“Patients who received the BCI treatment showed more activity in the neural tissue surrounding the affected area. Due to their plasticity, they could help make up for the functioning of the damaged tissue,” says Millán.\nElectroencephalographies (EEGs) of the patients clearly showed an increase in the number of connections among the motor cortex regions of their damaged brain hemisphere, which corresponded with the increased ease in carrying out the associated movements. What’s more, the enhanced motor function didn’t seem to diminish with time. Evaluated again 6–12 months later, the patients hadn’t lost any of their recovered mobility.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have shown that combining a brain-computer interface (BCI) with functional electrical stimulation (FES) can help stroke victims recover greater use of their paralyzed arm – even years after the stroke.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have shown that combining a brain-computer interface (BCI) with functional electrical stimulation (FES) can help stroke victims recover greater use of its paralyzed arm – even years after the stroke.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 29], "noise": false}
{"id": 1455, "text": "Researchers from EPFL and the AN Bach Institute in Moscow have discovered a new and extremely promising antibiotic for tuberculosis, especially effective against multi-resistant strains of the disease, which are on the rise in Eastern Europe. The drug, developed as a European FP7 project, has proven very effective against the disease. In an article published in EMBO Molecular medicine, the researchers show that, when combined with other drugs, the new antibiotic, called “PBTZ169”, can take down even the most resistant strains of tuberculosis bacteria. Following the publication, the researchers formed the IM4TB Foundation on their campus. Supported by EPFL, the foundation aims to bring the new treatment to the market. This unusual step was taken because traditionally, technology transfer from academia to the pharmaceutical industry doesn’t work well with tuberculosis: development costs are too high and the affected countries are often barely able to maintain their own healthcare infrastructures. \n With the IM4TB Foundation, EPFL intends to pick up the slack in the limitations of the industrial model. “The development of antibiotics is increasingly expensive and the countries most affected by tuberculosis are still emergent,” says Benoit Lechartier, co-author of the PBTZ169 study. “The recent closure of the AstraZeneca research center in India illustrates the extent to which it is difficult for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in infectious diseases.”\nHuman trials in 2015 \nLocated on the EPFL campus, the IM4TB Foundation plans to move onto human trials within a year, in collaboration with the University of Lausanne Hospitals (CHUV). \n PBTZ169 shows much promise. It attacks the bacterium’s strong point – the cell wall, which forms an impenetrable shield against antibiotics and the patient’s immune system. “Our molecule makes the bacterium literally burst open,” explains Stewart Cole, director of the study and head of EPFL’s Global Health Institute. \nA cheap but formidable weapon against resistant strains \nThe researchers showed that PBTZ169 is extremely effective in tri-therapy, where it is combined with a standard drug, pyrazinamide, and a more recent one, bedaquiline – and both these drugs have already been approved by the EU and the FDA for multi-resistant strains. “This could be the winning strategy”, says Cole. “These molecules attack different targets in the bacterium. By combining them, we drastically reduce the risk that it will mutate into more resistant forms.”\n As a treatment, PBTZ169 has many advantages. It is not expensive to produce, since it is relatively easy to synthesize. Initial tests have shown good compatibility with other anti-tuberculosis treatments and it is expected to be equally compatible with antiretrovirals used to treat AIDS, as HIV-positive individuals are particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis, and cases of cross-infection are on the rise. \n This molecule is the culmination of many years of research. The preliminary versions were formidable in the laboratory, where they decimated bacteria in culture. However, their effectiveness in vivo was limited. New technologies like structural biology enabled researchers to redesign the molecule so that it could be more rapidly absorbed. “Thus we were able to improve its pharmacodynamics,” explains Cole. “Tuberculosis is often wrongly considered a disease of the past, but in order to fight it, we needed to employ 21st century technologies.”\nMore than 1.5 million deaths per year\nTuberculosis still kills more than 1.5 million people every year. It is uncommon in Europe, although certain countries such as the Ukraine are experiencing a resurgence of patients infected with multiresistant strains. The EU is leading a program that aims to eliminate the disease. The research team at EPFL that developed PBTZ169 received funding from the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission, in the framework of an international collaboration.", "summary": "Even though tuberculosis kills more than 1.5 million people every year, the market is not cost-effective for pharmaceutical companies.

Unfortunately, there are no effective therapies for unstable blood pressure after spinal cord injury”. said Dr. Aaron Phillips, co-lead author of the study (see affiliations below). “We created the first platform to understand the mechanisms underlying blood pressure instability after spinal cord injury.”\nTheir findings, published today in Nature, builds on research that has already enabled several paraplegics to walk again through epidural electrical stimulation (EES). But instead of targeting the region of the spinal cord that produces leg movements, they delivered EES in the region containing the neural circuits that regulate blood pressure. In addition, they adapted the stimulation protocol in real-time based on measurements taken by a blood-pressure monitor implanted in an artery. The monitor measures blood pressure continuously, and adapts the instructions sent to a pacemaker that in turn delivers electrical pulses over the spinal cord. The stimulation is biomimetic, since it recapitulates the natural activation of the body’s hemodynamic system. “The stimulation compensates for the broken communication line between the patient’s central nervous system and sympathetic nervous system,” says Courtine. \n© 2021 EPFL Mediacom Communication visuelle\nThe research team initially tested their method in preclinical rodent and nonhuman primate models in order to understand the mechanisms that disrupt blood pressure modulation after spinal cord injury, and to identify where and how the stimulation patterns should be applied to obtain the desired hemodynamic responses. Jocelyne Bloch, the neurosurgeon who heads the .NeuroRestore research center with Courtine and who carried out the surgical implants, was surprised at how quickly the stimulation protocol worked. “It was impressive to see the blood pressure rise to the target level immediately after the stimulation was applied,” she says.\nThe electrical stimulation treatment provided a huge relief – much more effective than medication.\nRichdeep Gill, first patient\n After these initial tests, the scientists tried their method on a human patient. \n“I suffered from daily episodes of low blood pressure, especially in the morning and evening,” says Richi, 38 years old. “But since I’ve had the implant, it happens much less often – maybe once every couple of weeks.” Himself a surgeon, Richi lost the use of all four limbs after a sport accident. “Those daily episodes of hypotension were a real burden. They also disturbed my vision and prevented me from performing even simple everyday tasks. The electrical stimulation treatment provided a huge relief – much more effective than medication.”\nOne of the physicians working with Richi, Dr. Sean Dukelow, states: “Since using this system, Richi was able to completely stop all drugs he was using to manage blood pressure instability.

This will all take place during a 30-minute virtual game that, according to its developers, is a cross between Pokemon Go and an escape game. For Codex D., the EPFL spin-off behind the app, this game is just the beginning; the company already plans to introduce a new scenario next spring, taking place in historical Paris.\nTo play the game at Forum EPFL, visitors simply need to install the app on their smartphone and launch it whenever they want. As they go through this virtual treasure hunt, they will learn interesting facts about each start-up’s business as well as anecdotes about them. Users will be asked questions along the way, which they can answer by photo or text. Automatic recognition programs will analyze the answers and, if they’re right, send out the next challenge.\n“This game is only the first of a whole series of adventures,” says Stefan Rotarus, one of Codex D.’s founders. He and the other founders – Jeremy Bensoussan and Paul Renauld – are already brimming with ideas. Several new scenarios are in the works, all taking place at various tourist destinations – starting with Paris in 2019. The scenarios are interactive and structured as gamebooks where the story unfolds according to choices that the user makes along the way. Codex D.’s target market is young people and techies, although a family version without time limits is also planned. The scenarios will be designed to provide a fun way of learning interesting details and anecdotes “without having to schedule a session ahead of time, as is the case with conventional escape games,” says Rotarus.\nPlayers writing their own scenarios\nJust like with any online game, the key to success is building a community. Codex D. will aim to engage with the most creative users first through an app that enables them to create their own scenarios – taking place at any location they wish – and post them online. No special programming skills required. Other users will then be able to vote on the scenarios and a ranking will gradually be established of the best ones.\nThe ideal opportunity for applying theory learned in class \nCodex D.’s founders didn’t wait until they had their EPFL degrees in hand to launch their business. Currently third-year students at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, they are big fans of escape games as well as history, programming and even philosophy. This new business venture lets them combine the skills they learned in class with their hobbies and entrepreneurial spirit. According to the founders: “Being at EPFL gives us a chance to launch our start-up without risking anything but our time and energy. And it’s the perfect opportunity for applying all the theory we’ve learned.”\nJust a few months after they created Codex D., they received funding from the XGrant program which also includes training for entrepreneurial-minded students. They likewise received support from the European Venture Program, which brings together universities from across Europe and gives the Codex D. founders an international perspective.\nIn late September the founders launched a crowdfunding campaign (\n) to raise the CHF 9,000 needed to design graphics for characters for their new scenarios, purchase libraries for their scenario development app, hold real-world events to expand their user community and put together advertising campaigns in Paris and eventually other cities. “We hope that this venture will give users a new way of experiencing tourism and their favorite destinations.

{"id": 1467, "text": "It's a bit deceptive, but for the right reason. Restoring motor control after an accident can be a long, painstaking and often discouraging process. So for his Master’s project in computer science, Sidney Bovet studied a way to help patients stay motivated by amplifying their movements in virtual reality. With his system, the movements made by patients’ avatars are larger than the patients’ actual movements – which should help encourage patients to keep pressing ahead with their therapy. The challenge for Bovet was to make sure the avatars’ movements remain realistic and provide convincing haptic feedback.\nEPFL researchers had already been studying movement, rehabilitation and motor control, but Bovet approached the subject from a whole new angle. He examined the way a user’s movements are transformed before being projected in a virtual reality headset. He looked specifically at the motion capture and tracking systems of virtual reality devices, as well as users’ perceptions of their own bodies.\nA barely noticeable difference\nBovet’s research was overseen by Ronan Boulic, who heads EPFL’s Immersive Interaction Group. Bovet developed a distortion function and added it to the motion tracking software used for patients. He opted for a linear function to simplify the analysis. For instance, if a patient moved his arm ten centimeters, the avatar would move its arm by 20 centimeters, for a distortion factor of 2.\nBut that’s just the mathematical part. Bovet also wanted to know how patients perceived the distortion – and especially whether they felt comfortable with it. If the distortion was too obvious, it could become ineffective at keeping patients motivated. The researchers therefore tested different distortion factors on healthy volunteers and asked them if, for each factor, the movements their avatars made corresponded to the movements they actually made. “Our initial tests showed that as long as the distortion factor remained between 1.5 and 2.0, users rarely saw a difference. But beyond that, they quickly caught on,” says Bovet.\nThe more realistic, the greater the distortion\nHowever, Bovet found that what mattered even more than the distortion factor was how accurate the contact reproduction was when patients touched their own bodies. “In virtual reality, if an avatar’s body shape is too different from the user’s own body shape, then the user will have a hard time identifying with the avatar,” explains Bovet. “For instance, if a user looks like Santa Claus but his avatar is slim, then when the user puts his hand on his belly, the avatar’s hand will be several centimeters in front of his stomach, not touching anything. So before we introduced the distortion, we had to make sure that self-contact by a patient would be correctly reproduced by his avatar. Because the more accurate that reproduction is, the more a patient will identify with his avatar, and the less likely it is that he will notice the distortion. That makes for a more immersive user experience.”\nFurther research is needed before the promising results of this project can be used in therapeutic applications. But that research will have to be done without Bovet, who has decided against pursuing a PhD. He will nevertheless stay on the EPFL campus, working on more mature applications at Logitech.", "summary": "Summer series - Students projects. For his Master’s project in computer science, Sidney Bovet developed a system that distorts – or more specifically, amplifies – an avatar’s movements relative to the user’s.

{"id": 1468, "text": "Rivers and riverbanks are worlds in themselves; they are teeming with a rich and varied diversity of plant and animal life. But humans are constantly modifying this environment. Enormous projects such as canals, drainage, dams, diversions, and vegetation introduction have been undertaken to reclaim land and divert or obtain access to water.\nIt is now possible to precisely measure the impact of these alterations on riparian (river zone) biodiversity. Laboratory experiments using microorganisms have demonstrated the relevance of mathematical models that analyze the evolution of populations in these specific situations. The research, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), was conducted by scientists from EPFL, EAWAG (the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology) and Princeton University.\nTheir conclusions should lead to increased caution when considering the alteration of riverbeds. The researchers showed that the observed biodiversity at a given point in the river is highly dependent on all the smaller tributaries feeding into it, and not uniquely on the specific conditions at that particular location. Channeling a branch of a tributary doesn’t just harm the fauna in that stretch of the tributary, but could have consequences on the entire river, even several kilometers downstream.\nA river network in the lab\nIn their experiment, the scientists used trays, each holding 36 boxes of culture media, into which they distributed ten different species of microorganisms (protozoans and rotifers). In one case, they removed the water and its inhabitants from one box and transferred it to another, following a “dendritic” network based on the real path of an actual river and its tributaries. In the other case, they systematically pipetted it into the four closest boxes. “The organisms chosen allowed us to observe the evolution of populations over 50-100 generations, which took a month,” explains Francesco Carrara, a PhD student in EPFL’s Ecohydrology Laboratory (ECHO) and first author on the paper.\nThe main conclusion of the research is that an evolution that follows a branched network ends up yielding a much higher variety of species at locations where waters come together. But that’s not all: populations that live close to the “sources” of each tributary also exhibit a much broader degree of diversity. According to the scientists, maintaining this rich upstream community is indispensable for the development of downstream biodiversity.\nIt is thus now proven that choking off any of these tributaries or modifying any hydrologic network could compromise the natural balance and downstream biodiversity – a fact that can no longer be ignored by anyone considering water management projects that would alter natural waterways.", "summary": "To alter natural waterways is to take a serious risk of endangering species living on the entire length of a river.

That’s why it was selected as one of the challenges that students tackled in the first edition of the Kitchen-Inspired Engineering contest. “The idea behind this engineering challenge was to give Bachelor’s students experience working on an entire project, from developing a design and running simulations to performing tests and building a prototype,” says John Kolinski, head of EPFL’s  (EMSI) laboratory. “Each of the three teams participating in the contest decided which kitchen problem it wanted to solve and came up with its own ideas.”\nThe teams, which consisted of four to five students each, met once a week during the spring semester. They worked closely with their professors and postdoc researchers to develop functional designs that address the specific problem they selected. One team came up with a system for pouring the perfect beer, while another created a device that makes the perfect poached egg. “Those students had to figure out how to deal with eggs of different ages and how to keep the water clean so that the device could be used over and over again. It was impressive to see how effectively the students worked together,” says Kolinski.\nThe beer foam manager project team © EPFL\nFood science on campus and beyond\nFood preparation is an important part of our everyday lives, which is what prompted four EPFL professors – Kolinski, Tobias Schneider (), Pedro Reis () and Selman Sakar () to set up the contest. “We sat down and discussed how we could explore the idea of kitchen-based engineering in a fun, engaging way. It’s a field with tangible applications and could be a vector for bringing food-science teaching and research onto our campus, in association with our talented, smart, ambitious and curious undergraduate students,” says Kolinski.\nEncouraged by the success of this first Kitchen-Inspired Engineering contest, the four professors plan to continue it in the coming years. They hope to create more opportunities for students from different EPFL schools to work with each other and with students from other institutions; one student team taking part in the competition has already contacted the Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL). Such joint projects allow students to learn from each other’s knowledge and experience.\nFrom education to innovation\nIn addition to providing a learning opportunity, the contest can also give rise to marketable innovations. “One of the ideas presented at the competition turned out to be so promising that the team is now looking into filing a patent for it,” says Kolinski.\nEPFL’s  (IFNC) brings university researchers together with food industry professionals. “The Center’s wide range of contacts can provide a solid basis for students to seek out interesting problems and find solutions that make a real impact,” says Kolinski. The IFNC’s objectives are in line with the goals of the Kitchen-Inspired Engineering contest, paving the way to many more food-science projects and research initiatives on the EPFL campus.\nThe Eggcellent project team: Andrey Piskunov, Daniil Morzhakov, Vincent Poszgay and Oskar Helander © EPFL\nAn eggcellent recipe: The secret to the perfect poached egg\nThe first step is to make a clean crack in the eggshell. One of the student teams in the Kitchen-Inspired Engineering contest developed a system for doing this by using a compression machine and a razor blade to create a fissure in the eggshell, which is then propagated to crack open the egg.\nAs eggs get older, the protein in their whites decomposes and becomes watery. That’s what creates flakes in the cooking water when poaching an egg. The students’ system therefore includes a dynamic filtering system to prevent flakes from entering the cooking water so that the device can be used again. The system consists of a slotted ramp that eggs can be slid onto so as to eliminate any residue and then be dropped gently in the water.\n The final step is to keep the cooking water at the generally recommended 80°C.

{"id": 1470, "text": "Inspired by origami, the folding drone developed by a team at EPFL and NCCR Robotics unfurls and takes off in a third of a second. The moment it is turned on, the rotors engage, the articulated arms extend and the drone begins moving. This eager device could be quickly released in large numbers over a disaster zone in order to bring back photos and establish contact with people in need.\nUsing the power of the rotors\n The arms, made of fibreglass and light inelastic polyester, fold up into the shape of a trapezoid. When not in use, they wrap horizontally around the body of the device. What sets this device apart is the ability of the arms to unfold by themselves: the force generated by the rotors causes the arms to move into place. The rotors turn in the same direction, causing the arms to rotate out the opposite way and open around two vertical folds. When the arms are fully extended, their upper section moves horizontally and locks the segment open. Small magnets hold everything in place.\nFor a quadrotor to maintain stability while in flight, two rotors diagonally across from each other need to turn clockwise while the other two spin anticlockwise. The drone must therefore reverse the spinning direction of two of the rotors before taking off. This action takes place automatically in under 50 milliseconds once a sensor has detected the arms have locked into place. This ingenious system has been patented and will be shown on 25 May at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Seattle, which will bring together some 2,000 robotics specialists.\nNatural stiffness\n This quick-starting drone, while simple in appearance, is made up of a number of well-thought-out parts. The stiffness of the arms, for example, is critical to the quadrotor’s manoeuvrability. If these parts were flexible, they could bend and vibrate while in flight, causing instability and reducing the quadrotor's response time to external commands. Stiffness in the arms is a key factor for folding, and by spreading out horizontally the arms avoid imbalances caused by the laws of gravity. There is no need for an additional reinforcing mechanism, which would add to the weight of the device.\nOne advantage of this design is that it’s reversible. “This prototype still needs to be folded by hand, but it takes less than 10 seconds for someone with practice,” said the device’s designer, Stefano Mintchev, who is already planning a version that folds up on its own.\nFuture efforts will focus on fine-tuning. This includes further reducing the weight so larger models can be developed, and strengthening the arms so they can withstand crashes. The principle of origami folding as applied by the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, headed by Dario Floreano, could very well be applied to other types of flying devices in the form of wings, a protective cage or other innovations.", "summary": "Thanks to the power of its rotors, this fold-up quadrotor extends its articulated arms and takes off in a fraction of a second.

{"id": 1472, "text": "“Our student population is increasing rapidly,” observes Michel Chinal, Director General of the International School of Geneva. And the rising number of parents picking up and dropping off their children is creating traffic problems in the village of Founex, just outside Geneva. The bus service offered by the school is too slow. “Parents often say that they would like to sign their children up, but the bus ride is too long.” The buses pick up students in an area bounded by Morges, Geneva and neighboring France. So how can they improve the routes of 11 different buses carrying a total of 283 students to and from school? That’s the problem that was given to the mathematicians in EPFL’s Discrete Optimization Group.\nEPFL chemist Rainer Beck, whose child attends the school, offered to optimize the service during a meeting of the parent’s association. He asked his mathematical colleague Friedrich Eisenbrand to tackle the problem. “Coming up with a simple arithmetic algorithm is not difficult. But that’s not an efficient approach -- due to the enormous number of possible itineraries, the calculations are painfully slow. We needed to develop an algorithm that quickly rejected most routes, so that the computation could be completed before the end of the Universe,” explains Eisenbrand. With the assistance of his PhD student Adrian Bock, the mathematician came up with a solution for this complex problem. Using a few clever techniques, the calculations only take half a day to complete.\nThe researchers modeled student and parent satisfaction using specific parameters, such as “regret” (also called “opportunity loss”), a term used in decision theory. For this case, the regret was the difference between the ideal direct route – in a car – and the route taken by the bus. This parameter enabled the mathematicians to determine the threshold that would convince more students to take the bus. Once the calculations were finished, the gain was impressive: the largest discrepancies between the bus and car routes were cut by 25%.\nOne collaboration, many applications\nOptimization is a technique that can be taken well beyond the problem of ferrying kids back and forth from school. The mathematicians are collaborating not only with world leaders in the telecommunications and airline industries to improve communications devices, but also with insurance companies to streamline their lengthy computations. Thus, in everyday life, as soon as we tap into a network, such as the Internet, we are benefiting from all the optimization work that is hidden behind it. \n In addition to its evident economic advantages, this research can also help meet objectives for reducing environmental impact. “Our school is seriously concerned with pollution, and we are trying to find responsible solutions,” adds Chinal.\nLinks:\n Decision theory: \n Discrete Optimization Group: \n L’Ecole internationale de Genève :", "summary": "Optimizing school bus routes is a lot more complicated than one might think.

{"id": 1474, "text": "This summer, 15 containers were stacked up three levels high in the parking lot between the GC and BM buildings on the EPFL campus. Intended to house the new Student Kreativity and Innovation Lab (SKIL), this structure contains a vast array of research equipment, from miniaturized electronics to large machines like laser cutters and 3D printers. A full kitchen rounds out the creative working space. SKIL is an ENAC initiative to enable students to carry out research projects they design themselves, under the guidance of the school’s professors. This academic makerspace will be inaugurated on 24 September.\nLearning from trial and error \n“During the Solar Decathlon project, we saw that our school was missing an educational framework for students to design interdisciplinary projects, as well as a dedicated workshop where they can test out their own ideas. That’s what prompted us to create SKIL,” says Marilyne Andersen, who spearheaded the initiative during her tenure as dean of ENAC.\nAccording to Samuel Cotture, head of SKIL, “Our lab gives the students a space to develop and carry out research projects either individually or in a group. They can come with a potential innovation already in mind, or with just a vague idea and get the support they need to turn that idea into an innovation. Here they have a safe place to try things out and make mistakes, all while learning valuable lessons about the creative process and project management.”\nAn initiative-taking culture\nSKIL was launched in the spring 2018 semester in connection with a course for third-year Bachelor’s students offered as part of the Design Together program. It aims to encourage interdisciplinary research across all of ENAC’s core disciplines: architecture, civil engineering and environmental engineering. Nine research projects have already been carried out under the initiative – one on uses of mycelium, an environmentally-friendly shower, a system to recover weather balloons, and even a community website.\n“We wanted to foster a new culture where students are encouraged to take the initiative and are supported in their nascent projects. Students should be given a chance to explore their own ideas and learn to work with their own two hands using a variety of materials and equipment. EPFL never had such a facility until now. Today, EPFL students have a new framework for fully developing their creativity,” says Anders Meibom, a SKIL professor and scientific advisor.\nAn open approach to interdisciplinary research\nSKIL is currently being funded by ENAC with the support of central services. It is intended mainly for ENAC students but, because it aims to encourage interdisciplinary research and student initiatives, it is open to any group or project team with at least one ENAC student. Two of the projects already underway – EPFL Rocket Team and Lausanne Racing Team – are examples of this open approach.\nThe new structure will serve as students’ very own fab lab, although technicians will oversee the use of any equipment that requires special training or experience. Otherwise, students can sign up and work when they wish; the lab will be open 24/7.\nSKIL is one of the many initiatives at EPFL to revamp teaching and promote innovation. Other such initiatives include its interdisciplinary research projects, X-grants, student clubs for makers, and the Enable program. SKIL empowers students to lead applied-research projects in their fields on topics they are interested in, and that contribute to their education. The lab and its equipment are being offered hand-in-hand with similar facilities set up under the Discovery Learning Program. Together these resources give students the tools to develop a broad range of skills.\nGoing forward, the lab will adapt to how students actually use it and what their needs are. In addition to accommodating hands-on courses and semester projects, it could also host high-school students during the school’s open-door days, provide training facilities or house a number of other student initiatives.\nThe inauguration ceremony will be held at 5:15pm on 24 September.

{"id": 1479, "text": "In recent years, robotics experts have taken a page from the traditional Japanese practice of origami and come up with light and flexible – and highly innovative – robots and drones. Two types of origami-inspired structures have emerged: rigid structures that have a certain weight-bearing capacity but that break if that capacity is exceeded, and flexible yet resilient structures that cannot carry much of a load at all.\nEPFL researchers, applying what they observed about insect wings, have developed a hybrid origami drone that can be stiff or flexible depending on the circumstances. When airborne, the structure is stiff enough to carry its own weight and withstand the thrust of the propellers. But if the drone runs into something, it becomes flexible in order to absorb the shock and therefore minimize any damage. This research, which is being carried out in Dario Floreano’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, has been published in \nScience Robotics\n.\nSandwich structure \n The drone’s resilience comes from a unique combination of stiff and elastic layers. An elastomer membrane is stretched and then sandwiched between rigid plates. When the system is at rest, the plates hold together and give the structure its stiffness. But when enough force is applied, the plates draw apart and the structure can bend.\n“When we make a drone, we can give it specific mechanical properties,” says Stefano Mintchev, the study’s lead author. “This includes, for example, defining the moment at which the structure switches from stiff to flexible.” And because the drone builds up elastic potential energy when it is folded up, it can unfold automatically when so instructed.\nStructures that are stiff and flexible at the same time have a range of other potential applications as well. As they were developing their drone, the researchers used the same technology to create a soft-touch gripper. The gripper softens once it reaches a certain level of pressure so as not to break the object that it is picking up. This also means it cannot pick up a load that exceeds its capacity.\n“The current trend in robotics is to create ‘softer’ robots that can adapt to a given function and operate safely alongside humans. But some applications also require a certain level of rigidity,” says Floreano. “With our system, we have shown that you can strike the right balance between the two.”", "summary": "An origami-like drone developed at EPFL is flexible enough to absorb shocks without breaking before returning to its initial shape.

{"id": 1481, "text": "It’s a whole new way of thinking about electronics. Excitons – or quasiparticles formed when electrons absorb light – stand to revolutionize the building blocks of circuits. Scientists at EPFL have been studying their extraordinary properties in order to design more energy-efficient electronic systems, and have now found a way to better control excitons moving in semiconductors. Their findings appear today in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nQuasiparticles are temporary phenomena resulting from the interaction between two particles within solid matter. Excitons are created when an electron absorbs a photon and moves into a higher energy state, leaving behind a hole in its previous energy state (called a “valence band” in band theory). The electron and electron hole are bound together through attractive forces, and the two together form what is called an exciton. Once the electron falls back into the hole, it emits a photon and the exciton ceases to exist.\nLast year, a team of scientists from EPFL’s Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES) announced that they had developed a transistor – one of the components of circuits – that runs on excitons rather than electrons (). And for the first time, they were able make the transistors function at room temperature, a major step forward for developing practical applications for this technology.\nTo make the excitons last longer, the scientists layered two different 2D materials on top of each other: tungsten diselenide (WSe\n2\n) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe\n2\n). The resulting material had a shimmering texture that influenced how the quasiparticles were distributed. “With these two materials, the excitons tended to group together in specific places and prevent the current from flowing,” says Andras Kis, the head of LANES and a coauthor of the study. To prevent that from happening, this time the research team added a middle layer of hexagonal form boron nitride (h-BN), which let them see the excitons and their energy levels more clearly.\nThe research team also discovered a way to polarize the exciton currents, meaning the quasiparticles could eventually be used to encode data independently through variations in current magnitude as well as its polarization. That opens the door to even more applications in both coding and data processing on a nanoscopic level.", "summary": "Excitons are quasiparticles made from the excited state of electrons and – according to research being carried out EPFL – have the potential to boost the energy efficiency of our everyday devices.", "claim": "Excitons are quasiparticles made from the excited state of electrons and – according to research being carried out EPFL – have the potential to boost the energy efficiency of her everyday devices.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 29], "noise": false}

{"id": 1485, "text": "What do multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes and food allergies have in common? All these conditions are caused by an abnormal immune response; white blood cells that attack their own body cells or overreact to external elements. In EPFL’s Innovation Park, the start-up company Anokion is developing an extremely promising technology to treat autoimmune conditions and other maladies. The first clinical trials are planned for 2017.\nAnd the range of applications isn’t just limited to autoimmune disease. The body also develops immune reactions to many protein drugs used to treat hemophilia and cancer, for example, and Anokion’s approach may be able to prevent these reactions as well. Now, a group of venture capitalists specializing in pharmaceuticals (Novartis Venture Fund, Novo Ventures and Versant Ventures) has recognized the potential and injected 33 millions Swiss francs (37 millions dollars) into the young company. \nHow to trick the immune system\nAnokion’s technology takes advantage of a behavior exhibited by white blood cells that is still not very well understood. These cells, the advance guard of the immune system, tend to calm down in the presence of cells that are dying normally at the end of their life cycle. Their cousins, the red blood cells, do just that in healthy individuals, turning over en masse on the order of 200 million per day.\n The researchers developed a technique to attach the protein responsible for triggering the immune response onto these red blood cells. A bit like Pavlov’s dogs, who learned to associate the sound of a bell with the appearance of food, the white blood cells associate the “foreign” protein with the millions of calming messages released every day by the red blood cells as they expire. The undesirable immune response disappears. In 2012, the EPFL laboratory led by Jeffrey Hubbell used this technique to prevent disease in mice that were developing type I diabetes. The research was published in PNAS and received an enormous amount of attention. \n “The technology delivers proteins, be they autoimmune antigens or protein drugs, in a manner that re-trains the immune system to accept them as the body’s own,” explains Hubbell “We are delighted that leading biotech venture funds have recognized the value of our approach, providing the necessary financial means to move forward.”\n Anokion’s mission is to commercialize this discovery so that it can move out of the lab and into use as a treatment for disease. For now, the researchers are concentrating on a specific kind of white blood cell, T lymphocytes, that are implicated in many autoimmune and allergic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes. \n The technology has a far wider potential, however. Protein drugs are used to treat diseases such as cancer and a number of genetic diseases such as hemophilia. Despite their effectiveness in treating these diseases, the body frequently recognizes these proteins as foreign and mounts an immune response against them, sometimes even after one or a few doses. After this, the body neutralizes the protein drugs that have been developed to heal it. \n Using Anokion’s technique, the drug could be administered over a much longer period by teaching the immune system to leave it alone. Multiple therapeutic molecules that trigger immune reactions have been withdrawn after clinical trials due to these immunogenicity challenges. The researchers think that many of these could be rehabilitated if the immune response of the T-cells during treatment could be controlled. \n Anokion is planning clinical trials for 2017. They will initially test their technology in conjunction with a drug known to trigger strong immune reactions before moving on to autoimmune diseases.", "summary": "EPFL start-up Anokion has the immune system in its sights.

{"id": 1487, "text": "The patient weighs several tons and is hundreds of meters long. His body is made of concrete, reinforced by a skeleton of steel. Like living creatures, bridges sometimes have health problems. EPFL engineers have developed an imaging technique that permits a quick and easy diagnosis of corrosion in the steel rebar skeleton, the most serious problem that these grand, artistic structures can encounter. This method will result in a considerable reduction in the cost and inconvenience of rehabilitation work. \n The process, developed as part of the PhD research of Alexis Kalogeropoulos, is based on a technique known as “georadar,” which uses microwave radiation to penetrate the insides of the bridge. Numerical treatment of the data yields images that are precise and easy to interpret. The goal is to detect corrosion in the steel rebar – which is the primary weakness in structures made of reinforced concrete. \n Contrary to what one might think, concrete is a porous material. It’s riddled with a network of tiny veins, barely a micrometer wide. “Even the best concretes have this defect,” explains professor Eugen Brühwiler, head of EPFL’s Structural Engineering Group, who led the study. Water infiltrates into the concrete through these tiny channels, carrying a variety of substances, such as chloride ions from salt used for de-icing, into the heart of the bridge. These substances gradually oxidize the steel rebar deep within the concrete. “The same problem occurs in concrete buildings near the ocean, where salt from sea spray is naturally present.” \n Currently, the most widely used diagnostic method is to drill core samples from the bridge deck. A maximum of ten samples can be taken from a 100-meter bridge. “This method is too random to be able to precisely predict the magnitude and duration of rehabilitation, and thus to optimize the intervention,” explains Brühwiler.\n For the past decade, Georadar has been used to get a better picture of what’s going on. Mounted on a vehicle, a device sends radiation into the structure, then records the reflected signal. Much like a sonogram, this method gives engineers a look at the insides of the bridge – and allows them to diagnose various conditions such as construction defects, water pockets, and the presence of chloride ions. The drawback, like in medical applications, is that it takes an expert eye to be able to read the results. Brühwiler shows an image to demonstrate – a piece of a slab from a bridge, sliced up into irregular layers of several shades of gray. “In Switzerland there are only two or three people who are capable of interpreting this data, with at best an accuracy of 70%. I would be completely at a loss.”", "summary": "EPFL engineers have developed a new imaging technique that lets them see the insides of massive concrete bridges.

{"id": 1489, "text": "‘Cell migration’ is a broad term for all the processes associated with the movement of cells from one location to another. It lies at the core of biological processes like embryonic development, immune responses and wound healing, but also autoimmune diseases and metastasis of cancerous cells. Cell migration is achieved through the movement of the cell’s membrane, which is powered by the action of a protein network inside the cell. However, this interaction is affected by the cell’s overall shape, but exactly how this takes place is unclear. Publishing in Current Biology, EPFL scientists have discovered an unexpected link between the 3D shape of the cell and its migration efficiency, and have explained its physics using a simple model of a liquid droplet.\nThe first step in cell migration occurs when the cell extends its front edge – a process called ‘protrusion’. This is driven by the growth of the filaments of the protein actin, which push the cell membrane from inside. Simultaneously, membrane tension controls protrusion by providing resistance protecting the cell from over-extending. But physical laws (e.g. Laplace’s law) dictate that the shape of the cell membrane must play a role in the balance between force exerted by actin and the resisting membrane tension. However, this was not taken into account in previous studies, which used simplified 2D models of migrating cells.\nNow, Chiara Gabella and Alexander Verkhovsky at EPFL have determined the relationship between cell protrusion, shape and membrane tension. Using a model cell type taken from fish scales, the researchers developed a fast and simple way to evaluate the 3D shape of migrating cells by observing them in a chamber filled with a fluorescent solution. By applying various treatments to swell, shrink, or stretch the cells, they were able to observe their impact on membrane tension, shape, and protrusion velocity. The treatments only affected the cells’ shape and migration speed, but not membrane tension. The overall conclusion was that that the more spherical the cell, the faster it moves.\nIn order to interpret these unexpected findings, the researchers modeled a migrating cell as a liquid droplet spreading on a surface. “It is well known that a droplet’s shape and, in particular, the contact angle that it makes with the surface are determined by the tension forces between the droplet, its environmental medium (e.g. air or a different liquid) and the surface on which it moves”, says Gabella. The researchers considered the protruding edge of the cell as such a triple interface, but also added the tension from growing actin filaments inside the cell.\n“From this point of view, a more spherical cell means less load for actin filaments to overcome, and therefore faster actin growth and migration”, explains Verkhovsky. In support of this idea, the researchers found that the cells were also sensitive to the surface’s characteristics just as droplets would be, by slowing down or being pinned at ridges.\n“The emphasis of many studies has been on discovering and characterizing individual cellular components”, says Verkhovsky. “This is rooted in the common belief that a cell’s behavior is determined by intricate networks of genes and proteins”. In contrast, this work shows that, despite their enormous molecular complexity, cells can be described as physical objects. The findings point to a new relationship between a cell’s shape and its dynamics, and may help to understand how cell migration is guided by the cell’s 3D environment.\nThis work was performed in the EPFL Laboratory of Cell Biophysics (LCB), directed by Jean-Jacques Meister, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPCM).\nReference\n Gabella C, Bertseva E, Bottier C, Piacentini N, Bornert A, Jeney S, Forró L, Sbalzarini IF, Meister JJ, Verkhovsky AB.

{"id": 1492, "text": "Can students, looking at the world from a fresh perspective, come up with innovative solutions? The Swiss Space Center (SSC) thinks so. The SSC, based at EPFL, has just launched the “My idea for space” website, which invites students from all universities in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe to share their ideas. This new platform, in addition to attracting all kinds of ideas regarding space technologies, is the home of a major pilot project, in preparation of \nThe project, whose theme is how to create a human habitat in ice, is related to the European Space Agency (ESA) “” initiative. That initiative consists of educational activities that aim to foster closer contact and interaction between the space industry and universities. The aim of these activities is to encourage R&D and the discovery of innovative solutions. This first project will serve, in some ways, as a proof of concept.\n“The space industry has entered a new era,” says Tobias Bandi, the SSC engineer in charge of the project. “In the past, only a few of the world’s major powers had space-related activities, but the industry is now seeing the arrival of new participants such as private-sector companies, developing countries, academic institutions, industries and private individuals. So it needs to take a more open approach. There are 40,000 people working in the space industry but more than a million students gaining technical qualifications each year in Europe, so initiatives like this could potentially make a huge contribution.”\nThe Moon Village\nParticipants in the project are being asked to devise all solutions required for humans to live, long-term, far from Earth in a habitat carved from ice. “Many planets are either partly or fully covered by an ice cap,” says Bandi. “So the project’s theme is highly relevant to future space exploration. Ice also has a number of advantages, since it provides plenty of water and can protect people from radiation and meteorites.”\nThe project will consider all aspects of human life and our day-to-day requirements – such as excavation, architecture, energy systems, sanitation infrastructure, waste management, water treatment and the production and preservation of food – and how they interact. In this, the project is taking a page from the ESA’s Moon Village concept, which aims to solve problems by encouraging people from different disciplines to share their skills and ideas. An example of the type of solution the project is seeking is the design of a pyrolysis reactor that converts organic material (human and other waste) into a form of carbon that can be used either to generate energy or fertilize plants.\nIdeas that are also useful for life on Earth\nFor this project – and for subsequent ones if successful – the idea is to bring together around 30 participants from four to eight different countries. They will form small local groups, each of which will deal with a different aspect while working towards the common goal. Their work will last for one or two years, in line with standard academic timeframes. For participants, the project is an opportunity to work in a team, enhance their technological skills and gain experience in the space industry. For universities, it is a way for them to raise their profile, enhance their students’ education and build new networks and collaborations.\nBandi also notes that the competitive element of the project could well produce ideas that are useful for life on Earth. It is also entirely possible that ideas that turn out to be impractical in space can be usefully applied in a different area, as is often the case with scientific discoveries. “In Europe, we have huge amounts of skills, knowledge and motivation that could benefit the space industry, and vice-versa. With this project, we want to open doors between these various communities.” \nFor more information on the pilot project in preparation of  and to join the discussion, visit .", "summary": "How can we build a habitat on an ice-covered planet?

{"id": 1494, "text": "If we wanted to count the number of people in a crowd, we could make on the fly estimates, very likely to be imprecise, or we could ask each person to pass through a turnstile. The latter resembles the model that EPFL researchers have used for creating a “DNA reader” that is able to detect the passage of individual DNA molecules through a tiny hole: a nanopore with integrated graphene transistor.\nThe DNA molecules are diluted in a solution containing ions and are driven by an electric field through a membrane with a nanopore. When the molecule goes through the orifice, it provokes a slight perturbation to the field, detectable not only by the modulations in ionic current but also by concomitant modulation in the graphene transistor current. Based on this information, it is possible to determine whether a DNA molecule has passed through the membrane or not.\nA thickness of one third of a nanometer\n This system is based on a method that has been known for over a dozen years. The original technique was not as reliable since it presented a number of shortcomings such as clogging pores and lack of precision, among others. “We thought that we would be able to solve these problems by creating a membrane as thin as possible while maintaining the orifice’s strength”, said Aleksandra Radenovic from the Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology at EPFL. Together with Floriano Traversi, postdoctoral student, and colleagues from the Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures, she came across the material that turned out to be both the strongest and most resilient: graphene, which consists of a single layer of carbon molecules. The strips of graphene or nanoribbons used in the experiment were produced at EPFL, thanks to the work carried out at the Center for Micro Nanotechnology (CMI) and the Center for Electron Microscopy (CIME).\n“Through an amazing coincidence, continued the researcher, the graphene layer’s thickness measures 0.335 nm, which exactly fits the gap existing between two DNA bases, whereas in the materials used so far there was a 15 nm thickness.” As a result, while previously it was not possible to individually analyze the passage of DNA bases through these “long” tunnels – at a molecular scale –, the new method is likely to provide a much higher precision. Eventually, it could be used for DNA sequencing.\nHowever they are not there yet. In only 5 milliseconds, up to 50’000 DNA bases can pass through the pores. The electric output signal is not clear enough for “reading” the live sequence of the DNA strand passage. “However, the possibility of detecting the passage of DNA with graphene nanoribbons is a breakthrough as well as a significant opportunity”, said Aleksandra Radenovic. She noted that, for example, the device is also able to detect the passage of other kinds of proteins and provide information on their size and/or shape.\nThis crucial step towards new methods of molecular analysis has received an ERC grant and is featured in an article published today in .", "summary": "One of the methods used for examining the molecules in a liquid consists in passing the fluid through a nano-sized hole so as to detect their passage.

{"id": 1496, "text": "Christophe Ancey, head of EPFL’s Laboratory for Environmental Hydraulics, is an expert in modeling avalanches and other environmental flows. His research group develops complex numerical models to simulate avalanches, yet he remains convinced that models alone cannot entirely replace the keen eye and intuition of an expert. In a recent article, he showed that more sophisticated computational models of avalanches do not necessarily translate to better accuracy in their results. We met with him to discuss the difficulties in modeling and predicting avalanches.\nOn March 3rd, you were called on to provide your expert opinion on an avalanche that had come down a slope beneath a chairlift in Saint-François-Longchamp, France. What did you see when you arrived at the scene?\nChristophe Ancey:\n I traveled to Saint-François-Longchamp the day after the avalanche had come down, as it was important to get a first-hand view of the site. At the bottom of the avalanche, the snow had accumulated six meters deep and two masts near the bottom chairlift station had been destroyed by the hydrostatic-like pressure exerted by the snow. As you can now see on youtube, the avalanche was a sliding avalanche. It had come down the slope so slowly that skiers had time to stop and film it!\nCould this avalanche have been predicted?\n By merely studying the slope, an experienced practitioner could have predicted the possibility of rare avalanche at that site and would have advised to build the chairlift station just outside the depression it was constructed in. But when the chairlift was planned 25 years ago, the risk was evaluated using methods of that time and deemed acceptable. \nHow can you evaluate avalanche risk? \n In the beginning, avalanche risk was evaluated based on naturalist knowledge. Without any calculations, an expert could estimate the trajectory that an avalanche might take and wind up with the right conclusions, basing himself only on observations of the mountain. During the early twentieth century, the first mathematical models were developed; an avalanche was modeled as a sliding block, subject to the forces of gravity and friction. Though simple, this approach provided more quantitative insight than the naturalist approach. And in the 1970s the first computational avalanche models were developed, based on the hydraulic models used at the time. These models, which were popularized in the 1990s, yielded much more precise results than the previous approaches. \nBut the model output didn’t become more reliable...\n Each time you zoom in and try to include more detail, you don’t just multiply problems by a factor, you raise them to a certain power. And there are several different classes of problems; cartographic ones, numerical ones, and problems related to the physics included in the model. \nYou recently authored an article with a surprising conclusion: for certain types of flows, the least detailed numerical models can yield the most accurate results. \n Yes, for this article, we chose to work in the lab. We ran our experiments using Carbopol - basically hair gel - since it replicates many of the important properties of snow avalanches. We let the gel flow down an inclined plain and tracked it until it came to a halt. By comparing measurements of flow velocities, gel depth, and flow distance to predictions by three models of increasing complexity we found, intriguingly, that the crudest model gave the best results. \nHow would you explain that?\n The numerical models we use were developed to study the dynamics of flows that were close to equilibrium, such as river flows on shallow slopes. In these situations, the force of gravity is balanced by the momentum flux and energy dissipation. In our case we are interested in studying flow behavior on steep slopes, where gravity and dissipation play a dominant role and for which part of the flow never reaches equilibrium. Due to their mathematical structure, the same equations that worked well on gentle slopes become difficult to solve numerically when certain terms such as gravity become large. \nWouldn’t you expect sophisticated models that resolve more of the physics to provide better results?\n When you measure a noisy signal, such as the brightness of a flickering light bulb, one thing you can do is average it to eliminate some of the error. By adding more complexity to our models, we’re doing exactly the opposite, refining them more and more. When modeling so-called non-linear fluids such as hair gel or snow, small errors in one variable can propagate to other variables, strongly affecting their precision. So, the more you try to refine your model, and the more physics you try to include, the more you tend to increase these sources of errors. \nMany extreme phenomena such as rogue waves seem to evade prediction. Will we ever be able to predict extreme avalanches?\n Some extreme avalanches seem to follow different statistics than other events. With enough data, we should be able to quantify the probability of future extreme events statistically. But there is growing physical evidence that certain events differ radically from the others as they are able to modify the physical system in which they occur by, for example, switching their trajectory. Putting aside the scientific issues, there is also the question of what engineers and public authorities do with the model predictions - how they deal with risk. We may never be able to characterize the whole system and eliminate risk entirely at a reasonable cost, but we should strive to determine the probability of various scenarios. In essence, the question cannot simply be: Can it happen, but with what probability will it happen?\nPubilcation:\n Ancey, C., Andreini, N., Epely-Chauvin, G., Viscoplastic dambreak waves: review of simple computational approaches and comparison with experiments, Advances in Water Resources (2012), doi:10.1016/j.advwatres.2012.03.015", "summary": "Christophe Ancey warns against relying blindly on the output of computational avalanche models to evaluate the safety of alpine areas.

{"id": 1497, "text": "Is antivirus software already dead? That’s certainly what George Candea believes, and he’s not the only computer security expert who says so. “Large enterprises and government agencies often deploy antivirus software to satisfy legal obligations or to meet contractual requirements, not because they really believe that the software can defend them,” says George Candea. Together with some of his former PhD students, the EPFL professor founded , a startup that is developing a brand new approach to computer security. And their results are promising. In a third party test, their solution warded off all 144 cyber attacks that had been hand-crafted by professional penetration testers, whereas security products so-called heuristic modern caught just over 20 of them. As for the best classic antivirus software tested, it only caught one. “I think it just got lucky!,” muses the researcher.\nSince it was founded in early 2015, Cyberhaven has had revenues of 640,000 dollars. This is encouraging for such a young company, and it enabled them to raise more than two million dollars in a first round of financing from Accomplice, one of the most active early-stage venture capital firms on the US East Coast. Cyberhaven will use the funds to set up its office in Boston and fuel the growth of its R&D team in Switzerland, at the EPFL Innovation Park.\nCyberhaven’s solution is marketed mainly to enterprises and government agencies, which are all targets of sophisticated cyber attacks. Cyber criminals develop targeted malware that is unique to each of their attack campaigns. As a result, most of today’s security products are not effective against such new attacks. So organizations try to have defense perimeters within defense perimeters to build up so-called “defense in depth\". “Information security officers eventually reach the point where their infrastructure is so complex that they simply cannot manage it anymore,” says George Candea.\nDefending “data in operation” against attack\n The team of EPFL researchers developed a completely novel approach to defend sensitive documents against cyber attacks in a way that significantly simplifies an organization’s security infrastructure. The approach complements what is perhaps the most effective security tool today, namely encryption – available in a wide variety of programs we use daily, including Microsoft Office.\nAlas, encrypting documents is not enough to safeguard them. When opening an encrypted file, such as a text document, the application must first decrypt it in order to operate on it. As a result, the document’s data is \"in the clear\". By exploiting vulnerabilities in applications like the Word text editor, malware hijacks them and steals all the documents that the application can access and decrypt. This is a real Achilles’ heel of enterprise security, and encryption cannot solve it.\nCyberhaven’s solution safeguards sensitive documents together with the relevant applications in a safe haven. “Only documents that are safe for these applications can enter the safe haven, and that also protects the integrity of the applications. Our defense technology is based on deep application analysis and has nothing to do with heuristics-based solutions that try to guess malicious behavior. We literally analyze every instruction, we never guess.” Developing the technology took seven years of research at EPFL and is protected by four EPFL patents that have been licensed to Cyberhaven.\nNeutralize malware instead of trying to keep it out\n Unlike traditional defense techniques, Cyberhaven does not aim to keep all malware out of the enterprise but instead prevents it from acting. “Instead of building a fortress with many weak walls, we protect individual workflows that correspond to users’ activities, such as the preparation of a quarterly financial report or the negotiation of a new inter-governmental agreement. By combining document encryption with Cyberhaven, it will no longer be necessary to use dozens of different security products to protect yourself; this will make your security infrastructure simpler and stronger.”\n“Expanding into the USA enables us to continue growing in Switzerland”\n According to George Candea, fundamental academic research with novel perspectives is required to solve today’s computer security problems. “Sometimes the industry can be stuck in a rut, so I believe it is up to researchers to rethink the problems from the ground up and come up with solutions.” And, to fulfill their mission, this team of researchers is taking the execution of their vision in their own hands: Cyberhaven’s leadership is entirely composed of former PhD students from George Candea’s lab at EPFL.\nCyberhaven now has eight full-time employees in Switzerland. One of the co-founders, Vova Kuznetsov, has taken over the reins and is setting up the company’s headquarters in Boston. “Switzerland has exceptional talent and quality infrastructure, but it is also a small market. By expanding into the US, we make it possible to grow our R&D in Switzerland, explains George Candea. And the US is not just a huge market, it is also an opportunity to compete with the very best, and that pushes us to become better.”\n---\nCyberhaven leadership: Dr. Vova Kuznetsov, CEO / Dr. George Candea, Chairman / Dr. Cristian Zamfir, COO / Dr. Radu Banabic, VP of Engineering / Dr. Vitaly Chipounov, Chief Architect\nContacts\nLionel Pousaz, EPFL Press Service, l\n or +41 79 559 71 61\nGeorge Candea, EPFL researcher, \n or +41 79 822 70 15", "summary": "Cyberhaven is developing a new concept for information security.

{"id": 1498, "text": "Biological molecules like proteins contain thousands of atoms that form extremely complex 3D structures. Being able to identify such structures is important because they directly affect how a molecule behaves in cells, and can often make the difference between life and death; for example, mad cow disease is caused by the misfolded version of an otherwise harmless prion protein. Determining 3D structures can be challenging, because biological molecules can be made up of the same atoms connected in the same order, but have radically different structures and therefore radically different effects. In a  that made the cover of\n Angewandte Chemie\n, EPFL scientists used a new method based on infrared and UV lasers to more accurately determine the structure of biological molecules.\nProteins and peptides tend to have extremely complex three-dimensional structures. The problem is complicated by the fact that they often exist as isomers, i.e. they have the same sequence of atoms but different 3D structures. That means that simply knowing what a molecule is made of is not enough to understand what it looks like in three-dimensional space. More information is needed, and that comes in the form of molecular “fingerprints” – characteristics of a molecule that reflect its 3D structure. Clearly, two isomers would not share the same structural characteristics, meaning that more fingerprints would make it easier to distinguish them.\nWorking out the structure of biological molecules begins by making several theoretical predictions of what a molecule would look like, and then matching them to experimental data. Currently, one of the new and promising techniques providing such data is Cold Ion Laser Spectroscopy, which has been developed for over a decade at EPFL’s . Molecules are ionized, cooled close to absolute zero and then shot with infrared and UV lasers at different energies, each producing a different number of molecular fragments. These fragments are then measured by a mass spectrometer, which tells scientists about energy levels within the molecule.\nEPFL scientists have now extended this approach to include a new fingerprint, greatly increasing the accuracy of structure determination. ’s team at LCPM discovered the way to measure precisely how much light a molecule can absorb, which is another fingerprint of its 3D structure. The atoms in a molecule are not at rest; rather, they vibrate at frequencies that depend on how the atoms are structured in space. As there are three vibrational frequencies for every atom, large biological molecules like proteins can have hundreds to thousands of frequencies that together provide a unique fingerprint of the molecule’s 3D structure.\nBy analyzing how Cold Ion Laser Spectroscopy works, the scientists came to the idea of how to measure what is called the absolute absorption intensity for each vibration of a molecule, creating a whole new fingerprint to work with. This makes it possible to identify the molecule’s 3D structure with more certainty, because it is unlikely that two isomers will have the same vibrational frequency and light absorption pattern at the same time.\nThe researchers first tested their new approach with a known antibiotic molecule made of 176 atoms. When that proved successful, they pushed the boundaries of spectroscopy and recorded the first ever “vibrational spectrum” for a protein called cytochrome c, which is critical in processing oxygen in our cells. Their breakthrough two-fingerprint approach advances structural chemistry and can allow scientists to faster and more accurately determine the structure of large biomolecules like polypeptides and proteins, which can have tremendous implications for biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, epidemiology (e.g. prion diseases), molecular biology and genetics, and wider biological endeavors.", "summary": "3D structures of biological molecules like proteins directly affect the way they behave in our bodies.

{"id": 1499, "text": "Widespread drying as a result of climate change is driving an increase in forest fires around the world. By the end of the 21st century, Switzerland is expected to experience many more fires between May and November than it does today. According to experts, the worst-affected areas will be the Aare valley and lowland areas of Bern Canton. Moderate increases are predicted in Ticino Canton and the Engadin, while larger areas of Valais Canton will likely be set ablaze. These fires could trigger erosion and compromise the protective role played by forests. “Forest fires will become commonplace in Switzerland,” predicts Johan Gaume, who heads EPFL’s Snow and Avalanche Simulation Laboratory (SLAB). “The good news is that, unlike with other climate-change impacts, we’re looking at fairly long timescales.”\nIn 2018, a fire destroyed six hectares of trees in Les Voëttes, a forested slope in the Diablerets mountain range in Vaud Canton. Gaume and Xingyue Li, a postdoctoral researcher at SLAB, were keen to learn more about whether and how the damage might have affected the forest’s ability to protect against avalanches in the winter. So they asked two Master’s students in environmental engineering to examine the case for their Design Project, working directly with Vaud Canton’s Environment Department (DGE).\nMap of the position of trees after forest fires © SLAB/EPFL\nMapping avalanche risk\nUsing a digital model developed at SLAB, the students produced a new avalanche risk map to inform the DGE’s reforestation strategy. They found that, although future avalanches will move faster down the slope at Les Voëttes, the relatively shallow gradient will stop them from reaching the houses below. The expanded avalanche risk zone only includes one extra chalet that was previously outside the boundary.\nThe students made two recommendations for the DGE: to plant dense clusters of trees in highly localized spots in order to improve stability, and to employ random planting patterns across the rest of the forest to provide enhanced protection. “Smaller, non-hazardous avalanches play a key role in supporting biodiversity,” says Francesc Molné, one of the two Master’s students who worked on the Design Project. “In ecosystems like these, plants and wildlife are adapted to these types of event, so it’s important that they continue.”\n“Our findings were broadly in line with what we expected, but they’re less alarming than the DGE’s own predictions,” says fellow student Clara Streule. “We know that trees hold back some of the snow during an avalanche,” adds Molné. “The EPFL simulation model factors in the spatial distribution of trees to a high degree of accuracy. The model the DGE uses” – the RAMMS model developed at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF – “isn’t quite as accurate on that front. Perhaps that’s where the difference lies.”\nMultiple parameters\nThe engineering students fed multiple parameters into the model, all of which influence how quickly an avalanche travels and how it behaves. These included the precise position and layout of surviving and damaged trees, the exposure and topography of the terrain, and different types of snow (fresh snow, wet snow, and packed and densely packed wind slabs). Molné and Streule used a drone to take aerial photographs of the area, which they combined using photogrammetry. They also scoured historical records for the region, using the heaviest snowfall figures for the past 100 years in their model.\n“What I found most interesting was putting our faith in a digital model to come up with effective solutions, while recognizing the model’s limits and understanding how different factors influenced the end result,” says Molné. Streule notes: “The complex terrain made the topographic survey challenging. Programming the drone’s flight path put our math skills to the test – I really enjoyed rolling up my sleeves and applying the theory we’d learned in class to a hands-on problem.” She adds: “Making recommendations for Vaud Canton also taught me an important lesson about my future career. If we can’t reverse climate change, a big part of my job will be finding ways to adapt our lifestyles and shield ourselves from its worst effects.”\nMore collaborations to come\nThe students’ method could be applied to protection forests across Europe. “This pilot study was a chance to test our digital model,” says Gaume. “Now we’re keen to see how far we can take it.” His enthusiasm is shared by Vaud Canton. “This research gives us new insights into how forested slopes protect against avalanches at low altitude and will help improve our forest maintenance strategy,” explains Jean-Louis Gay from the DGE’s Forestry Inspectorate Division. “We’ll be working with EPFL again at other sites in the Canton.” A scientific paper based on the students’ work is also in the works.\nLes Diablerets, in Vaud Canton. © iStock", "summary": "Two EPFL students have compared the ability of a forest in Vaud Canton to protect against avalanches before and after it was ravaged by fire in 2018.

{"id": 1503, "text": "EPFL hasn’t missed its rendez-vous with History. Discovered during the preparatory phase of the site of the School’s future Congress Center, the vestiges of an imposing Roman building will be rendered spectacular thanks to the competencies of two start-ups resulting from two laboratories.\nIn order not to delay the building work unduly, the archeologists commissioned by the Canton to work on the site have had to proceed sector by sector. As soon as they had finished recording information about a “block”, the excavators swung into action. “As such, the foundations that we uncovered didn’t justify keeping,” explains Christophe Henny, in charge of the digs performed by the company Archéodunum. At no time it has been possible to have a complete overview of the Roman villa which may have belonged to Dorinius, a landowner whose existence was assumed by archaelogists because of the place name “Dorigny”.\nThanks to Sensefly and Pix4d, two start-ups resulting from EPFL laboratories, this inconvenience will however be short-lived. In fact, Jean-Christophe Zufferey, director of Sensefly and scientist at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems , regularly sent his “swinglet CAM” drones over the excavation site. These entirely automated flying wings, equipped with a camera, have thus been able to immortalize in high definition each stage of the discovery. Pix4d, a company in the process of being created out of the Computer vision laboratory (), is specialized in image compilation. Its ultra-powerful algorithms will thus be capable of faithfully piecing together the plan of the villa in its entirety, and with its outbuildings, as if it had been possible to take a single aerial photograph.\nJean-Christophe Zufferey, director of Sensefly, about to launch one of his drones. © Alain Herzog - EPFL\nA villa and its outbuildings\n These discoveries – most of which have already disappeared – deserve however that we give them some special attention. Three elements probably dating from the High Empire (between 1st century B.C. and 3rd century A.D.) have been clearly identified.\nOn the south-east side was a barn (25m x 22m) with three small closed off units and a large room taking up most of the surface of the building. Part of the ground was probably covered with flooring, presumably since burned, as witnessed by the blackness of the ground over a three-meter wide strip along two of the walls. The archeologists have also found pits, whose use is yet unknown – perhaps for blacksmithing activities. They may even date from before the time of this building, as evidence of a previous occupation has also been found.\nFurther north-west, there was the main building, housing the living quarters. An imposing building in the shape of a ”T”, whose facade extended over 27 meters, included at least one wing, whose foundations have been found on the left-hand side of the building. “Some elements may lead us to presume a symmetric plan, with one wing of the same type on the right-hand side”, suggests Christophe Henny.

{"id": 1505, "text": "Lockdown had just been imposed, and hundreds of semester projects were suddenly in question. Two long weeks of uncertainty followed, until an announcement was made of how students could earn their course credits – the Lauzhack. Despite skepticism, anxiety and doubt, a number of students spent their Easter weekend on a hackathon devoted to finding real-world solutions to problems raised by the pandemic.\nWe spoke with several participants who, far from defeated, came out of the experience with a new sense of their capabilities.\nAn emotional roller coaster\nTheir names are Lison, Florence, Camille, Ekaterina, Aurélien and Tristan. Their reactions ranged from genuine enthusiasm to misgivings and apprehension. Having been very keen on their planned semester projects, it was difficult for them to put them aside, not knowing if they would later come to fruition. But without access to a lab or equipment, they had to overcome their frustration and welcome this new challenge.\n“I was at a loss about what to do,” says Camille Montemagni, a Bachelor’s student in computer science. “Since I couldn’t reuse the basis of my original project – calibrating an avatar in augmented reality using motion capture – I had to start from scratch and find a new project. It was really stressful, especially since I’m not very fond of hackathons, but I needed those eight credits.” In the end, Camille and her team designed a \n.\nEven for those who didn’t need to start fresh, joining Lauzhack was not an obvious choice. “I didn’t see what I could contribute, since I’m not a biologist or an epidemiologist,” says Ekaterina Svikhnushina, a PhD student in computer and communications science. “But then I realized that the hackathon wasn’t just about finding a vaccine, but rather involved all sorts of crisis-related issues, above all ones related to helping people.” She oversaw the \n project, a support service for people at risk. The idea came to her when her grandfather called her with a computer problem. She didn’t need the credits, but she wanted to participate and be of service.\nFlorence Stoffel, a Master’s student, had the same reaction: “I saw the hackathon as a chance to put my skills and expertise to work. After all, we’re trained for this, and now is the time when we chemists can and should play a part. This is our moment.” She came up with the idea of  to identify new medicines that could target viral proteins, based on existing drugs that already have this property. Even though she is not a computer scientist, she quickly contacted experts using the Lauzhack platform and the team got to work.\nA scientific experiment with a human dimension\nFinding a project and team members wasn’t obvious. “I switched projects partway through because I didn’t feel sufficiently useful; my skills didn’t match what was needed,” says Aurélien Kinet, a Master’s student in electrical and electronic engineering. “I felt on more familiar ground when I joined the \n project. For example, I was able to use my skills in Python coding, machine learning and dataset management. I was really happy with my team, and it was also interesting how my teammates’ nationalities shaped their visions.”\nA lucky few were able to work on projects related to their studies. Lison Marthey, a Master’s student in materials science and engineering, thought the hackathon would focus on coding and IT. “I wanted to concentrate on materials, so tackling questions related to surgical masks was the obvious choice – how to sterilize them, to make them more comfortable, and to add a moisture indicator so that wearers would know when to change them.” The \n project was born. “It was a great opportunity. At first I had my doubts, but in the end the group really worked well together and I’m glad that I took part,” she says.\nIt was an intense, exhilarating experience for everyone involved. “The goal was to have a concrete and transferable result by the end of the weekend,” says Tristan Vouga, a member of the \n team. “Working against the clock was inspiring for the team, and it forced us to focus on what’s most important.” Indie-Pocket, designed to be integrated into the SwissCovid app, locates exactly where people carry their smartphones. He adds: “It fostered a spirit of healthy competition, and confirmed that this was the right way to move forward. In the end, the hackathon was tough, but it brought out the best in us.” Florence, however, expressed some reservations: “Of course, the goal was to come up with a working prototype. However, due to the nature of the project, certain details were not given adequate attention, even though they might make all the difference. If I had been more relaxed, I would have spent more time on them. People work differently under pressure, and our team had the added challenge of being spread out over different time zones.”\nAs for Camille, the experience was a real shot in the arm: “Seeing something tangible come out of the project gave me self-confidence, even though I started from zero and worked in areas in which I’m not proficient. I’m much more sure of myself now.” The same is true for Ekaterina, who “tried, accomplished and learned things that I wouldn’t have under normal circumstances. We were motivated and convinced that our problem was worth solving.”\nWhat’s next?\nThe hackathon may be over, but the projects continue. The \n garnered by \n enabled the team to collect even more sound samples in order to fine-tune their project. “The dataset is growing and it’s taking me longer and longer to clean up the data,” says Aurélien. “We now need to incorporate medical data from confirmed COVID-19 patients. After that it should go faster, but the app will be released only when it’s 100% reliable.”\nThings are also going well for Tristan: “We were able to produce several deliverables: data collection, the app to harvest it and the algorithm for the tracing apps. It’s invigorating to work on a concrete project. It is a real breath of fresh air compared to our usual research work.” Florence, who had the bad luck of losing all of her raw data, reflected philosophically, “Sometimes you learn the hard way. But if this were easy to solve, it would have been done by now.”\nAnd now? “Once lockdown is over, I’d really like to meet – in person – the members of my team I don’t know,” Lison says.\nFor most of these students, this was their first hackathon. Given the unique circumstances and the lessons learned, we’re willing to bet it will remain an unforgettable experience.", "summary": "The Lauzhack hackathon gave students a chance to redirect their semester projects towards issues related to the coronavirus.

{"id": 1510, "text": "The future of the Earth’s poles is critical. In the coming decades, major international negotiations will focus on the polar regions, which are bearing the brunt of global warming. Switzerland, intent on having its voice heard and making a contribution in a field in which it already has solid expertise, today announced the creation of the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI). This new interdisciplinary center will be devoted to researching the Earth's poles and other extreme environments. The SPI, based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), is a consortium of Swiss universities – EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, ETH Zurich and the University of Bern – and was cofounded with Editions Paulsen. Officially supported by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), the SPI is a Swiss initiative with a decidedly international mission.\nPolar explorer Frederik Paulsen is proud to be involved in this initiative: “The Swiss Polar Institute will help drive research in extreme environments, contribute to progress in the field of polar science and promote cooperation among public and academic institutions, industry and private-sector partners.”\nTo mark its launch, the SPI is organizing a major project: the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) will be the first scientific expedition to fully sail around the southernmost continent. The purpose of this expedition, with key logistical support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals, will be to measure and quantify the impact of climate change and pollution in the Southern Ocean.\nMore than 50 researchers \n At the end of December 2016, some 50 researchers from around the world will set off for three months onboard the Akademik Treshnikov, a Russian ship dedicated to scientific research. Twentytwo research projects – submitted by teams from Switzerland, the UK, France, Australia, etc. – were selected for the expedition. The projects range from glaciology to climatology, biology and oceanography.\nThis expedition neatly illustrates the SPI’s mission: the Swiss Polar Institute is designed to be a platform for global experts in polar research to bring their combined knowledge to bear – such as by drawing parallels between polar environments and alpine regions. This is similar to what is being done in the field of space research. “Swiss universities owe their competitiveness to a shrewd approach of competing and cooperating with each other at the same time,” said Mauro Dell'Ambrogio, State Secretary for Education, Research and Innovation. “The Swiss Polar Institute is a great example of intelligent cooperation.”\nThe Institute’s role will also be to assess the state of the Earth's poles and climate in general, to outline the many challenges we face going forward and to keep the public informed. Its work is bound to have an impact on the development of new technologies for extreme environments. The SPI will be an important asset for Switzerland, which aims to play a key role in international agreements on the future of the polar regions. This includes discussions on the Antarctic Treaty.\nThe Earth’s climate balance is at stake \n The Earth’s poles are fundamental to the planet's climate balance, and learning more about how they work through research is crucial. The climate, which is regulated by the interaction of atmospheric and oceanic currents, acts like a massive heat engine. This engine is powered by the transfer of heat between polar and tropical regions: currents of icy water deep in the ocean travel from the poles toward the equator, while warm water and air move across the ocean’s surface towards the frigid zones. This complex and fragile mechanism also plays a key role in the carbon cycle, in which the ocean absorbs a significant amount of the CO2 in the atmosphere.\nHuman settlement and activities may be concentrated far from the Earth’s poles, but they directly affect polar environments. “The poles are essential for climate balance, but they are also the regions where changes are most apparent: that’s where the largest temperature differences have been recorded,” said Philippe Gillet, vice president of EPFL and a specialist in Earth and planetary science. The 2015-2016 winter was the mildest on record at the North Pole. December and January temperatures there, normally close to -20°C, were above freezing.\nPotential discoveries \n The 22 projects selected for the expedition cover a spectrum of topics, including the composition of plankton, threatened animal species, the presence of microplastics in the surrounding water, the carbon cycle, microorganisms that flourish in the ocean depths or in ice, and the impact of waves on the coasts.\n“The ACE initiative is a unique and precious opportunity”, says ACE Panel member Prof. Jean Jouzel, glaciologist and climatologist. “Bringing together multi-disciplinary projects to circumnavigate Antarctica and gathering scientific evidence in a region so remote and yet deeply affected by human activity and climate change will hugely contribute to our understanding of past and future evolution of the Southern Ocean. It is a key region for the carbon cycle and the Antarctic continent which may significantly contribute to the sea-level rise in the coming centuries“.\nThe projects will make use of the most advanced data collection and analysis technologies available. In addition, because they will be run in extreme environments, the projects will provide insight into biochemical compounds and microorganisms that up to now have been studied little if at all. The results could lead to discoveries and new and interesting applications in the fields of biotechnology, medicine and environmental science.\n---\nPress kit\n Contacts\nEPFL\n Philippe Gillet, vice president for academic affairs , +41 21 693 70 58\n Sarah Perrin, press officer , +41 21 693 21 07\nFederal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL\n Gottardo Pestalozzi, communications , +41 44 739 22 40, mobile: 41 79 224 20 18\nETH Zurich\n Claudia Naegeli, media relations officer , +41 44 632 41 41\nUniversity of Bern\n Martin G.

{"id": 1512, "text": "Tumour cells present antigens or protein markers on their surfaces which make them identifiable to the host immune system. In the last decade, cancer vaccines have been designed that work by exposing the patient’s immune cells to tumour-associated antigens and so priming them to kill cells that present those antigens. These have caused much excitement, not least because by acting so specifically on cancer cells, they could potentially eliminate the unpleasant side effects of chemo- and radiotherapy.\nLike soldiers protecting a fort\n However, clinical trials of such vaccines have had a very low success rate to date, mainly because tumours have various mechanisms for evading detection by immune cells, even when those immune cells – called T cells – have been primed to seek them out. Those mechanisms are, in general, poorly understood. But in a paper to be published this week in \nCell Reports\n, the laboratories of Melody Swartz at EPFL and Stéphanie Hugues at th the University of Geneva (UNIGE) provide a key insight into one of them. They describe for the first time how, like soldiers protecting a fort, lymph vessels surrounding a tumour ward off T cell attack.\n Plenty of research has shown that tumours can induce the growth of lymph vessels in their vicinity, and that this growth is correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis. It was assumed that these lymph vessels simply provided an escape route for cancer cells, transporting them to distant sites. In the new study, led by postdoc Amanda Lund, the researchers show that lymph vessels actually suppress the immune response, deleting the attacking T cells or leaving them “functionally exhausted” by the time they reach the tumour.\n They studied a type of tumour that expresses large amounts of VEGF-C, a molecule that is naturally expressed in humans and that stimulates lymphatic growth. Having engineered the tumour cells to express a foreign antigen, they compared the efficacy of a vaccine designed to prime T cells to kill cells carrying that antigen, either when VEGF-C was present or when its activity was blocked. With VEGF-C suppressed, the vaccine’s efficacy increased and tumour growth slowed fourfold.\nA weakness in cancer’s defense system exploited\n The researchers went on to show that the endothelial cells which line lymph vessels “scavenge” tumour-specific antigens and present them to the tumour-specific T cells in a manner that induces their exhaustion or deletion. According to Melody Swartz, that means that first targeting the lymph vessels associated with a tumour could, in theory, significantly increase the efficacy of existing cancer vaccines. “It would be like removing the soldiers from around the fort before sending in your opposing army,” she says. “If you disable the lymph vessels’ suppressive functions, our data suggest that tumour-killing T cells would do their job a lot more effectively.” Future clinical trials are needed to put that theory to the test.", "summary": "Researchers at the EPFL have identified an important mechanism that could lead to the design of more effective cancer vaccines.

{"id": 1515, "text": "The energy-intensive construction industry is among the biggest culprits when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and rising global temperatures. But with storms, floods, heat waves and other natural disasters set to grow in frequency in the coming decades, the built environment is also one of the victims of climate change. The urgency of the situation calls for a rethink – one that starts with architects.\nThe construction industry makes up a sizable share of the Switzerland’s environmental footprint, accounting for  – ahead of any other sector – and a large portion of the country’s energy consumption. Labs at EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) are pushing the boundaries of innovation and developing sustainable design and construction methods that will shape the buildings of the future. One example is the , led by associate professors Martin and Anja Fröhlich, where researchers are investigating how recycling and reusing building materials could conserve energy and resources. \nShifting mindsets\nIn 2016, EAST began exploring more efficient ways to recycle and reuse unwanted construction materials and disused structures. This new way of thinking, which considers buildings by type and potential, is part of a wider effort to change the way architects are trained. It takes its cues from the concept of \nBaukultur\n, a holistic approach to built-environment design. Every year, the lab sets students a challenge: to design and build mock-ups from recycled materials. Working in teams of 30, they have to think creatively and come up with two designs using the same constituent parts. In one project, students  near Lausanne.\n“We want our architecture students to consider sustainability at every stage of the design process,” says Martin Fröhlich. It’s a view shared by Tiago P. Borges, an architect and assistant at the lab: “In five years, or maybe a decade from now, today’s students will be tomorrow’s leaders. If we want them to change the world, we have to press home the right values now.”\nEAST’s work will take center stage at the third , held every two years in Lugano by the International Institute of Architecture . This year’s event, which focuses on the theme of reuse, will run from 1–3 October. Fröhlich will take part in a panel discussion entitled “Reuse at School” alongside Prof. Martin Boesch from the University of Lugano (USI) and Prof. Jan de Vylder from ETH Zurich.\n“It’s important to get young people thinking about sustainable design from an early age. It has to start at school, long before they come to us. By the time they get to university it’s almost too late, because it’s the last opportunity to shift mindsets. Students need to take the driving seat, not the back seat – they should be acting, not reacting.”\nMartin Fröhlich\nWith a structure composed of elements of a scaffolding and a paraglider, EAST's students designed and produced a prototype pavilion for the Swiss Alpine Club. © 2020 EAST EPFL\n“Something needs to change”\nThe event will also feature an exhibition, entitled “Rather Than – Sustainable design principles in the work of Studio EAST”, that takes an in-depth look at the design and construction of three of the pavilions. “We want to show that demolishing a building isn’t the end of the story,” says Tiago P. Borges, who’s co-organizing the exhibition. “Why throw away perfectly serviceable materials when we can reuse them and conserve resources in the process? Given the scale and breadth of the construction industry’s footprint, wasting materials is just irresponsible. Something needs to change – and that starts with better design.”\nResearchers at EAST argue that most of the solutions needed to make buildings more sustainable and less energy-intensive are already out there. The challenge now is to abandon the wasteful practices of the past – a process that will require a concerted effort from architects, construction-industry professionals, clients and society at large.", "summary": "In order to shrink the construction industry’s vast carbon footprint, architects will need to build recycling and reuse principles into their design process.

{"id": 1516, "text": "“I never thought I’d become a professor. I never considered myself to be particularly gifted,” says Aleksandra Radenovic. “But I’ve always enjoyed pushing my boundaries and trying new things.” That curiosity – coupled with an avid interest in science – is what prompted her to pursue a career in research. And she has no regrets. \nRadenovic, who is from Croatia, developed an interest in science after being inspired by a high-school teacher. “I initially wanted to become an archeologist and so I decided to study Latin and Greek,” she says. “But then my physics teacher got me enthusiastic about that subject. So I enrolled at the University of Zagreb as a physics major, and later switched to biophysics so I could combine physics and biology.”\nLessons from the conflict\nRadenovic’s life was disrupted by the Yugoslav wars that ravaged the country between 1991 and 1995. Fortunately, the capital city of Zagreb was spared the worst of the fighting. “I don’t see myself as a victim – I didn’t lose my house or have to flee the city. But it was a time tough, and my whole family was really lucky,” she says. However, her old high school was bombed during her first year at the university. Radenovic recalls her experience during the war with a sober tone, adding that it taught her some important life lessons. “Experiences like that shape you,” she says. “I learned that nothing is permanent and everything can change in the blink of an eye. So now I try to live in the present and do what I can to build a better future.” \nAfter graduating with a physics degree, Radenovic obtained a PhD in biophysics from the University of Lausanne. She was one of the last students to graduate before the fundamental sciences were transferred to EPFL. Radenovic then worked as a postdoc fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, under the Swiss National Science Foundation’s postdoc exchange program. “I really liked how open-minded and international people were at Berkeley, as well as the freedom we were given. It was fun being a foreign student in that environment,” she says. \nRaising responsible citizens \nIn 2008, Radenovic was awarded an assistant professor position in EPFL’s bioengineering department. “I was glad to come back to Lausanne because I’ve always liked this city,” she says. “And as a biophysicist I feel at home at EPFL, since it’s a cross-disciplinary school by nature. I appreciate the spirit of teamwork here and the discussions you can have with people who share the same interests. It’s a young, dynamic school.” Radenovic also chose to start a family in Switzerland. “This country – unlike the Balkans – doesn’t have a violent past. I’d like my children to grow up in a climate of peace and respect, so that they can become global citizens and, as they get older, help protect our planet.” \nIn her laboratory at EPFL, Radenovic aims to create an atmosphere where people feel free to express their opinions. “I also think it’s important to give each student a chance,” she says. “I support and encourage my students as much as possible. You can’t work with people who you don’t appreciate.”\nBio\n1975: born in Zagreb, Croatia\n1994–1999: studied physics at the University of Zagreb, Croatia \n2003: obtained a PhD in biophysics from the University of Lausanne (under Prof. Giovanni Dietler)\n2004–2007: worked as a postdoc fellow in the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley\n2007: worked as a visiting scientist at NIDCR, one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n2008–2015: worked as a tenure-track assistant professor in the bioengineering department of EPFL’s School of Engineering\n2015–present: works as an associate professor (tenured) in the bioengineering department of EPFL’s School of Engineering", "summary": "Summer series: A calling for research.

It is equipped with a screen that switches between showing various performance stats and data on the surrounding environment. Skiers working their way up the slope see in real time the length of their turns going up, their cadence, the symmetry of their steps, the temperature of the snow, and more. Skiers may use this info to modify their route, and they can even program objectives into the device. It was created by an EPFL spin-off and a local equipment maker.\nThe device includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a barometer. It is called the Pomocup, and its sensors can collect 1,400 pieces of data per second. It calculates the movement of the skis in 3-D relative to the slope – and relative to the other ski if each one is equipped with the device. “A particular detail of backcountry skiing means we can achieve good precision relatively easily: when one ski glides, the other is still for long enough to allow the algorithms to correct any errors,” said Benoît Mariani, co-designer of Pomocup.\nBut doesn’t the deep snow cover the little screen on the skis? “The routes are already cleared before competitors come through. Also, the rounded shape of the device means that snow quickly slides off the sides,” said Mariani. For several years now, this cross-country ski buff has been developing, with his start-up, movement analysis sensors for medical, safety and sporting purposes. He started working on a preliminary version of this backcountry skiing device during his microengineering studies at EPFL. After linking up with Pomoca, which specializes in backcountry ski gear, he perfected the system.\nUseful for mountain guides\n The professional version of the Pomocup is meant for mountain guides, who can quickly be apprised of certain information without stopping or taking off their gloves in order to fish out other devices. “They’ll be interested in data like the air and snow temperature and the slope incline, in order to assess the avalanche risk,” said Mariani.\nRecorded data can be viewed on a smartphone, tablet or computer, using apps similar to those developed for running.

{"id": 1523, "text": "Geneva and Casablanca loom large in people’s imaginations, but for vastly different reasons. Geneva sits on the tranquil shores of Lake Geneva; it’s known as the birthplace of Calvinism and is the archetypal international city. Casablanca, the “White City,” faces the unbridled Atlantic Ocean and was immortalized in Michael Curtiz’s eponymous movie. But there’s one thing these two cities have in common: they’ve both been shaped by the forces of globalization, which have been gaining momentum since the late 20th century. In a landscape marked by neoliberalism, competition between metropolises, and the cross-border flow of people, goods and capital, both Geneva and Casablanca can be called globalized cities, and both are vying to increase their appeal through major urban development projects.\nKamil Hajji grew up in Casablanca and moved to Switzerland to attend university. He holds an architecture degree from EPFL and completed his PhD at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR). After seeing first-hand the rapid transformation of Casablanca and then later Geneva, he decided to focus his thesis research on a comparison of their development patterns. He looked in particular at how their urban development projects are being informed by market forces and local resistance. His thesis public defense took place on October 29. \nGlobalization is a fascinating phenomenon. I saw it transform Casablanca completely, and as I began visiting other world cities, I saw a lot of similarities among them. I wanted to know what was behind that\nKamil Hajji​​​​​\nAn exhaustive study\nHajji examined the development projects for the new  and Casa Marina neighborhoods in Casablanca, and for the new  and  districts in Geneva. His aim was to understand exactly how each one has been influenced by globalization. “Globalization means adopting essentially the same public policies and strategies in cities around the world. Capital is moving more freely and local governments are seeking to attract it and keep it local. So they are implementing strategies with very similar fundamentals. You can see that in their buildings – high-rises and other urban structures designed to bring people in,” says Hajji. \nHe performed an exhaustive study of each project, conducting interviews with policymakers, investors, local groups, and people who were removed from their homes to make way for the development work. He also read through the minutes of neighborhood meetings and searched carefully through city archives. “I wanted to trace the projects back to the very beginning and see exactly how the process unfolded,” says Hajji, who undoubtedly drew on journalistic skills inherited from his father. “I also wanted to see whether the neighborhoods would turn into gated communities where people of a certain social class close themselves off from the outside world,” he adds. “In Morocco I saw the adverse social effects of globalization – that’s an issue I care about and wanted to understand better.”\nLocal resistance \nBy comparing these two globalized, dynamic cities with very different political systems, Hajji gained unique insight into the underlying mechanisms of globalization. In Switzerland, he saw a semi-direct democracy where local resistance can block profit-driven initiatives. In Morocco, where the constitutional monarchy was reformed to introduce greater democracy after the Arab Spring protests in 2011, he saw how local resistance movements are able to take shape, and how much leverage they have with local governments and investors. In both countries, Hajji assessed how much power is held by municipalities – the lowest rung of democracy.\nThe CFC First Tower, 122 meters, in the heart of Casablanca's Casa Anfa business district. © skyscrapercity\nIn the PAV project in Geneva, Hajji found that Switzerland’s local resistance system led to lengthy negotiations and a series of concessions that resulted in a final development plan considerably different from the initial proposal. However, in Casablanca, the more top-down approach results in plans “that are closer to the developer’s initial, globalized vision. That’s because local resistance is not organized enough and isn’t sufficiently represented in the political sphere to have much of an impact,” says Hajji. \nWith his PhD under his belt, Hajji is now completing a post-doc at LaSUR and works for , an EPFL spin-off. Based on his research, he believes that democracy can change how globalization is implemented locally. “In more democratic countries, the image of a neoliberal, globalized city changes shape as local considerations are taken into account,” he says. “These environments also tend to produce cities with greater social cohesion.”", "summary": "For his PhD thesis at EPFL, Kamil Hajji compared urban development projects in two major cities – each a business and financial hub, but in countries with very different societies and political systems.

Should it be housed in a new high-profile building or in an existing one? 117 students in the final year of their Master's degree in architecture were given a challenge: they had one semester to come up with proposals for EPFL's future Student Center, a place for students to meet up and hang out. But there was a catch: they had to develop a concept based on the idea of ‘living together’ but with a utopian element. The entire effort was overseen by Superstudio, the workshop headed by Paola Viganò.\nThe students came up with 11 projects. They range from very simple – setting up modular tarpaulin structures on campus (We Are A Monument) – to highly ambitious – taking over unused land owned by the city of Lausanne (Collection). In between the two, some students suggest repurposing existing buildings (Beautiful Carpet, Sans feu ni lieux, Space Time Blur), while others would like to see a new building on the north side of campus. That project (Boucle verte) includes plans to expand the community vegetable gardens to bring the students into contact with local residents.\nTheater on the lake\nOne group of students was more provocative, proposing to turn the iconic Rolex Learning Center into the Student Center and build a partly floating platform on the lake’s edge to hold an open-air theater and café (Yapalfeuolac). Several groups of students sought to tighten links between EPFL and the University of Lausanne, playing on the different levels of existing buildings (Superliken Campus, Treillis d’union).\nWhat do all these projects have in common? They give us a peek at the future of EPFL. A more open campus, with improved access routes from the outside and revamped and rearranged public spaces on campus. In most of the projects, the students got creative with the ground floors – which currently serve as parking lots and underground passages – and envisioned building several 'spaces' rather than a single building.

{"id": 1528, "text": "When you’re out of work, starting a company can be a good solution, both for you and for the economy. This is the conclusion of a recently released study led by professor Marc Gruber, holder of EPFL’s Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization Chair. Conducted with the support of several regional employment agencies, this study analyzed in detail and for the first time which unemployed individuals are starting their own businesses, what factors drive them to take this step, and how their companies are developing. The scientists compared data from several countries – Switzerland, Germany, France and Belgium. Gruber gives us an overview of the study.\n-Your study shows that companies started by unemployed people do much more than just provide them with a job.\nAbsolutely. It appears that these companies generate employment. In Switzerland, these enterprises created on average 2.2 jobs after three years, in addition to the position of the company’s founder, and thus they’re potentially taking other people off the unemployment rolls. In addition, they have a very encouraging survival rate, even higher in Switzerland than in the other countries we studied: 88% of them are still viable after three years, compared with 80% in Germany and 77% in Belgium.\n- Can you give us a profile of someone who’s likely to start a successful company?\nThis is a heterogeneous group, made up of people coming from very diverse backgrounds, from landscaping to architecture to consulting. Even so, there are certain commonalities. These people are by and large male, in the 30-60 year-old age bracket, and thus have a certain amount of previous job experience. Two profiles stand out: those who have always dreamed of starting their own business but resisted as long as they had salaried jobs; for them, unemployment provided the needed impetus and opportunity. And there are those who only considered starting a business after months, if not years, of unemployment, and then as a last ditch solution. Those in this second category are in the minority.\n- How can the results of this study be used?\nThe goal of this study was to better understand the effects that interventions and government support, which vary considerably from one country to another, have on the evolution of unemployment. These results will thus be primarily of use to policy makers in the area of unemployment, to improve programs designed to facilitate business development, better target their financial or training support systems, or develop new kinds of assistance. These data can also be helpful for entrepreneurs or those who would like to become entrepreneurs; they will discover possible avenues for developing their strengths, anticipating possible difficulties, identifying gaps they need to fill in education or management skills, and learning how to get the support they need. Understanding how to handle all these aspects is all the more important now that everyone is likely to change jobs or go through job restructuring several times in the course of his or her life.\n- Do you think that for these companies there is a “recipe for success?”\nWe often believe that luck is the main ingredient in success. You need it, that’s for sure! But in this study, we were asking ourselves about other components that systematically had an impact on the performance of new start-ups -- the idea itself, the founder’s expertise or knowledge, his management experience and personality – which make a company prosper, create jobs and turn a profit. In fact, two factors favorably influence success: an idea with growth potential and a founder with prior management experience. You have to know how to stay afloat in a competitive environment and understand how your competitors are handling it, as well. Our results show that specific expertise in the new company’s domain is less critical for these “high performers,” because they can always acquire knowledge along the way or get outside support by bringing in skilled collaborators.\n- Could starting a company be possible for all the unemployed?\nEntrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. But we could at least ask everyone who is jobless to consider it, to see it as a possible alternative. There are certainly many people who would make good entrepreneurs, but who don’t think of it or won’t even allow themselves to consider the possibility.", "summary": "More than 90% of companies launched by unemployed individuals are still viable after three years.

{"id": 1530, "text": "Air bubbles in a glass of water float freely up to the surface, and the mechanisms behind this are easily explained by the basic laws of science. However, the same laws of science cannot explain why air bubbles in a tube a few millimeters thick don’t rise the same way.\nPhysicists first observed this phenomenon nearly a century ago, but couldn’t come up with an explanation – in theory, the bubbles shouldn’t encounter any resistance unless the fluid is in motion; thus a stuck bubble should encounter no resistance.\nBack in the 1960s, a scientist named Bretherton developed a formula based on the bubbles’ shape to explain this phenomenon. Other researchers have since postulated that the bubble doesn’t rise due to a thin film of liquid that forms between the bubbles and the tube wall. But these theories cannot fully explain why the bubbles don’t rise upwards.\nThe bubble not rising upward Credit: EPFL\nWhile a Bachelor’s student at the  within EPFL’s School of Engineering, Wassim Dhaouadi was able to not only view the thin film of liquid, but also measure it and describe its properties – something that had never been done before. His findings showed that the bubbles weren’t stuck, as scientists previously thought, but actually moving upwards extremely slowly. Dhaouadi’s research, which was published recently in \nPhysical Review Fluids\n, marked the first time that experimental evidence was provided to test earlier theories.\nDhaouadi and EMSI lab head, John Kolinski, used an optical interference method to measure the film, which they found to be only a few dozen nanometers (1 x 10\n-9\n meters) thick. The method involved directing light onto an air bubble inside a narrow tube and analyzing the reflected light intensity. Using the interference of the light reflected from the tube’s inner wall and from the bubble’s surface, they precisely measured the film’s thickness.\nDhaouadi also discovered that the film changes shape if heat is applied to the bubble and returns to its original shape once the heat is removed. “This discovery disproves the most recent theories that the film would drain to zero thickness,” says John Kolinski.\nThese measurements also show that the bubbles are actually moving, albeit too slowly to be seen by the human eye. “Because the film between the bubble and the tube is so thin, it creates a strong resistance to flow, drastically slowing the bubbles’ rise,” according to Kolinski.\nThese findings relate to fundamental research but could be used to study fluid mechanics on a nanometric scale, especially for biological systems.\nJohn Kolinski and Wassim Dhaouadi\n Dhaouadi joined the lab as a summer research assistant during his Bachelor. He made rapid progress, and continued the work of his own volition. “He essentially participated out of his interest in the research, and wound up publishing a paper from his work that brings to rest a centuries-old puzzle”, says Kolinski.\n “I was happy to carry a research project early in my curriculum. It is a new way of thinking and learning and was quite different from a Homework set where you know there is a solution, although it may be hard to find. At first, We did not know if there would even be a solution to this problem\n.\n,” says Dhaouadi, who is now completing a Master’s degree at ETH Zurich.

{"id": 1532, "text": "Traffic noise isn’t just noise. It can also be a veritable data mine, as Patrick Marmaroli has shown. The Electromagnetics and Acoustics Lab (LEMA) PhD student has designed a dual microphone system that uses the sound produced when tires roll over pavement to determine traffic volume. The system can also track a vehicle’s speed and even determine its approximate size (i.e., whether a passing vehicle is a station wagon, compact, truck, etc). This information can then be used to provide traffic or air-pollution bulletins, and can also help engineers to better plan future road-building. “Currently, several different types of instrument are needed to obtain all of this information: a sound engineer who wants to know the number, speed and size of passing vehicles has to make not just sound measurements with a somometer, but also other measurements, using things like radar, video cameras, or pneumatic tubes,” says Marmaroli. “Then, all the data needs to be synchronized, which is expensive and time-consuming, given its heterogeneity. Our idea is to replace all of that with just one device that provides all the data synchronously and in a single format.”\nA simple method based on complex algorithms\nThe system is light and has a small footprint. It is composed of two microphones placed a set distance from each other and a computer that runs a complex algorithm. “The first tests were done with a PC, but a smaller device could be used in the future,” says Marmaroli. The recording zone is only a few meters wide, and sound is recorded for about 4 seconds per vehicle. Each vehicle is detected and followed in real time, and its speed is estimated. It is also possible to determine the wheelbase (i.e., how much space there is between the axles), which provides information on what size the vehicle is. The sound is then mapped onto an image, with a slope whose steepness depends on the speed (see diagram).\nFiltering background noise\n To optimize vehicle detection and monitoring, Marmaroli employs an acoustic tracking approach. It is based on a “smart” algorithm that uses probability and some basic assumptions to filter out background noise and focus on the traffic. Background noises such as pedestrians, planes, or even a tractor in the fields near the road are ignored by the algorithm, in contrast to traditional sonometers, which don’t filter out background noise. In order to “select” the right sounds, the system’s algorithm assumes, for example, that a car heading in one direction at 80 km/h isn’t going to stop on a dime and speed off in the other direction at 80 km/h. It instead works from the assumption that the second track is another car, on the other side of the road, and doesn’t take account of it in its tracking of the first vehicle. In this way, the system can analyze several vehicles in real time without mixing them up.\nSize and speed \n Because there are two microphones in the array, it is also possible to determine the speed of traffic and the size of individual vehicles. Sound from the tires hits one microphone before the other, and this time-gap changes as the vehicle moves along. The system uses a Monte Carlo method to sequentially analyze changes in the time gap, thereby determining each vehicle’s position and speed.\nThe audio analysis of each microphone is so precise that it is even possible to calculate the distance between the front and the rear tyres of each vehicle, with a margin of error of about 30cm. “30 cm is less than the width of a tire,” notes Marmaroli.\nSoon to be implemented in Swiss cities?\n The first tests of this groundbreaking traffic sensor system were conducted around the EPFL campus. Two Swiss cities, Sion and Martigny, may be interested in using the technology, and negotiations aiming to find financing and continue the project are underway. “The system could eventually be used in other areas, such as air traffic, train traffic or industrial metrology,” says Marmaroli. For the moment, the aspiring PhD candidate will be defending his thesis on 15 February (ELA 2 room at EPFL).", "summary": "An EPFL doctoral student has designed a microphone-based system that functions as an automatic road traffic sensor.

{"id": 1534, "text": "Future cars will be both self-driving and manual. \"We wanted to harness technology to enhance drivers’ skills without interfering with the enjoyment of being behind the wheel,\" explains José del R. Millán, who holds the  (CNBI). As part of a joint project with Nissan researchers based at the CNBI, the team managed to read the brain signals that indicate a driver is about to do something – such as accelerate, brake or change lanes – in order to send that information to the vehicle. With this advance notice of a few hundreds of milliseconds, the smart vehicle can anticipate the driver's movements and make the ensuing maneuver easier. The car is also equipped with sensors to monitor its environment, which means it can help the driver when traffic conditions are difficult.\nAn easier and more personalized driving experience\nThe signals produced in the driver's frontal motor cortex are detected using a sensor-equipped EEG (electroencephalography) headset. They are then sent to the smart vehicle for processing. By combining that data with the information detected by its own sensors, the car can react to the situation at hand. \"If you're coming to a red light and getting ready to brake, the car will assist you by starting to brake 200–500 milliseconds before you do. But if you approach a red light and your brain shows no intention of slowing the car down, the car will warn you that the light is red to make sure you've seen it,\" says Millán.\nWe all generate different patterns of brain signals, so the vehicle learns from each driver and customizes its software. It stores each driver's regular routes, as well as their driving habits and style, using this information to more accurately anticipates what each driver might do at any time. The brain-machine interface not only makes driving easier, it also creates a more personalized experience, as the car will always be in sync with the driver. Even the car’s setting can be transparently adapted to the driver’s preferences. For instance, if the driver has adopted a more relaxed driving style, the interface will detect that the selected sports mode is not appropriate and switch the car to a more comfortable setting.\nTech transfer\nIn 2014, after four years of research, scientists from the CNBI delivered the brain-machine interface to their industry partner Nissan. The carmaker then continued the research through a senior innovation research program with support from the CNBI. The resulting technology was integrated into a prototype, creating the interface that enables the vehicle to communicate with the driver. This prototype was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.\nSince 2015, Nissan and the CNBI researchers have been working on further developing this brain-vehicle technology, mainly by adding an eye tracker function. \"Our eyes are always moving and observing what's going on around us,\" says Millán. \"But not everything we see is relevant or important. So we are studying ways to detect brain signals that indicate that a certain object or situation has caught our attention and needs to be factored in by the vehicle.\"\nFor several years now, Millán's team has been developing scientific knowledge in detecting and using brain signals to control objects and our environment. They have been focusing on driver-assist technology with Nissan since 2011. In parallel, they have been exploring other applications for their expertise as well, such as helping people with motor disabilities.", "summary": "EPFL and Nissan researchers are able to read a driver’s brain signals and send them to a smart vehicle so that it can anticipate the driver’s moves and facilitate the driving process.

{"id": 1535, "text": "Space trips affect the human body in many more ways than we think. Susana Zanello specializes in these effects. Trained as a biologist, she works for the Division of Space Life Sciences (DSLS) in Houston, an institution supporting the work of NASA. Her mission is to investigate the human adaptation to life in space, identify the risks involved and develop countermeasures to preserve the health of the astronauts as they go on space exploration missions. For a few months, she has been at EPFL as an academic guest at Prof. Phillipe Renaud’s Microsystems Laboratory 4.\nI came here to learn more about miniaturization and gather some ideas. In space medicine, we need low-volume devices that allow in-flight analysis and real time health monitoring to measure parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and the temperature of the astronauts. Plus, it has to be possible to cross-reference data collected by the devices to obtain the health status of the whole crew. This is a crucial point, because we have a lot of limitations in space: the available space, the crew time, and the weight of the objects we take up there. Therefore, we are looking for new micro- and nanotechnologies to build better and smaller devices.\n- What are the most important effects of space flight on the body?\nIt’s a huge challenge to live outside the Earth. Through evolution, life has really adapted to being on this planet. In space, one of the main risks comes from microgravity - or the absence of gravity. A very clear consequence is the loss of bone mineral density. Up there, you simply don’t have to constantly fight the force of gravity, the way we do naturally on Earth. Thus, there is no more need for a skeleton to sustain us! The human body starts adapting by reducing bone matrix density and processing calcium differently. This leads to a loss of strength in your bones that increases your risk of fractures when you are back on Earth, as well as that of developing kidney stones.\nCosmic radiation is another critical risk of space exploration. Earth’s magnetic field is a very effective protection, preventing most of the high-energy particles from reaching the surface of our planet. Outside the Van Allen belts, or also on other planets, we are constantly bombarded by strong solar protons and galactic cosmic rays. There is abundant evidence that these can traverse our entire body and interfere with our DNA. So, in the long term, all the risks associated to those DNA alterations, such as cancer, really have to be carefully studied.\n-\tYour research also focuses on changes in the astronauts’ vision…\nIn the early 2000s, we began to observe a degradation of the astronauts’ near visual acuity after they spent time in the ISS, the International Space Station. Upon further investigation, we noticed a change in the shape of their eyes, called globe flattening, and a thickening of the back part of the eye, at the beginning of the optic nerve. About 60% of astronauts experience vision loss, which can be irreversible in some cases. This is why it is considered as a high priority health risk by NASA.\nWe think it happens because of a shift of the fluids inside the body. On Earth, liquids tend to go down into our legs. Their movement and valves in our leg veins then help pump the blood back up to our heart. In microgravity, this system is no longer needed, and you fluid is pumped towards the head instead. This leads to the typical puffy face and chicken legs that astronauts have, but also possibly to increased intracranial pressure. Scientists postulate that when the pressure in the cerebral spinal fluid increases, it alters the pressure behind the eyes, impacting visual acuity.\n-\tIn which direction will you focus your research in the future?\nThere are physiological signs of adaptation that we can observe, but also underlying ones at a molecular level. Genes may be expressed differently in space, leading to specific physiological changes. The studies that I am conducting right now already seek to answer these questions. But again, there are a lot of limitations to performing experiments in space. Commonly, astronauts live up there for six months, and now two of them are participating in a one-year mission. But when we are talking about going to further destinations, like Mars, this means much longer missions. To know what could happen on such trips, we have to perform experiments not only using the ISS but also ground analogs, which are platforms simulating, to a certain extent, space conditions.\n -\n Precisely, what are the main challenges of a trip to Mars?\nSuch a mission is estimated to take three years. The first risk is psychological. And to measure it, we have to take into account the duration, the remoteness, the isolation, the confinement with a limited number of persons, the stress of a high workload and the pressure of being successful. Now, once you arrive on Mars, there is one good thing: you have partial gravity. Your bones will immediately be stimulated and reduce the rate of density loss. But once again, on the surface, astronauts will be confronted to the risks of high-energy radiation. Not to mention a harsh climate, dust, and the need for good nutrition, among others.\n- What about other planets?\nOf course, we are beginning to consider more remote objects, like Jupiter’s satellite Europa, where water has been found. But that’s much farther away! Plus, believe it or not, even though Mars sounds inhospitable, it is quite a friendly planet, compared to others. Its size and rotation pattern are similar to that of the Earth. Therefore, a day is almost 24 hours long. And that’s a big thing for humans, as life evolved to fit such conditions. Living on a planet with a 10-hour day, for example, would trigger many more other adverse effects in the body.\n- Aren’t we too adapted to Earth’s conditions to survive elsewhere in space?\nExperience shows that we are able to adapt at least to some extent to new environments. Of course, there are risks and there always will be. The most important thing is to define very precisely the acceptable levels of those risks. Moreover, we cannot ignore the human greed for exploration. Even with a high level of risk, I bet there will always be somebody ready to push and take it.", "summary": "Susana Zanello is an expert of human adaptation to life in space.

{"id": 1537, "text": "Fourier’s well-known heat equation describes how temperatures change over space and time when heat flows in a solid material. The formulation was developed in 1822 by Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician and physicist hired by Napoleon to increase a cannon’s rate of fire, which was limited by overheating.\nFourier’s equation works well to describe conduction in macroscopic objects (several millimeters in size or larger) and at high temperatures. However, it does not describe hydrodynamic heat propagation, which can appear in electronic devices containing materials such as graphite and graphene.\nOne of these heat-propagation phenomena is known as Poiseuille heat flow. This is where heat propagates within a material as a viscous-fluid flow. Another phenomenon, called “second sound,” takes place when heat propagates in a crystal like a wave, similar to the way in which sound spreads through the air.\nSince these phenomena are not described by Fourier’s equation, until now researchers have analyzed them using explicit microscopic models, such as the Boltzmann transport equation. However, the complexity of these models means that they cannot be used to design complex electronic devices.\nThis problem has now been solved by Michele Simoncelli, a PhD student at EPFL, together with Andrea Cepellotti, a former EPFL PhD student now at Harvard, and Nicola Marzari, the chair of Theory and Simulation of Materials in the Institute of Materials at EPFL’s School of Engineering and the director of NCCR MARVEL. They showed how heat originating from the atomic vibrations in a solid can be described rigorously by two novel “viscous heat equations”, which extend Fourier’s law to cover any heat propagation that is not diffusive.\n“These viscous heat equations explain why and under which conditions heat propagation becomes fluid-like rather than diffusive. They show that heat conduction is governed not just by thermal conductivity, as described by Fourier’s law, but also by a second parameter, thermal viscosity,” says Simoncelli. \nThis breakthrough, published in \n,\n will help engineers design next-generation devices, particularly those that feature materials such as graphite or diamond in which hydrodynamic phenomena are prevalent. Overheating is the main limiting factor for the miniaturization and efficiency of electronic devices, and in order to maximize efficiency and predict whether a device will work – or simply melt – it is crucial to have the right model.\nThe results obtained by EPFL’s team are timely. From the 1960s until recently, hydrodynamic heat phenomena had only been observed at cryogenic temperatures (around -260\no\nC) and were therefore thought to be irrelevant for everyday applications. Already in 2015 Marzari and his colleagues predicted that this would be very different in two-dimensional and layered materials – a prediction that was confirmed with the publication in \nScience\n of pioneering experiments that found second-sound (or wavelike heat propagation) in graphite at temperatures around -170\no\nC.\nThe formulation presented by the EPFL researchers yields results that line up closely with those experiments. Most important, they also predict that hydrodynamic heat propagation can also happen at room temperature, depending on the size and type of material.\nThrough their work, the EPFL researchers are providing new and original insight into heat transport, but also laying the groundwork for an understanding of shape and size effects – not only in next-generation electronic devices but also in “phononic” devices that control cooling and heating through engineered superstructures. Finally, the novel formulation can also be adapted to describe viscous phenomena involving electrons discovered in 2016 by Philip Moll, now a professor at EPFL’s Institute of Materials.\n-----\nFor the mathematically inclined, these viscous heat equations were also immediately included in the documentation accompanying Wolfram Mathematica software ().", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and MARVEL have developed a novel formulation that describes how heat spreads within crystalline materials.

The company, whose technology has achieved record efficiency of 29% for sun-to-electricity conversion, will initially target the agricultural sector with translucent panels that can act as both greenhouse covers and power plants.\nTargeting agriculture first\nThe photovoltaic modules developed by Insolight, based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, represent a novel approach to solar power generation. Lenses embedded in a thin glass layer focus sunlight on tiny, high-efficiency, space-grade solar cells below. The lenses move a few millimeters throughout the day to track the sun’s movement across the sky and keep the cells aligned with the light rays. The system can be fitted to conventional solar panels to maximize energy production. But the translucent modules can also work as standalone power plants while serving other functions such as promoting crop growth.\nInsolight is planning to team up with major solar energy suppliers to target the agricultural sector with panels that can be installed in fields, on greenhouses and on green roofs. Users will be able to switch between two modes: an electricity generation mode, in which the lenses concentrate light on the high-efficiency solar cells, and a maximum light transmission mode, in which all incoming light passes through the panel to reach the crops below. “The agrivoltaics market may be relatively new, but it’s already worth an estimated CHF 700 million, with total installed capacity of 5 GWp,” says Insolight CEO Laurent Coulot.

{"id": 1539, "text": "EPFL’s Technology Transfer Office (TTO) has recently seen a surge in requests for licenses for your software, which generates color-coded graphs highlighting the key elements of websites’ data protection policies. Who are all these requests coming from? \nIt’s true that the TTO has received over 20 license requests in the past few months. Most of them come from companies offering web services – such as personal data protection software and data monetization applications – as well as lawyers drafting data protection policies and disclaimers, who want to test their texts. Some ad agencies have requested licenses so that they can place ads in accordance with new regulatory requirements. A few of the requests we have received were for exclusivity agreements, which is something we want to avoid. We just entered into a license agreement with DuckDuckGo, a US search engine that stands apart for its commitment to protecting personal data. For instance, it doesn’t store any personal information about its users.\nWhat benefits does your software offer DuckDuckGo?\nIts developers plan to incorporate our AI algorithms into the search engine’s Privacy Essentials extension. This extension already provides a summary of important data protection information, but that summary is generated by hand based on the policies of just a few dozen websites. With our algorithms, the summary generation process can be automated and expanded to include tens of thousands of websites. However, it’s worth pointing out that the summaries produced by our software have no legal value – they’re for information purposes only – but they do have a nearly 80% accuracy rate at this point.\nDid you expect Polisis to be so successful when you were developing the algorithms?\nWe spent a year and a half developing the technology at EPFL’s Distributed Information Systems Laboratory, in association with the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan. The development was done for research purposes, but the number of license requests the TTO has received since we put the program online has far exceeded our expectations. And over 30,000 people have tried it out. Part of Polisis’ success is due to the fact that it’s easy to use – you don’t have to be an expert to understand the color-coded graphs it generates. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that took effect in May also helped. Our program clearly provides the easiest way to decipher all the different data protection policies, which are often long-winded but now mandatory for all websites. The GDPR has also prompted people who are simply curious to take an interest in our program. That makes me almost wish we had created a start-up to market our technology!\nDo you have any competitors?\nThere are other websites out there that analyze data protection policies, but they don’t work the same way. They highlight specific sentences and clauses based on what a user searches for. But they don’t provide automatically-generated summaries of how websites use personal data.\nAre you surprised by some of the things you found using your program? \nIt was interesting to see that some websites that you wouldn’t think are much concerned about data privacy actually show up as having robust policies. The developers of those websites probably hired an army of lawyers to comb through their policies and introduce generic terms that make it through filters. The end result is policies with extremely vague terms like “with our partners for different reasons,” “if necessary” and “effectively.” These policies seem clear when you first read them, but dig deeper and you’ll find that’s not the case. And the GDPR has not completely eliminated this trend. Our algorithms are designed to boost transparency and draw attention to these kinds of highly important details. We are currently working with Kassem Fawaz’s lab at the University of Wisconsin to improve our algorithms so they can better recognize generic terms.\nYour software can help identify where personal data are sent and how they’re used, but can it check whether websites are actually following their data protection policies? \nNo, because we don’t have access to websites’ servers. But extensions like those provided by DuckDuckGo can spot advertising trackers and check whether websites disclose them in their data protection policies.

{"id": 1542, "text": "To explain why the system developed in his Distributed Computing Lab () represents a paradigm shift in how we think about cryptocurrencies – and about digital trust in general – Professor  uses a legal metaphor: all players in this new system are “innocent until proven guilty.”\nThis is in contrast to the traditional Bitcoin model first , which relies on solving a difficult problem called “consensus” to guarantee the security of transactions. In this model, everyone in a distributed system must agree on the validity of all transactions to prevent malicious players from cheating – for example, by spending the same digital tokens twice (double-spending). In order to prove their honesty and achieve consensus, players must execute complex – and energy-intensive – computing tasks that are then verified by the other players.\nBut in their new system, Guerraoui and his colleagues flip the assumption that all players are potential cheaters on its head.\n“We take a minimalist approach. We realize that players don’t need to reach consensus; they just need to prevent malicious behavior when it manifests,” he explains. “So, we assume everyone is honest, and if players see someone trying to do something wrong, they ignore that player – and only that player.”\nWith the consensus requirement out of the way, the DCL’s new system, dubbed Byzantine Reliable Broadcast, can achieve safe cryptocurrency transactions on a large scale with an energetic cost of virtually zero – “roughly equivalent to that of exchanging emails”, Guerraoui says – and just a few grams of CO2 compared to  for a single Bitcoin transaction.\nThat could be a big advantage over Bitcoin, which has been reported to have a global electricity consumption , and a global carbon footprint .\nCommunication is key\nSo, how can users be sure that cryptocurrency transactions are secure if they are not sure who the malicious players are? Guerraoui says: players just need to communicate with each other.\n“If a malicious player wants to make a payment, for example, this system would not allow anyone to accept money from that player until a randomly chosen sample has confirmed the player has not sent money to anyone else; otherwise, the payment will not be accepted,” he explains. “Basically, we’re saying that you only need to exchange information with a sample of players to implement a cryptocurrency.”\nThe central element of communicating, or broadcasting, information is what gives the Byzantine Reliable Broadcast system its name. After first  the theoretical results behind the system earlier this year in the proceedings of the 2019 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (), one of the two most prestigious conferences in the field, Guerraoui and his colleagues have recently published  describing the implementation and scale-up of their algorithm.\nFor its description of the first scalable solution to a consensus alternative, the second DCL paper has already garnered interest from industry, and won the Best Paper Award at the field’s other top conference,  (the 33\nrd\n International Symposium on Distributed Computing). The award will be presented in Budapest, Hungary in mid-October.\nFrom banking to bikeshares\nIn addition to its lower cost and energy expenditure, the Byzantine Reliable Broadcast system sacrifices nothing in terms of transaction security. While it has a narrower range of applications than Bitcoin – being suitable only for cryptocurrencies, and not for more complex transactions like smart contracts – the system can manage other forms of currency besides money.\n“It could be used for an abstract cryptocurrency for exchanging goods, like bikes in a bike-sharing program for example,” Guerraoui says.\nHe and his colleagues plan to release their new system as an open-source code for anyone to download and use by the end of 2020.\nThis research is being carried out as part of an ERC Proof-of Concept Grant won by Guerraoui , aimed at putting a new class of “consensusless” algorithms into practice.", "summary": "The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is limited by its astronomical electricity consumption and outsized carbon footprint.

{"id": 1543, "text": "DP3T is an approach to decentralized, privacy-preserving contact tracing that aims to provide a digital means for humans to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The  was initially launched by researchers from EPFL and ETH Zurich, and is now being developed in collaboration with a number of other , as well as software developers Ubique and PocketCampus.\nMathias Payer, head of the  lab in EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences (), explains that recent tests carried out on the EPFL campus were designed to compare the DP3T system’s proximity measurements with data on Swiss Army soldiers’ physical positions. The soldiers were asked to mimic daily activities like shopping or sitting on a train, while their positions were captured and analyzed using specialized cameras from EPFL'S Computer Vision Laboratory (), led by Pascal Fua.\nOn April 30\nth\n, just a week after the EPFL tests, Payer led a 24-hour field test at a military facility with about 100 soldiers. This time, the soldiers performed routine tasks while the app ran on their phones, and took note of each time they came into contact – defined as “less than two meters for more than five minutes” – with another person.\n“We wanted to establish a baseline for how people actually act in different situations,” Payer explains. He adds that an additional challenge was to calibrate the system to work regardless of whether a user’s smartphone was in their hand, in their backpack, etc. “We tested different parameters, such as signal strength and frequency, to ensure that the system generates good information without too many false positives, and without draining your phone battery.”\nThis signaling system is at the core of the DP3T technology: it uses Bluetooth signals to continuously broadcast random and impossible-to-guess strings of characters between smartphones. All sent signals, as well as those received from nearby devices, are stored on users’ phones for a maximum of 14 days. If a user is diagnosed with COVID-19, their unique character sequences will be added to a hospital list, which other users’ phones will check regularly to see if they ‘recognize’ any of them. If a match is found that indicates a user was near a COVID-19 patient long enough to risk infection, the app will display an alert, asking the user to self-isolate and enabling him or her to get tested as soon as possible.\n“Privacy by design” \nThe idea of using smartphones for proximity tracing has raised concerns over data privacy, as critics argue that such a system could create new opportunities for personal information to be abused, even after the pandemic eases. But the DP3T team is working to ensure that even if a hacker could get their hands on the signal data – which will be stored only on users’ smartphones, rather than a centralized server – it would be useless to them.\n“This is privacy by design: we wanted to create a system that respects the need of citizens, which is not just to stop the coronavirus, but also to preserve freedom. So, we are building an app that cannot be used for anything other than contact tracing – it cannot be used to know location, identities, or activities,” says Carmela Troncoso, head of EPFL's Security and Privacy Engineering Lab ().\nShe adds that the system is also designed to dismantle itself organically as soon as the app is uninstalled from a smartphone, which will delete all stored signal data, thus placing control of the system in the hands of users.\nLooking ahead\nAs the parameter tests of the DP3T system are completed, all results will be published online to encourage continuous feedback and refinement. A beta version of the DP3T app is anticipated by mid-May; however, the researchers emphasize that the rollout of the app for use by citizens is ultimately within the purview of the Swiss government.\nIn the meantime, the DP3T team is working to ensure that the system will be ready to welcome a forthcoming application program interface (API) , which is still under development.\n“This is all happening in parallel. We have an app that works using our protocol, and that is compatible with Apple and Google’s protocol. As soon as that protocol is available, we will switch to it, as it will simplify integration with iOS and Android devices,” Payer says.\nAbout the DP3T project\n At EPFL, the team working on DP3T includes Alfredo Sanchez, Apostolos Pyrgelis, Carmela Troncoso, Dominique Quatravaux, Edouard Bugnion, Daniele Antonioli, James Larus, Jean-Pierre Hubaux, Ludovic Barman, Marcel Salathé, Mathias Payer, Pascal Fua, Sylvain Chatel, Theresa Stadler, and Wouter Lueks.\n At ETH Zurich, the team working on DP3T includes David Basin, Dennis Jackson, Jan Beutel, Kenneth Paterson, and Srdjan Capkun.\n Elsewhere in Europe, developers include Bart Preneel, Nigel Smart, Dave Singelee, and Aysajan Abidin (KU Leuven); Seda Gürses (TU Delft); Michael Veale (University College London); Cas Cremers (CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security); Reuben Binns (University of Oxford); and Ciro Cattuto (University of Torino / ISI Foundation).\n In Switzerland, the project is being coordinated by the  of the Swiss Federal Council, and is  by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health ().\n Internationally, DP3T has been listed as one of several privacy-preserving, decentralized approaches to contact tracing in a  endorsed by some 300 scientists from over 25 countries.", "summary": "Over the past two weeks, EPFL computer scientists have been testing and refining the smartphone-based system developed by the international Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing project (DP3T), with the help of the Swiss Army.

It shows that some areas of Lausanne are particularly problematic,” says Stéphane Joost, a researcher at EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG).\nReal health risks\nSleep disturbances can have serious health consequences, as they can lead not only to daytime sleepiness and higher stress, but also to a greater risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, fatigue-induced accidents, depression and other psychological disorders. For their study, the scientists mapped out the neighborhoods where people suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness live and compared that with traffic-noise data obtained from the OFEV’s sonBASE. They found distinct neighborhoods with similar levels of reported sleepiness, illustrating the effects of nocturnal noise pollution on Lausanne residents.\n“Daytime sleepiness is a common complaint among the people who contact us,” says Raphaël Heinzer, head of the Sleep Disorders Center at CHUV. “This study is the first to show that where a person lives can be a major contributing factor.” The red zones on the scientists’ map indicate neighborhoods with both a high occurrence of daytime sleepiness and elevated levels of nighttime noise – meaning they are probably areas where residents don’t sleep very well. On the other hand, the blue zones indicate neighborhoods with low levels of daytime sleepiness. “The difference in nighttime noise between the red and blue zones is over five decibels, which is huge considering that volume doubles with every three decibels,” says Joost.\nLegend: \nBlue zones correspond to neighborhoods with below-average daytime sleepiness and where similar sleepiness levels are reported within a range of at least 400 meters. Red zones correspond to neighborhoods with above-average daytime sleepiness. \nLausanne’s red zones are located primarily at the intersection of Avenue d’Echallens and Chemin de Montétan – which is especially noisy between 10pm and 6am – and below the train station near the Place de Milan. In addition, the equivalent continuous sound level (Leq) in neighborhoods near major thoroughfares and train tracks can exceed 50 decibels, which is the maximum allowed by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.\nMaking targeted measures possible \nThe study’s authors hope their work will help policymakers identify which neighborhoods can benefit the most from noise-reduction measures to improve residents’ health. “Fortunately, sleep disturbances and the resulting health problems are reversible. We can reduce nighttime noise by introducing speed limits, restricting certain kinds of vehicles, or using sound-absorbing surfaces, for example,” adds Joost.\nDoctors are also advocating such measures. “Improving patients’ health through urban-planning policies designed to reduce the amount of noise pollution they are exposed to is one aspect of a new field of healthcare called urban health,” says Idris Guessous, a primary care physician at HUG and a coauthor of the study. “We want to build awareness among not just doctors, but also urban planners, geographers, architects, lawyers and sociologists of the role they can play in working together to improve the health of a city’s residents. Our maps were developed jointly by several public-sector institutions, and they can help local governments make better informed decisions. We hope our research will speed progress towards targeted public-health policies.”\nA similar study is being carried out in Geneva using data on the city’s residents collected during HUG’s \nBus Santé\n program. Follow-up research is also planned on the Lausanne study; while that study relied on subjective data collected from answers to a questionnaire, the new research will use objective measurements of sleepiness obtained from electroencephalography (as part of a HypnoLaus study).", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL, the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) compared the geographical distribution of nearly 3,700 Lausanne residents suffering from daytime sleepiness with the noise caused by road and railway traffic in those parts of the city at night.

In the most severe cases, the sufferer may become fully paralyzed and in need of permanent assistance.\nThe TOBI project (Tools for brain-computer interaction) is financed by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7) and is coordinated by EPFL. Since 2008 it has focused on the use of the signals transmitted by the brain. The electrical activity that takes place in the brain when the patient focuses on a particular task such as lifting an arm is detected by electroencephalography (EEG) through electrodes placed in a cap worn by the patient. Subsequently, a computer reads the signals and turns them into concrete actions as, for instance, moving a cursor on a screen.\nTests involving more than 100 patients\n Based on this idea, researchers from thirteen institutions together with TOBI project partners have developed various technologies aimed at either obtaining better signal quality, making them clearer, or translating them into useful and functional applications. During the research, more than 100 patients or handicapped users had the opportunity to test the devices.

{"id": 1547, "text": "Why is it that we don’t wake up in the middle of the night feeling hungry while it’s hard for us to endure eight hours without eating after breakfast? In our daily life, every one of us realizes that our body responds to the rhythm imposed by the succession of days and nights, which has important metabolic consequences. The jet lag syndrome is another manifestation of the interaction between our internal clock and the environmental cycles.\nWhile many molecular studies have been conducted on living organisms’ circadian clocks, new analytical tools currently available allow a closer inspection of the real impact of this clock on some biological processes, in particular at a level of temporal protein abundance. This is exactly the research carried out in a joint study between EPFL and the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences (NIHS), thanks to a grant from the Leenaards Foundation disbursed in 2012. Their results have been published this week in the journal \nProceedings of the National Academy of Science of the USA\n (PNAS).\nThe researchers, under the direction of Frédéric Gachon (NIHS) and Felix Naef (EPFL), used mass spectrometry to analyze mice liver proteins. They measured the concentration of more than 5000 different proteins – whereas previous techniques only allowed to identify a few hundreds at best. \"We have observed that 6% of the proteins are expressed in a rhythmic manner, explained Felix Naef. This rate seemed low to us, since we know that almost half of the active genes in the liver follow a rhythm in messenger RNA abundance. But the most amazing part was that more than half of these rhythmic proteins originate from genes whose messenger RNA is not influenced by the circadian clock.\"\nThis apparent paradox suggests that the circadian clock does not only influence the production of proteins by the genes, but also the way the liver regulated the storage and release of proteins into the body.\nThe researchers observed an overnight accumulation of proteins, suggesting that their secretion is higher during the day. This results in a maximal plasma concentration during the night, the active period for mice. Unlike humans, mice are nocturnal animals, they eat and are active at night while resting during the day. \"Our experiments seem to prove that the pace set by feeding patterns takes precedence over the circadian rhythm. However, it appears that the strongest effect takes place when these two rhythms overlap\", said Frédéric Gachon.\nA next step in this research will attempt to translate some of these results to humans. \"Our work will help develop strategies focused on diet to help treat patients suffering from disorders associated to circadian dysfunctions\" said Felix Naef.", "summary": "Living organisms have adapted to the day-night cycle and, in most cases, evolved a \"circadian clock\" – that is: an actual cellular metronome – whose effects are not completely known yet.

{"id": 1548, "text": "Every year, nearly 500,000 people around the world find themselves living with disability as a result of a traffic accident or other trauma that has damaged their spinal cord. People with severe injuries lose the vast majority of their motor and sensory abilities in their lower limbs. They may also experience secondary conditions resulting from inactivity, such as bedsores and cardiovascular disorders.\nIn order to improve their daily lives and restore as many motor functions as possible, research teams from the Alberto Santos Dumont Association for Research Support (AASDAP)\nin Brazil, in collaboration with EPFL, have developed a new, non-invasive system for lower-limb neurorehabilitation.\n Patients use their own brain activity to send electrical impulses to 16 muscles in their legs. With the help of a conventional walker and a body weight support system, they learn to walk again, build muscle strength and improve their motor skills. A haptic interface provides vibrotactile feedback on their arms, giving patients information about the position of their limbs in space. This means they can move their legs without having to constantly look at them.\n The system was tested on two patients with chronic paraplegia. At the end of the clinical evaluation, both patients were able to move with less dependency on walking assistance, and one of them displayed a clear motor improvement. Doctors also noticed enhanced cardiovascular capacity and muscle volume. Significant recovery was achieved without resorting to surgical intervention. The results of this study have been published in .\nElectrodes to measure brain activity and stimulate the legs \nThe patients wore an EEG headset with electrodes to record the brain’s electrical activity and detect movement intention. Eight electrodes were attached to each leg, stimulating the muscles involved in the walking process. After preliminary training, patients used their own brain activity to send electric impulses to the muscles in either leg.\n“We decoded the patients’ motor imagery using a non-invasive brain-machine interface,” says Solaiman Shokur, from the AASDAP. “The patients were instructed to imagine moving their left and right legs in turn, and our system used these signals to move the corresponding limb.”\nWith the help of a walker and supported by a harness that bore 60–70% of their body weight, the patients learned to walk again and increased their sensorimotor skills.\nThis approach, using a predefined walking trajectory, imposes a physiological gait on the patient. The trajectory is associated with a predefined electrostimulation pattern for the lower-limb muscles involved in walking.\n\"We controlled the electrostimulation through a closed loop. This allowed us to adjust the electrical current applied to the muscles in real time in order to correct for differences between the measured and target hip and knee angles,\" says Mohamed Bouri, who heads up the , which developed the electrostimulation and the vibrotactile feedback technologies. \"That means we can improve muscle activation and reduce muscle fatigue.\"\nAnother major component of this approach was the use of a wearable haptic display to deliver tactile feedback to the patients´ forearms in order to provide them with a continuous source of proprioceptive feedback related to their walking. Tactile feedback improves the fluidity of movement and increases patients' confidence in their ability to walk.\nWaking up residual nerves that have been dormant for years\nThe researchers’ approach is innovative: it is multimodal and doesn't require invasive surgery. Patients simply need to train on simulators and become familiar with the interface. The results are surprising in that they demonstrate both muscular improvement and progress in neurological functions. “Our hypothesis is that, after a spinal injury, some spinal cord fibers may have survived, but they may not have been activated for years,” says Solaiman Shokur. “Our system makes it possible to stimulate them again.\"\n\"There is no silver bullet to treat spinal cord injuries,\" says Miguel Nicolelis, from the AASDAP. \"More and more, it looks like we need to implement multiple techniques simultaneously to achieve the best neurorehabilitation results.\"\nThis project is the result of a collaboration between the , the headquarters of the , the  at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC, Santo André, Brazil), and EPFL’s  research group ().", "summary": "Researchers from the Alberto Santos Dumont Association for Research Support (AASDAP) in Brazil, in collaboration with EPFL, have developed a non-invasive strategy that combines functional electrostimulation, a body weight support system and a brain-machine interface for the rehabilitation of people with paraplegia.

{"id": 1554, "text": "Martin Ellwanger is really into trains and rail infrastructure. So being able to come up with a Master’s project in the transport field was a real stroke of luck. And the fact that it had to do with Clip-Air – the project to develop a modular airplane with the flexibility of rail travel – was the cherry on the cake. “In addition to the train aspect,” says Ellwanger, a civil engineering student, “I was really excited about working on a groundbreaking project – even if it takes 50 years to really take off.” In his Master’s project, he focused on a critical phase of the project: the technical challenge of transporting Clip-Air capsules on trains and methods for transloading the capsules, i.e., transferring them onto train wagons.\nClip-Air is an ambitious project to radically restructure air travel. The project is based on passenger and cargo capsules that detach from a supporting structure composed of a flying wing, engines, the cockpit and landing gear. The capsules will be designed to simply clip onto the flying wing. This innovative structure could make air travel as flexible as rail transport, by linking airports to train stations. The capsules would be loaded onto trains at the airport and delivered directly to train stations – or even companies.\nFour seats across\nEllwanger started out by calculating the dimensions of the capsules so that they can travel on railways. Loading gauges differ between Switzerland, the rest of continental Europe, the UK and the United States: the first two are very similar, apart from height standards; UK gauges are narrower; and US gauges are wider. Since the idea is to transport the capsules both by air and by rail, the first step was to define a standard capsule size.\nAfter factoring in a number of constraints – diameter, length, wheel base and cantilevers – dictated by both Swiss and continental European standards, Ellwanger settled on a diameter of 3 meters and a length of 27 meters (with the exception of the British system, where capsules cannot exceed 21 meters). “With this diameter, we can put four seats abreast,” says Ellwanger. He studied the Lausanne-Geneva section of the railway and concluded that a capsule three meters in diameter would not impede rail traffic in any way. And in the United States, a 3.5-meter-diameter capsule could fit five seats across. That’s less than the diameter of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737, which is close to four meters.\nThe other technical component that Ellwanger studied was transloading, or transferring the capsules onto custom-fit train wagons. He looked at three possible lifting mechanisms: from the top, where the capsule hooks onto the wing; from the bottom, with a cradle system; or a combination of the two. In the end, he selected two variants: one, a combination of a gantry crane and a transfer carriage, not unlike today’s container loading system; the other, a railway wagon with retractable wheels that can operate on both the tarmac and the rails. These wagons include the gripper-arm and lifting mechanism. With the second variant, the capsule can be no longer than 24 meters.\nStill some work to do\n“We are obviously still at the idea stage, and there are lots of other aspects to work on,” says Ellwanger. “But at least my project shows that transporting Clip-Air capsules by train is feasible.” That said, he is under no illusions: “Before the first Clip-Air train leaves the station, further analyses will be needed on the train wagons, the gripper-arm system and the layout of the train stations.”", "summary": "Summer series - students works.

{"id": 1556, "text": "A new discovery is rarely the result of one successful experiment. Rather, it is usually born from a long process of trial and error – combined with a healthy dose of intuition that the scientists have honed over the years. But sharing knowledge about failed attempts could make research easier for everyone, especially in the field of chemical synthesis. That’s what a team of chemists from EPFL’s Laboratory of Molecular Simulation (LSMO) have recently shown in an article appearing in \nNature Communications\nLSMO, based in Sion, is specialized in synthesizing and simulating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) – a special type of compound discovered some 20 years ago. MOFs consist of metal ions linked by organic molecules to form 3D crystals. Because their molecules can be combined in an almost infinite number of ways, MOFs offer promising opportunities in a wide range of applications. Chemists at LSMO are studying MOFs that can absorb CO\n2\n in order to develop a system for removing this powerful greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.\nThe hitch is that developing new MOFs requires a huge amount of time and energy. This kind of chemical synthesis involves optimizing many different variables – solvent composition, temperature, and reaction time, to name just a few. And the more variables there are, the higher the number of possible combinations; researchers can easily find themselves with millions of experiments to carry out to come up with just one MOF. What’s more, the chemical links and assembly processes underlying the formation of MOFs are still not fully understood, meaning there are not yet any basic principles that chemists can follow. They essentially have to start from scratch each time.\nTen billion days \n“That’s where intuition comes in,” says Berend Smit, head of the LSMO. “With our research, we wanted to leverage Machine Learning technology to develop a systematic method for quantifying the lessons learned from prior experience.”\nHis team took as an example an MOF that is well known to scientists: HKUST-1. Its crystalline structure can vary depending on what chemical group is used to synthesize it. To measure how extensively intuition plays a role in synthesizing the right kind of material, the LSMO chemists first used a method that does not rely on intuition at all – a high-performance robotic synthesizer. Their synthesizer processed no less than nine different variables to reverse engineer the process and compile all possible failed synthesis experiments for an HKUST-1 molecule.\n“Our robot can crunch through about 30 chemical reactions a day. But even with that high level of throughput, it would still take nearly ten billion days to run through all possible reaction combinations. So researchers working under normal conditions – that is, without a robot – clearly have to rely on intuition to rule out a vast number of possible combinations and focus on the most promising,” says Kyriakos Stylianou, head of chemical synthesis at LSMO.\nIn other words, whether they realize it or not, researchers who carry out several experiments – successful and otherwise – get a feel for what will work and what won’t. This “gut feeling” tells them which variables could have the greatest influence on the outcome of a chemical reaction. For example, if a scientist finds that changing the reaction temperature alters the results of his experiment, even slightly, then he will be more likely to focus on the temperature variable.\nConvincing the scientific community \nThe Machine Learning method that was developed by LSMO enabled chemists to not only quantify researchers’ intuition, but also program their robot to carry out synthesis reactions more efficiently. That matters because around 1,000 new MOFs are developed each year, and behind each one lie anywhere between 10 and 100 failed attempts. These mistakes contain important and potentially useful information for further research by anyone working in the same field. Thanks to the method developed at LSMO, as well as the platform made available under Switzerland’s NCCR MARVEL program, the lessons learned can be compiled and shared.\n“Now we need to convince scientists to open up and talk about their unsuccessful experiments. If we’re able to do that, we can dramatically change the way chemical research is performed,” says Smit.", "summary": "When researchers make a new discovery, they tend to only publish the results of their successful experiments.

{"id": 1557, "text": "The emblematic yellow Postbuses have been roaming the Swiss countryside for more than 100 years, serving even the country’s most remote valleys. Changes in rural development, in the distribution of populations, and in their accompanying mobility needs, however, have meant that PostBus Switzerland Ltd., a subsidiary of Swiss Post, has had to continually adapt its service.\nThe results of “Optima,” a long-term study – three years of work done by twenty researchers – commissioned to EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) by PostBus Switzerland Ltd. are being published today. PostBus Switzerland now has additional tools in hand with which to direct its strategic development in the most pertinent manner possible. Three laboratories participated in the study, which was done under the aegis of EPFL’s Transportation Center (): the Urban Sociology () led by Vincent Kaufmann, the Transport and Mobility laboratory (), led by Michel Bierlaire, and the Urban and Regional Planning Laboratory (), led by Martin Schuler.\nThese intermediate results show that PostBus has significant growth potential. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in the suburbs (neither in the city center, nor in a rural area), and this group is an ideal target for PostBus service. The services provided for leisure and shopping passengers could be further developed. In addition, the Swiss population already has a heightened sense of “multi-modality” – the use of several different forms of transport over a single route – as well as one of the most well-developed rail services in the world. Its car-sharing system, Mobility, which has just celebrated its 100,000th customer, is one the best in Europe.\nSeveral avenues to explore\nQualitative studies (detailed analysis of 20 people’s travel over a 10-day period) and quantitative measurements (a survey filled in by 2,000 people from all over Switzerland) done by EPFL reveal that more than 80% of the population would be, under certain conditions, likely to use PostBus services or increase their usage. The researchers made several observations that could lead to targeted actions:\n •\tThere is a “threshold” of 12 return-trip journeys per day, below which PostBus service does not attract users;\n •\tGood coordination between bus and train schedules is crucial; an improvement in “feeder” services to the train stations is one of the population’s biggest expectations. An lack of coordination between schedules is one of the most serious shortcomings noted in certain PostBus lines, and it penalizes the entire public transport chain; \n •\tPublic transport users do not cover ground in the same way as those who drive private vehicles. The former tend to make “clusters” of routes around their centers of interest (activities), and the latter tend to weave “webs” of routes over large areas;\n •\tThe “holes” in the PostBus service in off-peak periods during the day or on weekends heavily penalize its success, because this doesn’t permit people to be spontaneous. Original solutions such as providing taxi or free bicycle service during these periods could be an inexpensive way to address the problem; \n •\tThe image that people have of the PostBus system is still heavily influenced by tradition: leisure activities, hikes in the mountains, etc. Many of those who don’t use the PostBus are not aware of all the existing services and tend to overestimate how long a trip will take. Information campaigns and communications efforts should thus be carried out to convince new users – particularly by integrating Publicar in the online SBB planning tool (www.sbb.ch). In addition, the difference in service in the German speaking regions (much more complete) and French-speaking regions of Switzerland has a measurable impact on the image that the local population has of the services that the PostBus provides.\nThe avenues for action suggested by EPFL at the end of the study were deliberately left quite broad. It is now up to PostBus to analyze them with regards to their efficiacy and profitability. “Our collaboration has been very fruitful,” says Grego Ochsenbein, innovation specialist with PostBus Switzerland. “It allowed us to better understand the mobility needs and patterns of our current and potential customers, as well as those who don’t use public transport at all. PostBus will now be able to improve its services even further and put in place targeted campaigns to encourage combined mobility.”", "summary": "A study commissioned by PostBus Switzerland Ltd. and carried out in three EPFL laboratories identifies the needs and expectations of the Swiss public regarding “combined” mobility, which currently exhibits the strongest potential for growth in transporting passengers in Switzerland’s metropolitan areas.

No fewer than 60 people external to EPFL will be invited, among whom are famous names in the area of mathematics, such as Jean-Pierre Serre (youngest Fields medal-winner – aged 27, in 1954 – and winner of the Abel Prize in 2003) or Elon Lindenstrauss (Fields medal-winner in 2010).\n The BIC offers a complete infrastructure for the running of these seminars, with meeting places, conference rooms and a back-office for managing the logistics. “We are looking to invite people from the whole world and to get them to work together”, concludes Philippe Michel. The BIC concept is not very prevalent throughout the world, with only a few universities making use of a similar tool. The center is financed by EPFL and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF). \n Link :", "summary": "A new theme-based term is being offered at the EPFL Bernoulli Interfaculty Center.

{"id": 1565, "text": "According to figures released by the UN yesterday, natural disasters have killed more than 1.2 million people since 2000 and cost nearly $ 3 trillion.These pressing threats bring into sharp focus the need for new answers to the problem of soil stabilization. Scientists at EPFL’s Laboratory of Soil Mechanics (LMS) have developed a number of sustainable solutions, including one that uses enzyme metabolism. Although these methods work for a wide range of soil types, they are considerably less effective when it comes to clay soils. In a paper published yesterday in \nScientific Reports\n, the team demonstrates how chemical reactions can be enhanced by using a battery-like system to apply electric current.\nA new type of biocement – produced in situ and at ambient temperature – has recently been put forth as a promising method for stabilizing various soil types. The method harnesses bacterial metabolism to produce calcite crystals that durably bond soil particles together. This biogeochemical process is energy-efficient and cost-effective, and could be rolled out quickly in the coming years. But since the ground needs to be impregnated for the method to work, it is less suited to low-permeability clay soils. Now, the LMS team has developed and successfully tested a viable alternative, which involves applying electric current using sunken electrodes. “Our findings show that this geoelectrochemical system does indeed influence key stages of the calcification process, especially the formation and growth of the crystals that bind the soil together and enhance its behavior,” says Dimitrios Terzis, a scientist at LMS and one of the co-authors of the paper.\nThe biocement is formed by introducing chemical species into the soil. These include dissolved carbonate and calcium ions, which carry opposite charges. Sunken anodes and cathodes are used to create an electric field, much in the same way as a giant battery. The current forces the ions to move across the low-permeability medium, where they intersect, mix together and eventually interact with soil particles. The result is the growth of carbonate minerals, which act as links or “bridges” that enhance the mechanical performance and resistance of soils.\nTechnology transfer grant\nThe paper, which sets out the team’s findings from observing and measuring the quality of these mineral bridges, paves the way for future developments in the field. Further tests, at different scales, are needed before the technology can be applied in the real world. The research was carried out under a 2018–2023 European Research Council (ERC) Advanced grant awarded to Prof. Lyesse Laloui, who heads the LMS and is a co-author of the paper. The project has three verticals, targeting the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that occur at the soil-particle scale (micro-scale), the advanced characterization of mechanical behaviors at laboratory scale, and the large-scale development and demonstration of innovative systems in natural environments. In July 2020, the same research team obtained an additional ERC Proof of Concept grant to accelerate technology transfer to industrial applications.\nIn the past, soils were treated solely as a mix of solid earth, air and water.

{"id": 1571, "text": "There is indeed a glamorous side to the star performer who “spends half his life in the air between New York and Singapore.” Then there is the reality of people who spend two hours every day in a train, bus or car. Sociologists call them ‘highly mobile’ people, whether or not they choose to commute so far and regardless of whether this brings them a big paycheck or career success. Researchers at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory analyzed how this phenomenon has evolved over the past 10 years in four European countries: Switzerland, France, Germany and Spain. Their work has now been published in book form.* In it, they show how people increasingly accept long commutes in response to economic difficulties.\nA highly mobile person is someone who spends more than two hours per day commuting or over 60 nights per year away from home. The book is based on two studies, conducted in 2007 and 2011, that surveyed some 7,000 working people between the ages of 25 and 54. The researchers used the data they collected to construct a biography of these people on the basis of their residential, professional and family lives and their commuting habits over the course of their lives. By revisiting some of the same people in 2011 as in 2007, the researchers were able to measure subtle changes in their behavior and in how they talk about commuting, as well as to estimate the effect of the 2008 economic crisis.\nA way out of unemployment\n First observation: many people commute a long distance to work. Between 11% and 15% of workers between the ages of 25 and 54 are highly mobile. The rates were highest in Germany and Switzerland and grew between 2007 and 2011. “In these countries, people mainly choose the long-distance commute,” said Vincent Kaufmann, Director of LASUR. “This is facilitated by the fact that long trips are made easy by the very effective transit system.”\nOn the other hand, in Spain – and to a lesser extent in France – long commutes tend not to be by choice and are sometimes the only way out of unemployment. The 2008 crisis is still being felt. In Spain, the number of long-term commuters fell, while the number of people away from home has doubled. In 2011, one out of every two highly mobile commuters became that way to escape unemployment, versus 28% in France, 22% in Germany and 13% in Switzerland.\nIn addition to comparisons by country and over time, the book categorizes highly mobile commuters in a way that often belies stereotypes. In most cases they are not well-paid people with a high level of education. And their efforts will not necessarily lead to career success. While it is generally a springboard in Switzerland and for women in France, in Spain it is more the result of need. More personally, the book looks at how people deal with the need to commute a long distance over the course of their lives. Why does one commute? Is it by force, choice or necessity? How do people view their own situation? What do they hope to gain from it?\nIn the grand scheme of things, what is the social cost of high mobility? In short, marital instability and lower birth rates. Among women surveyed who had never experienced episodes of high mobility, 10% did not have children at the time of the interview. These figures rise to 18% for women who experienced high mobility, 22% among long-term commuters and 23% among those who commuted long distances early in their career. One must add to this stress, fatigue and a “higher burn-out rate,” according to the sociologist. “Professional exhaustion often causes people to rethink their choices and give up the highly mobile life.”\n“High Mobility in Europe,” by Vincent Kaufmann and Gil Viry, published by Palgrave Macmillan, August 2015.", "summary": "What drives people to spend hours commuting to and from work?

{"id": 1572, "text": "When vertebrates run, their legs exhibit minimal contact with the ground. But insects are different. These six-legged creatures run fastest using a three-legged, or “tripod” gait where they have three legs on the ground at all times – two on one side of their body and one on the other. The tripod gait has long inspired engineers who design six-legged robots, but is it necessarily the fastest and most efficient way for bio-inspired robots to move on the ground?\nResearchers at EPFL and UNIL revealed that there is in fact a faster way for robots to locomote on flat ground, provided they don’t have the adhesive pads used by insects to climb walls and ceilings. This suggests designers of insect-inspired robots should make a break with the tripod-gait paradigm and instead consider other possibilities including a new locomotor strategy denoted as the “bipod” gait. The researchers’ findings are published in \nNature Communications\n.\nThe scientists carried out a host of computer simulations, tests on robots and experiments on \nDrosophila melanogaster\n – the most commonly studied insect in biology. “We wanted to determine why insects use a tripod gait and identify whether it is, indeed, the fastest way for six-legged animals and robots to walk,” said Pavan Ramdya, co-lead and corresponding author of the study. To test the various combinations, the researchers used an evolutionary-like algorithm to optimize the walking speed of a simulated insect model based on \nDrosophila\n. Step-by-step, this algorithm sifted through many different possible gaits, eliminating the slowest and shortlisting the fastest.\nAdhesive pads\n The findings shed new light on problems for biologists and robotics engineers alike. The researchers found that the common insect tripod gait did emerge when they optimized their insect model to climb vertical surfaces with adhesion on the tips of its legs. By contrast, simulations of ground-walking without the adhesiveness of insects’ legs revealed that bipod gaits, where only two legs are on the ground at any given time, are faster and more efficient – although in nature no insects actually walk this way. “Our findings support the idea that insects use a tripod gait to most effectively walk on surfaces in three dimensions, and because their legs have adhesive properties. This confirms a long-standing biological hypothesis,” said Ramdya. “Ground robots should therefore break free from only using the tripod gait”.\nPolymer boots\n The researchers then built a six-legged robot capable of employing either the tripod or bipod gait. The bipod gait was again demonstrated to be faster, corroborating the simulation algorithms’ results.\nFinally, the experimenters examined real insects. To see if leg adhesion might also play a role in the walking coordination of real flies, they put polymer drops on the flies’ legs to cover their claws and adhesive pads – as if the flies were wearing boots – and watched what happened. The flies quickly began to use bipod-like leg coordination similar to the one discovered in the simulation. “This result shows that, unlike most robots, animals can adapt to find new ways of walking under new circumstances,” said Robin Thandiackal, a co-lead author of the study. “There is a natural dialogue between robotics and biology: Many robot designers are inspired by nature and biologists can use robots to better understand the behavior of animal species. We believe that our work represents an important contribution to the study of animal and robotic locomotion.”\n-----\nSource:\n, \nNature Communications", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and UNIL have discovered a faster and more efficient gait, never observed in nature, for six-legged robots walking on flat ground.

{"id": 1573, "text": "Hydraulics research in French-speaking Switzerland is turning 90 this year. It plays a strategic role in the country’s renewable-energy industry and has changed considerably since Alfred Stucky built the first hydraulics lab in 1928 at what was then the Lausanne School of Engineering – and now EPFL.\nTo mark this anniversary, EPFL’s Environmental Hydraulics Laboratory (LHE) and Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) will be holding a special event at the school’s SwissTech Convention Center on 8 March. And since that is also International Women’s Day, they asked six female Doctoral-School alumnae to be the guest speakers, discussing the state of hydraulics research in Switzerland and internationally. The event will also include videos by other key figures from both business and academia. \nLCH director Anton Schleiss is the event organizer. He has headed the lab for 21 years, and was the one who wanted to put the spotlight on women researchers. Schleiss is also the president of the International Commission on Large Dams and advocates academic research that is both practical and competitive on an international level. We spoke with him about this event and his view of the hydraulics industry.\nWhy did you choose female alumnae as the guests of honor for the commemoration?\nIt’s a message we wanted to send. In my experience, it’s very important for a research lab to include scientists from all over the world and have a good balance of men and women – especially if we want to bring in new ideas, create positive energy and instill respect among colleagues. Around a third of the 50-odd thesis projects that I have supervised were by women, which is a pretty good percentage in this field. The women who will speak on March 8 are active around the world and will share their experience with us.\nHow has your discipline evolved over the years?\nHydraulic energy expanded rapidly in Switzerland and internationally between 1928 and the 1970s. For instance, a number of dams and large hydroelectric plants were built in the Alps. Academic research at the time supported these large-scale projects by providing expert reports that aimed to tackle specific problems, such as by conducting experiments on scale models. Research – that is, with no direct link to a major infrastructure project – didn’t reach EPFL until 1972 when Professor Walter H. Graf joined the school. That research studied things like sediment transport in rivers, sand build-up in dam reservoirs and lake hydrodynamics.\nWhat changed in the 1980s?\nBefore, engineers used concrete to completely dam up rivers and canalize them. But when the Reuss river flooded in the Canton of Uri in 1987 – causing over CHF 1 billion in damage because the whole dike failed – we realized that a river will always return to its original course during a flood. That natural disaster triggered a paradigm shift because it showed us we need to pay more attention to rivers’ natural behavior. So engineers started thinking about how to improve existing dams and build better ones in the future, in order to better protect the environment.\nAnd how did this affect research at EPFL?\nWhen I got to the school in 1997, it wasn’t very well-known in Switzerland for providing expertise on river engineering projects carried out under this new paradigm. Contractors turned mostly to ETH Zurich, even in French-speaking Switzerland. So I helped bring this culture to EPFL and increase the number of publications by our researchers. That bolstered our reputation in the scientific community, not just in Switzerland but around the world. We also developed pioneering theories on subjects like the scouring of rocks by high-velocity jets downstream of dams, models to simulate and predict lake floods in the Alps, and walls to protect areas against floods. Our PhD alumni still use these theories, and many of them have set up their own engineering firms. Of course, the research we conduct at our lab changes in line with industry needs. For example, we developed floating retention dams to use in the case of an oil spill; for that we worked on the artificial beaches set up for the Swiss national exposition in 2002. We also studied the safety of reinforced shafts in high-head hydroelectric plants – that research was prompted by the shaft failure and tragic accident at Cleuson-Dixence, just above Nendaz, in 2000. We were also a pioneer in protecting fish in canalized rivers by creating refuges.\nHow has climate change influenced hydraulics research in the past few years?\nIt has given rise to a host of new research topics. River floods have become more frequent and it is now more important than ever to protect rivers’ natural courses. More recently, the melting of glaciers has become a particularly worrying development in Switzerland. As glaciers melt, they form lakes that carry down increasing amounts of moraine – which can accumulate upstream of dams. If a large chunk of a glacier melted into one of these lakes, that could potentially be very dangerous. So we need to continue studying such scenarios.\nHow have your researchers addressed these issues? \nWe formed cross-disciplinary research teams, which was crucial for identifying all aspects of a given project and thus avoid the objections that could cause delays. We introduced a new methodology called Synergie that aims to develop “multi-purpose engineering solutions.” By that we mean solutions that strike the right balance between generating the power that people need and preserving the natural environment. For example, at Riddes in the Canton of Valais, we suggested creating an artificial lake on the Rhone and building a hydroelectric plant. That would not only generate power, but also help protect against floods and eliminate drawdown in the river. What’s more, a lake would provide a thriving habitat for wildlife, a rest area for migrating birds and even a place to go kitesurfing since the region is very windy.\nDams are still controversial, even within the scientific community. What would you say to detractors? \nOne of the biggest challenges of the 21\nst\n century will be to make renewable energy – and, of course, water – available to everyone under the best possible conditions. Out of the around 60,000 large [over 15-meter-high] dams around the world, only a handful are really debatable. Hydropower still has enormous potential worldwide and could replace many of today’s coal-fired plants. But that’s only if we keep to the notion of “synergy” and don’t try to build the biggest and highest dams at any cost. I often say that we need to build better dams for a better world. And that’s a challenge for engineers and companies alike.\n“Hydraulic Laboratory in Civil Engineering, 1928–2018, 90 years of impact thinking,” 8 March 2018, 3pm–5pm, SwissTech Convention Center.

{"id": 1575, "text": "Adhesive wear occurs when two surfaces – such as a brake pad and a wheel’s disc, or a car tire and the road – rub against each other. Why is this a concern? Because the rubbing action generates millions of fine particles that can cause serious problems, such as respiratory illnesses. The formation of this debris also means that the materials get worn down, which eventually leads to both financial and energy-related losses.\nIn 2016, researchers from both the Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LSMS) of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and Cornell University used computer simulations to identify how these particles form. This initial breakthrough, which was published in \nNature Communications\n, laid the groundwork for a new field of study in the broader science of tribology. The researchers have now written another article that goes even further: their computer simulations can be used to calculate the volume, shape and size of this type of debris. Since the smallest particles are the most harmful, this information is crucial to determining how dangerous the particulate matter is. Their work is being published in the \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)\n.\nRevisiting the Archard’s wear equation\n The computer simulation used by the EPFL researchers replicated the physical process of adhesive wear at the atomic level: “Our study shows that the volume of the particles that form depends on the size of the contact areas between the asperities,” says Ramin Aghababaei, the study’s lead author. Aghababaei notes that his study refines the Archard wear equation – the most fundamental yet empirical model of adhesive wear developed in 1953 by British scientist Jack F. Archard that has become a standard in the field of tribology. In this equation, the volume of debris is proportional to both the normal load – i.e., the applied pressure – and the sliding distance between two surfaces. “Previously, researchers and engineers added a coefficient whenever their observations didn’t tally with the equation’s output. Our research, in addition to proving the validity of this equation, establishes a scientific basis for the coefficient.”\nIllustration of adhesive wear, in which two surfaces rubbing together produce debris (diagram). © Ramin Aghababaei\nAn expanding field\n “Until now, researchers had a poor understanding of why this debris formed and how to calculate the volume of particles, because they could only make empirical observations,” says Jean-François Molinari, the director of the LSMS and the study’s co-author. “For close to fifty years, tribology was largely overlooked among the sciences, and even experienced a decline.” According to Molinari, things are turning around now thanks to novel experiments at the nanoscale and to the development of computer simulations, which help researchers analyze physical behaviors that are invisible to the human eye and even the most powerful cameras. “In our lab, two theses are devoted to this field. They are attempting to develop analytical tools that work with real rough surface profiles and various materials.”\nMany applications\n Aghababaei is preparing to set up his own research group as a tenure-track assistant professor at Aarhus University (Denmark). One of the things the group will work on is preventing adhesive wear in wind turbines – just one of the many areas in which this research is relevant. For Aghababaei, this study is just the first step: “Our research will have direct applications in the automobile, aerospace and metals industries, where it could be used to develop coatings that prevent the loss of both materials and energy. A better understanding of debris formation will also give us important insight into gouge formation, of crucial importance to understand earthquakes, and help reduce wear in prosthetic devices and the pain it causes to patients. By measuring the size of these particles, we’ll learn more about these processes and be better equipped to prevent them.”\nThis study, which was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (\n#162569, “Contact mechanics of rough surfaces”\n), was the result of a collaboration between EPFL’s Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory and Cornell University (Professor Derek Warner). \nReferences", "summary": "An EPFL study has deepened our understanding of the fine particles produced by adhesive wear.

Their results are published in the current issue of the scientific journal ”Nature Nanotechnology“. “The model that we propose is extremely precise in its predictions“, says Raffaele Mezzenga, Professor of Food and Soft Materials Sciences at the ETH Zürich. “Up to now there was no such exact and general model for the formation of Amyloid fibers”, continues Giovanni Dietler, Professor of Physics of Living Matter, at the EPF Lausanne.\nThe structure of the Amyloid fibers as it was unveiled by the experiments, surprised the researchers. Single proteins build the long filaments and subsequently the filaments assemble side by side to form the ribbon-like twisted fibers.\nMezzenga explains that the ribbon-like structure is the logic consequence of the strong charge carried by the building blocks of the fibers. In fact, the single proteins feel a strong mutual repulsion preventing them to pack and the ribbon structure is the only one that permits to limit this repulsion. Presently one missing information in the present model, is the exact nature of the short range attraction between the building blocks that drives in the first place the assembly among the protein filaments. Scientists agree that along the filaments there are charge-less domains of hydrophobic character (water repellant) that are the source of the short-range attraction. So there is a balance between attractive and repulsive interactions and the results is the ribbon like twisted conformation.\nSelf-organizing proteins are common in living matter and they are found in large aggregates for example in blood coagulation. Spherical like proteins are used in food industry as emulsifiers, gelling and foaming agents and in vitro they form Amyloid like structures. These latter fibers have properties (elasticity, solubility, etc) favorable for food texturing or to produce special structures. The milk protein beta-lactoglubulin studied by Mezzenga and his colleagues is at the beginning spherical and by a heat treatment accompanied by acid environment it aggregates into the filamentous structures. Beta-lactoglobulin is an important component of the milk serum and therefore very relevant for food industry.\nThe knowledge gained by the scientists on this food protein can potentially benefit medical sciences. In fact Amyloid-like fibers appear in humans affected by neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer- or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These human fibers, although made out of a very different proteins, are also ribbon-like and twisted and their assembly into long aggregates is presently under intense scrutiny. The model proposed by the team could also help to understand the genesis and development of theses diseases.", "summary": "Researchers at ETH Zürich, EPF Lausanne and at the University of Fribourg have evidenced a basic general mechanism describing how filamentous proteins assemble into ribbon like structures, the so-called Amyloid fibrils.

{"id": 1582, "text": "Sometimes barely noticeable, and at other times devasting, earthquakes are a major geological phenomenon which provide a stark reminder that our planet is constantly evolving. Scientists have made significant progress in understanding these events over the past 50 years thanks to sensors set up around the world. And while we now know that earthquakes are caused by shifts in tectonic plates, a lot remains to be learned about how and why they occur.\nPasselègue, a scientist at ENAC’s , has been studying the dynamics of faults – or the areas between tectonic plates, where most earthquakes occur – for the past ten years. He recently made a major breakthrough in understanding the rupture mechanisms that eventually lead to seismic shifts along fault lines.  on 12 October 2020.\nWe know that rupture speeds can vary from a few millimeters per second to a few kilometers per second once nucleation occurs [the process by which a slip expands exponentially]. But we don’t know why some ruptures propagate very slowly and others move quickly. However, that’s important to know because the faster the propagation, the quicker the energy that accumulates along the fault is released.” \nFrançois Passelègue\nAn earthquake will generally release the same amount of energy whether it moves slowly or quickly. The difference is that if it moves slowly, its seismic waves can be absorbed by the surrounding earth. These types of slow earthquakes are just as frequent as regular ones; it’s just that we can’t feel them. In extremely fast earthquakes – which occur much less often – the energy is released in just a few seconds through potentially devasting high-frequency waves. That’s what sometimes occurs in Italy, for example. The country is located in a friction zone between two tectonic plates. While most of its earthquakes aren’t (or are barely) noticeable, some of them can be deadly – like the one on 2 August 2016 that left 298 people dead.\n“A single fault can demonstrate all kinds of seismic mechanisms”\nIn his study, Passelègue developed an experimental fault with the same temperature and pressure conditions as an actual fault running 8 km deep. He installed sensors along the fault to identify the factors causing slow vs. fast rupture propagation. “There are lots of hypotheses out there – most scientists think it’s related to the kind of rock. They believe that limestone and clay tend to result in slow propagation, whereas harder rocks like granite are conducive to fast propagation,” he says. Passelègue’s model uses a complex rock similar to granite. He was able to replicate various types of slip on his test device, and found that “the difference isn’t necessarily due to the properties of the surrounding rock. A single fault can demonstrate all kinds of seismic mechanisms.”\nIn his study, Passelègue developed an experimental fault with the same temperature and pressure conditions as an actual fault running 8 km deep. © 2020 Alain Herzog\nPasselègue’s experiments showed that the amount of energy released during a slip, and the length of time over which it’s released, depend on the initial strain exerted along the fault; that is, the force applied on the fault line, generally from shifting tectonic plates. By applying forces of different magnitudes to his model, he found that higher strains triggered faster ruptures and lower strains triggered slower ruptures. “We believe that what we observed in the lab would apply under real-world conditions too,” he says.\nEarthquakes may not be random occurrences \nUsing the results of his model, Passelègue developed equations that factor in the initial strain on a fault and not just the amount of energy accumulated immediately before a slip, which was the approach used in other equations until now.\nFrançois is one of the first scientists to measure rupture speeds in rocks under the same temperature and pressure conditions that you find out in nature. He developed a way to model the mechanisms physically – something that had never been done before. And he showed that all earthquakes follow the same laws of physics\nMarie Violay, head of LEMR.\nPasselègue warns that his model cannot be used to determine when or where an earthquake will occur. Since faults run too deep, scientists still aren’t able to continually measure the strain on rock right along a fault. “We can identify how much strain there needs to be to cause a rupture, but since we don’t know how much a fault is ‘loaded up’ with energy deep underground, we can’t predict the rupture speed.”\nIn his study, Passelègue developed an experimental fault with the same temperature and pressure conditions as an actual fault running 8 km deep. © 2020 Alain Herzog\nOne implication of Passelègue’s research is that earthquakes may not be as random as we thought. “Most people think that faults that have been stable for a long time will never cause a serious earthquake. But we found that any kind of fault can trigger many different types of seismic events. That means a seemingly benign fault could suddenly rupture, resulting in a fast and dangerous wave propagation.”", "summary": "The speed and intensity with which seismic waves propagate after an earthquake depend mainly on forces occurring deep inside the rocks along a fault line, according to a study by EPFL scientist François Passelègue.

The framework presented as a resource in this paper is an important building block towards a detailed, bottom-up model of the mammalian hippocampus. The framework could provide a platform to not only enable the integration of disparate datasets but also catalyse a community-driven consensus of synaptic organization in the hippocampal formation. \nThe closest cellular and synaptic-level approximation of cortical tissue to date in a model is the ’s biologically detailed digital reconstruction of rat neocortical microcircuitry (Markram*, Muller*, Ramaswamy*, Reimann* et al. 2015).

The presentation on sports innovation was included for the first time this year.\nHow are technology and sports related?\n Just like in biomedicine, where technology can enable doctors to carry out less invasive treatments, develop artificial tissue and prescribe personalized therapies, advancements in sporting equipment can enhance performance, aerodynamics, and ergonomics – allowing athletes to push the limits of their sport even further.\nSo will their exploits be human or technology-driven? \n Modern technology can make poles more resistant, skis more flexible and tennis rackets lighter, meaning they are safer and easier for athletes to use. But the records that athletes set will remain a product of their individual or team performance, as they should.\nWhat research areas are used in sports innovation?\n Two prime examples are materials science, to develop components for skis, and microelectronics, to make sensors for studying the movements and mechanics of the human body. Research like this can help athletes to excel in their achievements. Computer science is also being increasingly used to model specific actions, generate real-time images of match statistics and analyze competitors’ performance.\nIs EPFL involved in this research?\n Sports professionals have a long history of teaming up with high-tech labs. EPFL was involved in the design and testing of yachts for the Alinghi team, which won the America’s Cup in 2003 and 2007.

{"id": 1586, "text": "For the past 5 years, Andrea Bassi’s research group has been investigating densification and its effects on urban spaces. In the meantime, the Swiss population has voted to put an end to urban sprawl, putting villages and cities under pressure to accommodate growing numbers of residents without spilling over their perimeters. But what does this mean for people living in cities? Can dense urban centers offer them the quality of life they are after? On Thursday, September 19, Andrea Bassi will present findings from a four-year research project, which focused on the transformation of Geneva’s Praille neighborhood, at the Semaine de la densité, held at the Pavilion Sicli in Geneva.\nIf we look into the past, we come across several failed attempts at urban densification. What have we learned in the meantime that you believe could help us avoid repeating them? \n This is true, but it is important to remember that modernity is still only around 100 years old. 50 years ago, we hadn’t yet had enough time to learn how to deal with such high population densities. And like after any other kind of revolution, be it political, scientific, or social, initially, ideologies dominate. In urban planning, the ideology behind zoning, promoted by Le Corbusier in particular, and the separation of residential, commercial, and industrial areas connected by a transportation network prevailed. Today, in contrast, we have reached a level of maturity that allows us to distance ourselves from these strict ideologies. At least here in Switzerland, we see through them and appreciate the pros and cons of each approach. Rather than blindly applying ideological solutions, we respond to challenges using our knowhow and experience.\nHow can architects address the challenges that come with urban densification? \nOne of the main challenges we run into in cities is personal mobility, largely due to the separation of residential, commercial, and industrial areas. By promoting urban mixity, that is, the coexistence of spaces dedicated to these activities and to recreational purposes, we can reduce the reliance on motorized means of transport. But to architects, this means that we have to put more emphasis on designing the spaces that connect different activities, which lie somewhere at the crossroads between collective, anonymous, and private spaces, and have an appeasing effect by promoting social interactions. Think about it. If you have to drive your children to school every morning for 5 minutes, you are much less likely to interact with a neighbor than if you walk them to school. And the same is true of shopping, the movies, etc. With increased mixity, city life becomes more organic.\nSo what will these dense neighborhoods look like? \nWe understand that there is no single type of building that works best in this context. Instead, we should leverage the diversity of building types and make them coexist – high-end apartments next to subsidized housing, etc. Here, diversity is an important asset. But would we feel comfortable in a city, where some buildings are built using wood, others using concrete, and others still using plastics? I argue in favor of a more homogenous approach based on concrete. In the past century, this would have created a dry, dull atmosphere, but today, we know how to work concrete and take advantage of its many surprising facets.\nWould this be sustainable? \nIt may come as a surprise, but yes. Studies conducted at the federal level have shown that in the middle to long term, building with concrete is more sustainable as building with wood. But it entails a paradigm shift in the way we look at cities. In the past, cities drew on their surroundings for natural resources. Quarries provided stone and sand, while forests provided wood. But today, cities are increasingly becoming their own quarries, where materials from torn down buildings are recycled and provides the primary resources to build new ones. In this case in particular, but also otherwise, the components used to produce concrete are much more local than wood, which is typically transported hundreds of kilometers by truck.\nSo when do we begin moving in this direction? \nWe already are! The master plan for the Praille neighborhood in Geneva is based on a mixed, dense program. A national construction program outlining many of these themes is already in place. The Lemanic metropolis has been a reality for the past two years. And cement recycling is already happening.

{"id": 1591, "text": "Corals, like all animals, must eat to live. The problem is that most corals grow in tropical waters that are poor in nutrients, sort of like ocean deserts; it’s this lack of nutrients that makes the water around coral reefs so crystal clear. Because food is not readily available, corals have developed a remarkable feeding mechanism that involves a symbiotic relationship with single-celled algae. These algae grow inside the corals, using the coral tissue as shelter and absorbing the CO\n2\n that the corals produce. In exchange, the algae provide corals with nutrients they produce through photosynthesis. These algae contain a variety of pigments, which give the coral reefs the colors they’re known for. \nOver the past 35 years, tropical oceans have experienced multiple major heat waves. Scientists have observed that during these episodes, the algae – stressed by the warmer temperatures – release compounds that are toxic to the coral, prompting the coral to expel the algae from their tissue. That means the corals lose their color and their primary food source, and then begin to starve. This is the process of coral bleaching. And it has been occurring more and more frequently, threatening the survival of many reefs, including Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Bleached corals do not necessarily die; their symbiotic algae population can be reestablished if the conditions around a reef return to normal. But if the heat persists, or is aggravated by other factors like pollution, the coral becomes too weak to survive.\n© Nils Rädecker\n, an international team of scientists that includes Nils Rädecker at EPFL’s , reveals a major discovery related to how the symbiotic relationship ends between the coral and algae. “We showed for the first time that the coral starts to suffer from hunger long before the algae are expelled. The algae apparently stop providing sufficient nutrients while they are still inside the coral tissue,” he says.\nWhen symbiosis no longer works \nScientists already knew that ocean warming is the main factor causing the symbiotic relationship to break down. But what Rädecker’s team discovered was that the coral is already in a stressed state and lacking nutrients even before the algae begin releasing toxic compounds. “The roots of the problem are much deeper than we thought, and they involve an early breakdown of the metabolic exchanges in these fascinating organisms,” says Anders Meibom,\nRädecker spent more than a year studying a coral reef just off the coast of Thuwal, Saudi Arabia – the city where the Red Sea Research Center, part of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, is located. He then replicated these environmental conditions in the aquaria at the Center so that he could investigate the corals under controlled conditions. The data were then analyzed at several laboratories, including EPFL and the Biology Department at the University of Konstanz in Germany. \nThe data were analyzed at several laboratories, including EPFL and the Biology Department at the University of Konstanz in Germany. © Nils Rädecker\nCalling known facts into question\n“Based on what we found, we can determine which environmental conditions other than temperature (such as water quality) stress the corals in a reef, and use this information to predict whether the reef will bleach. Our findings can also be used to identify corals that are particularly resistant to bleaching, like those in the Gulf of Aqaba and elsewhere in the Red Sea. That will tell scientists which reefs should be protected because they have a better chance of survival,” says Rädecker.\nAccording to Meibom, this study makes a major contribution to coral research and sheds new light on earlier observations. “Nils’ research has uncovered metabolic mechanisms that play a fundamental role in the coral bleaching process – and that we didn’t understand the importance of until now.

He/she will be complemented – and challenged – by a personality from «the terrain»: former Federal Councillor \nPascal Couchepin\n will comment on politics, Logitech founder \nDaniel Borel\n on entrepreneurship, Nobel Prize winner \nKurt Wüthrich \non science, architect\n Mario Botta \non multiculturalism, etc. We will show movies, bring in “authentic Swiss” music, organize field trips and do our best to make it fun and special.\nAbout Pascal Couchepin\nAfter a long career in local politics as mayor of the city of Martigny, Pascal Couchepin was elected to the Swiss parliament in 1979 where he soon became a “front bencher” and the head of the Parliamentary Group of his party, the Swiss Radical/Liberal Party. In 1998 he was elected to the Swiss Government where he took over the Federal Department for Economic Affairs. From 2003 until his resignation in September 2009, he acted as the head of the Department of Home Affairs, a ministry with a very broad range of responsibilities including Education and Research, Social Security and Public Health. Twice, in 2003 and 2008, Pascal Couchepin served as the President of Switzerland.\nThe course is in English. However, in order not to miss out on the world-renowned Swiss spontaneity (!), some parts will be in French (why not improve your French at the same time….).\nThe programme begins on Thursday, 30 September, 2010.\nThe classes are every second \nThursday from 5.15 to 7 pm.\nThe sessions take place in\n auditorium SG 1 from October 7, 2010.\nRegistration by email to the following address :", "summary": "The former Federal Councillor will be on campus to bring his expertise to three exception classes on Swiss institutions.", "claim": "The former Federal Councillor will be on campus to bring its expertise to three exception classes on Swiss institutions.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}

{"id": 1599, "text": "There are particle accelerators in the universe that are far more powerful than CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. Supermassive black holes in the centers of far-off galaxies and the remainders of exploded stars, for example, send various particles, known as cosmic rays, hurtling out into the universe. When these rays interact with interstellar space, they produce another kind of radiation, known as gamma rays. Telescopes observe these particles in order to reveal potential those cosmic accelerators. These telescopes can capture flashes of light, called Cherenkov flashes, that occur when gamma rays interact with the Earth’s atmosphere. The observation of these brief flashes requires ultra-rapid, sensitive cameras that can record several billions images per second. This is the feat that’s been accomplished by the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT), designed by EPFL and the universities of Geneva, Dortmund, and Würzburg under the leadership of ETH Zurich.\nGetting a glimpse into where cosmic rays are born\nNearly a century has passed since the discovery of cosmic rays, yet their origin remains one of the fundamental unsolved mysteries of modern physics. The FACT telescope is the first step towards solving this mystery, which will involve building a network of Cherenkov telescopes. This network will be crucial for identifying the source of cosmic radiation. Physicists hope to be able to associate the observed flashes with a known object such as a supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy or a stellar supernova.\nNew technology\nThis is the first time that this semiconductor-based camera technology is being used in astronomy. The FACT telescope detector is composed of light-sensitive diodes that produce an electric current when they record a flash of Cherenkov radiation. The semiconductors are advantageous for several reasons. The camera is lightweight, and so a telescope equipped with it can also be lighter in weight. It maintains good sensitivity in high ambient light conditions. It is thus possible to make observations when the moon is full; the detector’s performance is not compromised by exposure to light, as is quickly the case with traditional cameras.\nA 45-person team built the FACT telescope camera on the ETH Zurich campus. Once completed, the detector was sent to the El Roque de los Muchachos observatory in the Canary Islands. It was mounted on an already existing telescope that had been completely restored by a team from EPFL and the universities of Dortmund and Würzburg. Calibration tests and the observations of the first flashes were largely carried out by an EPFL team from the High Energy Physics Laboratory, led by Mathieu Ribordy, who is in charge of for data processing for the telescope. Scientists from the laboratory were able to put to use what they had learned from their participation in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, an installation in the Antarctic designed to detect high energy cosmic ray neutrinos.\nLinks:", "summary": "For the first time, a Cherenkov telescope has been equipped with a camera based on a new technology that uses semiconductors.

Scientists can already assess this tiny organism’s morphology and genetic makeup, but there is currently no way to determine its internal chemistry. Yet obtaining this data would make it easier to more accurately predict the likelihood of healthy development. EPFL spin-off Annaida has developed EmbryoSpin, a new sensor that allows hospitals and clinicians to predict the viability of an embryo and produces results in just one hour. The company has recently completed its first fundraising round, securing one million Swiss francs to hire new staff and test the safety and efficacy of its technology before proceeding to clinical trials.\nA smart chip for fertility\nConventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems are incapable of producing valid results for organisms as small as a grain of sand. Although some specialized devices are available, they’re not widespread because they are too complicated to use, too expensive and not yet sensitive enough. Several research groups around the world are currently tackling these issues. Solving these problems would give scientists unprecedented insights into the internal chemistry of microscopic entities, such as embryos and organoids – miniaturized organs that are increasingly used in pharmaceutical research. “The new sensor developed at EPFL’s Microsystems Laboratory (LMIS1), combines ease of use with unprecedented performance at microscopic scales, enabling previously impossible applications”, says Gora Conley, cofounder of Annaida. The scaled-down device can observe samples 50 times smaller than conventional systems – including human embryos in the very earliest stages of development.\nNMR harnesses the intrinsic properties of the nuclei of certain atoms in the presence of a strong magnetic field. These nuclei absorb electromagnetic waves then release the absorbed energy at a specific frequency, which differs according to the type of atom and the chemical environment inside the molecule. Using a receiver to capture this signal allows scientists to determine the internal chemistry of the sample. The new technology developed at the School of Engineering de l'EPFL uses purpose-built 3D-printed microfluidic structures to guide and contain samples smaller than a nanoliter. The structure is combined with a microchip, similar to those found in smartphones, which contains all the needed electronics. The whole system is just one millimeter across.\n“In preliminary trials, we demonstrated that our technology is sensitive enough to detect the chemical composition of tiny organisms,” says Annaida co-founder Marco Grisi, whose PhD thesis served as the groundwork for the technology. “More recently, we tested the system on embryoids obtained from mouse stem cells to see just how powerful it was. The sensor was able to detect viable signals showing the presence of lipids and metabolites, producing results in less than three hours.” The next step is to determine which chemical markers are predictors of healthy embryo development.\n“EmbryoSpin is a commercially viable, robust and easy-to-use device,” says Gora Conley . “We are now working to develop a system compatible with the typical workflow of a busy fertility clinic.”", "summary": "EPFL spin-off Annaida is developing a magnetic resonance system that can detect the chemistry inside the tiniest living organisms.

It is impossible for them to know who asked first, who most needs their help, how much time the students spent on a certain exercise, or if a collective explanation would be more beneficial. Lantern reveals all of this using a simple luminous device – an invaluable aid for classroom management.\nThe colored lamps make it possible for the teacher to see both how much time students spent on an exercise and on which they are working. At the start of the session, students light their lamps. Light intensity gradually increases as time passes. When moving to the next problem, they turn the lamp up a notch. It changes color and begins anew at the lowest intensity. And then the cycle repeats.\nObjectively Managing Expectations \nNeed help from the professor? The student presses the lamp. The top of the lantern glows pink and flashes more rapidly as time passes. Teachers can objectively manage a classroom in a blink of an eye. They can know, for example, how long students have been waiting or on which exercise they are working. If numerous lamps are flashing for the same exercise, the instructor knows immediately that a collective explanation will save time.\nFor students, it’s also a time saver. No more long minutes spent trying to catch the instructor’s attention to receive help. When assistance is needed, nearly 70% of the student’s time is spent at this task. That is what Hamed Alavi, head of the spin-off that developed Lantern, calculated when observing the work of many classes during his thesis at the Center for Pedagogical Research and Support at EPFL (CRAFT) .\nAfter the lesson the teacher can connect the lamps to a computer, and software shows the statistics: the average time spent on each exercise, waiting time, etc. This creates valuable information for preparing upcoming sessions. They can then be reprogrammed to determine the time required to solve each problem for the next session.

{"id": 1608, "text": "The molecule developed by Cellestia Biotech, an EPFL spin-off, is a targeted therapy designed to treat cancers resulting from a mutation of the Notch gene. Clinical trials are scheduled to start soon in Spain. This oral treatment is the first to work by stopping the problem at its roots, i.e., in the cell's nucleus. It inhibits the protein complex – which allow cancerous cells to multiply – so that they cannot generate signals.\nOne of the alternatives to chemotherapy currently being investigated by experts is the array of signals generated by proteins in a cell’s nucleus. A normal Notch protein plays an indispensable role in embryonic development and in the formation and maintenance of stem cells. Genetic lesions, however, can result in an abnormal signaling pathway that facilitates the development of cancerous cells and causes resistance to conventional therapies. This vicious signaling pathway has been the subject of several recent studies that have confirmed its link to breast cancer, leukemia and several types of lymphoma. Around 250,000 patients worldwide are diagnosed each year with a cancer related to this type of genetic lesion.\nBinding with the protein to keep it quiet \nThe safest way to block the signaling pathway is to cut it off at the source, preventing the protein from activating signals in the nucleus. Molecule CB-103, discovered by Rajwinder Lehal during his doctoral studies in Freddy Radtke's laboratory at EPFL, binds with the protein complex and inhibits its activity inside the nucleus. This cuts off all Notch signals regardless of how they are activated, thereby killing off the cancerous cells. Other therapies that target the Notch signaling pathway have also been investigated by research groups, but their effects remain peripheral – some block only part of the pathway while others inhibit different mechanisms involved in other cellular processes.\nPatents have been filed for the molecule and for the development and marketing of several similar molecules. Both in-vitro and in-vivo tests carried out on the molecule showed excellent efficacy and tolerance. It also demonstrated rapid uptake and distribution in tissues.\nThe clinical trial will be partly funded by the CHF 8 million in seed financing raised by the startup early this year. The researchers will investigate several factors such as tolerability and the dosages for adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Biomarkers have also been developed to ensure that patients taking part in the trial have the right type of cancer for the molecule.\nA highly coveted molecule\n\"The Notch pathway has become a key target for cancer therapies because of the critical role it plays in tumorigenesis. That’s why it’s being researched by so many pharmaceutical companies,\" says Rajwinder Lehal, Chief Science Officer at Cellestia Biotech.

At the invitation of Jilion, a start-up company based in Innovation Square, EPFL computer science student Andrea Coiro developed a weather application for Apple’s iPad for his Bachelor’s project. Yet another weather app? “It’s true that there are already a lot of them on the market,” admits Mehdi Aminian, co-founder of the company. “But most of them are either too tacky or contain too much information, sloppily presented.”\nJilion, which has already developed an Internet service called “Sublime Video” that can incorporate a universal video player into web pages (even readable on iPhone and iPad using the HTML 5 format), was looking for something exceptional, and, above all, beautiful from a design standpoint. “We were naturally interested in what’s being done in luxury watchmaking,” continues Aminian.\nThe application, baptized Aelios, opens onto a world map. In the center, a finely-detailed dial evokes both antique navigational instruments and Swiss luxury watches. The user can drag the dial around the map and zoom, putting the area of interest in the center of the dial. A circle is automatically drawn around the largest city. The local hour is displayed, both digitally and on the 24-hour clock on the dial. The length of the day and night are even shown – in this month of June, you can watch the night portion dwindle to nothing the farther north you drag the dial.\nBut Aelios’ selling point is of course how it shows the weather. As soon as a city is selected, symbols appear around the dial: in a single glance, you can see the local forecast for the entire day. A small tap on the dial and it displays forecasts for the upcoming week. The forecasts come from a service at the world-reputed Norwegian Meteorological Institute (). “Our application is set up to get input from several sources, however – which will soon be implemented in the US,” says Aminian.\nPerformance, speed and an elegant presentation: all the ingredients came together to seduce iPad users. And they didn’t need much persuading. In Switzerland and Germany, thousands of people didn’t hesitate to shell out a few coins (3.30 chf in Switzerland) to buy the app, and in a few days it was the number one iPad download in Apple’s online store. It was quickly at the top of the “weather apps” category in twelve countries, without any promotion at all save a “buzz” that got started on Twitter and an “app of the day” selection by the site Gizmodo.com. “For us it was a pleasant surprise,” admits the Jilion co-founder.\nWhen his project was finished, Coiro joined the Jilion team – a \nmodus operandi \nthat Aminian would like to encourage. “We would like to use this as a model -- get other students going on exciting projects, and then hire them when they’ve proven themselves,” he concludes.", "summary": "Aelios is an application that was developed as an EPFL Bachelor’s project.

{"id": 1610, "text": "Schizophrenia appears in adolescence or adulthood and often comes with false beliefs, paranoid thoughts, and a tendency to see or hear things that aren’t there. The strongest risk factor for the disorder is the presence of an affected close relative: one in ten siblings of people with schizophrenia are predicted to develop the disorder, compared with 1 in 100 individuals among the general population.\nHowever, scientists have known that there is no one single genetic variant that causes schizophrenia. The disorder rather stems from many different DNA mutations, duplications, and deletions that cause the developing brain to go awry. For this reason, predicting who’s at risk of developing schizophrenia is no simple task.\nBecause genetic studies yield slow clues into dozens of genes associated with schizophrenia, the disorder should be dissected into measurable traits found in both individuals with schizophrenia and unaffected members of their families, says study co-senior author Michael Herzog, head of the Psychophysics Laboratory at EPFL School of Life Sciences. These quantifiable traits, called endophenotypes, connect the symptoms of a disorder to the underlying genetic risk factors.\nLooking for endophenotypes of schizophrenia, the researchers analyzed the brain patterns of 101 people with schizophrenia, 43 of their unaffected siblings, and 75 healthy individuals who reported no family history of schizophrenia.\nLed by Janir Ramos da Cruz, a postdoc in the Herzog’s lab and the lab of Patrícia Figueiredo at the University of Lisbon, the team scanned the participants’ brains using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). This non-invasive technique measures the brain’s electrical activity via electrodes attached to the scalp of individuals as they relax and sit still for about five minutes.\nAfter gathering the EEG data, the researchers tracked specific patterns of neuronal activity that have been described as the building blocks of cognition and emotion. Dubbed “EEG microstates,” these patterns last between 60 and 120 milliseconds and arise when specific brain areas activate together.\nBrain ‘signature’\nPrevious work has revealed that individuals with schizophrenia have abnormal EEG microstates, but the new study is the first to show that unaffected siblings share the same abnormalities in these brain patterns.\nThe researchers found that a specific type of microstate, called class C, occurred more frequently and for longer durations in individuals with schizophrenia and their siblings than it did in healthy people. Other brain activity patterns, known as microstate class D, occurred less frequently and for shorter amounts of time in those with schizophrenia and their siblings than in healthy individuals.\nWhat’s more, people who had just experienced their first episode of psychosis showed the same anomalous patterns of brain activity as those who had been suffering from schizophrenia for years. “This suggests that these microstate abnormalities occur right at the beginning of the disease,” Ramos da Cruz says.\nThe team also found that a third type of microstate, called class B, occurred more frequently and for longer periods in siblings than in individuals with schizophrenia. This might explain why healthy siblings do not show schizophrenia-related behaviors, despite sharing the same brain ‘signature’ as people with the disorder. “This could be a protection mechanism that prevents the imbalance in microstates class C and D from creating functional problems,” Ramos da Cruz says.\nHow the alterations in EEG microstates affect brain function is still unclear, Herzog cautions. “But for diagnostic purposes, you don’t need to know that,” he adds. Herzog says that looking for abnormal patterns in brain waves could be one component of a screening battery for schizophrenia, and it could help to detect who is susceptible to the disorder before clinical symptoms develop.\nIn the future, EEG microstates could even inform treatment and prevention strategies for this neuropsychiatric disorder. Knowing how the microstates contribute to schizophrenia could lead to personalized treatments using techniques that modulate brain activity patterns, Herzog says. “If we can improve even just the symptoms by a small factor, that would still be a major relief for the patients,” he says.", "summary": "People with schizophrenia and their healthy siblings share patterns of brain activity that are different from those seen in individuals with no family history of the disorder, scientists from EPFL have found.

{"id": 1611, "text": "A ‘killer application’ is what all start-ups are looking for – the most lucrative way a new technology could be commercialized. A killer application (or \nkiller app\n for short) is any technological innovation that many people “have to have.” Telephones, home computers and televisions are all killer apps, but so are spreadsheet programs, iphones and Google. There is no set recipe for how and why killer apps come about, and new technologies often make their companies the most money by being used for purposes not even imagined at their conception.\n Marc Gruber, director of the Research Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization at EPFL, and his team of doctoral students are trying to better understand why some start-ups develop killer apps while others do not. His team studied over 140 different technology start-ups looking for patterns of success in the data, their results were recently published in the .\n What is there typical profile of a successful start-up?\nMarc Gruber:\n We found in our study that a successful start-up tends to have a small team of three or four people with different backgrounds. Heterogeneity plays an important role. The superior team combination is a specialist who is a detail oriented person with specific skills and a generalist who has the larger picture in mind and probably has past entrepreneurial experience. The decisions made at the early stages of the start-up are fundamental to the success of finding a killer app – this combination of persons and personalities have a propensity to create the right circumstances for making the right decisions from the beginning.\n Are there any notable exceptions to this rule?\nMarc Gruber:\n Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Computers, could be considered an exception. He is the sort of entrepreneur who embodies, alone, both the specific knowledge needed to obtain technological excellence as well as the commercialization knowledge necessary to make the visionary decisions that lead to killer apps. Technology and its management are two sides of the same coin.\n What extent does culture play a role in shaping entrepreneurship?\nMarc Gruber:\n Culture definitely plays a key role. We look forward to our next study, where we analyze 500 European technology start-ups, to better understand the influence of culture in start-up success. What we have already observed is that many factors contribute to success and sometimes one or more of these factors are missing in a specific culture. Take Switzerland for example, we have extraordinary technological and human resources, but when it comes to growth, Swiss start-ups often fall short. It appears that many Swiss entrepreneurs prefer to maintain their individual liberty and not get chained down by being responsible for a larger number of employees. We hope that by recognizing this short-coming for what it is, we can teach future entrepreneurs here at EPFL to master firm growth and value creation.\n Marc Gruber will be teaching a course on Entrepreneurship to EPFL Bachelor students in Spring 2011, and regularly holds seminars for EPFL master and PhD students.", "summary": "Marc Gruber at EPFL’s College of Management is teaching his students how to look for ‘killer applications.’ An interview.", "claim": "Marc Gruber at EPFL’s College of Management is teaching your students how to look for ‘killer applications.’ An interview.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}

Unfortunately, it seems to be rather good at doing that in the human population, and seems to be spreading even more effectively than the influenza virus which causes the flu. It is also unfortunately ­\n­­\n- to the best of our current knowledge - more deadly than the seasonal flu. But unlike the flu, the people who are most at risk from critical complications, or even death, are the elderly. A pandemic, i.e. non-seasonal flu, often affects young adults more strongly.\nQ. What makes it so hard to contain and/or treat, compared to seasonal flu?\nTo be clear — we are not good at all at containing the flu. Every year, it infects about 10% of the human population, and that with vaccines. For COVID, we don’t even have a vaccine (yet). Vaccines are still our number one weapon in our fight against the flu — without the vaccine, the flu would infect probably around a third of the population, which is what we normally see for pandemic, non-seasonal flu. Also, because we are exposed to the seasonal flu each year, over time everyone has some form of immunity against some variants, either through vaccines or through infections. To this novel coronavirus, it currently looks like there is no or very little immunity in humans.\nQ. What are some things institutions like EPFL can do to prevent the spread of the virus?\nAs you may know, EPFL and other public institutions have been publicly criticized recently by the head of the communicable disease division at the federal office for public health, for taking \"excessive measures” - for example with the schools’ policy that people returning from China should not come to the campus for 14 days. The criticism was that this doesn’t follow the official federal line. I must say I was quite stunned to hear this. I think that EPFL is doing the right thing, for the good of its community, even if the measures so decided are more intense than what the federal office recommends at a given time point.\nQ. What is the best strategy for containing and treating COVID-19?\nThere are currently no particular COVID treatments. Hospitals will treat patients to the best of their knowledge, depending on the severity of the disease. For containment, we have the options of various so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions, ranging from small but important personal measures such as frequent and thorough hand-washing, not shaking hands etc. to more drastic community measures such as cancelling large events, traveling restrictions, and the like. The former is something everyone can start to do. The latter is of course more serious, and should be recommended only after careful deliberation.\nQ. How do you think the outbreak will evolve globally?\nI think there is currently little hope that it can still be contained, and we must plan for global spread. I will be very happy to be wrong about this but from looking at the data, and talking to many of my epidemiology colleagues, I can see very little diverging opinions about that. Our goal now has to be to focus on mitigation, i.e. making sure we can dampen the impact, and delay the epidemic as much as possible, in order to buy us time for the potential development of a vaccine, or drugs, and to make sure the healthcare systems won’t be dramatically overburdened.\nQ. Which countries are at higher risk?\nHard to say. In general, countries with better healthcare infrastructure, better surveillance, and more transparent governance are generally in a better situation than others.\nQ. How can we know when the pandemic has reached the tipping point?\nIf you mean the peak, then that’s something that will show up in the numbers.\nQ. Why is closing the borders considered inefficient?\nBecause it runs under the assumption that infections come from abroad. The first ones always do (by definition that’s correct in all countries but one) but it takes only a few infections inside the country to seed local outbreaks. Open borders also bring a lot of essential goods and services to the country, and any risk-benefit analysis would strongly be against closed borders. And once you have local spread, closing borders makes no sense because you already have the problem at home. These kinds of questions have been modeled extensively and we understand well that their effect is very limited.\nQ. What is the role of digital epidemiology in the COVID-19 outbreak?\nDigital in general is a massive asset in fighting infectious disease. The rapid data sharing, enabled by digitization, is itself enabling more rapid drug and vaccine development. We can also use digital data streams such as Twitter to better understand the concerns, discussions, worries, and questions in the population. In order to effectively fight a pandemic, you have to bring the population along — you can’t just do things top-down only. That world is long gone. It seems to me that not everyone has fully understood that yet.", "summary": "After his  on the current coronavirus outbreak, we asked EPFL Professor Marcel Salathé, an expert in digital epidemiology, a few follow-up questions.", "claim": "After our  on the current coronavirus outbreak, we asked EPFL Professor Marcel Salathé, an expert in digital epidemiology, a few follow-up questions.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 1], "noise": false}

It ratified the partnership between the canton of Fribourg and EPFL in the construction of the Smart Living Lab (SLL), a new center of expertise dedicated to the technology of the intelligent buildings of the future.\nIndeed, the partners behind the SLL believe that building technologies will play a leading role towards achieving the federal government’s objectives on energy savings and sustainable development. Therefore, the SLL plans to develop research projects of international scale in the fields of design and habitat use.\nLocated in the heart of the blueFACTORY technology park, the SLL will play a central role in the positioning of this new site as a \"zero carbon\" innovation square. It will be an experimental building (yet to be constructed) which will stimulate the cooperation among research groups from EPFL, the University of Fribourg and Fribourg’s College of Engineering and Architecture (EIA-FR) by taking advantage of such institutions’ complementary expertise. The University of Fribourg will base two research groups dedicated to the legal and economic aspects of the intelligent homes of the future at the SLL. For its part, the EIA-FR will contribute with two applied research groups devoted to the technological aspects. As a result, more than fifty researchers will work on the site. The SLL will also aim for the development of research projects with third-party institutions such as the Swiss Federal Laboratory for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA).\n The Canton of Fribourg will finance the infrastructure, installation and running of the University and EIA-FR’s research groups, as well as three EPFL chairs, two of them regular and one for a guest professor. EPFL is on its part committed to adding two other chairs and covering their costs.\nThus, the blueFACTORY site will at first have five EPFL’s teaching and research chairs.

{"id": 1621, "text": "Managing the heat generated in electronics is a huge problem, especially with the constant push to reduce the size and pack as many transistors as possible in the same chip. The whole problem is how to manage such high heat fluxes efficiently. Usually electronic technologies, designed by electrical engineers, and cooling systems, designed by mechanical engineers, are done independently and separately. But now EPFL researchers have quietly revolutionized the process by combining these two design steps into one: they’ve developed an integrated microfluidic cooling technology together with the electronics, that can efficiently manage the large heat fluxes generated by transistors. Their research,  will lead to even more compact electronic devices and enable the integration of power converters, with several high-voltage devices, into a single chip\n.\nThe best of both worlds\nIn this ERC-funded project, Professor Elison Matioli, his doctoral student Remco Van Erp, and their team from the School of Engineering’s Power and Wide-band-gap Electronics Research Laboratory (POWERLAB), began working to bring about a real change in mentality when it comes to designing electronic devices, by conceiving the electronics and cooling together, right from the beginning, aiming to extract the heat very near the regions that heat up the most in the device. “We wanted to combine skills in electrical and mechanical engineering in order to create a new kind of device,” says Van Erp.\nThe team was looking to solve the issue of how to cool electronic devices, and especially transistors. “Managing the heat produced by these devices is one of the biggest challenges in electronics going forward,” says Elison Matioli. “It’s becoming increasingly important to minimize the environmental impact, so we need innovative cooling technologies that can efficiently process the large amounts of heat produced in a sustainable and cost-effective way.”\nMicrofluidic channels and hot spots\nTheir technology is based on integrating microfluidic channels inside the semiconductor chip, together with the electronics, so a cooling liquid flows inside an electronic chip. “We placed microfluidic channels very close to the transistor’s hot spots, with a straightforward and integrated fabrication process, so that we could extract the heat in exactly the right place and prevent it from spreading throughout the device,” says Matioli. The cooling liquid they used was deionized water, which doesn’t conduct electricity. “We chose this liquid for our experiments, but we’re already testing other, more effective liquids so that we can extract even more heat out of the transistor,” says Van Erp.\nReducing energy consumption\n“This cooling technology will enable us to make electronic devices even more compact and could considerably reduce energy consumption around the world,” says Matioli. “We’ve eliminated the need for large external heat sinks and shown that it’s possible to create ultra-compact power converters in a single chip. This will prove useful as society becomes increasingly reliant on electronics.” The researchers are now looking at how to manage heat in other devices, such as lasers and communications systems.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have created a single chip that combines a transistor and micro-fluidic cooling system.

{"id": 1627, "text": "EPFL researchers are taking part in an ambitious project funded by the Swiss NanoTera Program to develop a swimming robot that can detect the source of water pollution. The robot, named Envirobot, is equipped with chemical, physical and biological sensors and measures nearly 1.5 meters long. It moves through water like an eel, without stirring up mud or disturbing aquatic life. Its sensors take measurements at different locations in the water as it swims and send the data to a computer in real-time.\nThe robot is regularly tested in Lake Geneva. A recent test involved simulating water pollution by diffusing salt into a small area just off the shore, thus changing the water’s conductivity. The researchers then let the robot swim in the contaminated area. The robot successfully mapped the variations in conductivity and generated a temperature map. The ultimate goal is for the robot to be able to detect heavy metals like mercury or other pollutants.\n“There are many advantages to using swimming robots. They can take measurements and send us data in real-time – much faster than if we had measurement stations set up around the lake. And compared with conventional propeller-driven underwater robots, they are less likely to get stuck in algae or branches as they move around. What’s more, they produce less of a wake, so they don’t disperse pollutants as much,” says Auke Ijspeert, Head of EPFL's Biorobotics Laboratory (BioRob). “The Envirobot can follow a preprogrammed path, and has also the potential to make its own decisions and independently track down the source of pollution.” That could be by, for example, steadily swimming in the direction of increasing toxicity.\nSensors comprised of bacteria, crustaceans and fish cells\n The robot is made up of numerous modules that each contain a small electric motor for changing curvature, enabling it to move smoothly through the water. The modular design also allows engineers to change its composition and vary its length as needed. “The robot can be easily taken apart, transported to a remote water reservoir, for example, and put back together to begin testing,” says Behzad Bayat, another BioRob researcher.\nSome of the modules contain conductivity and temperature sensors, while others have tiny, sophisticated chambers that fill up with water as the robot swims. These chambers contain miniaturized biological sensors that house either bacteria, small crustaceans or fish cells. The sensors work by observing how these organisms react when put into contact with the water – thereby giving an indication of whether certain key pollutants are present and of the water toxicity in general. The sensors have already proven highly effective in laboratory experiments.\n“For example, we developed bacteria that generate light when exposed to very low concentrations of mercury. We can detect those changes using luminometers and then transmit the data in the form of electrical signals,” says Jan Roelof van der Meer, Project Coordinator and Head of the Department of Fundamental Microbiology at the University of Lausanne.\nAnother method involves using two compartments filled with \nDaphnia\n, which are tiny crustaceans that constantly move around. One compartment is exposed to the water being analyzed, and the other contains clean water. “The \nDaphnia\n’s movement is affected by water toxicity. By comparing changes in their movement relative to the control group, we can get an idea of how toxic the water is,” says van der Meer. And a third method consists of growing fish cells directly on electrodes. When toxins are present, the cells become disturbed and no longer touch each other. That interrupts the flow of electricity – a change that can easily be detected.\nFor now the project team has tested only the conductivity and temperature sensors out in the field; tests of the biological sensors are harder to carry out. “We obviously can’t contaminate a lake like we do the test water in our lab,” says van der Meer. But tests are planned for later this summer. “For now, we will continue using salt as the contaminant until the robot can easily find the source of the contamination. Then we will add biological sensors to the robot and carry out tests with toxic compounds,” he says.\nThe Envirobot project, part of the Nano-Tera research program, is a joint initiative involving EPFL, the University of Lausanne, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland (HES-SO) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG). Its cross-disciplinary approach brings together engineers, biologists and chemists.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL, together with other institutes, have developed a robotic eel that swims through contaminated water to find the source of the pollution.

{"id": 1629, "text": "Thirty-two million people around the world are blind. Between 2 and 4 million of them owe their condition to the loss of light-sensitive cells in their retinas. The most promising treatment for this type of blindness is a retinal implant containing electrodes that electrically stimulate the retinal cells. “But current implants produce very poor results, and their wearers are still considered legally blind,” says Diego Ghezzi, who holds the  in EPFL's School of Engineering. “In order to lead what is considered a ‘normal’ life, the implantee must recover a visual field of at least 40 degrees. Current implants achieve only 20 degrees.\"\nThe LNE researchers have come up with a pioneering, wireless implant made of a highly flexible and pliable material and containing photovoltaic pixels. It is expected to provide wearers with a visual field of 46 degrees along with much better resolution. These findings were recently published in \nNature Communications\n.\nPoor results from existing implants\nThe retinal implants currently available consist of a grid of electrodes placed directly on the retina. The implants are wired to a pair of glasses and a camera and to a portable microcomputer. The camera captures images that enter the implantee’s field of vision and sends them to the computer, which turns them into electrical signals that it transmits to the electrodes. The electrodes stimulate the retinal ganglion cells based on the light patterns detected in the field of vision. The implantee then has to learn how to interpret the incoming visual sensations in order to ‘see’ the images. The more numerous and detailed the patterns, the easier it is for the wearer to recognize them.\nA larger surface area means more pixels \nEPFL’s implant, like conventional implants, is composed of an array of pixels, glasses and a camera – but no wires. It also has a larger surface area designed to widen the visual field and improve image quality. The greater size also means that more retinal cells will be stimulated by the photovoltaic pixels. “This will expand the field of vision,” says Laura Ferlauto, a scientist at the LNE. “Existing implants only stimulate cells at the center of the retina.” Naïg Chenais, a PhD student at the lab, adds: “It also means we can increase the number of photovoltaic pixels, which will sharpen the images.”\nThe same image looks very different, depending on how many pixels are available.\nSurgical constraints\nUntil now, the size of retinal implants was limited mainly by the length of the surgical incision in the eye. “The cut has to be as small as possible to avoid damaging the tissue,” says Chenais. To get past this hurdle, the researchers chose to work with an extremely flexible material. This enables the implant to be folded during surgery, so a larger implant can be inserted without having to lengthen the incision. The material is a transparent, non-toxic polymer that is already used in the medical field. “Because the polymer is flexible, the implant can bend to the curvature of the eye and be in greater contact with the retinal ganglia,” adds Marta Airaghi Leccardi, another PhD student at the LNE.\nPhotovoltaic pixels and no wires\nThe researchers were able to make their implant wireless by replacing the electrodes with photovoltaic pixels. Unlike electrodes, the solar-powered pixels generate an electric current themselves and do not require an external energy source. The light captured by the camera therefore no longer needs to be transformed into electrical signals. Instead, it needs to be magnified in order to be detected and processed by the photovoltaic pixels. “The pixels will only react to light signals that meet certain requirements in terms of intensity, duration and wavelength,” says Ferlauto. “Natural light alone isn’t enough.” A second advantage of photovoltaic pixels is that they take up less space than electrodes. More of them can fit on the implant, which further boosts both visual acuity and the field of vision.\nIn the first round of tests, the prototype proved to be non-toxic and to successfully increase the visual field and visual acuity. The next step will be \nin vivo\n trials to look into other factors such as how the pixels behave and how long the implant will last. “It will also be interesting to see how well humans adapt to this new way of seeing, which is unlike our natural vision,” concludes Ferlauto. \n“\nDesign and validation of a foldable and photovoltaic wide-field epiretinal prosthesis\n”, Nature Communications, Laura Ferlauto\n1\n, ‡, Marta J.

{"id": 1630, "text": "A drone makes large circles in the sky. With two powerful antennas, it sniffs the data packets emitted by mobile phones. On the ground, an interface developed specifically for this project makes it possible to track the flight of a small robotic aircraft in real time from a computer. Colored dots visible on the screen map indicate the spotted phones. The vehicle tightens its flight around the selected device to indicate its position. “In the best tests we have performed, the place indicated was within 10 meters,” says Jonathan Cheseaux, who worked on this project with Karol Kruzelecki and Stefano Rosati under the supervision of Bixio Rimoldi, head of the Mobile Communications Laboratory.\nFollowing an earthquake or another natural disaster, it is often difficult to know the position of victims under the rubble. At a time when most people, even in poor countries, have a mobile phone, the team of Mobile Communications Laboratory had the idea of using them to know the position of victims and thereby facilitate a search. When WiFi mode is activated, the devices emit data packets at regular intervals so that it’s possible to know various parameters, including the power received by the antenna connection. This can vary depending on the surrounding terrain, the weather or interference. It is also weaker as the layer of rubble over a person is thicker—another important factor.\nBut there is little similarity between these signals and a distance in meters that would make it possible to know directly the position of the device. With the drone, it is the GPS points of the captured signals from several places that locate the phone. These benchmarks are considered the center of circles which could potentially find the phone. The intersection of the latter determines the location of the phone and, therefore, probably the person. “By refining the system to automatically eliminate weaker signals, the system has become even more accurate,” explains the master’s student. “Flight tests have located a cell phone on campus with high accuracy.”\n“The drone’s WiFi antenna could be replaced by Avalanche Victim Detectors (DVA) which would enable the rapid and inexpensive deployment of the first avalanche searches,” predicts the student, who is also an amateur mountaineer.\nIn the second part of his work, Jonathan Cheseaux also noted the challenge of connecting to the WiFi network of a device through the drone – without human intervention. An antenna on the plane permits the device to guess the identity of the router that connects the phone and then pretends to be it. It can thereby establish communication. “In the case of natural disasters mentioned above, it would provide a substitution network when connections have been destroyed,” he says. But for now, this system only works if the network is open and not password protected. This work has also helped highlight issues of confidentiality and the protection of private data. Recovering the names of registered WiFi (SSID) by a smartphone is done to establish the habits of owners. For example, it may have a list of “EPFL,” “Fitness,” “Café-so,” “House,” et cetera.

It identifies the device brand and deconstructs statistics on the distribution of smartphone / router / printer brands.\nJonathan worked at one aspect of a much larger project called SMAVNET II.", "summary": "Summer series – student research (1): During his semester project in Communication Systems, Jonathan Cheseaux developed a system for locating a person via his or her mobile phone with a drone.

{"id": 1633, "text": "as a professor at the EPFL's School of Computer and Communication Sciences. During the last decade, Jean-Pierre Hubaux and his team at the  have focused their research efforts on privacy protection, in particular for mobile communication networks (and notably geolocation) and personal data (with genomic data as an application example).\nWhat type of personal data should we try to protect?\n Nowadays, administrative, medical or legal data are mostly kept in digital form. And a plethora of personal data is now publically accessible, whether voluntarily or otherwise, over the Internet. The exposure of such records to the digital world poses fresh challenges as quickly as the Internet grows. At the same time, the propagation of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets threatens our privacy.\nHow have mobile technologies changed the situation with regards to privacy protection?\n Cell phone companies must locate a subscriber's cell phone in order to channel communications via network antennas. However, locating our cell phone not only reveals our physical location, it also reveals when we are there, how long and even with whom. So far, this personal data is relatively well protected within the current legal framework. In addition, users pay a subscription to cell phone companies. Cell phone companies therefore generate a profit under a traditional business model of fee-based services. However, this is not the case for service providers such as Google, Facebook Mobile or Foursquare. How do these companies make money? They do so precisely by collecting and analyzing the personal data of users.\nFree services therefore pay for themselves with our data…\n That's right. What you do not pay in monetary terms, you pay by some other means, and often without your knowledge. Service providers obtain geolocation data: i.e. where you are, when, how long and with whom. They can then cross-reference this data with the content of your e-mail messages and your electronic agenda or with the type of searches that you enter into their search engines. If you are also registered on a social network such as Facebook or Google+, then they've hit the jackpot. In other words, what you do not pay for with money, you pay for with your personal data. In the best-case scenario, this data is only used to send you targeted advertising based on your interests, gender, age, income level as well as the interests of your friends and colleagues…\nWhich other risks need to be considered?\n A pessimistic, but plausible, scenario is that your personal data in digital form will be used for surveillance purposes, since governments can demand access to your data. Governments also already conduct surveillance on a massive scale, as revealed recently in NSA-related scandals. Targeted surveillance (sometimes performed secretly) is of course needed, notably to fight organized crime, but mass surveillance is unacceptable. Additional risks include harassment (e.g., blackmail) and identity theft.\nTo make matters worse, the legal framework lags behind service providers, which are generally U.S. companies based on a new business model whose profitability can only be achieved through the exploitation of personal data. In addition, mobile technologies are evolving at a breathtaking pace, which makes it even more difficult for legislation to keep up with our day-to-day reality.\nBut let me be clear on this: the Internet and associated services are a fantastic invention! Let's just say that often the most wonderful innovations have side effects, such as the larger carbon footprint caused in part by the increasing use of hydrocarbons or the rising number of cases of senile dementia caused by medical advances and resulting gains in life expectancy.\nBut who would even want to take advantage of access to our personal data?\n Well, your employer may want to know whether you have had job interviews with the competition. Your insurance company may decide to accept or refuse you as a policyholder on the basis of your absenteeism from work. Your bank may decide to reject a loan application on the basis of an assessment of how likely you are to remain healthy. Just consider the fact that for $100, a private company will analyze a sample of someone's saliva for simple DNA sequencing. For $5,000, that same company will provide a complete analysis of a person's genome. What transits over the Internet are not only your genetic data, and therefore any abnormalities (i.e. physical and mental defects caused by your genes), but rather a portion of your entire family's genome, revealed in a probabilistic fashion since you all share the same genetic makeup.\nWhat would happen if privacy were to disappear?\n Well, it would be the end of truth as we know it, the end of mutual trust and the end of democracy!\n Imagine a world in which you could no longer trust your own doctor for fear that your medical records could fall into the wrong hands. Would you lie to your doctor to protect yourself? Under what circumstances and to whom would you lie in order to protect your personal data from being divulged at any time? It would be the end of truth because people would begin to lie methodically, which in turn would undermine mutual trust. If medical confidentiality can be eroded in this manner, imagine what would happen to confidentiality in electronic voting systems. In a democracy, the people are sovereign and must be able to vote as they see fit without fear of reprisals.\nIn your opinion therefore, unfettered access to personal data is nothing less than a threat to democracy?\n Absolutely. If voting secrecy is no longer guaranteed, will voters be subject to undue pressures as a result of their political affinities? Will they be forced to vote in a way that goes against their own personal convictions? All dictatorships violate the privacy of their citizens. All democracies have laws aimed at protecting privacy, which is paramount to preserving democracy.\nWhat solutions do you propose?\n Follow the money trail and the strategy will appear! According to , a mathematical discipline borrowed from economics, it is possible to calculate the degree of motivation to perform certain acts. In other words, we can assess the financial cost of different strategies that the adversary has at its disposal to determine which one offers the best \"quality-price ratio\". The ultimate aim is to reach a point where none of the adversary's strategies is motivating because the cost exceeds the benefit in each case. In the area of geolocation, we have shown how users of geolocation services are able to preserve their privacy with an acceptable level of service quality. For instance, users can install a software application that hides their tracks, indicating only that they are in Lausanne but not indicating that they are actually in such and such office at the EPFL, for example. We have also quantified . Generally speaking, our contributions make use of probabilities and statistics (including inference techniques), communication protocols, applied cryptography and machine learning.\nHow about other disciplines?\n It is important to encourage interdisciplinary approaches to address social phenomena associated with information technologies, law, economics, etc. Over the past few years, my laboratory has been working closely with geneticists from CHUV and the EPFL as well as with a start-up company, . We have also entered into discussions with telecom operators.", "summary": "What impact does the proliferation of new mobile technologies have?

These five winning ideas will be developed by the French automobile manufacturer in collaboration with EPFL. \n Starting from the premise that twenty years from now cars will undoubtedly be far more than simply a means to get from point A to point B, EPFL invited the entire campus community – including alumni and those working in the EPFL Innovation Park – to get their thinking caps on and come up with a design for the car of the future. Five hundred people signed up on the Fusebox platform and 178 ideas were submitted, resulting in a veritable avalanche of comments and votes. The jury has made its decision; the 25 authors and contributors to the five most innovative ideas, along with seven individuals who made outstanding efforts, have been selected. They will receive their awards during the contest’s closing ceremony on December 5, 2013.\n The five winning ideas\n #1 \"Tomorrow's Gym\" \n “Get a workout behind the wheel: row, pedal under the seat, use detachable devices.

{"id": 1640, "text": "Earthquakes almost never kill people by themselves. Instead, the high toll they take can be explained by a lack of resilient buildings and infrastructure. In Chile in 2010, many thin-walled reinforced concrete buildings were damaged in one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded. Yet today, more and more structures with even thinner walls are being built in some Latin American countries. Recently, engineers from EPFL evaluated the stability of thin reinforced concrete walls to understand how they fail. Their findings are  in the journal Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering.\nTo find out how very thin-walled structures behave in an earthquake, João Almeida and Angelica Rosso, two of the study’s authors, tested two 80-millimeter-thick, 2-by-2.7-meter wall segments, similar to those used in low-income housing projects in some South American countries. By clamping the wall segments to the floor of the laboratory and loading them with five actuators strong enough to slowly bend the walls back and forth in different directions, they simulated the impact of an earthquake on the structure. By slowing down the process the researchers had time to watch the damage spread and to find out how cracks propagate across the wall, ultimately destabilizing it.\n“The data we gathered in our experiment is unique,” says Katrin Beyer, the principal investigator of the study. “It is the first to contain detailed measurements of a so-called out-of-plane wall failure, which means that the wall structure was irreversibly deformed perpendicularly to its surface.” According to Beyer, it was also the first time that displacements greater than the wall thickness itself had been observed under these conditions. By the end of the test, the wall’s reinforcement bars had bent, with the concrete crumbling in one corner of the structure. Thanks to an array of sensors, cameras, and strain gauges, the researchers were able to capture and analyze every motion leading up to the collapse of the wall.\nTo withstand an earthquake, a building’s structure has to be ductile enough to ride out the vibrations caused by the earthquake’s seismic waves. But because seismic design is typically more expensive and requires more expertise, poorer parts of developing and emerging countries are often built with sub-standard buildings. A case in point: closer investigation of the housing units that collapsed in the 2010 Chile earthquake revealed that their reinforced concrete walls often did not meet the recommendations of the country’s construction code.\nA dangerous loophole\nThe reason they were built at all, explains Beyer, can be found in a loophole in the construction code. All it takes is for an engineer to deem thin walls sufficiently robust, and the project can go forward. “The real solution would be to more strictly enforce and further tighten the building code in countries that are prone to earthquakes,” says Beyer. But until then, she says, the loophole will subsist.\nRather than focusing on Chile, the scientists focused on neighboring Colombia, a country with a lower, nonetheless dangerous, seismic risk. In Colombia, demand is high for low-income housing in medium to high-rise buildings built using reinforced concrete walls. But even though housing design engineers in Colombia are aware of the risks earthquakes bring, building permits do not always reflect this. And with concrete and reinforcement bars often making up the lion’s share of a building’s cost, constructors often opt to use even thinner walls – sometimes only half the thickness of those used in Chile.\nA duty to share\n“Because we are lucky enough to have access to such expensive research infrastructure, we see it as our duty to make our data available to the scientific community, so that researchers and engineers around the world can exploit the results,” explains Beyer. Together with the Colombian partners at the Universidad del Valle in Cali, the School of Engineering of Antioquia and the University of Medellin in Colombia, they recently received a second round of funding to further improve the understanding of the structural behavior of these structures and to study cost-effective approaches capable of stabilizing existing thin-walled reinforced concrete structures.\nThis project was partly funded by an EPFL Seed Money Grant from EPFL’s Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV), which was awarded to EPFL’s Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics Group and the School of Engineering of Antioquia and the University of Medellin in Colombia.", "summary": "Given the choice between safer and cheaper construction, many housing design companies in earthquake-prone developing countries see themselves forced to save on expensive construction materials and opt for the latter.

Switzerland is of course included in this model, which covers 28 regions. “We\n are trying to calculate the impact that the various strategies for combating climate\n change will have on lifestyle and well-being, and studying various options for adapting\n to climate change.”\nIn this new project, REME will look at the economic consequences of measures taken\n to slow down climate change. What is the cost of climate change, and what are the\n possible ways in which we can adapt? “In Switzerland, for example, climate change is\n already affecting winter tourism. What approach should we adopt in response to this?\n In the agricultural sector, how should farming practices be adapted? The insulation of\n buildings is also an important issue,” adds Vielle. “It’s stimulating to work on projects\n with an international scope, particularly when we can use applied research to propose\n solutions to decision-makers.” The objective of this three-year project is to use and\n combine the models created by the different teams to evaluate climate-related\n strategies, and ultimately to attain the objective of limiting the increase in global\n temperature to 2°C.\nHow will international climate strategies evolve?

{"id": 1646, "text": "We’ve all felt stressed at some point, whether in our personal or professional lives or in response to exceptional circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic. But until now there has been no way to quantify stress levels in an objective manner. \nThat could soon change thanks to a small wearable sensor developed by engineers at EPFL’s Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab) and Xsensio. The device has the potential to be placed directly on a patient’s skin in a wearable patch and, in the future, to quasi-continually measure the concentration of cortisol, the main stress biomarker, in the patient’s sweat.\nCortisol: A double-edged sword\nCortisol is a steroid hormone made by our adrenal glands out of cholesterol. Its secretion is controlled by the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is produced by the pituitary gland. Cortisol carries out essential functions in our bodies, such as regulating metabolism, blood sugar levels and blood pressure; it also affects the immune system and cardiovascular functions.\nWhen we’re in a stressful situation, whether life-threatening or mundane, cortisol is the hormone that takes over. It instructs our bodies to direct the required energy to our brain, muscles and heart. “Cortisol can be secreted on impulse – you feel fine and suddenly something happens that puts you under stress, and your body starts producing more of the hormone,” says Adrian Ionescu, head of Nanolab.\nWhile cortisol helps our bodies respond to stressful situations, it’s actually a double-edged sword. It’s usually secreted throughout the day according to a circadian rhythm, peaking between 6am and 8am and then gradually decreasing into the afternoon and evening. “But in people who suffer from stress-related diseases, this circadian rhythm is completely thrown off,” says Ionescu. “And if the body makes too much or not enough cortisol, that can seriously damage an individual’s health, potentially leading to obesity, cardiovascular disease, depression or burnout.”\nQualitative depiction of regular and irregular circadian levels throughout the day. © Nanolab, EPFL\nCapturing the hormone to measure it\nBlood tests can be used to take snapshot measurements of patients’ cortisol levels. However, detectable amounts of cortisol can also be found in saliva, urine and sweat. Ionescu’s team at Nanolab decided to focus on sweat as the detection fluid and developed a wearable smart patch with a miniaturized sensor. \nThe patch contains a transistor and an electrode made from graphene which, due to its unique proprieties, offers high sensitivity and very low detection limits. The graphene is functionalized through aptamers, which are short fragments of single-stranded DNA or RNA that can bind to specific compounds. The aptamer in the EPFL patch carries a negative charge; when it comes into contact with cortisol, it immediately captures the hormone, causing the strands to fold onto themselves and bringing the charge closer to the electrode surface. The device then detects the charge, and is consequently able to measure the cortisol concentration in the wearer’s sweat.\nProcess flow for capturing cortisol with the graphene electrode and aptamers. © Nanolab, EPFL\nSo far, no other system has been developed for monitoring cortisol concentrations continuously throughout the circadian cycle. “That’s the key advantage and innovative feature of our device. Because it can be worn, scientists can collect quantitative, objective data on certain stress-related diseases. And they can do so in a non-invasive, precise and instantaneous manner over the full range of cortisol concentrations in human sweat,” says Ionescu.\nEngineering improved healthcare\nThe engineers tested their device on Xsensio’s proprietary Lab-on-Skin\nTM\n platform; the next step will be to place it in the hands of healthcare workers. Esmeralda Megally, CEO of Xsensio, says: “The joint R&D team at EPFL and Xsensio reached an important R&D milestone in the detection of the cortisol hormone. We look forward to testing this new sensor in a hospital setting and unlocking new insight into how our body works.” The team has set up a bridge project with Prof. Nelly Pitteloud, chief of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), for her staff to try out the continuous cortisol-monitoring system on human patients. These trials will involve healthy individuals as well as people suffering from Cushing’s syndrome (when the body produces too much cortisol), Addison’s disease (when the body doesn’t produce enough) and stress-related obesity. The engineers believe their sensor can make a major contribution to the study of the physiological and pathological rhythms of cortisol secretion.\nSo what about psychological diseases caused by too much stress? “For now, they are assessed based only on patients’ perceptions and states of mind, which are often subjective,” says Ionescu. “So having a reliable, wearable sensor can help doctors objectively quantify whether a patient is suffering from depression or burnout, for example, and whether their treatment is effective. What’s more, doctors would have that information in real time. That would mark a major step forward in the understanding of these diseases.” And who knows, maybe one day this technology will be incorporated into smart bracelets. “The next phase will focus on product development to turn this exciting invention into a key part of our Lab-on-Skin\nTM\n sensing platform, and bring stress monitoring to next-generation wearables,” says Megally.", "summary": "EPFL engineers, working in association with startup Xsensio, have developed a wearable sensing chip that can measure the concentration of cortisol – the stress hormone – in human sweat.

{"id": 1648, "text": "Imagine car paint that can automatically repair itself after a scratch, or a corrosion-resistant coating that can automatically restore itself after being chipped off. These are just two of the promising new applications for self-healing materials – although numerous obstacles remain. “Each type of material poses a different challenge,” says Véronique Michaud, one of the study’s authors and head of the LPAC. “Some materials can already regenerate thanks to a system of liquids inside them. If the material is scratched, the liquid flows out and reacts with the surrounding air, for example, to fill in the scratch. It’s similar to how your blood coagulates if you cut your finger.” But other materials are more complicated, and progress is still at the laboratory stage. That’s especially true for composite materials, which are used in aircraft and sporting equipment – and are the focus of the scientists’ work.\nChanges in plants’ mechanical properties\nOut in the wild, plants must deal with a variety of stresses such as wind, rain and breakage. That’s why the scientists decided to study how the stems of flax plants change after they’ve been cut. “We chose flax because its fibers are already used to make composite materials, and because it’s a common plant that grows quickly,” says Michaud. They made lengthwise and crosswise incisions in the stems of two different families of flax plants and let them grow for 25 days next to plants that hadn’t been cut. They then measured changes in the stems’ stiffness and damping properties. The scientists, which included EPFL researchers and a biology post-doctoral researcher from the University of Freiburg, applied a dynamic tensile load to the stems to measure the amount of force necessary to strain them and their temporal response both on intact stems and self-repaired ones. Stiffness and damping are also properties that researchers continually strive to improve in materials; they must always find the right trade-off between these two factors, whether the aim is to avoid uncomfortable vibrations in a car, make sure a bicycle can ride smoothly over bumps or develop a responsive tennis racket. The testing methods and machines that the scientists used in their research on flax stems are the same as those used to test composite materials.\nDifferent reactions depending on the type of wound\nThe scientists also looked at how the stems healed from the incisions. They found that the response was different depending on whether the incision was lengthwise or crosswise. For lengthwise incisions, the plant cells surrounded the wound and created a sort of skin, but the stem did not regenerate. However, for crosswise incisions, the cells filled in the space created by the wound and healed it almost completely; the regenerated plants recovered 95% of their mechanical properties. Other tests carried out at the University of Freiburg showed that self-healing results can vary according to the kind of plant and the severity of the damage for both the plant and its survival in its habitat. Self-healed plants were found to not grow as tall as their intact counterparts, but they did form flowers and seeds. This study marks the first time that scientists have quantified the flax plant’s mechanical properties and ability to regenerate. It is also the first time that LPAC researchers carried out tests on plants using equipment designed for studying synthetic materials. The researchers hope to continue drawing from mechanisms occurring in nature to propose new strategies for creating composite materials.\nThis research was carried out under the EU-funded Marie-Curie Initial Training Network #290308, \"Self-Healing Materials: from Concepts to Market\" (SHeMat), in association with the University of Freiburg in Germany.\nThe picture on the right shows a cross section of a Linum “Drakkar” stem at the same day after sawing (A) Control stem without wound, (B) 26-day-old wound parallel to the fibres, (C) 26-day-old wound transverse to the fibres.", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL’s  (LPAC) and the University of Freiburg’s Botanical Garden have studied how the flax plant heals itself after it has been wounded.

{"id": 1655, "text": "From 8 April to 10 May 2020, at the height of the partial lockdown imposed by the Federal Council due to the coronavirus pandemic, a team of local researchers used social media and various other channels to distribute a multilingual survey (in French, German, Italian and English) throughout Switzerland, querying recipients about how they were adapting to life under lockdown. The goal was to assess respondents’ professional and personal quality of life with an eye to creating more effective support structures in the future. The researchers were from EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR) and Laboratory on Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS), the Idiap Research Institute and the University of Lausanne’s Institute of Psychology. Their findings have just been published on the website . \nA total of 6,919 people responded, a high level of participation that provided the team with a great many insights. The survey data was rounded out with semi-structured interviews with 60 individuals and feedback from 216 others via the “Civique” mobile app – an option listed at the end of the survey. Using the app, residents were able to more actively participate in the study at intervals of several weeks. They shared their personal experiences and photos of their homes as they evolved under the demands of teleworking and home schooling.\nIn a second phase of the study, five \"citizen think tanks\" – discussion groups of between six and ten members of the general public – were set up after the lockdown was lifted. Each group was tasked with developing desirable or probable \"post-COVID\" scenarios on the following topics: housing, mobility, tourism, digital governance and the local economy.\nNew ways of living\n According to the survey, 55% of respondents teleworked, and 40% lived with at least one teleworker. Although only 8% reported a lack of comfort in their homes, the most common challenge was how to reorganise and adapt their living space to changes in people’s private and professional lives. Overall, the idea of widespread teleworking over an extended period of time was thought to be undesirable.\nUnequal burdens for women\n It is clear that the partial lockdown resulted in – or heightened – many forms of gender inequality. Whereas only 3% of respondents reported losing their jobs, 70% of those who did were women. The majority of women also felt that their working conditions had become more difficult; a large proportion of them stated that they were employed in the health and social services sector, and therefore ran a greater risk of infection. People working in this sector reported that they felt most useful during the crisis, but also that they would have liked to be better rewarded for their efforts, either through compensatory leave, holidays or financial compensation.\nMoreover, one woman in two reported being solely responsible for home schooling, compared with only one out of every 10 men. Interestingly, significantly more men than women stated that this task had been shared. “Men may have the impression that they were handling the schoolwork, or that they did so more often than in the past,” says Laurie Daffe, a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL's LASUR. “This feeling was not however shared by their spouse or reflective of the actual distribution of labor.” She points out that this is a recurrent theme in gender sociology, a discipline that also brought to light the phenomenon of a household’s “mental load” and how it is unequally shared between men and women.\nLastly, young working women with diplomas were the most likely to report having taken on too many household chores. “This segment tends to be more attentive to the division of labor within a couple, but this finding may also stem from the fact that, under normal circumstances, wealthier households make greater use of paid domestic help,” says Garance Clément, another postdoctoral researcher at LASUR. “Yet it is these domestic workers – who frequently lost their sources of income during the crisis – who suffered the most.”\nNew social initiatives\n By actively encouraging input from respondents, the study also aimed at generating reflections on new forms of social organization. Participants expressed interest in investing more of themselves in their neighborhoods and neighborhood life, with a view to forming support networks in the event of a new crisis. They also called for greater food self-sufficiency at the federal level and highlighted the need for shorter food supply chains. Input via the mobile app reflected the view that closing the country’s borders to prevent the virus from spreading was seen as the least desirable option.\nWhen it comes to mobility, as other studies carried out during the lockdown have shown, there was strong support for limiting car journeys and work-related travel – a change dependent on employers’ flexibility, as those surveyed pointed out. “When studying different mobility scenarios, we observed that there was an implicit conflict between the desire to move towards a societal model that supports modes of transport other than private cars and the concern that public transport will be shunned out of fears of contamination,” says Daffe.\nTowards eco-friendly tourism\n Thirty percent of respondents stated that they were looking forward to seeing their families again after the lockdown was lifted, but fewer than 20% were excited about travelling again. In this respect, the think tanks underscored the participants’ preference in the future for slower, more engaged and more environmentally friendly modes of travel and local tourism. \"This trend was partly confirmed this summer,\" says Daffe. \"But they also had reservations, including a sense of fatalism and concerns about a return to pre-pandemic practices, such as air travel.” \nLastly, to prevent the virus from spreading, those surveyed preferred to keep technology to a minimum in their daily routines, opting instead to take personal responsibility and make direct contact with those around them in the event of exposure.\nContradictions\n “Generally speaking, we noted a contradiction between, on one hand, respondents' desire for social change, eco-friendly approaches and greater involvement at the local level, and a rather disillusioned view of the future on the other,” says Clément. “People are now looking for collective ways to turn such ideas into tangible initiatives, because they are not convinced that the public authorities themselves have the ability to do so.”", "summary": "A joint study by EPFL, the Idiap Research Institute and the University of Lausanne’s Institute of Psychology has provided us with a unique snapshot of how Swiss residents experienced the partial lockdown measures resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.

{"id": 1659, "text": "In the race to miniaturize electronic components, researchers are challenged with a major problem: the smaller or the faster your device, the more challenging it is to cool it down. One solution to improve the cooling is to use materials with very high thermal conductivity, such as graphene, to quickly dissipate heat and thereby cool down the circuits.\nAt the moment, however, potential applications are facing a fundamental problem: how does heat propagate inside these sheets of materials that are no more than a few atoms thick?\nIn a study published in Nature Communications, a team of EPFL researchers has shed new light on the mechanisms of thermal conductivity in graphene and other two-dimensional materials. They have demonstrated that heat propagates in the form of a wave, just like sound in air. This was up to now a very obscure phenomenon observed in few cases at temperatures close to the absolute zero.Their simulations provide a valuable tool for researchers studying graphene, whether to cool down circuits at the nanoscale, or to replace silicon in tomorrow's electronics.\nQuasi-Lossless Propagation\n If it has been difficult so far to understand the propagation of heat in two-dimensional materials, it is because these sheets behave in unexpected ways compared to their three-dimensional cousins. In fact, they are capable of transferring heat with extremely limited losses, even at room temperature.\nGenerally, heat propagates in a material through the vibration of atoms. These vibrations are are called \"phonons\", and as heat propagates though a three-dimensional material, these phonons keep colliding with each other, merging together, or splitting. All these processes can limit the conductivity of heat along the way. Only under extreme conditions, when temperature goes close to the absolute zero ( -200°C or lower), it is possible to observe quasi-lossless heat transfer.\n A wave of quantum heat\n The situation is very different in two dimensional materials, as shown by researchers at EPFL. Their work demonstrates that heat can propagate without significant losses in 2D even at room temperature, thanks to the phenomenon of wave-like diffusion, called \"second sound\". In that case, all phonons march together in unison over very long distances. \"Our simulations, based on first-principles physics, have shown that atomically thin sheets of materials behave, even at room temperature, in the same way as three-dimensional materials at extremely low temperatures\" says Andrea Cepellotti, the first author of the study. \"We can show that the thermal transport is described by waves, not only in graphene but also in other materials that have not been studied yet,\" explains Cepellotti. \"This is an extremely valuable information for engineers, who could adapt the design of future electronic components using some of these novel two-dimensional materials properties.\"", "summary": "EPFL researchers have shed new light on the fundamental mechanisms of heat dissipation in graphene and other two-dimensional materials.

{"id": 1661, "text": "In the virtual world, the objects you pick up do not exist: you can see that cup or pen, but it does not feel like you’re touching them. That presented a challenge to EPFL professor Herbert Shea. Drawing on his extensive experience with silicone-based muscles and motors, Shea wanted to find a way to make virtual objects feel real. \nInflating capsules\n“With my team, we’ve created very small, thin and fast actuators,” explains Shea, who heads up the School of Engineering’s Soft Transducers Laboratory at EPFL Neuchâtel. “They are millimeter-sized capsules that use electrostatic energy to inflate and deflate.” The capsules have an outer insulating membrane made of silicone enclosing an inner pocket filled with oil. Each bubble is surrounded by four electrodes, that can close like a zipper. When a voltage is applied, the electrodes are pulled together, causing the center of the capsule to swell like a blister. \nRecreating the sense of touch\nIt is an ingenious system because the capsules, known as HAXELs, can move not only up and down, but also side to side and around in a circle. “When they are placed under your fingers, it feels as though you are touching a range of different objects,” says Shea. The research has been published in the scientific journal \nAdvanced Material\n.\nVideo games and surgery\nShea’s team is already working on integrating a dozen of these capsules into a thin glove. “The capsules will be combined with another system that actively blocks your fingers from going through the virtual object,” says Shea. “You’ll convincingly feel you’re holding a solid object even though your hands are empty. We’ll also be able to recreate the feeling of different materials: you’ll be able to tell whether the object you’re holding is made of wood, plastic or ceramic. This will be fun for video games but also useful for surgical simulators and teleoperation.” Shea will also use tactile illusions to make the feeling as real as possible. “We are dominated by what we see,” he says. “When we rely heavily on our vision – which is the case in virtual reality – it is easy to trick our brain about the object we’re touching. That helps make virtual objects feel real.”\nFor the technology to be used, the researchers now need to create the software that will program the feeling and weight of the virtual objects held in the glove. “Simple movements will be easier to configure than those requiring more accuracy,” says Shea.", "summary": "Adding to the richness of virtual reality, EPFL researchers have created soft actuators that can simulate the feeling of touching a virtual object with your fingers.", "claim": "Adding to the richness of virtual reality, EPFL researchers have created soft actuators that can simulate the feeling of touching a virtual object with our fingers.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [25, 25], "noise": false}
{"id": 1663, "text": "The newest development in the area of smarthome products may be the server-heater. As they churn through terabytes of data, these machines can give off enough heat to maintain a comfortable temperature in your living room. Around 40% of the electricity used at data centers goes towards cooling the servers. Could this heat be put to good use? Karim Ziadé chose this topic for his Bachelor’s project, venturing into essentially unexplored scientific territory. In terms of energy savings, Switzerland could stop importing energy in winter under one of the scenarios analyzed. In economic terms, on the other hand, this approach will require further analysis.\nLet’s look at some numbers. Data centers in Switzerland consume 1.1 TWh, or 2% of the country’s electricity consumption. At the same time, the energy required for home heating and hot water heaters amounts to some 5.7 TWh, 80% of which is covered by imported energy in the winter. The logical solution is to put these data centers into residential areas around the country in order to make good use of their heat – and reduce our foreign energy dependency.\nOf course, the energy requirement for heating purposes is five times greater than the heat generated by data centers. But with electricity consumption at data centers doubling every five years, the tipping point should be reached in a dozen years. That led Ziadé to come up with two scenarios: the present and the future, when electricity consumption at data centers will exceed the amount used for heating purposes.\nThere are a number of constraints to be reckoned with. For reasons of data security, companies will not agree to move their servers off-site; for reasons of bandwidth, the servers will have to be located in regions equipped with optical fiber, which only five cities in Switzerland have at this point; and for practical purposes, the data centers run throughout the year yet their heat is not needed in the summer. But Ziadé focused his Bachelor’s project at the Energy Center on macroeconomic considerations. Ziadé makes clear from the start: “This is just a simplified preliminary estimate meant to determine whether or not this could be feasible in Switzerland.”\nHeating only half the year\nThe rough calculations show that Switzerland could already reduce its electricity imports in the winter by over 10% today. And in the future scenario, we could achieve 100% energy independence. This solution is thus feasible, at least in terms of energy capture. But the economic analysis is less convincing. Ziadé estimates that servers used as heaters will cost companies three times more than those used in their data centers. And they will have to be replaced every three years, which means high installation costs.\nUnder the current-day scenario, the server-heater would have to be on for nearly 4,000 hours per year to be worthwhile. Yet heating is only needed for around 2,000 hours per year (out of a total of 8,700 hours in a year). The calculations are also subject to a major variable: the price of electricity. But we know that prices will rise, and that we will have to reduce our electricity use. In addition, the operating cost of data centers tends to increase relative to the acquisition price.\nZiadé concluded that the feasibility of server-heaters will require more complex calculations that take more parameters into account.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES on Student Projects (1) – For his Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Karim Ziadé assessed the feasibility of putting data centers into residential buildings for heating purposes.", "claim": "SUMMER SERIES on Student Projects (1) – For your Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Karim Ziadé assessed the feasibility of putting data centers into residential buildings for heating purposes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}
{"id": 1664, "text": "Most naturally occurring materials have a disordered atomic structure that interferes with the propagation of both sound and electromagnetic waves. When the waves come into contact with these materials, they bounce around and disperse – and their energy dissipates according to a highly complex interference pattern, diminishing in intensity. That means it’s virtually impossible to transmit data or energy intact across wave-scattering media and fully leverage the potential of wave technology.\n For an example, you need look no further than your smartphone – the geolocation function works less well inside buildings where radiofrequency waves scatter in all directions. Other potential applications include biomedical imaging and geological surveying, where it’s important to be able to send waves across highly disordered media.\nA team of researchers from two labs at EPFL’s School of Engineering, working in association with TU Wien and the University of Crete, has developed a system that allows sound waves to travel across such media with no distortion. It uses tiny speakers as acoustic relays to offset the wave scattering, and has been successfully tested on a real acoustic system. Their work has just been published in .\nUsing speakers to eliminate obstacles\nIn the researchers’ system, the tiny speakers can be controlled to amplify, attenuate or shift the phase of the sound waves. That lets them offset the diffusion that results when the waves hit obstacles, and thereby reproduce the original sound exactly on the other side of the disordered medium.\nHow does it work? “We realized that our acoustic relays had to be able to change the waves’ amplitudes and phases at strategic locations, to either magnify or attenuate them,” says Romain Fleury, head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Wave Engineering (LWE) and a co-author of the study.\n The researchers tested their system by building a 3,5 meters long air-filled tube and placing various kinds of obstacles such as walls, porous materials and chicanes into it, in order to create a highly disordered medium through which no sound waves could pass. They then placed their tiny speakers between the obstacles and set up electronic controls to adjust the speakers’ acoustic properties. “We’ve been working on using controlled speakers as active sound absorbers for years, so it made sense to use them for this new application too,” says Hervé Lissek, head of the acoustics research group at EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory 2 (LTS2) and a co-author of the study. “Until now, we only needed to attenuate sound waves. But here we had to develop a new control mechanism so we could also amplify them, like how we can already amplify optical waves with lasers,” adds Etienne Rivet, another co-author at EPFL who wrote a thesis on the subject. Their new method – the only one of its kind in acoustics – uses programmable circuits to control several speakers simultaneously and in real time.\nMaking objects invisible\nThe researchers’ method for active acoustic control is similar to that used in noise cancelling headphones and could potentially be used for sounds containing common ambient frequencies. It could also be used to eliminate the waves that bounce off objects like submarines, making them undetectable by sonar. Moreover, the theory underlying their work is universal and could have parallel applications in optics or radiofrequencies, to make objects invisible or to take images through opaque materials.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have found a way to make materials that are normally opaque to sound waves completely transparent.

{"id": 1665, "text": "Startups may be dynamic, flexible companies, but they’re also vulnerable during times of crisis. There are many reasons why young companies struggle when the economy is flagging: research and development can take longer, revenues may be low or even nil for a couple of years, and significant outside investment may be needed. To stay afloat for the next few months, more than a quarter of the 208 companies in EPFL’s Innovation Park (EIP) applied for a loan under the federal government’s guarantee program. How well the economy picks up will, of course, play a key role in these companies’ future development. So far, none of them has gone under, but campus experts are calling for caution over the coming months. They nevertheless remain optimistic about fundraising opportunities.\nSome startups have kept growing\nEIP didn’t shut down completely. Many startups were able to continue developing their devices, provided they complied with the strict hygiene rules. “Some people involved in testing equipment continued to come to work,” says Laurent Coulot, the CEO of Insolight. Other young companies, like Ouay, which was founded by EPFL students and whose workshop is located in an EPFL lab, were able to take their equipment home just before the campus closed.\nMedical startups were hit particularly hard by the two-month lockdown – hospital-based tests were stopped short, in some cases forfeiting several months of work and financial investment.\nBut some startups were able to quickly adapt their devices to meet new needs. Examples include Technis’s people-counting solutions, Rovenso’s cleaning robots and Abionic’s sepsis tests. Other startups have been developing technologies over the past few years that are now proving particularly useful, like the transparent face masks developed by Hello Mask.\nNo panic among investors\nBut most startups did not fare well during the pandemic, and observers think that close to half of them may be in danger. Jean-Philippe Lallement, EIP director, initially sensed a bit of panic about the lack of visibility. But that was soon allayed by the guarantees announced by the federal government at the end of April. A lot of companies on campus have made use of them, and some 10 million Swiss francs in support have also been granted by the Canton of Vaud.\n“The support is very welcome but it’s not ideal for a startup,” explains Jordi Montserrat, the head of Venture Kick in French-speaking Switzerland. “The loans have to be repaid over five years, so it might end up taking that long for the company to start turning a profit.” EPFL Innovation Park has also set up a support plan, which 70 companies from EPFL and Campus Biotech have applied for. The financial aid will go towards rental costs and other park-related expenses. For a large number of companies, costs have already been cut because of the lockdown, so they should be in a better position as they wait for the economy to pick up again. “It’s going to take somewhere between four and 12 months for business to get back to normal,” says Montserrat. “Provided there isn’t a second lockdown, that is.”\nFundraising opportunities\nBut not everything came to a standstill for the past two months: a number of large funding rounds still took place. Lunaphore, for instance, raised 25 million Swiss francs, and Flybotix 1.5 million francs. There’s as much money available now as there was before, especially since two new Swiss-based venture capital funds aimed specifically at domestic startups were created recently.\nBut things are out of kilter, and investors may well proceed cautiously over the months ahead. “Companies might find they have less room to negotiate fundraising terms and conditions,” says Lallement. Montserrat adds, “Unless we see a rapid V-shaped recovery, as some experts hope, it might be worth being a little conservative for a change.”\nThree start-up share their work during the confinement\nInsolight embarks on a funding round \nInsolight, which makes solar panels with close to 30% efficiency, was due to start running assembly tests on its Spanish production lines in April. “But our suppliers went into lockdown one after the other,” says Laurent Coulot, Insolight’s CEO. “So just before the borders closed, we brought the equipment back to Switzerland in order to run tests here.” The science park stayed open and a few employees continued to go to the workshop, taking all the necessary safety precautions. The rest of the team worked from home.\nThere was a lot of uncertainty at the start of the lockdown, and Coulot filed a request for compensation for reduced working hours for his employees, although the plan was not to use it. “We saw quite quickly that we could still meet our objectives – things would just take a bit longer. The government support was aimed primarily at small to medium-sized companies that get by on their income alone, like hairdressers and small shops. Our startup relies on other funding sources in order to survive, and a delay in product development could have had a detrimental impact, especially in terms of our investors.”\nBut the company’s investors continued to trust in Insolight, as the startup is about to raise close to 5 million Swiss francs. “At the start, we were afraid that some investors might throw in the towel. But our worries soon faded.”\nThe production and assembly tests should start up again soon in Europe. This will increase production volumes, and the panels should go on sale by the end of the year. “The challenge now is to mitigate external risks, since some of our suppliers and clients could end up going under,” says Coulot.\nEPFL spin-off Abionic helps detect sepsis in COVID-19 patients.\nEPFL spin-off Abionic was planning to launch its product in March, a machine called the \nAbioscope\n that promises to detect sepsis up to 72 hours earlier than today’s standard of care. Instead, the start-up has been deploying its technology since early March to several hospitals in Switzerland, France and Italy for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.\n“We are very happy to participate to the effort to fight the coronavirus, by providing physicians with the most rapid diagnostic platform in the world,” says Abionic CEO Nicolas Durand. “Our device has demonstrated the capacity to identify sepsis and bacterial superinfection up to 72h earlier, which contributes to decreasing the mortality rate of covid-19 patients”.\nDurand is convinced that the nanofluidic-based technology of the Abioscope disrupts current blood-testing standards.\n. According to Professor Jean-Daniel Chiche, designated future head of ICU at the CHUV and , sepsis may account for half of critically ill COVID-19 adult patients deaths. It is unclear why sepsis occurs in COVID-19 patients, but early diagnosis leads to early implementation of life-saving procedures, including the prescription of appropriate antibiotics at the right time.\nAccording to the CDC, \nSepsis is the body’s extreme response to an infection. It is a life-threatening medical emergency. Sepsis happens when an infection you already have —in your skin, lungs, urinary tract, or somewhere else—triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. Without timely treatment, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nWritten by Hillary Sanctuary\nOuay: “The lockdown has shown just how useful our devices are”\nWhen the lockdown began, Ouay – which makes smart speakers to help the elderly communicate more easily with people outside their home – had already sent out some of its devices to clients for testing . “Unfortunately, we had to postpone the test phase, but the lockdown has shown just how useful our devices are,” says Sven Borden, the startup’s CEO. “They would have made things easier for elderly people who became even more isolated during the lockdown.”\nThe startup didn’t apply for compensation for reduced working hours. “We halted our work and took the equipment on campus home with us,” says Borden. The tests will start again this summer. “The lockdown has also been good in a way because a lot of elderly people starting using tablets more in order to keep in contact with people.” The only break the Ouay team will get this summer is for the exam session, which has been pushed back to August.", "summary": "The lockdown has been a real headache for most EPFL startups.

{"id": 1666, "text": "For more than 100 years, electricity grids around the world have worked with alternating current (AC). However, direct current (DC) is now back in fashion and – thanks to advances in power electronics – is already becoming the new norm.\n Today, most of our appliances such as computers, LEDs and electric cars all run on DC. Batteries and photovoltaic panels also produce DC current. And while high-voltage DC is an efficient and proven method for transporting power over large distances, the interconnection still requires legacy AC grids. If we are to one day achieve DC grids that can facilitate the smart grid concept, further technological progress in this area is still needed. This transition will require flexible, efficient and high-performance power electronic conversion devices – commonly referred to as solid-state transformers (SSTs).\nSSTs can perform any desired electrical energy conversion (i.e., AC-AC, AC-DC, DC-DC, DC-AC), depending on the needs of the application. In this way they are similar to a multi-purpose Swiss Army knife.\nThis is where EPFL’s researchers from the School of Engineering’s \n(PEL)\ncome in. They have developed a way of optimally designing and producing medium-frequency transformers (MFTs), which are one of the key enabling technologies for SSTs.\nThe researchers have designed, optimized and built a working MFT prototype, rated for 100kW and operated at 10kHz. Following rigorous testing, it serves as the basis for technical tutorials, some of which have already been given to various specialists from the academic and industrial worlds.\nControllability of power grids\n Full controllability can be achieved. “We can be highly flexible and quickly alter the power flow – and we can do that very efficiently,” explains Marko Mogorovic, one of the device’s designers. “This will be very important when it comes to integrating the intermittent energy generation from renewable sources into tomorrow’s smart grids.”\nThe higher the frequency, the smaller the MFT\n Another plus is the small size of the device: “In an AC system, the frequency at which transformers operate depends on that of the surrounding grid. In Europe, that frequency is fixed at 50Hz,” explains Drazen Dujic, director of PEL. Since the frequency cannot be changed, miniaturization is impossible.\n“In a DC system, however, transformers operate within converters at very high frequencies of up to several tens of kilohertz, thanks to power electronics. And the higher the frequency, the more compact the device,” says Dujic.\nThe reduced size of these transformers will be particularly useful in traction systems, in terms of both efficiency and integration: “A lighter locomotive would consume much less energy,” says Mogorovic. In traction systems, the device would transform the AC from the railway lines into DC for the traction/propulsion chain. The railway grid in Switzerland operates at 16.7Hz, which until now has translated into rather bulky transformers inside the locomotives.\n At the same time, however, miniaturization represents a real challenge for engineers, who have to deal with many cross-disciplinary constraints, including thermal, dielectric and magnetic issues. EPFL researchers developed a set of sophisticated and very fast models that can quickly generate several million designs. It makes it possible to then select the best design, depending on the performance they want to achieve.\n“The fact that we’ve made this type of transformer inside a lab is a major step, given the safety and function-related problems that usually arise,” explains Dujic. “We managed to get it to work perfectly. That’s what’s important for experts in this field.”\nA gathering of such experts is already scheduled. The European Center for Power Electronics (ECPE) will hold a workshop called “New Technologies for Medium Frequency Solid State Transformers” on 14–15 February 2019 at EPFL.

{"id": 1667, "text": "For members of EPFL Racing Team, the winter exam session ended with an additional – and significant – challenge: on 31 January, the students spent the day demonstrating their technical expertise in an attempt to qualify for this summer’s Formula Student races. They qualified for competitions in Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany this summer, having already made it into July’s season-opening race in Zurich as one of the home teams. So it will be a summer of speed for the approximately 50 students, including two women, who are taking part in EPFL’s motor racing adventure.\nFor many of the team’s members, the challenge started more than a year ago. “Our 2020 car is the result of all the experience we gained in 2019 and the lessons we learned from the mistakes we made,” explains José Hajjar, who is in charge of partnerships. “Last year, our aim was to have a functioning car. This year, we want a high-performance car. We’re doing all the same things, but twice as well.”\nThe team’s efforts have focused on improving the car’s engine, weight, batteries, layout and structure. EPFL Racing Team’s single-seater will have two engines, one to control each of the rear wheels, supported by an electronic assistance system instead of a differential. “The control software will take into account all of the car’s fundamental parameters in real time in order to control things like skid and stability,” says team leader Pierre Georges. “So it will really boost performance.”\nLighter and faster\nThe car is not only smarter but also lighter, because some of the mechanical equipment is no longer required. Although the 2020 model features roughly the same design as last year’s version, its weight will drop from around 300 kg to around 200 kg. That reduction is the result of improvements in the construction process, but also in materials due to greater use of carbon fiber for example. The battery represents another key enhancement. “By using copper connections between the battery cells, we can reduce resistance and increase output throughout a race,” says Hajjar. All of these innovations do not come cheap: the budget has almost doubled between 2019 and 2020.\n“This year we have rethought every aspect and how it affects the rest of the car,” says Georges. The team has received support from EPFL through the MAKE program and is advised by Mario Paolone, a leading expert in batteries.\nPublic unveiling on 12 May\nThe design process for all of the car’s various components has now been completed and the custom parts are being built in-house. Final assembly will take place between mid-March and mid-April, in time for 12 May, when the car will be unveiled to the public at EPFL’s Rolex Learning Center. Its first competition will take place from 15 to 19 July in Zurich. EPFL Racing Team will then take part in races in Most, Czech Republic from 20 to 26 July, Zalaegerszeg, in Hungary from 4 to 9 August, and in Hockenheim, Germany from 17 to 23 August.\nFormula Student, which was created 40 years ago, gives engineering students a chance to design a single-seater racing car to take part in competitions in various countries. The challenge involves designing the car and racing in up to nine competitions in Europe per year. Vehicles are tested through three static events focusing on technological solutions, cost management and presentation. They also undergo five dynamic events – acceleration, skidpad, autocross, endurance and fuel economy – that test the cars’ pure performance.", "summary": "EPFL and its electric single-seater racing car will take part in Formula Student motor racing competitions in Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany this summer.", "claim": "EPFL and your electric single-seater racing car will take part in Formula Student motor racing competitions in Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany this summer.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 2], "noise": false}

It consumes up to half of all resources and generates about a third of all waste. As a result, in order to comply with international treaties and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the industry is being forced to take bold steps to reduce its environmental footprint. “We need to mitigate this impact as quickly as possible,\" says Jan Brütting, who has just completed a PhD at EPFL’s Structural Xploration Lab (SXL), headed by Corentin Fivet from the Smart Living Lab in Fribourg. “One way to achieve this is by systematically implementing the principles of the circular economy.”\nWhen designing a building, instead of using new components or even recycling existing metal parts by melting them down and casting them into new shapes, Brütting encourages companies, structural engineers and architects to base their designs on previously-used components, without reprocessing them. This makes sense, since the reliability and technical properties of these components have already been proven. “It means we need to change everything we’ve learned up to now,” he notes. And yet, the construction industry lacks the tools needed for this. Over the past four years, Brütting has been developing a software application that enables users to design structures while conducting life-cycle assessments. It is oriented towards the reuse of steel beams, columns and bars, but other materials, such as wood and concrete, could also be incorporated.\nA range of features\nHere's how it works: the engineer or architect designing or modifying a structure enters its overall characteristics into the program, along with a description of the stock of reusable, second-hand components. The software then performs an initial optimization of the structure's form, so as to use as little material as possible. Next – and this is one of the program’s innovations – it provides designers with alternative forms that meet various sustainability objectives. For example, it changes the layout of the structure and it optimally selects and positions elements from existing stocks to further reduce the structure's carbon footprint, it limits the number of new cuts and keeps the number of components to a minimum. \nThe software can also identify the optimal combination of new and recycled components that will minimize a structure's carbon footprint. A designer can thus select and adapt the most appropriate solution for the project. Brütting has tested his application in real-life situations, based on materials recovered from Swiss buildings and infrastructures that were being demolished.\nFinally, his work supplies benchmark values enabling users to verify that reusing construction materials in new buildings can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 60%, despite an up to 40% increase in a structure’s mass.\nJan Brütting’s original contributions on reuse are very well received by practitioners and researchers. © 2020 Alain Herzog\nA much-needed database\nFor Brütting, creating a Swiss – or even Europe-wide – database of reusable elements would make it possible to effectively implement a circular economy. Ideally, his software would be able to access it, giving designers a wide variety of components to choose from, and thus lessening the restrictions on the design of new structures. “Databases of this type are currently under development,” he says. He has no doubt that reuse has a bright future, despite the many obstacles that still exist. “Since I started my thesis in 2016, I have definitely observed an uptick in the number of scientific publications on the circular economy in the construction industry, and EU policies are supporting an increasing number of research projects to promote this. Recently, the Federal Office of the Environment even published a report on reuse.”\nJan Brütting’s original contributions on reuse are very well received by practitioners and researchers. Last year, he has been awarded the Hangai Prize by the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures.\nModular constructions\nBrütting, who is as enthusiastic about civil engineering as he is about architecture, has also programmed the software to design temporary event-specific structures based on linear beams and spherical connectors. This concept is similar to the MERO system or USM’s modular furniture, but with one big difference: “Our solution offers many more design options than current modular construction systems,” says Brütting. “This could be of interest to companies specializing in the reuse of materials.”", "summary": "Algorithms developed at EPFL can help architects to design building structures that incorporate both new and reused components, thereby lowering their environmental impact.", "claim": "Algorithms developed at EPFL can help architects to design building structures that incorporate both new and reused components, thereby lowering its environmental impact.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [21, 21], "noise": false}

Up to now there had been some uncertainty as to how it was regulated. Yet, understanding this mechanism is of crucial importance to prevent the diseases related to fat accumulation in adipose tissue.\nA research team led by Carine Gubelmann and Petra Schwalie at EPFL’s Laboratory of Systems Biology and Genetics, directed by Bart Deplancke, joined forces with Christian Wolfrum’s researchers from ETH Zurich, to decode the process of adipogenesis. They performed a large scale study of the action of no less than 734 \"transcription factors\", the proteins that specifically regulate gene expression.\nTo do this, the researchers \"over-expressed\" each factor to see which one had an impact on adipogenesis. Their observations, performed in vitro, allowed to identify 26 transcription factors involved in the differentiation of fat cells and to \"rank\" their importance in the process.

{"id": 1676, "text": "Pierre Brisson, a planetology enthusiast who heads the Swiss chapter of the Mars Society, believes in the need to send people to Mars. He recently gave a talk at EPFL on the technical challenges we still need to overcome to get to the red planet – the only one he believes we could ever reach – and set up a colony.\nWhy are you so interested in Mars?\nI’ve always been passionate about physical geography, planetology and things related to space in general. But what interests me about Mars is that it’s the only planet where we could one day live. And it’s much more interesting than the Moon – a natural satellite whose geological evolution ground to a near halt much earlier.\nWhy do you think it’s essential to send humans to Mars? \nBecause it’s technologically feasible. Maybe not right away, but it will happen one day. What we need to do is develop a massive rocket, like Elon Musk’s Big Falcon. While I doubt people will be able to live permanently on Mars – although that could be our goal – we could at least send manned missions there. And we’ll need to do so because human-assisted robots work much better when humans are around. Sending information between Mars and Earth takes 3–22 minutes each way, meaning direct human control would be impossible unless people are on site. What’s more, no matter how sophisticated our robots are, they can do only what they’ve been programmed to. But humans can react to changing circumstances and modify the robots’ behavior accordingly. Of course, another reason to send people to Mars is the challenge – the thrill of achieving such a major feat. There’s also the issue of the survival of our species. If one day we can no longer live on Earth, our descendants will be glad we started planning now.\nSo Mars could be a “Planet B?”\nYes, eventually. We need to start developing technology now if we want humans to someday be able to live there permanently. It would take a colony around 100 years to become completely self-sufficient; in the beginning, it would be almost entirely dependent on the Earth. That said, Mars does have some key natural resources that could be used almost immediately. Its air contains 95% CO\n2\n, which can be processed to extract carbon and oxygen. And the water on Mars could be a source of hydrogen which, when combined with carbon, can generate methane, methanol, ethylene and other important compounds. Finally, the Martian soil was formed from the same types of rocks we have on Earth. That opens up the possibility of producing metals, glass and fertilizer. We’ll need to make as many semi-finished materials as possible on site since sending them up from Earth would be extremely onerous.\nFrom what you describe, living on Mars sounds realistic. What do you think the first colonies will be like? \nConditions will be difficult in the beginning. Scientists are already working on various life support systems, such as through the Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELISSA) initiative by the European Space Agency (ESA). These life support systems consist of large domes that people will live inside and where almost all of the organic matter they use will be recycled, since organic compounds will be extremely valuable. The biggest challenge will be designing structures that can withstand the large pressure differential between the inside of the domes – humans need, say, 0.5–0.7 bars of pressure to live – and the atmospheric pressure on Mars, which is around 6 millibars on average. That differential will be a huge strain on the dome walls. Possible solutions that scientists are looking at include geodesic hemispheres of around 10–20 meters in diameter that are firmly anchored in the ground – and which would serve as common areas – combined with smaller individual chambers where people would live. These chambers would be connected to each other and made of a steel frame and ultra-thick glass plates. The entire colony would be covered with huge blocks of Martian ice to shield against radiation.\nSo people wouldn’t be able to leave the colony?\nOnly in space suits, which I imagine would become more comfortable and easier to wear as the technology develops. I’d also like to point out that conditions on Mars are much more amenable to human life than those on the Moon. Mainly because Mars has an atmosphere, even though it is thin. And secondly because the days on Mars last 24 hours and 39 minutes, whereas on the Moon they are equivalent to 14 Earth-days. There’s also the fact that temperature fluctuations are much smaller on Mars – ranging from 20°C during the day to –120°C at night, and that gravity on Mars is closer to what we experience on Earth, meaning people can move more naturally with a body weight that’s more like what they’re used to. Studies have shown that microgravity can affect a body’s vital functions – astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) have reported lesions on their optical nerves, for instance. Missions to Mars will hopefully be less risky in that regard.\nBut the trip to Mars would be much longer. What are the main challenges there? \nFirst of all, radiation. The level on Mars itself would be manageable, about the same as that on the ISS. But it could be a problem during the six-month trip to the planet, when astronauts would be exposed to different kinds of ionizing particles. They can protect themselves against solar radiation – which consists mainly of protons – by taking refuge in chambers surrounded by water reservoirs when sun storms hit. What’s more dangerous is the small amount of galactic cosmic radiation they will be subject to, made up of high-energy nuclei called HZE ions. They have so much energy that there is currently no material capable of blocking them, and they generate extremely hazardous gamma rays upon impact. The dose of this radiation that astronauts would receive on a trip to Mars is not excessive – but they wouldn’t be able to \ntolerate much more. That’s one reason why trips any farther than Mars – say, a several-year trip to one of Jupiter’s moons – wouldn’t be feasible. So in terms of distance, Mars is within reach given our existing technology.\nDoesn’t that prove humans are too earthbound to travel in space? \nIt’s true that we evolved on Earth and are designed for it. Scientists still need to study the health effects of an extended stay on Mars. And we aren’t sure that stays beyond one or two orbital periods, which last 26 months each, would be safe – although current research indicates they probably would be. We have a window of opportunity we need to seize. In any case, the exciting things we could learn from shorter manned missions to Mars, around 30 months, would be worth it.\nShort bio\n: Pierre Brisson is the president and founder of the Mars Society Switzerland.

{"id": 1678, "text": "Cities are teeming with wildlife, much of which goes unnoticed, hidden away in urban parks, gardens, and other secluded niches. But the impact of urban development on the long-term survival of plant and animal populations is still poorly understood. Now, researchers are calling on the people of the greater Geneva area, on both sides of the border, to help locate habitats of the common toad. Participants are asked to report the location of ponds on the unique and fun interactive . They can also follow the project’s evolution on social media via its .\nGenetic diversity is crucial for plants and animals. In the long term, it allows them to adapt to threatening situations, such as a changing climate, new predators, or diseases. But boxed into ever-smaller communities by roads, buildings, and other urban infrastructure, this life-saving diversity could be in peril. “We are trying to find out what happens genetically to plant or animal communities when obstacles split them into ever smaller groups,” says Stéphane Joost, principle investigator of the UrbanGene Project.\nCheek-smears from toads\t\nResidents of the Geneva area are called upon to help scientists fill the gaps in the database of urban ponds, common habitats of the toads, by entering them into a website. With permission from the landowners, a group of researchers would then visit each site in search of toads, from which they would extract a DNA sample by collecting some cells from the inside of the their mouths. After decoding their genetic information, the results would be plugged into a geographical information system for further analysis.\nPlants, toads, and butterflies\t\nIn the course of the project, the researchers will focus on three plant and animal species that are prevalent throughout the greater Geneva area: the common toad, the meadow brown or small white butterfly, and the broad-leafed plantain, a common weed. “By scanning the genomes of these organisms for a large number of genetic markers, we will be able to assess their genetic diversity and determine how it varies in response to urban densification,” says Ivo Widmer, a biologist and an expert in environmental genetics working on the project. The studies are timely, with many urban development and densification projects on-going across the territory that is split between Switzerland and France. And results could provide valuable insight to guide future sustainable urban development projects across the greater Geneva area.\nThe flow of genes in space and time\t\nThe UrbanGene project is breaking new ground by tracking three species that differ starkly in how they spread their genes. Plant DNA spreads by the wind, bees, and other pollinating insects. And while toad DNA travels by land, as the animals move from pond to pond, butterfly DNA takes to the sky. Because of these differences, the sensitivity of each species’ biodiversity to urban development is likely to differ strongly. The project will initially focus on understanding how the genes of animals and plants from different habitats are connected to each other. Follow-up studies will study the diffusion of genetic information across habitats over time.\nAccording to Sandra Mollier, Head of Agriculture, Nature, and Landscape at Le Grand Genève, one of the organizations funding the project, these abstract-sounding findings will have very practical implications. “Promoting a multipolar and urban agglomeration that allows urban wildlife to thrive is particularly important to us,” she says. “If, for example, through this project, we realize that certain plant or animal communities have become increasingly isolated because of urban construction projects, its findings could help us take effective steps already in the planning phase of future projects to reconnect them again.”\nA three-pronged approach\nThe project is being carried out in parallel to GreenTrace, an effort by EPFL, UNIL, UNIGE, and HUG researchers to understand the benefits provided by urban biodiversity. But pinning down its effect on a city’s residents is tricky business, because reported perception and measured reality often do not align. “To get a more accurate picture of the relationship between urban development and urban wildlife, we will be working on three levels. Genetic analysis will inform us of the impact of development projects on the plant and animal species. An extensive survey will reveal how people perceive urban wildlife. And using health data, we will be able to assess whether and how proximity with urban green spaces and wildlife has a concrete, measureable impact on actual physical well-being.”", "summary": "How are toads faring in our cities?

It can be integrated in a portable computer or mobile telephone , or even an MP3 reader, while keeping its bright, high-quality image. This new device will enable the projection of documents and videos onto a wall, in the same way as current fixed projectors. The size of the image can be adjusted simply by modifying the distance between the projector and the projection surface; the resulting image remains uniformly clear.\n Another significant advantage: this projector uses very little energy, requiring on average 30% less current than the matrix- or LED-based technology currently available on the market. This solution, now being finalized, should be available in 2011 for industrial applications, and the following year for consumer electronics, according to Nicolas Abelé, Technical Director of the start-up, located in the EPFL Science Park.\n Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are only beginning to be used as a basis for the next generation of optical material. “This micro-projector functions using tiny mirrors of less than a millimeter’s thickness. Positioned on a silicon (wafer) disc, they reflect red, blue and green laser beams,” explains Maher Kayal, the EPFL research director who developed the microelectronic aspects of the system. The device, contained in a tiny glass case (3 mm x 4 mm), oscillates so rapidly that the beam can scan a surface up to 20,000 times a second. In August, Maher Kayal’s team was able to generate a color image in VGA resolution (640 x 480px) for the first time.\n This pocket projector works at a minimum distance of 50 centimeters, and enables the projection of images onto a surface equivalent to a 15-inch screen. During the last few months, the Lemoptix team has considerably improved the architecture of the optical head containing the laser light sources and the MEMS mirrors, thereby reducing the size of the whole device and its energy consumption. The manufacturing and assembly processes have also been defined, and the first sub-contractors identified. Moreover, the company succeeded in raising 1.4 million Swiss francs of new funds at the end of August.\n This technology has many advantages that will enable it to succeed in the market. “The micro-components used can be manufactured in thousands, even tens of thousands, at low cost,” emphasizes Nicolas Abelé. It will be developed from now until end-2011 for industrial applications. For example, it could be used by automobile manufacturers to project information directly onto the windshield, such as speed, GPS information etc. Medical technology companies have already shown an interest: this technology could be used to beam information related to an operation directly onto the patient, and would avoid the surgeon having to lift his head to look at a screen. The improved brightness and contrast will enable it to replace LCD screens.

This system could enhance the future of video games or even make video chats more fun.\nOne tool required: a camera that has motion and depth sensors in the style of Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion, well known to gamers. During its first use, the software needs only ten minutes to recognize the user’s face. The user reproduces several basic expressions requested by the program: smile, raise eyebrows, etc. “The more movement is incorporated into the program’s 50 positions, the more realistic are the results,” explains Thibaut Weise, creator of the start-up currently based at the Technopark in Zurich. Then you can get into the skin of your character and animate by moving yourself. “It’s almost like leaving your body to enter that of your avatar,” jokes the young entrepreneur.\nSaving time for animated films\nThe challenge for the research team in the laboratory of Computer Graphics and Geometry was to find an algorithm to superimpose the depth data from the camera with the color of the image and avatar in one step. They demonstrated that 3D facial movements could be reconstructed in real time without using facial markers or complex scanning hardware.\nIn an animated film or a video game, the facial expressions of characters are defined with a program that permits the movement of different parts of the face, step by step. To simulate anger, for example, it’s necessary to knit each eyebrow in two or three clicks, then stretch the mouth down, and so on. With the Faceshift software, mimicry and “emotions” of the avatar follow those of the actor, rendering the work more fun and certainly faster. “This new tool can reduce the time to make a film by up to 30%,” asserts Weise.\nOne imagines the purpose is to directly animate the face of one’s avatar in a video game.

{"id": 1687, "text": "The concept is straightforward: on one hand, vehicles equipped with video cameras to record the city streets, and on the other, a computer able to spot waste, identify it and classify it – in the blink of an eye. A researcher from EPFL's , working with local startup , the  and several Swiss cities, has created a system that provides cities with an objective way of assessing the cleanliness of their streets, including detailed information on the amount, type and location of waste. The system should help them decide which and how many street sweepers to purchase, how often to clean the streets, and which areas need to be cleaned more often because they are dirtier or because the garbage there is more dangerous. With a fact-based assessment at their fingertips that showed what sort of trash is located where, and which areas are hardest hit, city officials would be able to implement much more efficient – and potentially much less expensive – street-cleaning programs. That’s the approach described in an article appearing in \nComputer Vision Systems\n.\nA definition of cleanliness based on human perceptions\nIn the absence of quantifiable and scientific criteria, city officials rely on human perception when it comes to setting up street-cleaning programs. “It’s a key factor for cities in Switzerland and in Europe more generally, because it affects residents’ quality of life and has a bearing on how attractive cities are for both tourists and businesses,” says Mohammad Saeed Rad, a scientific assistant at the LTS5. “But cities today don’t have the objective metrics they need to manage their waste.” Every city has its own approach to assessing the cleanliness of its streets. Zurich does this by sending people out several times a year to walk the streets and record the trash they encounter – bottles, cigarette butts, etc. Others do it by asking residents to rate various parts of town for cleanliness.\nA program that can recognize every type of garbage\nTo obtain the fact-based assessment needed, the researcher's system uses vehicles equipped with high-definition video cameras to record city streets and all the objects on them. A computer then analyzes the images using special software to identify each object, determine if it is waste and, if so, assign it to one of 25 categories labeled as “waste” – e.g., plastic bottles, newspaper, cigarette butts or leaves. The researchers used machine learning to ‘train’ the computer to recognize and categorize various types of waste. They showed the computer as many images of as many types of waste as possible so that it can recognize them all. “We are still improving our results by feeding the database,” says Rad. The more types of waste the computer sees, the fewer mistakes it will make in recognizing and categorizing it. \nThe system recognizes every object and classifies it in the correct category\nSpotting small waste in all conditions\nThe researchers had their work cut out for them, since the computer has to be able to recognize two-centimeter-long cigarette butts, for example, in images taken several meters above ground at a speed of two frames per second. “At first, we decided to mount the cameras on the top of the city’s street sweepers, since they are sure to visit the dirtiest parts of town,” says Rad. “We then realized, with our partner cities, that these vehicles could not be driven in a number of important areas like parks and playgrounds.

{"id": 1690, "text": "The engineers at SEED Biosciences, an EPFL spin-off, have come up with a unique pipetting robot that can isolate single cells with the push of a button – without damaging the cells. Their device also records the cells’ electrical signature so that they can be traced. While this innovation may seem trivial, it can save researchers several weeks of precious time and speed up development work in pharmaceuticals, cancer treatments and personalized medicine. The company began marketing its device this year.\nCreating cell lines from a single cell\nEach biological cell – like each human being – is different, with variations in their size, shape and configuration. That has been making researchers’ jobs particularly difficult over the past few years. Because of those differences, scientists have been cloning stem cells and cancer cells to obtain samples that can be compared effectively and generate reliable results. This is the approach taken by several major research organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Being able to create cell lines from a single cell is essential for developing new therapies.\nThe method that scientists currently use is to repeatedly dilute cells in order to maximize the occurrences of a given cell. But that takes several weeks, so it’s a long and costly process. Yann Barrandon, an honorary professor at EPFL and stem-cell expert, was hoping for years that engineers would develop a system for turning this step into a simple formality, making his research easier and providing traceability. Tired of waiting, he suggested the project to two EPFL PhD students – David Bonzon and Georges Muller – who took it on with the help of Professor Philippe Renaud at the Microsystems Laboratory 4. After several years of hard work, Bonzon and Muller were ready to unveil their device; they created SEED Biosciences and, in association with other researchers, just published two articles in \nSLAS Technology\n. “Several systems have been introduced over the past few years, but ours – called Dispencell – is the first to tick all the boxes. It’s easy to use, doesn’t affect cell functions, can be sterilized, improves traceability, and more,” says Bonzon, the company’s CTO.\nThe pipette tips are designed to be sterilized and replaced © 2020 Alain Herzog\nTo use the device, scientists pipette 20 µL of a solution with a high cell concentration, drawing in a few hundred cells. They then place the pipette’s tip into the dish where they want to dispense the cells. By pressing a button, they can release individual cells one by one. The system contains an electronic sensor linked to a software program – also developed by SEED Biosciences – that records each cell’s electrical signature. The software is sensitive enough to detect single cells as they pass through the tip. They are then displayed on a computer screen as sharp peaks. The company is now working on a feature that can distinguish damaged cells from healthy ones.\nTwo electrodes in the pipette’s tip\nPart of the device’s secret is that it uses a 50-year-old mechanism called a Coulter counter. With this counter, particles pass between two chambers separated by a tiny hole while an electric current is applied across the hole. In SEED Biosciences’ device, one electrode is located against the pipette’s tip and another is placed in the solution. A thin membrane with a 30 μm hole stretches across the very tip of the pipette and allows the cells to pass through one by one. The device detects and records the cells as they pass through; because the cells are not conductive, they cause changes in the current based on the cells’ size. By measuring the change in current, the software determines the cells’ passage and electrical signature. The pipette tips are designed to be sterilized and replaced so as to avoid contamination.\nThe device is initially intended for the pharmaceutical industry but also has promising applications in personalized medicine.

{"id": 1691, "text": "Randomness and geometrical structures interact with one another in a plethora of real-life examples, such as bubbles in boiling water or snowflakes. But Professor Juhan Aru, , found a way to link his hobbies with work in another everyday phenomenon: clouds.\n“In the north, from where I come from, the summer skies are often filled with small puffy clouds – cumulus clouds,” he says. “You often see them in Switzerland too. One of my favourite pastimes has always been to lie down on a field, a beach – why not a mountaintop? – and to watch these clouds.” Aru considers himself lucky, as his current field of mathematics is actually linked to clouds.\nThe field Aru is working on is sometimes called \"random geometry\", where geometric structures and randomness interact. If one looks at cumulus clouds, then a certain structure – or geometry – is clear and apparent to the eye. But even so, randomness is present, hidden in the formation of clouds through the aggregation of water molecules, each flying around the sky independently, randomly, before ultimately “deciding” to contribute to the cloud itself.\nMathematicians don’t have a good, satisfactory mathematical description of cumulus clouds – or at least a model that can describe and understand their detailed and beautiful shapes. For now, we have to work on simpler things, e.g. restricting ourselves to two dimensions – or as mathematicians would say, to “planar structures” – some of them still resemble clouds, but two-dimensional clouds.\nAru and his group are trying to understand the mathematical properties of these cloud-like planar structures. Their work is similar to that of a biologist, who taxonomizes different species – classifying them, and describing their distinctive and common properties.\nOne of the models Aru works with is called the “2D Gaussian free field” (2D GFF; see an example in the figure) We can think of it as the height function of a mountainous landscape, like the Alps.\nA surface plot of an approximation of the 2D Gaussian free field. Credit: Juhan Aru, EPFL.\n“I try to understand the peaks, the valleys, and the level lines of this landscape,” says Aru. “It turns out that the 2D GFF has many connections to models of statistical physics, to quantum field theories, to simplified theories of quantum gravity, and also to what is called ‘Brownian motion’.” Brownian motion is a probabilistic model used in mathematics to describe the random motion of particles. “Errantly moving particles are like water molecules in the summer sky,” explains Aru. “So, at least for me, the GFF is also linked to clouds”.\nThe past few years have seen remarkable progress in the field, and now Aru and his colleagues have been able understand further aspects of the 2D GFF. “Yet, the work is by no means done,” says Aru. \"Indeed, many connections of the GFF are still being uncovered. For example, at the moment we have no mathematical means to study geometric questions in three dimensions; and yet, clouds are three-dimensional. So the questions are challenging, and inspiration is important - so I often go for a walk, lie down, and take a look at the sky!”\nTracking the maths\n The Gaussian free field (GFF) is a random height function. It is different every time you look at it, but even so there are some geometric properties that are (almost) always true. Therefore, when we study a 2D GFF, we are interested in describing its statistical properties. Together with co-authors, the Chair of Random Geometry has been studying such properties.\n The difficulty is that the 2D GFF fluctuates so much that you cannot assign a value to it at any point – mathematically speaking, at any point the random height has infinite variance. One can only ask about averages of the height around any point. Mathematically, this means that the 2D GFF can be only be described as a random generalized function, as a random Schwartz distribution, which makes the study of geometric properties more difficult – how do you even give a sense to for example contour lines, when the height-function has no point-wise values?\n Nevertheless, around 15 years ago Oded Schramm and Scott Sheffield found a way to describe the level lines of the 2D GFF and since then there has been tremendous progress in the subject. Part of the progress has been in giving sense to a wider variety of geometric notions, e.g. excursions off the level lines.\n Another part of the progress has been related to the many applications of the GFF: it helps construct 2D toy models of quantum gravity, called Liouville quantum gravity, and to better understand Schramm–Loewner evolution processes – a family of random curves that describes the geometry of many statistical physics models, e.g. those of long random polymers.", "summary": "Juhan Aru is a new professor in Mathematics at EPFL where he holds the Chair of Random Geometry.

The growth of a PbI\n2\n crystal (highlighted in yellow) from the partly amorphous PbI\n2\n film is visible. Image shows an area of 2.77 microns x 2.08 microns.\nPerovskite solar cells are an alternative to conventional silicon solar cells, poised to enter the market with their high power-conversion efficiencies (above 22% now) and lower capital expenditure and manufacturing costs. One of the main methods for depositing perovskite films onto panel structures is a process known as sequential deposition, which was developed in 2013 by Michael Grätzel and coworkers at EPFL. Many studies have attempted to control this process with additives, compositional changes, and temperature effects. However, none of these have provided a complete understanding of the entire sequential deposition reaction. This prevents adequate control over film quality, which determines the performance of the solar cell.\nA study by and Amita Ummadisingu at EPFL now offers the most systematic and full study of the sequential deposition reaction to-date. The scientists began with X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study in depth the crystallization of lead iodide (PbI\n2\n), which is the first stage of the reaction. They then used, for the first time, SEM-cathodoluminescence imaging to study the nano-scale dynamics of perovskite film formation.\n“We have combined two powerful tools to obtain compositional information about the surface of the film during perovskite formation,” says Amita Ummadisingu. “This technique enables us to achieve stunning nano-scale resolution meaning that we can see, for the first time, that mixed crystalline aggregates composed of perovskite and PbI\n2\n are formed during the reaction.”\nNext, the scientists used cross-sectional photo-luminescence mapping, which revealed the directionality of the conversion reaction. This kind of information has so far been unattainable with standard surface imaging because layers lying beneath one another are inaccessible. But with the aid of state-of-the-art hybrid high-definition photon detectors, the researchers were able to simultaneously image PbI\n2\n and perovskites in these cross-sections. “We identified trapped, unreacted PbI\n2\n inside the perovskite film using this technique, which is very useful,” says Ummadisingu.\n“Our findings finally answer several open questions regarding the location and role of residual PbI\n2 \nin perovskite solar cells,” says Michael Grätzel. “On a broader note, our innovative demonstration of this technique’s uses opens the door for understanding the properties of perovskites in vertical cross sections of solar cells, not just the perovskite surface as currently shown in the literature.”\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)\nReference\nA.

{"id": 1698, "text": "Cuprates are materials with great promise for achieving superconductivity at higher temperatures (-120\no\nC). This could mean low-cost electricity without energy loss. Intense research has focused on understanding the physics of cuprates in the hope that we can develop room-temperature superconductors. EPFL scientists have now used a cutting-edge technique to uncover the way cuprates become superconductors. Their work is published in \nNature Communications\n.\nConventional superconductors are materials that conduct electricity with no electrical resistance under temperatures nearing absolute zero (−273.15°C or 0 Kelvin). Under these conditions, the electrons of the material join up and form electron couples that are called “Cooper pairs”, and in this form can flow without resistance. Generally, cooper pairs form at such low temperatures, and only when the superconductor’s atoms vibrate and create an attractive force between electrons.\nHowever, there is a class of superconductors where Cooper pairs do not form because atoms nudge them together. These superconductors are copper-based materials called “cuprates”, and in normal temperatures they are actually electrical insulators and magnets.\nThe popularity of cuprates comes from the fact that they become superconductors at much higher temperatures than other materials: just over -123.15°C (150 Kelvin). This makes cuprates an excellent way towards everyday superconductivity. However, previous studies have suggested that cuprates do not become superconducting like other materials, which poses the question: how does superconductivity arise in cuprates?\nA team of researchers led by Marco Grioni at EPFL has used a cutting-edge spectroscopic technique to explore the unique superconductivity of cuprates. The scientists used a technique called Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering, which is used to investigate the electronic structure of materials. This high-resolution method was able to monitor what happens to the electrons of a cuprate sample as it turned into a superconductor.\n“Normally, superconductors hate magnetism,” says Grioni. “Either you have a good magnet or a good superconductor, but not both. Cuprates are very different and have really surprised everyone, because they are normally insulators and magnets, but they become superconducting when a few extra electrons are added by gently tweaking its chemical composition.”\nThe key ingredient of magnetism is a property of electrons called spin, which can be thought of as the moment of a spinning top. Spins can interact with each other and create spin waves that travel across the material. When magnetic materials are disturbed, spin waves are created and spread in ripples throughout their volume. Such spin waves are telltale fingerprints of the magnetic interaction and structure.\nEven when they become superconducting, cuprates do not lose their magnetic properties. “Something of the magnet remains in the superconductor, and could play a major role in the appearance of superconductivity ” says Grioni. “The new results give us a better idea of how the spins interact in these fascinating materials.”\nThe findings propose a novel understanding of superconductivity in cuprates, and possibly in other high-temperature superconductors. By revealing the role of spin interactions, it might pave the way for bringing high-temperature superconductors into the real world.\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Institute of Condensed Matter with Swiss Light Source, the University of Geneva, the University of British Columbia, IFW Dresden, Ruhr-Universität Bochum and the National University of Science and Technology of the Russian Federation.\nReference\nGuarise M, Dalla Piazza B, Berger H, Giannini E, Schmitt T, Rønnow HM, Sawatzky GA, van den Brink J, Altenfeld D, Eremin I, Grioni M. \nAnisotropic softening of magnetic excitations along the nodal direction in superconducting cuprates.\nNat.

{"id": 1702, "text": "Despite the pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout, your company managed to raise CHF 92 million in funding – CHF 56 million in 2019 and the rest very recently. What's your secret?\nIt was precisely because of the pandemic that we decided to streamline our fundraising efforts by continuing a third round rather than starting a new one. So we signed up the same set of investors, mainly Swiss, as well as a few others they had brought on board. This eliminated the need to make lots of presentations to attract new investors, which would have been difficult in light of the public-health situation.\nIn 2011, when you were a professor at EPFL, your lab developed an algorithm that transforms how computer buses transfer data. This breakthrough technology was the subject of your first patent. Is that when you came up with the idea for a start-up, with the anticipation that it would take off?\nWithin an hour of our system working for the first time, we thought it would be a good idea to create a start-up. It was immediately clear that, while our technology could give rise to some outstanding research papers, the best way to spotlight it would be through a company. However, Kandou Bus grew much more slowly than we had anticipated in our original business plan, which called for a few months’ R&D work at EPFL, a prototype in under a year, and funding rounds the following year to turn the system into a marketable product. We were hoping to get where we are now in just four years. But when the applications for your invention are in brand-new territory, as was the case for us, then the process is like skiing down a treacherous slope at night with only a flashlight. You have limited visibility, you have to react with lightning speed and, if necessary, change course without falling over. Under such circumstances, finding your way takes time.\nWhat were the key development steps for your business?\nWe're lucky that our technology is a horizontal one – that is, it concerns all segments of the computer-component market instead of just one narrow application. The downside of this was how to gauge the market early on to determine which segment to target first. During this phase, which lasted three years, we were in stealth mode; we didn't share what we were working on. Fortunately, the CEO of a US start-up, which had become a multinational some years earlier, believed in our technology. He loaned us CHF 10 million in 2012 so that we could keep our head above water. Then in 2014, after delivering a paper at a high-profile industry conference, someone from Marvell, a semiconductor company, expressed real interest in our system. It took two more years to secure this first contract, which really set us on our way.\nSuccessful IT start-ups are rare in Switzerland. What are the advantages of being based at EPFL?\nFirst of all, I live here and I love this region – that's important. Also, because there's not much ICT here, it's easier to blaze your own trail. At a place like Silicon Valley with so many successful high-tech firms, newcomers have a tendency to imitate them in order to get backing, even though that might not be the best course for their business. Finally, being positioned outside the microcosm, and its attendant discussions, lends us an air of mystery, which is an advantage during negotiations. Locating our company at EPFL was a strategic choice at the beginning. I was a professor there and needed to be able to shuttle quickly between the company and my office. Now, however, it gives us a clear advantage in hiring talented young engineers and keeping abreast of research developments.\nWhat advice would you give to entrepreneurs want to create a fast-growing start-up?\nBeing an entrepreneur is a lot like being a scientist – you have to be passionate about what you do from the outset. You can't invent it later on. Without that kind of enthusiasm, it's extremely difficult to succeed because your personal investment is crucial: developing ideas takes up a lot of time and you don’t get much vacation or weekends off. This kind of commitment is also what allows you to weather the storm when nothing goes according to plan. Afterwards, the fast growth comes on its own. There's no big mystery about the early funding period. You have to cultivate your network, but if an investor doesn't latch on, there's no point spending huge amounts of time trying to convince them. You can see right away if someone's interested.\nWhat are your plans after this substantial funding round?\nNow our main goal is to market our first chip for all USB-C connections by spring 2021. This chip allows for faster, lower-power data transfer between all types of devices: smartphones, computers, external hard drives, and so on. We’re currently in the final development phase for the high-end version. Over the next year, we’ll roll out other chips aimed at a much larger market. This will be our first widely-distributed product.\nWhere do you see your company in ten years or so – is an IPO in the cards? Will Kandou be the next Logitech?\nIn terms of success, I think Kandou Bus will follow in Logitech's footsteps. My goal is to supply chips for all the devices people use to communicate. Today, systems are built using components, and we’re designing those components. But we’re planning to fabricate finished products based on our technology within a decade. Our technology will likely be used in satellites. With regards to our business model, we want to remain an independent company. As a CEO, I have to keep an eye on the ROI for investors and future shareholders, but as a founder, I have a strong link with the company and want to remain with it for as long as possible.

{"id": 1704, "text": "Considering how many microorganisms we ingest each day, our gut has an extensive and well-developed immune system. This defense is involved in acute and chronic gut diseases, but it varies dramatically among people. A persistent question is how our genetic make-up affects our gut’s ability to fight infections. EPFL scientists have found that gut immunity is not affected by single genes but by entire groups of genes. The study, which challenges simplistic views of gut disease, is published in \nNature Communications\n.\nThat gut feeling\n A healthy gut contains a multitude of beneficial bacteria, which help us digest and process food. But the remaining fifth includes bacteria that can cause infections, which is why the gut has developed an extensive array of defenses. Upon ingestion, bacteria stimulate the gut’s cells to produce a mixture of antimicrobial molecules and highly reactive molecules that neutralize infectious microorganisms, but can also damage the gut tissue in the process. In response, cells in the damaged areas release specialized molecules that activate the gut’s stem cells to regenerate and heal the tissue.\nHowever, people are not equal in terms of gut immunity. Some individuals are more susceptible to infections than others, even when they share similar diets. For example, two people might eat the same salmonella-ridden hamburgers, but only one of them suffers an infection. The key, therefore, might lie in the genetic variation between individuals. Nonetheless, this is an area of which we still know very little.\nFlies to the rescue\nThe lab of Bart Deplancke, in collaboration with the lab of Bruno Lemaitre at EPFL, have now made a leap forward in advancing our understanding of how genetics influences gut immunocompetence. The researchers showed that we must think beyond single genes and into the far more complex dimension of “gene clusters” – groups of genes working together.\n“The problem with genetic variation is, how do you study it in humans?” says Deplancke. “There are so many factors that make it difficult to standardize the comparison e.g. different diets, rates of development, habits during the day and others.” Such environmental factors make it difficult to isolate genetic effects.\nThe team addressed the problem by using fruit flies, which can be easily standardized in terms of environmental factors. This makes it easy to have strains with distinct genetic profiles, while keeping environmental factors the same.\nThe researchers didn’t look at single genes but rather at groups of genes working together. Data from this “genomic” approach would be far more efficient as a starting point in connecting genetics and gut immunity.\nPhD student Maroun Bou Sleiman and postdoc Dani Osman infected fruit fly strains with an intestinal bacterium, making sure to keep all other factors, e.g. diet, temperature, humidity – even the amount of infecting bacteria – the same across all strains. The team used over a hundred fruit fly strains with well-defined differences in their sets of genes.\nIt’s all about the genome\nWhat they discovered was that there was a striking variation across the susceptibility of different strains. For example, one strain would show 100% susceptibility to the bacterium (all the flies would die after three days), in another there would be 100% survival, and all others fell somewhere in between (e.g. 50-50 survival etc).\n“It has to be the genome,” says Deplancke, since all environmental factors such as food, temperature etc. were the same across the strains. “Just having slight differences in the genome can make you anywhere from completely resistant to completely susceptible to an infection.”\nThe question was then finding the biological link between genome variations the gut’s ability to fight infections. To answer this, the researchers used two powerful techniques: The first one looked at which genes were “on” in the fly gut; the second one used computers to look at which genetic variants in different fly strains were associated with specific aspects of gut immunocompetence.\nThe scientists identified several new influencers of gut immunity. These are not single genes, but rather entire groups of genes working together. One group they discovered involved genes linked to the production of the highly reactive molecules that neutralize infectious microorganisms.\nThis group of genes helps flies resist infections by actually lowering the activity of reactive oxygen species, which minimizes their potential damage to the gut. The group of genes also helps with faster clearance of infectious pathogens and higher stem cell activity for tissue healing. In contrast, this helpful group was less active in susceptible flies, meaning that it could make a life-or-death difference when fighting an infection in the gut.\nThis study provides completely new insights into what controls the differences in the gut’s ability to fight infections, with far-reaching implications that go beyond acute infections. For example, being unable to clear infectious pathogens from the gut or control the gut’s immune response, or even to repair damaged tissue after immune responses may lead to chronic gastrointestinal diseases. As Deplancke explains: “Our work shows how relatively minor, but systematic variation in a fly’s – and probably a human’s – genome can lead to wide differences in the susceptibility of the gut to infections.”\nThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies, EPFL, and AgingX (SystemsX.ch). It involved a collaboration of EPFL’s Global Health Institute and Institute of Bioengineering with the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the University of Melbourne.\nReference\nBou Sleiman MS, Osman D, Massouras A, Hoffmann AA, Lemaitre B, Deplancke B. \nGenetic, molecular and physiological basis of variation in drosophila gut immunocompetence. \nNature Communications\n 27 July 2015.

{"id": 1706, "text": "The lens can be affected by cataract – a partial or total loss of its transparency. It’s made up of very dense proteins solution. These proteins are of differing sizes, and link up with each other according to the strength of their interaction, while ensuring the transparency of the eye. Giuseppe Foffi and his co-workers have further postulated that there is a weak interaction between the different types of proteins, and not only between those of the same group. They have now demonstrated this – both theoretically and experimentally – using simulations.\nAge-related cataract is caused by mutations of proteins that are triggered by genetic factors, diabetes, or ultra-violet light . The lens, once formed, doesn’t re-generate itself: therefore, it’s essential to understand the properties of its proteins in order to determine how certain diseases affect it. The objective is to treat the disease early on, rather than trying to manage it when it’s already established, which is often unsatisfactory. Although cataract is easily operable in developed countries, it’s the .\nCold cataract\nThe lens can also become opaque in response to a change in temperature. A lowering of temperature alters the properties of the proteins, which then no longer allow the light to pass through. This reversible phenomenon, called “cold cataract”, enables the understanding of the interactions between the molecules and the mechanisms of age-related cataract.\nGiuseppe Foffi, Nicolas Dorsaz (former PhD student, Cambridge University), George Thurston (Rochester Institute of Technology), Peter Schurtenberger (University of Lund) and Anna Stradner (University of Fribourg) used proteins, extracted from bovine lenses and cooled, to perform their experiments and to prove the hypotheses on the interaction between the different types of proteins. To examine the opaque lenses, they used X-rays and neutrons. The results showed that the very weak value of the interaction confirms the simulations and is essential for the transparency of the eye. The team will now concentrate on performing the same experiments with the latest type of protein , which is the least known.\nBeyond the perspectives for research and for the understanding of the eye and its pathologies, Giuseppe Foffi is enthusiastic: “There have been only two moments in my life where theory has predicted experimental results.” And even though the application of this research still seem far away, he reminds us that “before inventing the radio, it was necessary to discover the equations governing electro-magnetism”.\nLink:", "summary": "The lens of the eye, the only transparent part of the human body, is made up of proteins that still hold many mysteries for medical scientists.

{"id": 1709, "text": "Unlike our bones, the cartilage inside our joints is not vascularized (i.e., it has no blood vessels). This is one reason why cartilage does not heal well after an injury. In athletes in particular, joint injuries often result in cartilage degeneration and arthritis. The process is chronic and irreversible, and to this day, no effective treatment exists.\nEPFL scientists Dominique Pioletti and Harm-Anton Klok have developed a hydrogel that promotes cartilage regeneration. In a joint, cartilage-producing cells only respond to treatment if they are mechanically stimulated at the same time, for example in the knee joint when a person is walking. To exploit this fact, the scientists created a hydrogel that delivers a therapeutic drug to the cells only when they are undergoing repetitive movement. The results of their work, which is part of the \"Smart Materials\" Swiss National Research Project (PNR 62), have been published in the journal \nBiomaterials\n. \nTargeted and timed delivery \n The cells that produce cartilage in a joint are called chondrocytes. When a joint is at rest, its chondrocytes are mostly inactive. However, when the same joint is moving, its chondrocytes activate receptors that are sensitive to growth factors produced by the body. At the same time, the chondrocytes become sensitive to treatments that help them regenerate damaged cartilage. \"The receptors involved only appear after 5-20 minutes of repetitive movement,\" says Prof. Pioletti. \"We therefore had to develop a way to time the release of the medication.\"\nWhen a knee joint is in movement, friction generates heat. The method developed by the EPFL scientists is based on this concept. The viscous hydrogel matrix is designed to deliver the drugs it carries only when it reaches a certain threshold temperature, that is, after a specific number of repeated movements. Technically, the matrix contains liposomal nanoparticles as well as a therapeutic agent, TGF-beta growth factor. The matrix heats up during repeated movements. After 5-10 minutes, under the effect of the heat, the diameter of the nanoparticles decreases by a third, causing gaps to form in the matrix through which the growth factor can flow out into the target area. This mechanism thus makes it possible to time the release of the drug, delivering it at the most optimal moment to help the joint regenerate its cartilage.\nA minimally invasive procedure \n One way of implementing this approach in the future would involve arthroscopically implanting the matrix at the site of the damaged cartilage. Then, via targeted physical therapy, the joint would be mobilized to maximize the effect of the medicine. \n More work has to be done before the team's innovative method actually reaches the market. At present, the team has proven the concept from a mechanical standpoint, having successfully delivered a colored dye used in place of the growth factor, but the technique still needs to be fine-tuned. \"Several doctors have shown an interest in our approach,\" says Prof Pioletti, \"and now we need to find partners and improve the method for in vivo tests.\"", "summary": "A team of EPFL scientists has developed a smart hydrogel material that could promote cartilage regeneration.

{"id": 1714, "text": "Who would win in a real-life game of “Where’s Waldo,” humans or computers? A recent study suggests that when speed and accuracy are critical, an approach combing both human and machine intelligence would take the prize. With drones being used to monitor everything natural disaster sites, pollution, or wildlife populations, analyzing drone images in real-time has become a critically important big data challenge. Publishing in the journal Big Data, researchers, including Stéphane Joost from EPFL, present a new approach to rapidly interpret aerial images taken by camera drones that combines human crowdsourcing and machine learning.\nTo develop and test their approach, the researchers traveled to the  in the heart of Namibia. There they surveyed the compound using camera-drones to count the resident wildlife population, including ostriches, kudus, wildebeests, zebras and rhinos. Confronted with the daunting number of images captured, and the difficulty of having computers reliably distinguish between rocks, bushes, and animals, the researchers turned to the internet. Using an online crowdsourcing platform, , they uploaded their images for manual analysis by an army of digital volunteers.\nThe task put before the digital volunteers was straightforward. They were asked to click through a stack of images, identify all animals, and outline them on their screens. According to the study’s senior author Stéphane Joost, the response was astounding: “Within two days, they had evaluated 98% of the 26,000 images that had been uploaded.” Next, half of these annotated images were used to train an automatic object recognition algorithm, which was then tested on the remaining images. “The 500 digital volunteers did generate a number false positives, tracing features that in actual fact were not animals. Despite that, their analysis was certainly good enough to serve as training data for the computer algorithm,” says Joost.\nEssential aid following disasters\n Artificial intelligence has already become a mainstay in disaster response operations, where it is primarily relied on to scour tweets and text messages for what can be life-saving information. “Twitter can erupt with up to tens of thousands of tweets sent out of the disaster zone per minute. It would take humans days to sort the relevant from the irrelevant information,” says Joost. “Today, this challenge has been solved and tweets can be analyzed quickly using a combination human and artificial intelligence. Our challenge was to transpose this solution to apply it to the analysis of image data.”\nFrom high above, drones carrying high-resolution cameras offer rescue workers an invaluable vantage point from which to locate damaged buildings, blocked roads, and other important features. And fortunately, automatically spotting and identifying animals in the Savanna is likely to be far more challenging than locating infrastructure destroyed in a disaster. Following the completion of the pilot study in Namibia, the new tool was used in its first serious mission: it was adopted by the World Bank to speed up damage and needs assessment in the aftermath of tropical cyclone Pam that hit the Island State of Vanuatu in 2015.\nAn exceptional list of authors\n “It is interesting to point out that three of the study’s co-authors were, at the time, environmental engineering students, says Joost. It is quite rare for students to become co-authors of scientific research articles. “Nicolas Rey, Julien Briant, and Pauline Millet were attending a course in territorial imagery at EPFL, where they developed some of the detection algorithms used in this project.“\nThe study was carried out by researchers from EPFL, the , the , and the , in collaboration with .", "summary": "Drone images accumulate much faster than they can be analyzed.

The answer came in a lively presentation by Margaux Larcher, a PhD student at the Laboratory of Thermomechanical Metallurgy (LMTM), at the finals of EPFL’s My Thesis in 180 Seconds (MT180) competition. Using just the right words, carefully chosen metaphors and a dash of humor, she explained how the seemingly random movement of atoms in the shape memory material she is studying is, in fact, synchronized. Larcher’s presentation won over the jury and wowed the audience. Under normal circumstances, it would have drawn thunderous applause. But these are unusual times, and the 600-seater Rolex Forum was almost empty, with fewer than 50 audience members in attendance because of measures against the coronavirus. The event was live-streamed on  to allow spectators to cast their vote for the audience award (voting closes at 6pm tonight).\nMaterials were the star of the show last night as Rita Drissi Daoudi, another PhD student from the same lab as Larcher, took second place for her presentation on a system that detects manufacturing defects by “listening” to 3D-printed parts as they’re being made. Her audio detection method could one day be used to fix imperfections on the fly and stop defective components such as aircraft parts and hip implants from rolling off the production line. This year is the first time that EPFL will send two women to the national final, which will take place at the Rolex Forum on 26 May.\nThird place went to Sébastien Le Fouest for his presentation on vertical-axis wind turbines, which are smaller and more versatile than conventional horizontal-axis versions but have the disadvantage of being more fragile. Le Fouest is a PhD student at the Unsteady Flow Diagnostics Laboratory (UNFOLD), where he is investigating ways to overcome this fragility by studying the formation of vortices. In his presentation, for which he’d already picked up an audience award, he used his body to show how the wind acts on the blades. The other audience winner was Alice Gillen from the Laboratory of Nanobiotechnology (LNB) for her research into sensors that could deliver a steady dose of dopamine, in just the right amount, to patients with Parkinson’s disease.\nHigh-caliber presentations\nThe jury was chaired by Professor Marilyne Andersen from the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). She was particularly impressed with the caliber of this year’s entries. “The presentations were of such a high standard that we thought each one was going to be the winner – until the next one came along and made us reconsider,” says Prof. Andersen. The 14 PhD students who competed last night were able to successfully distill several years’ worth of research into just three minutes. The audience, watching in person and online, was treated to a whirlwind tour that included cell transport mechanisms for Alzheimer’s disease drugs, a magnetic probe for a nuclear fusion reactor, and a system for cooling hydrogen fuel cells.

Trials began yesterday in Falmouth, England.\nEight countries will compete aboard catamarans with dimensions not exceeding 7.62 x 4.20 m in size and 27.8 m2 in sail area. The two teams representing Switzerland have been training since early September aboard their vessels mounted on \"hydrofoils\", where they are capable to rise above the waves given specific wind conditions.\nHydros is very ambitious about this race. Florent Gaillard, head of communications, said openly: \"We have what it takes to win!\" And his optimism is not unfounded. Both catamarans have accumulated a substantial know-how in the course of countless practice sessions aboard the “Hydroptère.ch” on Lake Leman.\nExceptional partnership\nThe technology used also results from industrial and academic partnerships in the Leman area that have managed to establish a genuine \"cluster of excellence\" in the field of composite materials. Firstly, the boats are assembled in the Décision S.A. shipyard in Ecublens. Their construction puts great emphasis in the use of revolutionary materials whose development has been made possible by the involvement of several EPFL units such as the Laboratory of Applied Mechanics and Reliability Analysis (LMAF) and the Laboratory of Polymer and Composite technology (LTC). Finally, the raw material used to build the boats’ structure and wings is manufactured by North TPT, in Penthalaz.\nThe specialty of this quest, which makes it stand out at an international level, is the use of carbon fiber and thin film glass composites. Developed from the outset for sailing related applications, these materials became known in 2007 thanks to the famous Alinghi \"black sails\". At present, the same constituents allow the production of particularly light and strong rigid structures.

To help consumers get a better grasp of what they’re agreeing to, a team of researchers from EPFL, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Michigan have developed a program that uses artificial intelligence to decipher websites’ data protection policies in the blink of an eye.

Once the text of a policy is fed into the program, the software scours through it in just a few seconds and displays the results in easy-to-read visuals. That lets you see at a glance which data a website would be authorized to collect and for what purpose. You can then make an informed decision about whether to use the website, or, in the case of an app, download it.

His \"Roombots\" project, co-­funded by the National Centre for Competence in Research Robotics, is the subject of an article that has been published in the online version of the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems.\nRetractable claws\n Like Lego bricks, Roombots pieces can be stacked upon each other to create various structures. Each 22 cm-long piece, which looks like two large dice joined together, has a wireless connection. Inside are a battery and three motors that allow the module to pivot with three degrees of freedom. The modules have retractable \"claws\" that they use to attach to other pieces and form larger structures. With a series of rotations and connections, the modules can change shape and become any of a variety of objects and pieces of furniture. \"In order to keep costs down and ensure solidity, we have prioritized the construction of hybrid furniture, in other words, objects made up of both robotic modules and solid \"passive\" elements,\" says Auke Ijspeert.\nIn order to metamorphose and to attach to passive elements, the Roombots need to anchor themselves to something, so the researchers developed a special surface with holes adapted to the Roombots' mechanical claws. Fixed to the walls, floor and already existing pieces of furniture, these surfaces act as interfaces between the modules and their environment. The little robots can then climb the walls of a room, or attach themselves to \"passive\" elements on the furniture to form mobile tables or lamps that follow you around the room. \"It could be very useful for disabled individuals to be able to ask objects to come closer to them, or to move out of the way,\" notes Auke Ijspeert.\nAn aesthetic appeal\n The Roombots project is a true technological challenge, and for the moment it includes four functional modules with an autonomy of one-hour - still not enough to create complete pieces of furniture, but enough to build simple structures and hybrid combinations.\nThe potential for innovative applications is huge.

Their ideas, shared via a series of , pique the imagination: flower pots that can move from window to window around the façade of an entire building; Roombots that make lighting components and sound systems modular and adaptable are just two examples. \"We designed the Roombots elements in such a way that they blend into the background of a room and make the users' lives easier, while maintaining a certain aesthetic quality,\" says Ijspeert. \"We're open to any possibility.\"\nProgramming a floor plan from a tablet\n There are still a few technical details that need to be smoothed out. The movement of the modules when they're grouped needs to be accelerated and optimized, and the algorithms defining the sequences of motor actions involved in composing the various structures need to be improved. The scientists are also busy testing various user interfaces. \"One idea is to use a tablet on which you could define the layout of a virtual room. The Roombots would then take care of the rest,\" says Stéphane Bonardi, a PhD student involved in the project. In the next few years, the laboratory will continue the fabrication of modules. Perhaps the not-so-distant future will find us living in a world made up of intelligent buildings, with furniture that arranges and adapts itself to meet our every need.\n-----\n Add. information:", "summary": "EPFL scientists are creating futuristic furniture that can move around and autonomously change its shape.

{"id": 1727, "text": "A hunt for the goose that lays golden eggs. This is, in essence, Philippe Paccaud’s proposal in his master's thesis, conducted at EPFL’s Automatic Control Laboratory. This micro-technology student addressed the question that intrigues more than one mathematician: to what extent can we predict the number on which a roulette ball will fall? He might not have found a miracle equation, but the young man was certainly able to get some interesting results.\nHe had to be resourceful. He put together a customized experimentation platform that basically consisted of a wheel, a computer and a camera to record the slightest movement of the ball and the position of the number zero slot as a benchmark. To ensure consistency in the light source and thus the accuracy of the detection, the student had the idea to distribute LEDs along an old bicycle rim, which he then suspended above the wheel.\n\"By means of this system, I executed a thousand throws and recorded all the data to develop a model,\" explained Philippe Paccaud. Image processing algorithms allowed him to measure the ball and the roulette’s position every time. A Kalman filter - a tool for estimating a dynamic system’s variables based on partial and/or noisy measurements - was used to assess the speed and acceleration. Then, the database thus created was analyzed by machine learning algorithms. In fact, this is one of the original features of this work, as pre-existing studies on the subject were based primarily on physical models.\nA slight tilt\nThe data collection did entail some difficulties. The student quickly realized that he had to correct a flaw in the wheel: a slight tilt was influencing the ball’s trajectory. \"A 0.2 degrees difference is enough to bias the results,\" he explained. There was another difficulty; after starting with 1’400 different features recorded per throw, he ended up with too much information that was simply impossible to analyze. For that reason, he had to reduce them to the most relevant. Finally, Philippe Paccaud also had to ensure the proper positioning of the camera above the game. \"It must be placed exactly in the center to ensure an accurate measurement of the ball’s position, any mistake could inevitably influence the speed and acceleration estimates.\"\nOnce these corrections were made, the student was able to predict with a 43% success rate the baffle (the diamond-shaped metal parts placed around the wooden perimeter, just above the numbered boxes) on which the ball was to hit first. \"We could continue this work by testing other algorithms for predicting on which half of the roulette the ball is most likely to stop moving,\" he notes.\nEstimate the area\nIn conclusion, Philippe Paccaud highlighted the problem’s complexity. Not only each throw involves a huge number of variables, but one small parameter variation of the ball (position, speed, acceleration) will completely change the final result, making a prediction of the exact figure, according to him, almost impossible. \"One of the algorithms assessed that a difference of 2 inches per second for an initial ball’s speed of about 1.3 meters per second (that is: a ~ 0.2% margin) produces the same result, but just outside this range the end result is 10 slots away! One could only speak of the probability to estimate the area of the wheel where the ball will stop.\"\nBut these were not the figures that interested Philippe Paccaud the most. \"I thought it was particularly rewarding to start from scratch, to create a project from A to Z and to imagine an entire experimentation and analysis system, all of this counting on the teachers’ full confidence.\"", "summary": "Summer Series - student work (9): To what extent could we predict the number on which a roulette ball is going to fall?

{"id": 1731, "text": "Carlos Romero is not easily discouraged! This doctoral student of Colombian origin, passionate about lightning, is determined to uncover some of the secrets of this phenomenon that everyone knows, but whose physical principles remain largely a mystery.\n His thesis is dedicated to the design and construction of a totally innovative measuring device. Fifteen thousand components and eighteen months later, he didn’t hesitate to strap himself into a harness and to climb up 80 meters to install the device in one of the most extreme geographical locations in Switzerland. The radio-TV transmitter at the Säntis is built on a summit at 2502 meters, and culminates 120 meters higher up. “Inside the antenna, the temperatures can vary between –35°C in winter and +40°C in summer, explains Carlos Romero. We had to create a very robust device.”\n The antenna, which is reminiscent of a rocket ready for take off, also features another characteristic: it attracts lightning! According to the statistics from the European body in charge of monitoring the phenomenon, it could even be the European location most often struck by lightning. An ideal location therefore to pursue the work of Swiss researcher Karl Berger, a world-renowned name in this field. The use of his observations, performed over nearly thirty years (1943-1972) in Monte San Salvatore (Ticino region), is today confronted with the same limits regarding accuracy as existed at the time. “The devices we have installed have an extremely fine resolution and scan a very large spectrum of wavelengths. They take 100 million measurements per second and generate so much data – one gigabyte for each lightning strike – that we had to design a special software capable of processing them” explains Farhad Rachidi, Professor in the Electromagnetic Compatibility group of the Power systems laboratory, at EPFL.\n Another obstacle had to be overcome: the four hours’ distance separating EPFL and Säntis, as well as the restrictions governing access to this building, belonging to Swisscom. To remedy the first point, EPFL has formed a partnership with the Engineering School of the canton of Vaud (HEIG-VD), located in Yverdon-les-Bains, and the University of Bologna in order to develop, among other things, a full, remotely operated monitoring and control system. The gathering of data is completely automated, and the researchers receive an SMS every time lightning strikes.\n The devices were installed at the end of May 2010. “Since then, we have been able to record 50 lightning strikes”, enthuses Farhad Rachidi. Moreover, the results promise to be even better in future, especially as a great mystery is already puzzling the research team: “We have measured seven lightning strikes with positive polarity, whereas the majority of those hitting Switzerland are normally negative”, adds the expert.\n The research, which will be performed with the EPFL sensors, is sponsored by funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Union, Armasuisse and Montena EMC. In addition to helping us to better understand lightning, it will also serve other goals. “The accuracy of European statistics leaves much to be desired, and we could help them adjust their algorithms”, adds Carlos Romero. Moreover, an improved understanding of the electromagnetic disturbances produced by lightning will enable us to better protect electronic devices, a specialty of Farhad Rachidi’s laboratory. “We also want to understand why the movement of the blades of big wind turbines tends to attract lightning”, adds the latter, although he is sure that the sensor designed by his doctoral student will give his laboratory work for at least ten years.\nPicture: lightning on the Leman lake. © Philippe Barraud", "summary": "A scientist at EPFL has developed a sensor that he subsequently fitted in the radio-TV tower at the top of the Säntis mountain, one of the places in Europe most affected by lightning.

But his is certainly one of the most poetic ones.\nSupervised by Jeffrey Huang and Georges Abou Jaoude, the young architect wanted to propose a new interpretation to the concept of \"metabolist\" architecture, developed in Japan during the 1960s. To do so, he applied the tools of parametric architecture, his supervisors’ specialty, to the concept. In parametric architecture, a computer is given the task of determining the shapes of a building based on a set of data that it is fed.\nAdrian’s algorithm uses existing town-planning records of the city of Lausanne and its suburbs. Using mathematical formulas provided by Adrian, the computer processes these data to “single-handedly” generate peninsulas that follow the same design principles as nautilus shells, for instance.\nAn underwater subway\nAdrian then devised the different types of \"modules\" that would make up these islands. Housing, services, and crop cultures would all be integrated using these building blocks. Below the surface, a fast underwater subway would give maximum mobility to each resident. \"My project is designed for zero reliance on fossil energy. The roofs of certain buildings are equipped with mirrors that focus the sun's heat onto the top of a tower that produces all of the electricity required.\"\nNatural shapes, conceived by \"spontaneous generation\", limit the visual impact of such buildings - unlike the artificial islands built in cities such as Dubai. Adrian’s project, on display at the exhibition of architecture master’s projects, seems to get it just right and harmoniously decorates the banks of Lake Geneva. \"It would be able to accommodate up to 60,000 people though,\" calculates the architect.\nA versatile aesthete, Adrien Alberti worked very hard for his graduation dissertation.

{"id": 1735, "text": "A machine that allows highly skilled surgeons to effectively lengthen their fingers has been designed in the Robotics System Laboratory. Ricardo Beira elaborated this idea in his thesis, and subsequently created the start-up, DistalMotion, to further develop it:. The device is controlled by small joysticks which allow the operation of surgical tools fixed to the end of a metal arm. The goal? To facilitate minimally invasive operations without opening the abdominal wall.\nTwo to three bodily orifices allow for the passage of a small camera and long surgical instruments. This technique, known as endoscopy, is used more and more in urology, gynecology and visceral surgery.While this technique has many benefits, the main problem is the lack of precision in the surgeon’s movements, which is linked to the rigidity of the tools. Moreover, the surgeon must work with a mirror as, for example, a movement to the surgeon’s left results in the tool moving to the right; hence, a particularly intense training is necessary. Ricardo Beira’s system solves these problems.\nCompletely Mechanical\n The small joysticks are able to exactly replicate the surgeon’s movements,. As a result, pliers, scissors, needles and other tools move as if a practitioner was directly holding them. The research completed at the robotics laboratory has allowed for the elimination of a problem inherent to such mechanisms, the exaggeration of movements. When a small movement outside of the patient’s body is translated into a larger one inside the patient, operations become even more. delicate and painstaking. Thanks to this device, seven degrees of freedom are permitted in the reproduction of movement, including, for example, the rotation of the wrist.\nIn the era of robotics crammed with electronics, detectors and sensors, this mechanical engine developed by Ricardo Beira is quite remarkable. It should permit a considerable expansion of the variety of coelioscopic procedures, which present numerous advantages in relation to traditional surgery, notably with regard to safety, aesthetics and cost. The post-operative pain and risk of infection are lesser, the scars are smaller, and the stay at the hospital shorter.\nThe device requires craftsmanship of the highest and most detailed order, but the horizon is bright due to the numerous foreseen advantages . “The future cost of production will lie outside a common measure with the only devices capable of this much mobility in this type of operation, the DaVinci robots. These enormous devices, which equip only a few hospitals in the world, cost millions and necessitate huge spaces,”explains Ricardo Beira.\nSecond Prototype and Pre-Clinical Trials\n Pre-clinical trials at the CHUV and the Inselspital in Bern will take place this year with simulations of prostate operations.

{"id": 1738, "text": "“… the aim of teaching architecture is not simply the forming of brilliant and skillful architects, but rather that of intellectual critics endowed with a moral conscience.” Luigi Snozzi, during his inaugural lecture at EPFL in 1985.\nOne can learn to build, but to embrace a complex and autonomous discipline responsibly is another matter. Important pedagogical questions inevitably present themselves, such as how far to take the discipline, whether teaching should be approached as a dogma or as a dialogue, and how to present architecture to students who are encountering the subject for the first time. Luigi Snozzi devoted much of his professional life to these questions. He went about teaching project design by using his own work as an example. Answers can thus be searched for within his aphorisms and projects, which are exhibited here. To complete this debate, further response was found in Snozzi’s ex-students. They constitute a generation of architects who have been active in the field for ten to twenty years. Each is presenting a project in which a legacy of the years of study in Snozzi’s studio is apparent.\nThe appointment on call of Luigi Snozzi as a professor at the EPFL was certainly not calm nor usual. During its processing, the appointment was suddenly withdrawn, leading to a strong response from the student body. The students organised a demonstration and staged a sit-in in the president's office, imparting a powerful spirit of resistance. This strategy succeeded and Snozzi ended up directing a large studio there until 1997. Fifty of Snozzi’s past students display their own architectural work around that of their former professor.

{"id": 1740, "text": "What if everyone had their own medical avatar – a virtual replica of themselves featuring their own personal data – that could improve the way their health is managed and the way they are treated if they fall ill? That is the bold proposal put forward by the Health EU project, whose tagline is “Human avatars to prevent and cure diseases”. This international project, led by a consortium* headed by EPFL in collaboration with the Institute for Human Organ and Disease Model Technologies based in the Netherlands, recently applied to become a FET Flagship. FET Flagship is a prestigious multi-disciplinary research program run by the European Union that offers €1 billion in funding over ten years.\n“What we are proposing is a totally revolutionary way of handling health issues,” explains Adrian Ionescu, a professor of nanoelectronics at EPFL and one of the project’s originators. With its avatar-based system, Health EU aims to achieve improved disease prevention, early diagnosis, more accurate monitoring and customized, targeted administration of medicines and treatments, especially for increasingly common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular, chronic and neurodegenerative disorders.\n“We are offering a possible solution to problems faced by the current healthcare model, which is not economically sustainable because of the extremely high costs it entails,” adds Professor Ionescu.\nThe project’s core idea is to combine customized medicine with digital technology, using the latest technological developments such as connected objects, artificial intelligence and the concept of “digital twins”. In principle, a digital twin is a digital replica of an object that can be used to test and measure the effect of variables, processes and scenarios that would be impossible to apply in the real world. The approach is already being used in aerospace and astrophysics and in the automotive industry. However, it has not yet been applied to human beings. «Health EU’s vision combining digital and physical human avatars is taking digital twins to an unprecedented level» remarks Chris Van Hoof, senior director of Connected Health Solutions & IMEC Fellow.\nA whole range of technologies \n“Avatars are not simple digital models,” continues Professor Ionescu. “They will be developed and calibrated continuously on the basis of a large amount of customized data, collected experimentally during our day-to-day lives. Advanced models will be developed using artificial intelligence. Behind the scenes, we will create the infrastructure for the future Internet of Healthcare in order to manage the data in the form of genuine human avatars.” The Health EU project plans to develop a whole technological platform around patients and their virtual twins, capable of generating “big and deep data”. The platform will take into account and connect genomic and biological data, but also environmental and behavioral data, for example information about people’s habits and lifestyles. To collect that data, the project plans to use a whole range of leading-edge technologies: portable sensors, implants, nanomedicine techniques and medical imaging.\nIt will also use “organ-on-chip” technology – one of the project’s key features. This technology involves transferring cells onto a microchip to observe how they act and react. It will be the most physical, concrete aspect of the avatars. The method offers the possibility of testing the biological functions of an organ or interactions between several organs, but outside the human body. For example, the effect of a medicine could be measured at an early stage, avoiding side effects that can sometimes be extremely harmful, and allowing treatments to be tailored as closely as possible to the patient’s needs.\nReducing animal testing\nBetter anticipation of risks, personalized advice, more accurate medical monitoring, more suitable treatments and faster analysis: these are some of the main benefits that Health EU intends to deliver. More generally, the project aims to reduce costs and give a major boost to innovation in the medtech sector. “We shouldn’t forget that the solutions we are proposing would also replace a large proportion of testing currently carried out on animals,” stresses Albert van den Berg from the University of Twente, one of the coordinators of the Organs on Chip platform.\nHowever, there are many challenges ahead in terms of developing and refining the technologies, arranging collaborations between experts from many different disciplines and countries, and protecting the data collected from individuals. “Europe must maintain its data sovereignty,” says Patrick Boisseau, VP Healthcare at CEA Tech and Chairman of the board of the European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine. Information will be stored on servers located in Europe. We are also working on MPEG-type compression standards that will be specifically customized for the Health EU program. This secure infrastructure will become the future Internet of Healthcare, developed with the world’s leading cybersecurity experts. \"Health EU will be a kind of Netflix for genomic and sensory data! At the end of the day, however, it will always be up to patients to decide what they want doctors to see, and which doctors they want to see it”, says Adrian Ionescu.\nMore than 90 scientists from 47 leading-edge research groups at universities, institutes, clinics and companies in 16 European countries are directly involved in Health EU. Around 60 other scientists are project partners. The Health EU proposal has just been submitted to the European Union, and the final decision on whether it obtains FET Flagship status is likely to be made in early 2020.\nTo find out more about the Health EU project, visit \n* \nAs part of the Health EU project, EPFL and ETH Zurich are collaborating closely, with the involvement of more than 25 laboratories.

A recent clinical trial involving two EPFL entities – spin-off Amazentis and the Laboratory of Integrative Systems Physiology (LISP) – showed that urolithin A, a compound derived from biomolecules found in fruits such as pomegranates, could slow down this process by improving the functioning of mitochondria – the cells’ powerhouses. A joint paper presenting the results of the trial, published today in \nNature Metabolism\n, also demonstrates that ingesting the compound poses no risk to human health.\nSlowing mitochondrial aging \nThe claim that healthy eating is the key to longer life might seem too convenient – but it is now further backed by scientific evidence. Pomegranate, a fruit prized by many civilizations for its health benefits, contains ellagitannins. When ingested, these molecules are converted into a compound called urolithin A (UA) in the human gut. The researchers found that UA can slow down the mitochondrial aging process. The catch is that not everyone produces UA naturally.\nTo get around that problem, and to make sure all participants received an equal dose, the team synthesized the compound. Some 60 elderly people, all sedentary yet in good health, took a single dose of between 250 and 2,000 mg of UA. The researchers observed no side effects when compared with the control group, who were given a placebo. The participants were then split into four groups, each receiving a placebo, or a 250, 500 or 1,000 mg daily dose of UA for 28 days. Again, no adverse health impacts were found, even after prolonged ingestion. The team then assessed the efficacy of UA by looking at cellular and mitochondrial health biomarkers in the participants’ blood and muscle tissue. The results were compelling: UA stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis – the process by which cells increase mitochondrial mass – in the same way as regular exercise.\nUA is the only known compound that re-establishes cells’ ability to recycle defective mitochondria. In young people, this process happens naturally. But as we age, our body starts to lose its power to clean up dysfunctional mitochondria, causing sarcopenia (loss of skeletal muscle mass) and the weakening of other tissues. The team focused on slowing, or even reversing, this natural effect of aging.\nThe paper, published today, also confirms that the compound is safe to eat. Amazentis, based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, hopes to harness the promising results to quickly bring the product to market. “These latest findings, which build on previous preclinical trials, really crystallize how UA could be a game-changer for human health,” says Johan Auwerx, a professor at LISP, the EPFL lab involved in the trial. An article published in 2016 showed that the lifespan of nematode worms exposed to UA increased by 45% – from around 20 to 30 days – when compared with the control group. Likewise, older mice showed 40% better endurance while running after two weeks of treatment. The compound may thus have even more secrets to reveal about its benefits for human health.", "summary": "Urolithin A, a metabolite of biomolecules found in pomegranates and other fruits, could help slow certain aging processes.

{"id": 1743, "text": "It’s time to rethink our conception of robots. No longer the clunky machines of past, today a whole new breed of soft robots is emerging thanks to research being carried out at Paik’s . Paik – a spirited engineer with unfailing energy – is developing folding robots that could assist us not only with everyday tasks, but also with difficult physical maneuvers if placed on our arms and legs. Her soft, flexible and versatile devices are light years away from the machines we see on production lines and in science-fiction movies.\n“The rigid, powerful robots used in manufacturing are perfect for the preprogrammed environments of production plants – such as to make smartphones or computers,” says Paik. “But if we want devices that can assist us in our everyday lives, they need to be flexible, responsive to change and able to interact with us safely.” For instance, such robots could be used at home for doing the chores, or they could be integrated into our clothing.\nTechnology that moves with us\nPaik’s futuristic vision and insightful work have attracted the attention of  organizers. “One of the organizers attended a talk I gave and then invited me to speak at TED2019, whose topic is ‘Bigger than us.’ I didn’t think twice before accepting – it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!” says Paik.\nThis year’s TED conference will take a critical look at the technologies that are changing the world. Former TED speakers include Nobel prize winners and such prominent figures as Steve Jobs and Michelle Obama.\nIn her talk, Paik will outline her vision of a world where robots are as commonplace as smartphones. “The difference is that the new technology won’t be passive. It will move with us, but we won’t even notice it’s there. The robots will seem invisible,” she says.\nLarge-scale robot production\nSo what will these robots actually look like? Paik’s team of researchers is developing a couple of types. The first are robogamis, or folding robots inspired by origami. Equipped with several joints and actuators, they are initially flat, like a credit card, but can be folded into a variety of 3D shapes. Some robogamis, called tribots, can communicate with each other and move by jumping or climbing. And because robogamis can be manufactured in 2D, large-scale production is possible. “These robots have so many joints that even though their individual components may be rigid, they can bend in myriad ways and are completely flexible, like a mesh of yarn,” says Paik.\nPaik’s team is also developing “rubber” robots of all shapes and sizes that move using pneumatic actuators. They can mimic human muscles and be connected together to move objects or climb walls. “If we integrate the actuators into clothing, they can receive tactile signals and transmit those signals to a motion device. The system could thus help patients during physical therapy, for example,” says Paik.\nIn the future, Paik’s robots could handle repetitive, mundane tasks related to housework or gardening – but their potential doesn’t stop there. She is working with the European Space Agency and the Swiss Space Center to study applications for her soft robots in space. “Astronauts often end up wasting time on routine tasks. And since every gram counts when you’re sending a vessel up in space, these soft robots could be an interesting alternative,” she says.\nA talk for her grandmother \nAt her  talk in Vancouver, Paik will present a miniature haptic joystick that provides realistic tactile feedback – a promising technological development for virtual reality applications. The joystick, made of carbon fiber, is also inspired by origami and can be folded up when not in use to become just as flat as a piece of cardboard. The joystick is being marketed by a spin-off of her EPFL lab, .\nHowever, preparing for the TED talk is no child’s game. “I’m practicing with a coach who is helping me choose each word carefully. It’s a lot of stress, but it’s also highly stimulating,” she says. And speaking in Vancouver has special meaning for the Canadian-born engineer. “My grandmother, who is 94, lives in Vancouver and will come hear me speak. It’ll be the first time she will see me working. She’s always been my biggest supporter,” says Paik. “She used to say to me: there is nothing boys can do that girls cannot do. And you can do better than anybody. I hope she was right as always.”\nMore videos: \nBio\n Paik was born in Canada and grew up in Seoul, Tokyo and Vancouver. Her father is a scientist and her mother is a painter. After obtaining Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in engineering from the University of British Columbia, she went on to earn a PhD at Seoul National University. She conducted her PhD research in association with Samsung Electronics, designing the mechanical arm of a humanoid robot that weighed just 3.7 kg – a record at the time. She then completed a post-doc at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, where she developed a simple, intuitive device for endoscopic surgery, called JAiMY. The device assists surgeons with suturing during laparoscopies and was launched on the market in 2011. Paik completed a second post-doc at the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory where she became familiar with soft robotics.

{"id": 1749, "text": "Will artificial intelligence (AI) change the nature of work? For EPFL theoretical biologist Marcel Salathé, the answer is invariably yes. To him, a more fundamental question that needs to be addressed is \nwho owns that artificial intelligence\n?\n“We have to hold AI accountable, and the only way to do this is to verify it for biases and make sure there is no deliberate misinformation,” says Salathé. “This is not possible if the AI is privatized.”\nAI is both the algorithm and the data\nSo what exactly is AI? It is generally regarded as “intelligence exhibited by machines”. Today, it is highly task specific, specially designed to beat humans at strategic games like Chess and Go, or diagnose skin disease on par with doctors’ skills. \nOn a practical level, AI is implemented through what scientists call “machine learning”, which means using a computer to run specifically designed software that can be “trained”, i.e. process data with the help of algorithms and to correctly identify certain features from that data set. Like human cognition, AI learns by trial and error. Unlike humans, however, AI can process and recall large quantities of data, giving it a tremendous advantage over us.\nCrucial to AI learning, therefore, is the underlying data. For Salathé, AI is defined by both the algorithm and the data, and as such, both should be publicly available.\nDeep learning algorithms can be perturbed\nLast year, Salathé created an algorithm to recognize plant diseases. With more than 50,000 photos of healthy and diseased plants in the database, the algorithm uses artificial intelligence to diagnose plant diseases with the help of your smartphone. As for human disease, a recent study by a Stanford Group on cancer showed that AI can be trained to recognize skin cancer slightly better than a group of doctors. The consequences are far-reaching: AI may one day diagnose our diseases instead of doctors. If so, will we really be able to trust its diagnosis?\nThese diagnostic tools use data sets of images to train and learn. But visual data sets can be perturbed that prevent deep learning algorithms from correctly classifying images. Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to visual perturbations that are practically impossible to detect with the naked eye, yet causing the AI to misclassify images.\nIn future implementations of AI-assisted medical diagnostic tools, these perturbations pose a serious threat. More generally, the perturbations are real and may already be affecting the filtered information that reaches us every day. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of certifying AI technology and monitoring its reliability.", "summary": "In the quest for reliable artificial intelligence, EPFL scientist Marcel Salathé argues that AI technology should be openly available.

In just a single year, that amounts to 418 zettabytes – or 418 billion one-terabyte hard drives.\nWe currently store data as 1s and 0s in magnetic or optical systems that don’t last a century. Meanwhile, data centers consume massive amounts of energy and produce enormous carbon footprints. Simply put, the way we store our ever-growing volume of data is unsustainable.\nDNA as data storage\nBut there is an alternative: storing data in biological molecules such as DNA. In nature, DNA encodes, stores, and makes readable massive amounts of genetic information in tiny spaces (cells, bacteria, viruses) – and does so with a high degree of safety and reproducibility.\nCompared to conventional data-storage devices, DNA is more enduring and compacted, can retain ten times more data, has a million-fold higher storage density, and consumes 100 million times less energy to store the same amount of data as a drive. Also, a DNA-based data-storage device would be tiny: a year’s worth of global data can be stored in just four grams of DNA.\nBut storing data with DNA also involves exorbitant costs, painfully slow writing and reading mechanisms, and is susceptible to mis-readings.\nNanopores to the rescue\nA way is to use nano-sized holes called nanopores, which bacteria often punch into other cells to destroy them. The attacking bacteria use specialized proteins known as “pore-forming toxins” which latch onto the cell’s membrane and form a tube-like channel through it.\nIn bioengineering, nanopores are used for “sensing” biomolecules, such as DNA or RNA. The molecule passes through the nanopore like a string, steered by voltage, and its different components produce distinct electrical signals (an “ionic signature”) that can be used to identify them. And because of their high accuracy, nanopores have also been tried out for reading DNA-encoded information.\nNonetheless, nanopores are still limited by low-resolution readouts – a real problem if nanopore systems are ever to be used for storing and reading data.\nAerolysin nanopores \nThe potential of nanopores inspired scientists at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences to explore nanopores produced by the pore-forming toxin aerolysin, made by the bacterium \nAeromonas\nhydrophila\n. Led by Matteo Dal Peraro at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences, the researchers show that aerolysin nanopores can be used for decoding binary information.\nIn 2019, Dal Peraro’s lab  that nanopores can be used for sensing more complex molecules, like proteins. In this study, published in \nScience Advances\n, the team joined force with the lab of Alexandra Radenovic (EPFL School of Engineering) and adapted aerolysin to detect molecules tailored-made precisely to be read by this pore. The technology has been filed as a patent.\nThe molecules, known as “digital polymers”, were developed in the lab of Jean-François Lutz at the Institut Charles Sadron of the CNRS in Strasbourg. They are a combination of DNA nucleotides and non-biological monomers designed to pass through aerolysin nanopores and give out an electrical signal that could be read out as a “bit”.\nThe researchers used aerolysin mutants to systematically design nanopores for reading out signals of their informational polymers. They optimized the speed of the polymers passing through the nanopore so that it can give out a uniquely identifiable signal. \"But unlike conventional nanopore readouts, this signal delivered digital reading with single-bit resolution, and without compromising information density,\" says Dr Chan Cao, the first author of the paper.\nTo decode the readout signals the team used deep learning, which allowed them to decode up to 4 bits of information from the polymers with high accuracy. They also used the approach to blindly identify mixtures of polymers and determine their relative concentration.\nThe system is considerably cheaper than using DNA for data-storage, and offers longer endurance. In addition, it is “miniaturizable”, meaning that it could easily be incorporated into portable data-storage devices.\n“There are several improvements we are working on to transform this bio-inspired platform into an actual product for data storage and retrieval,” says Matteo Dal Peraro. “But this work clearly shows that a biological nanopore can read hybrid DNA-polymer analytes. We are excited as this opens up new promising perspectives for polymer-based memories, with important advantages for ultrahigh density, long-term storage and device portability.”\nOther contributors\nUniversity of Strasbourg", "summary": "Bioengineers at EPFL have developed a nanopore-based system that can read data encoded into synthetic macromolecules with higher accuracy and resolution than similar methods on the market.

{"id": 1762, "text": "Getting useful feedback from users is often a complex undertaking, especially when it comes to public transport. Social media may have given people a forum, but their comments are often too fragmented, infrequent or heated to have any practical value. EPFL researchers have now come up with an app that public transport authorities can use to survey passengers in real time through a series of interactive questions. Month-long tests of the new app – called Urban Mobility by Me, or  – will begin today in partnership with Transports Lausannois (tl), the Lausanne region’s public transport authority.\n“The advantage of real-time surveys is that we can get an instantaneous snapshot of the user and ask the right question at the right time,” says Fernando Simas, a researcher in EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory. This app makes it possible to reach a larger number of people at a lower cost, as the researchers have successfully applied new digital tools to survey methodology.\nQualitative data\nUsers have to download the app on their smartphone and then create a profile. The app automatically detects the phone’s geolocation data, which is not used until all personal information has been removed. When they are on the metro, the users receive two sets of four questions – one set at the start of their trip and one at the end – in the form of notifications. The questions are grouped by topic, including comfort, the weather, customer service, safety, payment, accessibility and how they passed the time on the metro. For example, UrbyMe will ask “What’s the weather like?” and will offer several responses in the form of icons. “Are you seated?” If so: “Are you comfortable?” If not: “Why not?” And the users can choose from a list of answers.\n“For transport operators, knowing where the user gets on and off the metro is essential, since that information can help them fine-tune their services,” says Dominic Villeneuve, the project’s co-designer. This innovative approach caught the attention of the Lausanne transport authority, which commissions an independent entity to run surveys for it on a regular basis.\nUrbyMe’s strength lies in its ability to gauge the user’s experience in qualitative terms as well. “We developed the questions together with the transport authority, to ensure we covered the main points of interest for them,” says Villeneuve. The tests, on the m1 and m2 metro lines, will start on 22 October following the fall break for local schools. They will last a month, during which participants will receive notifications when they take the metro, but no more than once every 30 hours. They hope that around 1,000 people will agree to participate.\nSurvey results for all to see\nUnlike most data that people generate, the information provided to UrbyMe has a specific purpose. The users know exactly who will receive the data, what will be done with it and how and why it is being collected. “This gives users an opportunity to share their opinion and be heard. They will also get feedback in return: the results of the satisfaction survey will also be published on a website,” says Simas.\nIf this round of tests is successful, Simas and Villeneuve plan to start a company to market their app. “UrbyMe could measure the user experience in other fields besides transports – such as at stores, at the airport or for service providers.” Eventually, the two researchers hope to provide a new methodology for origin-destination surveys.\nThe project has recieved a financial support from , a program of ENAC Faculty.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a smartphone app for passengers to evaluate their experience in real time and view other users’ ratings.

The findings should help policymakers be better prepared in the event of new pandemic outbreaks.\n • \n“Save the City:” A game to encourage social distancing.\n Tom de Geus, Mario Geiger, Leonardo Petrini and (SB). Save the City will be an interactive game in which players are faced with the challenge of managing the coronavirus outbreak. They will be asked to choose among different degrees of confinement measures, for example. Through this game, players will realize that the actions of individuals matter crucially.\n • \nCOVID-19 collaborative research on housing wellbeing: Initiating a Swiss Corona Citizen Science Research Team.\n,  and  (ENAC). In this study, citizens will be asked to participate in a survey. The aim is to come up with coping strategies for the new living and working conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak and to improve the understanding of how such crises can be better managed in the future.\nAn app that can tell if you’ve come into contact with the virus\nThe PEPP-PT – or \nPan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing\n– initiative brings together 130 research organizations in eight different countries to develop a tracking app for smartphones.

Students met at the site for a week in early February for the Youth for Reuse workshop, which was organized by Archizoom and EPFL-EAST. They came up with ideas on the potential reuse of the building’s materials for the new construction, as well as for the Olympic village that will be built for the 2020 Youth Olympic Games to be held in Lausanne. “Sustainable development and young people are very important to the IOC. This is why we are working with EPFL and bringing students into the search for solutions,” said Paula Navajas Ergüín, project manager in charge of sustainable development at the IOC.\n Twenty-two students visited the site and examined the old structure from top to bottom before getting to work. “Being able to touch and measure the materials directly is very useful, and it’s a great opportunity to get involved in the future of a building with such international influence,” said Marie Benaboud, a second-year Master’s student. She chose to use parts from the stairways to make a sculpture. Basile Diem is putting together a wooden model representing the posts on the outside of the building. \"These parts are iconic, they're the first thing you see when you look at the building. My idea is to reuse them to make spectator stands or streetlights, in order to have both artistic and functional elements for the 2020 games and for Lausanne,” said the third-year Bachelor’s student. \n According to the students’ instructors, this behind-the-scenes workshop was 'essential' for the students’ education, as it allowed them to assess new strategies of sustainable development in architecture. “By experimenting on a single building, we were able to approach the task very concretely, although, given time limitations, the students were not always able to see their ideas through,” said Professor Martin Fröhlich. “But the main thing was to come up with ideas.” Another objective of this workshop was to raise public awareness of our ecological footprint. “We want to get people talking about reusing and recycling materials and encourage them to come up with creative solutions combining art and function: two areas that do not normally intersect,” said Valentino Vittaca, from EPFL’s Laboratory of Elementary Architecture and Studies of Types.\nThe results of the workshop, including examples of materials, models and photos, will soon be put on display at EPFL.", "summary": "EPFL students have come up with ideas on reusing materials from the old IOC headquarters.

Miz is the lead author on  about the new algorithm, which was recently presented at  2019 in San Francisco, California, USA.\nCo-author , a former LTS2 researcher and EPFL data visualization lecturer now working as a data artist, added that what made Wikipedia so appealing as a data source was its accessibility and size.\n“Wikipedia has some 5 billion visits per year for English alone. With this technique, we can identify groups of pages that belong together,” he said.\nFrom collective memory to fake news\nThe researchers’ algorithm is unique because it can not only identify such anomalous events, but also provide insights into exactly where, how, and why they happened.\n“The core difference is that we provide more context due to the network structure. For example, if we look at Wikipedia pages about the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, we can see that the page about the attack is directly connected to the page about Charlie Hebdo magazine, and also to a cluster of pages representing terrorist organizations,” Miz explains.\nBenzi and Miz call this kind of information-seeking “collective memory”, as it can reveal how current events trigger memories of the past.\n“The Wikipedia research is about trying to explore new findings about human nature itself. Wikipedia is a very interesting dataset because it reflects more or less what we as humanity decide to remember. Collectively, we have the same train of thought and browse the same topics,” Benzi says.\nSo, what topics do people most care about, according to this research? In short: other people.\n“Some 80% of visits are for entertainment or celebrities. In past research, we've found that 40% of all links that are clicked are about people and their relationships,” Benzi says, adding that fewer than 1% of visits are for topics related to science.\nThe LTS2 is currently collaborating with developers of the free offline web browser , which aims to bring compressed versions of Wikipedia to those without free access to the internet.\n“Our method could be very helpful to Kiwix to help identify and compress only relevant portions of Wikipedia, based on language and culture, for example,” Miz says.\nOther applications of the algorithm could include studying the spread of fake news on Twitter by monitoring spikes in retweets, or understanding links between email network dynamics and real-world events. However, these topics are more challenging to study than Wikipedia due to smaller amounts of freely available data.\nCase study: Game of Thrones\nMiz, Benzi and their colleagues  to detect anomalous activity on Wikipedia pages related to the final season of the HBO hit show Game of Thrones as an example. The resulting open dataset allowed them to create  of pages relating to different aspects of the show, including actors, characters, seasons, episodes, and other topics.\nThe researchers were also able to use the method to determine character popularity based on the number of visits to their Wikipedia pages over time, and are currently trying to see which other pages were activated by the death of a particular character on the show.

However, current fabrication methods limit their ability to produce free-form shapes and achieve high cell viability.\nResearchers at the , in EPFL’s School of Engineering, working with colleagues from Utrecht University, have come up with an optical technique that takes just a few seconds to sculpt complex tissue shapes in a biocompatible hydrogel containing stem cells. The resulting tissue can then be vascularized by adding endothelial cells.\nThe team describes this high-resolution printing method in an article appearing in \nAdvanced Materials\n. The technique will change the way cellular engineering specialists work, allowing them to create a new breed of personalized, functional bioprinted organs.\nPrinting a femur or a meniscus\nThe technique is called volumetric bioprinting. To create tissue, the researchers project a laser down a spinning tube filled with a stem-cell-laden hydrogel. They shape the tissue by focusing the energy from the light at specific locations, which then solidify. After just a few seconds, a complex 3D shape appears, suspended in the gel. The stem cells in the hydrogel are largely unaffected by this process. The researchers then introduce endothelial cells to vascularize the tissue.\nThe researchers have shown that it’s possible to create a tissue construct measuring several centimeters, which is a clinically useful size. Examples of their work include a valve similar to a heart valve, a meniscus and a complex-shaped part of the femur. They were also able to build interlocking structures.\n“Unlike conventional bioprinting – a slow, layer-by-layer process – our technique is fast and offers greater design freedom without jeopardizing the cells' viability,” says Damien Loterie, an LAPD researcher and one of the study’s coauthors.\nReplicating the human body\nThe researchers' work is a real game changer. “The characteristics of human tissue depend to a large extent on a highly sophisticated extracellular structure, and the ability to replicate this complexity could lead to a number of real clinical applications,” says Paul Delrot, another coauthor. Using this technique, labs could mass-produce artificial tissues or organs at unprecedented speed. This sort of replicability is essential when it comes to testing new drugs \nin vitro\n, and it could help obviate the need for animal testing – a clear ethical advantage as well as a way of reducing costs.\n“This is just the beginning.

{"id": 1774, "text": "The key to utilizing stem cells for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering lies in a property of theirs called pluripotency. This refers to the cells’ ability to differentiate into different types of cells. This means that we need to be able to reliably obtain, culture and maintain fully pluripotent stem cells. It has been difficult to generate human embryonic stem cells at the earliest stage of pluripotency, in what is named “ground” or “naïve” state, whereas this is readily done with mouse cells. The labs of , , and  have now developed a four-step process for determining accurate signatures of human embryonic stem cells and relating them to precise developmental stages. The work, a first for human embryonic stem cells, is .\nThe first criterion involves a rigorous assay to see how much the naïve stem cells contribute to a mouse-human embryo. If the resulting organism (a so-called “chimera”) contains any human DNA, it signals successful engraftment of the stem cells.\nThe second criterion looks at the expression profile of 4.5 million RNA biomarkers called “transposable elements”, which are genetic units that can move around the genome – in fact, they make up half of the human genome. Because they can cause dangerous mutations by inserting themselves inside genes, transposable elements are actually suppressed in the early developmental stages of the embryo. However, transposable elements also regulate gene expression, and are essential in maintaining the organism’s homeostasis. The researchers demonstrated that profiling which transposable elements are active in the stem cells is an extremely sensitive and highly reproducible indicator of their pluripotency stage.\nThe third criterion focuses on DNA methylation state of the cells, which is lower in the naïve compared to the primed state. Finally, the fourth criterion is the epigenetic state of the X chromosome in female naïve cells, which resembles that found in the human pre-implantation embryo.\nThe study provides a roadmap for broadly evaluating stage, state and quality of human pluripotent cells, and can overcome current limitations with using such cells in research and clinical applications. Based on this work, the researchers have developed a startup project named . The company’s mission is to streamline the experimental work of the second criterion, which involves the transcriptional profiling of transposable elements to generate human cell markers for broad research and clinical applications.\nThis work involved a collaboration between EPFL’s School of Life Sciences, MIT’s Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (Cambridge, MA), and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (La Jolla, CA).

{"id": 1777, "text": "In Switzerland, 50–60% of new homes are equipped with heat pumps. These systems draw in thermal energy from the surrounding environment – such as from the ground, air, or a nearby lake or river – and turn it into heat for buildings.\nWhile today’s heat pumps generally work well and are environmentally friendly, they still have substantial room for improvement. For example, by using microturbocompressors instead of conventional compression systems, engineers can reduce heat pumps’ power requirement by 20–25% (see inset) as well as their impact on the environment. That’s because turbocompressors are more efficient and ten times smaller than piston devices. But incorporating these mini components into heat pumps’ designs is not easy; complications arise from their tiny diameters (<20 mm) and fast rotation speeds (>200,000 rpm).\nAt EPFL’s Laboratory for Applied Mechanical Design on the Microcity campus, a team of researchers led by Jürg Schiffmann has developed a method that makes it easier and faster to add turbocompressors to heat pumps. Using a machine-learning process called symbolic regression, the researchers came up with simple equations for quickly calculating the optimal dimensions of a turbocompressor for a given heat pump. Their research just won the Best Paper Award at the 2019 Turbo Expo Conference held by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n1,500 times faster \n The researchers’ method drastically simplifies the first step in designing turbochargers. This step – which involves roughly calculating the ideal size and rotation speed for the desired heat pump – is extremely important because a good initial estimate can considerably shorten the overall design time. Until now, engineers have been using design charts to size their turbocompressors – but these charts become increasingly inaccurate the smaller the equipment. And the charts have not kept up to date with the latest technology.\nThat’s why two EPFL PhD students – Violette Mounier and Cyril Picard – worked on developing an alternative. They fed the results of 500,000 simulations into machine-learning algorithms and generated equations that replicate the charts but with several advantages: they are reliable even at small turbocompressor sizes; they are just as detailed as more complicated simulations; and they are 1,500 times faster. The researchers’ method also lets engineers skip some of the steps in conventional design processes. It paves the way to easier implementation and more widespread use of microturbochargers in heat pumps.\nThe benefits of microturbocompressors\n Conventional heat pumps use pistons to compress a fluid, called a refrigerant, and drive a vapor-compression cycle. The pistons need to be well-oiled to function properly, but the oil can stick to the heat exchanger walls and impairs the heat transfer process. However, microturbocompressors – which have diameters of just a few dozen millimeters – can run without oil; they rotate on gas bearings at speeds of hundreds of thousands of rpm. The rotating movement and gas layers between the components mean there is almost no friction. As a result, these miniature systems can boost heat pumps’ heat transfer coefficients by 20–30%.\n This microturbocharger technology has been in development for several years and is now mature. “We have already been contacted by several companies that are interested in using our method,” says Schiffmann. Thanks to the researchers’ work, companies will have an easier time incorporating the microturbocharger technology into their heat pumps.\nPaper related to this research in", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a method that uses artificial intelligence to design next-generation heat-pump compressors.

It will culminate in an exhibition, the “Neuronal Ancestral Sculptures Series”, at ArtLab next summer.\nWhen she’s not at the EM+ lab in St Sulpice, Al-Badri lives and works in Berlin. She holds a degree political science from Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main, and her groundbreaking work has been featured by The New York Times, the BBC, Wired, The Financial Times, The Boston Globe, Gizmodo, and New Scientist, among many others.\nEPFL: Can you describe your background as an artist?\nNora Al-Badri:\n I am a multidisciplinary artist, and for many years, my medium has been technology – from robotics to 3D data and AI-based software.\nI am also a trained political scientist, and everything I create is based on deconstructing power structures as we know them, and using the emancipatory potential of technology. I like to quote Frantz Fanon when introducing my artistic practice: “Struggles for decolonization are first and foremost about self-ownership. They are struggles to repossess, to take back – if necessary, by force – that which is ours unconditionally and, as such, belongs to us.”\nFor example, one of my pieces, done in collaboration with , is known as the “”. We clandestinely scanned the bust of Nefertiti in Berlin’s Neues Museum, and then exhibited and buried a 3D print of the bust, as a form of techno-heritage, in Egypt.\nEPFL: What motivates you as an artist?\nNAB:\n I use and see the emancipatory and subversive potential of technology. I believe that questions of representation ethics and bias need to be negotiated in the arts and digital humanities. I also believe that this should happen not only within the academy or museum, because these are places of privilege, which are unfortunately inaccessible to most people.\nVirality and the internet are another public sphere where the discourse needs to happen. This also has limitations, because almost half the world is still not online. But as an artist, I can reach out to the world, and support a re-centering of knowledge towards the Global South.\nEPFL: Tell us more about this Neuronal Ancestral Sculptures Series\nNAB:\n My research in the EM+ lab expands on AI and museum practices as a form of techno-heritage, and as a decolonial practice. The Neuronal Ancestral Sculptures Series focuses on Iraq and its archaeological artifacts. I am interested in reflecting on the moment of image creation as a mimetic practice by applying GANs (generative adversarial networks) to images of these artifacts.\nGANs are a new and exciting technology, more widely known as “deepfakes“; images can be photorealistic, yet they are not photos, because each one is made up by the neural network. This confronts us with questions of originality and authenticity, and invites us to explore the neural net itself as an artistic tool.\nFurthermore, the generated images are potentially transcendental: in the Islamic discourse, geometry for example has its own spiritual agency, without any semiotic structure, and is based on mixed elements from math and art. It is not intended to be decorative, but rather mimetically and spiritually referring to infinity, and this is what we are exploring through diverse datasets of Mesopotamian artifacts.\nTo me, the AI-driven emergence of new images based on past or ancestral ones could also lead to new narratives in contemporary Iraq, where one is confronted with human and cultural losses every day. With this project, I want to contribute to a future in that region that is characterized by creation rather than destruction.\nEPFL: Do you plan to collaborate with other labs at EPFL?\nNAB:\n I am in conversation and exchange with other labs at the campus, including the Visual Representation Lab (), Signal Processing Lab (), and the Machine Learning and Optimization Lab (). Researchers at  are also looking at themes of social justice, decoloniality and representation, so I will engage with them in a fruitful discussion on the role of the Global South, as well as representation and bias in machine learning.\nI am finding it really exciting to be able to navigate the university as an artist, to be welcomed everywhere and to meet great researchers at every corner.

The SwissTech Convention Center is a world-class tool for the exchange of knowledge through which our school can make critical contributions to solving major societal challenges,” explains André Schneider, Vice President of Planning and Logistics at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. He wants the new EPFL Convention Center to be far more than simply one of the most modern in the world. “As one of the few convention centers in Europe to be established on a university campus, it will also serve as smart conferencing lab – a place to experiment with the most innovative technologies for improving the flow of ideas in scientific conferences and making these exchanges more fruitful.”\nThe SwissTech Convention Center (STCC), inaugurated today, already offers delegates the very best in technical equipment. It is characterized in particular by extreme modularity. Its large auditorium can be automatically transformed, at will, from a 3,000-seat amphitheater to a banquet hall of more than 1800 square meters, thanks to the Canadian technology, “Gala Systems,” which ensures the metamorphosis in about 15 minutes. Multiple intermediate configurations offer event organizers unsurpassed flexibility. The ground floor offers the possibility of countless workroom configurations across an area of nearly 1500 square meters.\nAs evidence that it meets a clear demand not only from scientists but also many businesses, as well as local and international institutions, the Center is already almost completely booked through its first year of operation. “The interest of the business world is also of prime importance to us, because that will lead to greater technology transfer,” says André Schneider.\nNovel equipment and architecture\nIn addition to multimedia art facilities in each of its rooms, STCC is also equipped with smart displays whose content automatically adapts depending on location. These same screens can communicate with the mobile phones of participants in events, for example, by sending them papers for discussion.\nDesigned by Richter Dahl Rocha & Associés of Lausanne, STCC also uses several pioneering technologies. It is based primarily on posts, some of which operate simultaneously as geothermal heat pumps. Packed with sensors, they are developing this technology to save large amounts of energy. One of its facades is also covered with 300 square meters of transparent and colored photovoltaic solar collectors, which are based on the principle developed by EPFL professor Michael Grätzel. Financed entirely by Romande Energie, this innovative solar installation is a world first for a public building and a new realization in the partnership between EPFL and Romande Energie to develop a large-scale solar power plant and conduct research and development. The chromatic organization of the panels is the work of artist Catherine Bolle of Lausanne.\nAn innovative financing model\nThe financing of STCC is also pioneering. As part of a public-private partnership, two real estate funds, Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund LivingPlus (CS REF LivingPlus) and Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund Hospitality (CS REF Hospitality) assumed the entirety of the business contract – to the tune of 225 million Swiss francs. This amount also includes the construction of the Northern Quarter, a complex which brings together businesses, services, 516 student dorm rooms and the SwissTech Hotel, which adds to the Starling Hotel to complete the accommodations on offer in the campus’ immediate vicinity. EPFL is the sole tenant of the buildings, constructed on a plot that belongs to the Swiss Confederation with surface rights granted for a period of 99 years.

{"id": 1783, "text": "A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is the appearance of plaques in the brain. The plaques are gradually made up by the aggregation of a small protein called amyloid-beta or “Abeta”. Alzheimer’s is usually diagnosed late, when the plaques have developed and are already causing cognitive damage like memory loss. In a large study led by EPFL, an international team of scientists from Harvard, Edinburgh and Ulm, have now found a way to detect Abeta aggregation in its early stages, which will make diagnosing and treating the disease much more effective. The study is .\nAlzheimer’s – and a number of other diseases – begins when Abeta proteins begin to aggregate, or clump together, in the brain and form larger structures called oligomers (“oligo” = few). The oligomers themselves then clump together to form the even larger amyloid plaques. The problem is that the molecular mechanisms that lead single Abeta to clump into oligomers early on are not well studied, and even the exact structure of the oligomers is a matter of debate among scientists.\n, have now led an international team of scientists from Harvard, Edinburgh and Ulm in one of the most extensive analysis of Abeta peptides. The project aimed to understand what happens during aggregation, and particularly at its early stages.\nUsing different analysis techniques (e.g. mass spectrometry), the researchers identified specific points on Abeta where it undergoes a process called “autocleavage”. Normally, Abeta is cut by specialized enzymes as part of the cell’s cleaning process. But, in this case, Abeta simply breaks at very specific points along its structure without any enzymes being involved.\nThe researchers found that Abeta autocleavage happens during the early stages of aggregation. The process generates truncated Abeta fragments, which can then form complexes with normal, unbroken Abeta molecules. This produces the neurotoxic oligomers that are thought to cause the early cognitive problems of Alzheimer’s.\nIn addition, the scientists found that autocleavage of Abeta also produces a pattern or “fragment signature” that is highly reproducible, meaning that it can be used to detect Abeta aggregation early on.\nThe research team also screened mice that are used as standard models of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as human post-mortem brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. The investigation showed that the process of autocleavage, (as a result of Abeta aggregation), is a highly relevant clinical feature of Alzheimer’s.\nFinally, the researchers also found that the truncated peptides can be used to develop antibodies that can identify and bind them. This would enable doctors to monitor the accumulation of truncated Abeta fragments in diagnostic tools, and even target them for clearing by the patient’s immune system.\n“The study reveals novel Abeta targets associated with the early events of oligomerization,” says Adrian Schmid at EPFL’s Protein Core Facility and senior author of the paper. “This may help define the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s, and determine the factors that predict the emergence of clinical impairment and progression to severe dementia.”\nThe findings take our knowledge about Abeta aggregation to a new level and have important implications in Alzheimer’s diagnosis and future therapies. “Preclinical biomarkers of dementia can help identify individuals who may benefit from early therapeutic intervention,” says Schmid. “It can therefore improve the patient’s overall quality of life while reducing the costs associated with long-term medical care.”\nThis project was conceived and developed at the EPFL’s Proteomics Core Facility (PCF) and involved a collaboration between the EPFL’s Interdisciplinary Centre for Electron Microscopy (CIME), the Department of Neurology at Ulm University Hospital (Germany), the Centre for Dementia Prevention at Edinburgh University (Scotland), and Harvard Medical School (Mass General Hospital, Boston, USA). \nIt was funded by EPFL and its Tech Transfer Office and the Biomedizin-Naturwissenschaft-Forschung project of the University of Bern.\nReference\nRudinskiy N, Fuerer C, Demurtas D, Zamorano S, De Piano C, Herrmann A, Spires-Jones TL, Oeckl P, Otto M, Frosch MP, Moniatte M, Hyman BT, Schmid AW. \nAβ oligomerization is associated with the generation of a typical peptide fragment fingerprint. \nAlzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association \n07 May 2016.

Today, major concerts are held in the Auditorium Stravinsky, a beautiful hall. However, some believe its acoustics are better suited to classical music.\nDuring the 2014 edition, which has just begun, Montreux Jazz Festival visitors can be part of an extraordinary experience. An installation consisting of a screen and several speakers will allow them to get back into the soundscape and visual environment of the festival’s early years. Codename: , for \"Immersive Archives of the Montreux Jazz\". \nThe creator behind this sensory journey is a post-doctoral researcher at EPFL’s Audiovisual Communications Laboratory: Dirk Schröder. He patiently rebuilt the old concert hall virtually. \"We only had a part of the architectural plans. We reconstructed the rest based on photographs and videos taken during the early years of the festival as well as testimonies,\" he said.\nThis authentic Benedictine endeavor led to the creation of a 3D model of the venue which also incorporates materials, furniture and even spectators. \"I used a piece of software developed as part of my thesis that can recreate soundscapes by taking all parameters into account: size and shape of the room, speakers and visitors’ distributions, etc… \".\nTo transform this reconstruction into a real experience for the spectators, Dirk Schröder used the festival’s archives, held at EPFL, to conduct a \"live simulation\". Nine spectators are placed in a small room, surrounded by 16 speakers and two subwoofers broadcasting 17 different music tracks and are invited to listen to a hit straight out of the seventies: \nGive me the night\n by George Benson. There is also a \"bonus\" track, a more modern surprise. They listen to the music as they could have at the old Casino. On the screen, the camera moves from the back of the room to the front of the stage, leading the audience with it. The sound participants could hear is based on recordings made last year in Montreux and corresponds exactly to their virtual position in the disappeared hall.\nThe software developed by Dirk Schröder is characterized by its ease of use. Moreover, it works in real time and seamlessly integrates with standard software tools for architects who, for the first time, will be able to carry out the acoustical planning of their works. Its creator is in the process of developing a start-up and already imagines many applications, for example the generation of specific soundscapes for cinema, virtual and augmented reality and music production.

{"id": 1790, "text": "An especially counter-intuitive feature of quantum mechanics is that a single event can exist in a state of superposition – happening \nboth here and there\n, or \nboth today and tomorrow\n.\nSuch superpositions are hard to create, as they are destroyed if any kind of information about the place and time of the event leaks into the surrounding – and even if nobody actually records this information. But when superpositions do occur, they lead to observations that are very different from that of classical physics, questioning down to our very understanding of space and time.\nScientists from EPFL, MIT, and CEA Saclay, publishing in \nScience Advances\n, demonstrate a state of vibration that exists simultaneously at two different times, and evidence this quantum superposition by measuring the strongest class of quantum correlations between light beams that interact with the vibration.\nThe researchers used a very short laser-pulse to trigger a specific pattern of vibration inside a diamond crystal. Each pair of neighboring atoms oscillated like two masses linked by a spring, and this oscillation was synchronous across the entire illuminated region. To conserve energy during this process, a light of a new color is emitted, shifted toward the red of the spectrum.\nThis classical picture, however, is inconsistent with the experiments. Instead, both light and vibration should be described as particles, or quanta: light energy is quantized into discrete photons while vibrational energy is quantized into discrete phonons (named after the ancient Greek “\nphoto\n = light” and “\nphono\n = sound”).\nThe process described above should therefore be seen as the fission of an incoming photon from the laser into a pair of photon and phonon – akin to nuclear fission of an atom into two smaller pieces.\nBut it is not the only shortcoming of classical physics. In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition state, like the famous Schrödinger cat being alive \nand\n dead \nat the same time\n.\nEven more counterintuitive: two particles can become \nentangled\n, losing their individuality. The only information that can be collected about them concerns their common correlations. Because both particles are described by a common state (the wavefunction), these correlations are stronger than what is possible in classical physics. It can be demonstrated by performing appropriate measurements on the two particles. If the results violate a classical limit, one can be sure they were entangled.\nIn the new study, EPFL researchers managed to entangle the photon and the phonon (i.e., light and vibration) produced in the fission of an incoming laser photon inside the crystal. To do so, the scientists designed an experiment in which the photon-phonon pair could be created at two different instants. Classically, it would result in a situation where the pair is created at time \nt\n1\n with 50% probability, or at a later time \nt\n2 \nwith 50% probability.\nBut here comes the “trick” played by the researchers to generate an entangled state. By a precise arrangement of the experiment, they ensured that not even the faintest trace of the light-vibration pair creation time (\nt\n1\n vs. \nt\n2\n) was left in the universe. In other words, they erased information about \nt\n1\n and \nt\n2\n. Quantum mechanics then predicts that the phonon-photon pair becomes entangled, and exists in a superposition of time \nt\n1\nand\nt\n2\n. This prediction was beautifully confirmed by the measurements, which yielded results incompatible with the classical probabilistic theory.\nBy showing entanglement between light and vibration in a crystal that one could hold in their finger during the experiment, the new study creates a bridge between our daily experience and the fascinating realm of quantum mechanics.\n“Quantum technologies are heralded as the next technological revolution in computing, communication, sensing, says Christophe Galland, head of the Laboratory for Quantum and Nano-Optics at EPFL and one of the study’s main authors. “They are currently being developed by top universities and large companies worldwide, but the challenge is daunting. Such technologies rely on very fragile quantum effects surviving only at extremely cold temperatures or under high vacuum. Our study demonstrates that even a common material at ambient conditions can sustain the delicate quantum properties required for quantum technologies. There is a price to pay, though: the quantum correlations sustained by atomic vibrations in the crystal are lost after only 4 picoseconds — i.e., 0.000000000004 of a second! This short time scale is, however, also an opportunity for developing ultrafast quantum technologies. But much research lies ahead to transform our experiment into a useful device — a job for future quantum engineers.”", "summary": "Scientists from EPFL, MIT, and CEA Saclay demonstrate a state of vibration that exists simultaneously at two different times.

{"id": 1792, "text": "Solitons are a type of wave that, unlike other waves, retains its shape even as it moves further away from its source. Soliton waves of light are of great interest because they can produce evenly spaced frequencies of light, like the teeth of comb. These “frequency combs” can be used in technologies that require widely spaced frequencies, such as telecommunications and chemical analysis. , researchers led by EPFL have successfully produced light solitons with a small chip-based device, setting a new record in the field.\nThe project was led by Victor Brasch and Michael Geiselmann at , working with colleagues at the . To generate the solitons, the scientists used microscopic ring-shaped structures made from very fine silicon nitride. These are called “microresonators”, and have been Kippenberg’s expertise for years.\nMicroresonators are coupled to a laser, and can store light coming from it a few nanoseconds. “This period of time is enough for the light to circumnavigate the ring thousands of times and to accumulate there, which greatly increases the intensity of the light,” explains Kippenberg.\nThe interaction between the microresonator and the light becomes non-linear. The laser, which is normally continuous by nature, is converted into ultra-short pulses: solitons.\nThe light is made up of a range of frequencies, which can be thought of as different colors. In the microresonator, the frequencies are separated very precisely by the same distance, producing something that looks like the regular spacing between the teeth of a comb. Consequently, physicists refer to this phenomenon as a “frequency comb”.\nBy adjusting the microresonator manufacturing parameters, the researchers were also able to generate a so-called “soliton Cherenkov radiation”, which broadens the frequency spectrum; in other words, it allows the comb to have more teeth. At this point, the generated frequencies extend over two thirds of an octave compared with the frequency of the incoming laser (an octave refers to either double or half the frequency).\nThe achievement sets a new record for this microresonators. \"These results represent a promising advance for applications that require many widely spaced frequencies,\" says Kippenberg, who has already filed a patent.\nA field that stands to gain from this work is optical communications. Using this approach, a single laser would be enough to create a range of individual frequencies that could carry information separately, even through the same optical fiber. In addition, chemical spectroscopy and atomic timekeeping are other potential applications.\nAll the microresonator samples used in this work were manufactured at .

{"id": 1793, "text": "During the lockdown in spring 2020, EPFL teachers had to give their classes in front of a computer – with their reflection in the screen as the only visible audience. That became standard procedure once again when classes were moved back online in late October. “Teaching is more than just transmitting knowledge. Human interaction plays a key role, and you lose a lot of that online. When you speak to a Zoom screen and most of your students have their cameras turned off, you don’t know if they are really following what you’re saying. You have to find another way to get their feedback,” says Andreas Osterwalder, a senior scientist in chemistry and chemical engineering and a member of the EPFL Teachers’ Council (CCE).\nStudents also feel that the lack of face-to-face contact is a problem. “It’s hard to speak on Zoom without interrupting someone. Discussions aren’t fluid, and that doesn’t encourage you to participate,” says Léandre Pitre-Tarpin, a class delegate for the civil engineering section and a member of AGEPolytique. “It’s also easier to lose concentration online or switch to another window.”\nMain challenges\nA study carried out by the  on how EPFL teachers adapted to the lockdown confirms that the lack of interaction and feedback is the biggest challenge to online teaching. The study involved interviews with around a dozen EPFL teachers in April and the first half of May 2020. “When you teach online, without being able to interact with your students, it’s impossible to pick up on signs that they may not have understood,” says Roland Tormey, head of EPFL’s Teaching Support Center (CAPE). “You can use clickers, mini-surveys and Q&A sessions as ways to find out. We also suggest conducting assessments like midterms more frequently, because online you don’t have the social aspect that boosts motivation.”\nThis situation increased the sense of solidarity among faculty members – we’ve got to help each other out.\nSamuel Dubuis, teacher for the CMS\nAccording to an  carried out in November 2020, 68% of Bachelor’s students (excluding those in the first year) and Master’s students said they had fallen behind in their classes. “When professors pre-record videos of their classes, we tend to watch them when we have time – or even at the end of the semester just before our exams, unless we have a midterm exam,” says Pitre-Tarpin. He adds: “Taking classes at home makes you feel like you’re studying all the time. It’s hard to stick to a routine with time for studying as well as free time. We also miss the social life and atmosphere on campus – it feels like this semester just keeps dragging on.” The AGEPoly survey found that 73% of students are experiencing a decline in motivation.\nLive classes and helping out colleagues \nSo how can teachers keep students motivated and involved? This spring CAPE tripled the number of workshops it offers, covering topics such as teaching online interactively, producing videos and implementing a flipped classroom format. In a flipped classroom, students learn the theory at home and spend the time in class working on exercises and asking questions. “This situation leads to more exchanges between teachers. And that’s helpful because it’s important for them to share their experience and best practices,” says Tormey.\nSamuel Dubuis, who teaches an analysis class for the preparatory mathematics course (CMS), interacts regularly with his colleagues in the mathematics section. This spring he became an “expert” on Zoom in just a few days, and wrote a guide for other teachers on how to use the program. “I got a lot of positive feedback, and even teachers outside my section started using my guide. That increased the sense of solidarity among faculty members – we’ve got to help each other out.”\nWe shouldn’t lose sight of the positive things that came out of this period – for example, it showed us the benefits of flipped classrooms.\nPierre Dillenbourg, the associate vice president for education\nDubuis initially gave his online classes through prerecorded videos, but found that students prefer live classes. He co-teaches one of his classes with two other instructors: one person creates dynamic slides; the other writes up additional lecture notes; and Dubuis gives the class on a tablet. “I give my lectures in almost the same way as if I were standing in front a chalkboard. Once the semester is over, we’ll assess how things went. Our goal is to keep the online classes appealing. We’ve gotten used to the technology, but we still need the face-to-face contact. The human interaction is one of the reasons why I decided to become a teacher,” says Dubuis.\nStaying in contact with students\nFrancesco Mondada, the academic director of LEARN and a professor at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory, has realized that it’s important to maintain a routine and speak frequently with your students. “I prerecorded my classes during the lockdown, but gave ‘live introductions’ at 8:15 am so that students would get up and keep a regular schedule. For the practical sessions where students work in pairs on robots, I set up a collaborative system that they could use for programming. Their final exams consisted of presenting their projects, and that went really well. This semester I’m giving a class that was already partly in a flipped classroom format, so it was easier to adapt. I tend to stay in regular contact with my students, and they can give me anonymous feedback on Moodle. For instance, at first I wasn’t very enthusiastic about the breakout room feature on Zoom [where teachers can divide students up into small groups and switch from one group to another], but I soon saw that students liked it.”\nEncouraging groupwork \nMondada conducted a survey among students in his Basics of Mobile Robotics class three weeks into the semester, and found that students who were not working in groups for the online exercise sessions were generally less motivated. The importance of groupwork – especially for first-year students – was also revealed in the AGEPoly survey carried out in November. However, 40% of those students said they weren’t able to find someone to work with. That’s why AGEPoly, with the support of schools and Vice Presidency for Education, set up a  for all first-year students; the goal is to “reduce the risk of them dropping out and improve their chances of success.” Dubuis notes that “technology often isolates us. Online, it’s hard to recreate the atmosphere of an exercise session.”\nWith regards to exercise sessions, Mondada developed a system that his students find very useful. He created a Google form where they can enter a brief summary of their question and indicate how they prefer to be contacted; the student assistants then reply to the questions in the order that they are sent. Mondada also set up two Discord servers: one for students and one for student assistants. After being contacted by several other teachers who had heard about his systems from their students, he created a user guide and video explaining how to install and use them.\nA blended future\nThis particularly challenging year has disrupted normal teaching practices and laid the foundations for what will eventually become a blended teaching model, according to Pierre Dillenbourg, an EPFL professor specialized in educational technology and the associate vice president for education. “Teachers were forced to adopt digital technology in a very abrupt manner. We’ve seen that moving everything online is very tiring and stressful, but it provides greater flexibility for students. Classes where students attend some lectures in person and others remotely, like the system EPFL had in place at the start of the semester, are not easy for teachers to manage. But we shouldn’t lose sight of the positive things that came out of this period – for example, it showed us the benefits of flipped classrooms. In the future, teachers will probably use a blended approach combining in-person and online instruction. But the exact ‘recipe’ for each class will be different depending on the subject matter, the number of students and the teacher’s personality.”\nOnline platform compiles studies of Covid-19’s impact on Swiss education\nSeveral studies have been carried out in Switzerland to evaluate the impact that Covid-19 – and more specifically, the spring 2020 lockdown and the shift to online classes – has had on students’ education. A  was set up in November to compile the findings of the various studies, allow them to be searched and viewed, and encourage coordination and collaboration among researchers. The platform is an initiative of the LEARN Center, and was developed in association with the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) and the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education (EDK).\n “Studies have popped up like mushrooms during these unprecedented times,” says Jessica Dehler Zufferey, the operational director of LEARN. “To the point where many researchers are using data-collection methods that have not been tested, pushing aside conventional theories and sharing little of their data. That’s what gave me the idea for this platform – to provide a forum for coordinating research efforts and extracting more value from their findings for decision-makers.”\n The platform already houses over 50 studies examining Covid-19’s impact on the Swiss educational system. And some 110 researchers took part in an online event held jointly by the LEARN Center, SERI and EDK on 1 December, where researchers discussed the projects they have underway. A survey carried out at the end of the event showed that participants would like to see more events of this type and thought the platform was a good idea.", "summary": "Since spring 2020, EPFL teachers have had to make remote teaching a part of their daily job.

{"id": 1794, "text": "Charles Jenny, who just graduated from EPFL's Master’s in architecture program, chose temporary housing as the topic of his Master’s project, using the 2018 Paléo Festival in Nyon as his case study. “I wanted my project to result in something tangible,” says Jenny. “And I’d love to turn it into a startup, which is why I also included a business plan.” He started out by studying the various types of temporary housing currently used at festivals to accommodate staff and the public, such as tents, pop-up chalets, yurts and camper trailers. He used life-cycle assessments to determine their carbon impact and considered other criteria such as storm resistance, comfort, cost, portability, space efficiency and the ease with which they can be set up and taken down. \n It turns out that each type of housing has its shortcomings. Jenny found plastic camping tents to be the most problematic, and not just because of the material they are made from: they compress the ground on which they’re set up, and they’re sometimes left behind on the site as if they were disposable. People of varying ages who travel across Europe in the summer and visit festivals may also be discouraged by the need to bring and set up their own tents. Based on his findings, Jenny came up with a new, more environmentally friendly housing solution that tallies with festival-goers’ needs: a raised, modular wooden cabin that can be easily assembled, disassembled and reused. \nMaximum efficiency\n “The pop-up concept is ideal for festivals but could also be used on a larger scale,” says Jenny. “Not only would it work for all sorts of private events, but it could also provide emergency housing for victims of natural and humanitarian disasters.” For his Master’s project, Jenny was advised by assistant professor Corentin Fivet, full professor Thomas Keller and lecturer Loïc Fumeaux. \n Jenny adds: “The organizers of festivals and other multi-day events would be able to order what they need through an app, selecting the level of comfort and the number of beds and accessories they want for each unit.” Jenny completed an internship in Copenhagen, and his cabins reflect the minimalist Scandinavian design. They can be linked together in rows through a simple turn of a screwdriver thanks to a system of eccentric cam locks – like those found in prefabricated furniture – on the cabins’ sides. Individual units can be carried by two people and hand assembled, and the interior furnishings are practical and efficient. Each cabin can hold a double bed or up to three singles arranged as bunk beds. Once disassembled, the panels can be stacked in a truck, making them very easy to transport. Up to 60 beds can fit on a single truck.\nNatural ventilation and light\n “What’s really innovative about my design is that it is highly efficient and architecturally appealing without sacrificing comfort,” says Jenny. “Existing solutions are not particularly attractive, have to be imported from other countries and often have few – if any – windows.” Each module consists of three or four cabins and features vertical joints to keep out the rain and a small common area that encourages neighbors to interact. While door slats, side windows and a skylight let in natural light and fresh air, the side panels provide both sound and heat insulation.\nA new market\n On 8 July, Jenny presented a 1:10 scale model of his design to a panel composed of EPFL professors and Thomas Hänni, who has been in charge of camping facilities at the Paléo Festival for the past 13 years. While the professors went so far as to challenge Jenny’s underlying premise – would such a minimalist design fit in with the rock ’n’ roll spirit of the Paléo Festival? – Hänni had no such doubts. He noted that all festivals in Europe offer some sort of makeshift housing in their camping areas, and the market is growing fast.\nPaléo recently set up an area for temporary housing called “Camping Pal’Asse” in response to growing demand. “We went from a capacity of 350 beds in 2017 to 450 in 2018 and 550 this year. The cabins range in price from 28 to 100 francs per night and are just right for people who don’t want to bunk down in a tent, such as grandparents with their grandkids.” That said, around 6,000 people still tent camp at Paléo. \nThe end of an aura?\n Paléo imports its temporary housing from England, since it cannot find an equivalent solution locally. “These companies are active all over Europe, supplying 30 or 40 festivals throughout the year,” adds Hänni. Is camping at music festivals losing its aura? Says Hänni: “The European music festival with the most pop-up housing is Hellfest” – a major heavy metal festival in France. \"It draws people of all ages, and its rock ’n’ roll spirit is beyond question.”\n(video, photos, press release)", "summary": "Série d'été: Using the Paléo Festival in Nyon as a case study, an EPFL student has developed an innovative alternative to the types of temporary housing commonly seen at multi-day events.

{"id": 1796, "text": "Stem cell-based therapies are becoming more and more common, especially in the treatment of blood cancers like lymphoma and leukemia. In these cases, the patient’s cancerous blood stem cells are removed and replaced with new, healthy ones. However, up to a quarter of cases end in death because replenishing of blood cells is too slow.\nOne solution to this is to boost the divisions of so-called hematopoietic (“blood-making”) stem cells (HSCs); these are the stem cells that produce the various types of blood cells in our bodies – red, white etc. So, pushing HSCs to divide faster would be ideal; the question is how.\nMitochondria in hematopoetic stem cells, visualized with a green fluorescent dye (credit: N. Vannini, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research)\nWe already know that what causes HSCs to slow down is stress: having to reconstitute the entire blood-cell supply system can be overwhelming. In terms of biology, this stress causes increased activity in mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles of the cell.\nTo meet the high demands of rebuilding blood cells, the mitochondria of the HSCs increase a process called “oxidative phosphorylation”, which generates fuel for the cell. But this has cost: boosting the activity of mitochondria causes HSCs to age prematurely.\nDrawing on this, a team of scientists led by  and  at the  have now found that an analogue of vitamin B3, nicotinamide riboside, can increase HSCs and boost their activity. The study, which also involved labs from , and the  has significant implications for stem-cell therapy patients, especially since nicotinamide riboside can be taken as a dietary supplement and still have such effects.\nWhen they studied the effects of nicotinamide riboside \nin vitro\n the researchers found that exposing human and mouse HSCs to it improves their function and increases mitochondrial recycling – the process by which stressed-out mitochondria get cleared out to make way for fresh ones.\nThe researchers found that adding nicotinamide riboside to the diet of mice that had undergone an irradiation procedure that eliminates their blood cells – modeling radiotherapy – improved their survival by 80% and accelerated blood recovery. In immunodeficient mice, nicotinamide riboside increased the production of white blood cells (leucocytes).\nA graphical representation of the study’s findings (credit: O. Naveiras; copyright: Cell Press)\nWhat all this translates into is a significant improvement in the ability of HSCs to divide and produce new blood cells. The study shows, for the first time, that nicotinamide riboside as a dietary supplement can have a significant positive effect on preventing blood-recovery problems in cancer patients, even after chemo- or radio-therapy.\n“We expect nicotinamide riboside and other mitochondrial modulators to become a complementary approach for increasing stem cell fitness and accelerating blood production, either through dietary supplementation or pharmacological administration,” says Naveiras.\nProfessor Naveiras' lab is part of the  within the .  is part of the , a multidisciplinary alliance pursuing fundamental, translational, and clinical cancer research.

{"id": 1799, "text": "Eight years ago, the Euler Course was started, giving schoolchildren with a knack for math the chance to take special math classes at EPFL. In April of this year, some 300 of them – a new record – from all over French-speaking Switzerland signed up for the entrance exam. The 28 students selected include a little girl who is barely 10 years old. She knows she’s giving up her Wednesday afternoons for the next six years. Quite a commitment for someone so young.\nEach student is unique\n “We meet with each of the students who pass the entrance exam, together with their parents, to be sure they know what they’re getting into,” said Jérôme Scherer, who’s in charge of the program. “They need to anticipate potential problems, like the length of the commute.” That particular concern did not deter the participants completing the Course this year, as they include a student from Neuchâtel, one from Valais, one from Geneva and two from Vaud.\nThe classes are no walk in the park: they require a significant and long-term personal investment. Apart from the class time, the students must also put in up to ten hours of homework per week. After six years, half the students had left the program. “There’s no point in forcing them to continue if their passion for math is no longer there. Giving up on the Euler Course is not a failure.”\nHigh-potential students\n The high-potential students who make it in want more than to just be fed information. They need a specialized approach to teaching that includes logic and reasoning, as this will help them discover and use all their skills. The program also teaches them organization and time-planning skills.\nGauzelin Vidovic, 17 years old, is pleased to have made it through. When he passed the entrance exam, he was only 11 years old and did not really know what he was in for. “I had gone with my sister to EPFL's \"math for girls\" open house, which I found really good,” he said. “But my first Euler class was a total surprise, it was not what I expected.” He realized he was going to have to give it his all: “I had never worked so hard in my life, both at school and at home, it was a bit of a shock to have to sit down and do my series at home for hours and hours, even on weekends.”\nGauzelin had to buckle down, change his schedule, and make some choices and sacrifices, including stopping piano and some sports. “I hung in, not for the math itself but because it taught me how to work, because I wasn’t bored in class and because the EPFL team is nice.” Certificate in hand, he has enrolled in microengineering: “I want to keep going in the sciences but I have no idea what I want to do. In microengineering you do a little bit of everything, so it’ll definitely give me some ideas.”\nWhat will they do after Euler?\n Now that they have finished the program, some of these math aficionados will continue studying this subject, while the rest will go into other technical fields also taught at EPFL or different fields like medicine.\nA lot of things will change for Xingjian Huang when the 2016-2017 school year begins. For starters, he will have to find an apartment in Lausanne and get used to his new classes. He’s enrolled in math at EPFL but is already considering whether he’ll do pure or applied math, because if all goes well he’ll start directly in on the second year of studies. “It all depends on my grade on my last exam at the end of June. I’m not totally confident, but it should go well.”\nXingjian, 18 years old, prefers to play things safe. It’s better to be prepared than overly confident – that’s what he keeps reminding himself, every step of the way. “I’m not really sure of myself, I don’t know what I can do until I try.” He didn’t think he could explain math to his classmates, for example, but then his German teacher asked him to give his daughter some help. She’s two years older, and she ended up getting a very good grade on her exam.\nHe’s the official Euler program assistant. He takes the series, corrects them, adds comments and helps the new batch of Euler students with anything they didn’t understand. “It brings back memories, which is cool, you can see that they are driven and I like the idea of being part of this process that helps people get ahead in math.”\nStudents who earned their certificate in 2016:\n After 5 years: Benjamin Gates, from Neuchâtel\n After 6 years: Xingjian Huang, from Geneva, and Mathieu Rochat and Gauzelin Vidovic, from Vaud.

{"id": 1800, "text": "Switzerland’s barn owl population is under close watch. These animals are being threatened by a sharp decline in the number of barns and farms where they can build their nests. But biologists didn’t have a practical, unobtrusive method for observing the animals in their natural habitat – until now. Students from EPFL’s have developed a prototype that can record when birds fly into and out of their birdhouses using a sensor installed at the entrance.\n The students came up with the idea after speaking with Isabelle Henry, a researcher who previously studied under barn owl expert Alexandre Roulin at the University of Lausanne. “Biologists wanted to be able to study barn owls inside their nests, but existing systems were too cumbersome and didn’t always work well,” says Sam Sulaimanov, an electrical engineering student at EPFL and president of Octanis. So the students devoted some of their spare time to building a simple device that consists of a printed circuit board and an antenna. Once the sensor is installed at the entrance to a birdhouse, it can detect when birds enter or leave, provided the birds have been tagged with tiny computer chips.\nBetter than a GPS\n The students’ system is light, cheap and can be used year-round. Its battery lasts for six months – a major advantage over existing GPS-based systems with shorter battery lives, since that means data can be collected without having to disturb the birds or capture them regularly. With these digital birdhouses, biologists won’t need to visit the birdhouses as often in order to get detailed information on the owls’ behavior before mating and on how often they feed their chicks. “We have 350 birdhouses set up between Lausanne and Morat, so this type of system could be extremely useful. We are delighted that these budding engineers have taken on this project,” said Roulin. The initial prototype will soon be installed in a birdhouse for real-world testing.\nInnovation outside the classroom\n Digital birdhouses are not the only invention to come out of Octanis. Its members have also built a rover that was tested in the Antarctic last winter. These projects give EPFL students an opportunity to explore their ideas and conduct experiments outside the classroom; most of the work is done in the prototyping labs in EPFL’s Mechanical Engineering building. Octanis is open to all EPFL students regardless of their field of study. Members can try out welding, 3D printing and even programming. “EPFL courses are extremely demanding, so it’s important to be able to take time to work on fun personal projects,” said Sulaimanov. “Here we feel free to make mistakes and test different solutions without having to worry about the impact on our grades – which enables us to learn a lot!”\nLearn more at \n An Open Night is held every Tuesday at 7:30pm on the 3rd floor of the Mechanical Engineering building", "summary": "EPFL students have developed a system that can detect when barn owls fly into and out of their nests, without disturbing the birds.

{"id": 1803, "text": "In the world of microscopy, this advance is almost comparable to the leap from photography to live television. Two young EPFL researchers, Yann Cotte and Fatih Toy, have designed a device that combines holographic microscopy and computational image processing to observe living biological tissues at the nanoscale. Their research is being done under the supervision of Christian Depeursinge, head of the Microvision and Microdiagnostics Group in EPFL’s School of Engineering.\nUsing their setup, three-dimensional images of living cells can be obtained in just a few minutes – instantaneous operation is still in the works – at an incredibly precise resolution of less than 100 nanometers, 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. And because they’re able to do this without using contrast dyes or fluorescents, the experimental results don’t run the risk of being distorted by the presence of foreign substances. \n Being able to capture a living cell from every angle like this lays the groundwork for a whole new field of investigation. “We can observe in real time the reaction of a cell that is subjected to any kind of stimulus,” explains Cotte. “This opens up all kinds of new opportunities, such as studying the effects of pharmaceutical substances at the scale of the individual cell, for example.”\nWatching a neuron grow\n This month in Nature Photonics the researchers demonstrate the potential of their method by developing, image by image, and the birth of a synapse, caught over the course of an hour at a rate of one image per minute. This work, which was carried out in collaboration with the Neuroenergetics and cellular dynamics laboratory in EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute, directed by Pierre Magistretti, earned them an editorial in the prestigious journal. “Because we used a low-intensity laser, the influence of the light or heat on the cell is minimal,” continues Cotte. “Our technique thus allows us to observe a cell while still keeping it alive for a long period of time.”\nAs the laser scans the sample from various angles, numerous images extracted by holography are captured by a digital camera, assembled by a computer and “deconvoluted” in order to eliminate noise. To develop their algorithm, the young scientists designed and built a “calibration” system in the school’s clean rooms (CMI) using a thin layer of aluminum that they pierced with 70nm-diameter “nanoholes” spaced 70nm apart.\nFinally, the assembled three-dimensional image of the cell, that looks as focused as a drawing in an encyclopedia, can be virtually “sliced” to expose its internal elements, such as the nucleus, genetic material and organelles.\nToy and Cotte, who have already obtained an EPFL Innogrant, have no intention of calling a halt to their research after such a promising beginning. In a company that’s in the process of being created and in collaboration with the startup Lyncée SA, they hope to develop a system that could deliver these kinds of observations in vivo, without the need for removing tissue, using portable devices. In parallel, they will continue to design laboratory material based on these principles. Even before its official launch, the start-up they’re creating has plenty of work to do - and plenty of ambition, as well.", "summary": "Two young EPFL scientists have developed a device that can create 3D images of living cells and track their reaction to various stimuli without the use of contrast dyes or fluorophores.", "claim": "Two young EPFL scientists have developed a device that can create 3D images of living cells and track my reaction to various stimuli without the use of contrast dyes or fluorophores.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [18, 18], "noise": false}

This is the challenge Switzerland has set for itself and which was approved by the people in the recent referendum on the energy transition. It's a shared goal, but to achieve it we will each have to make a personal effort. To help us get there, researchers at EPFL's Energy Center have added scientific data from Swiss Energyscope, an information platform developed by several laboratories on campus, to an interactive video game about energy that was first presented at Umwelt Arena in Spreitenbach, Switzerland in 2014. In just a few minutes, the most Swiss of all heroines, Heidi, and her grandfather guide us along the road to energy redemption. Although we may think we’re doing our fair share to achieve the country’s energy targets, in reality we’re not.\n“Switzerland is one of the worst offenders in Europe in terms of developing renewable energy – we're far behind the Scandinavian countries and Germany,” says François Vuille, director of development at the Energy Center. “We developed hydraulic power and then rested on our laurels.” The researcher has plenty of other examples that show our efforts are falling short of the mark. “Our buildings are energy sieves, and our cars are among the most fuel-guzzling in Europe, with a large number of high-powered SUVs that are used just as much to crawl through town as to climb mountain passes.”\nThe aim of “Mission Possible” is to make us stop and think about our own energy consumption and its carbon impact in Switzerland. How do you get around: public transport, sustainable transport, a hybrid or electric car, or a big SUV? Have you thought about properly insulating your home? As you guide your hero or heroine through the game, you have to make choices like these while also ensuring you don’t use too much electricity. You are then informed of the carbon impact of each choice. And to make things interesting, some options lead to a dead-end: “You can opt for nuclear power, for example, which is very good in terms of its carbon impact,” explains Vuille. “But if you do, you'll reach a point in the game where you hit a wall. Based on realistic scenarios, this can happen at any time, forcing players to rethink their choice of energy supply.” The point of the game is to meet or beat the targets in Switzerland's Energy Strategy 2050.\nThis interactive game is on display at the International Exhibition in Astana, in Switzerland's Flower Power pavilion, where visitors from Kazakhstan and further afield can learn about Switzerland from an ecological point of view. This can sometimes be eye-opening for those not yet attuned to these issues.\nAn educational version of the game is also being developed.

Professor Dietz pushes the budding architects to stretch their imagination to the limits, while meeting the standards and constraints related to this type of building.\nHOUSE 2 follows on the heels of HOUSE 1. For this second round of the project, Dietz – who also heads EPFL’s ALICE laboratory – divided his students into groups of 15 and asked them to design the dozen or so rooms in the house. The catch this year was that all the wooden pieces had to fit together into a container. This is because the project is headed for Zurich: HOUSE 2 will be on display in the western part of the city, under a railway bridge near the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), from 30 May to 15 June. This marks an unprecedented collaboration between the city and EPFL; the wooden home will be open to the public throughout the exhibition.\nFacing a critical evaluation\nThe student’s dozen projects – ranging from a kitchen and tea bar to an artistic projection room, urban training turret, high-tech conference room, and rest area – have just passed their critical evaluation. Dietz and his team called on Rémy Meylan, an engineer specialized in wood construction, to carry out the assessment.\nMeylan had the difficult task of reminding the students who came up with the most daring designs of certain construction standards and technical constraints.\nMeanwhile, Dietz used the evaluation to encourage the students to improve their designs, pointing out their strengths but also their weaknesses and shortcomings. “You should see the constraints you face as opportunities, not problems,” Dietz said as his class was faced with a tricky structural problem related to building a staircase. The students set up 1:10 and 1:5 wooden models in the Rolex Forum to help them visualize the magnitude of the house, which will be some 50 meters long, and the various challenges they will need to overcome.\nAn educational project \nLike HOUSE 1, HOUSE 2 is above all an educational project. It requires students to first work in a group on one part of the house, then to collaborate with neighboring groups to ensure feasibility and coherence.

{"id": 1806, "text": "Every human cell is encased in a five-nanometer-thick lipid membrane that protects it from the surrounding environment. Like a gatekeeper, the membrane determines which ions and molecules can pass through. In so doing, it ensures the cell’s well-being and stability and allows it to communicate via electrical signals.\nResearchers from the Laboratory for fundamental BioPhotonics (LBP) in EPFL's School of Engineering were able to track these moving charges in real time in a completely non-invasive manner. Rather than observing the membranes themselves, they looked at the surrounding water molecules, which, in addition to keeping the membrane intact, change orientation in the presence of electrical charges. So by ‘reading’ their position, the researchers were able to create a dynamic map of how charges are transported across a membrane.\nThe researchers’ method has just been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). It could shed light on how ion channels function, along with other processes at work in membranes. This clinically viable method could potentially also be used to directly track ion activity in neurons, which would deepen researchers’ knowledge of how nerve cells work. “Water molecules can be found wherever there are lipid membranes, which need these molecules to exist,” says Sylvie Roke, head of the LBP. “But until now, most studies on membranes didn’t look at these molecules. We’ve shown that they contain important information.”\nThe researchers did this by using a unique second-harmonic microscope that was invented at the LBP. The imaging efficiency of this microscope is more than three orders of magnitude greater than that of existing second-harmonic microscopes. With this microscope, the researchers obtained images of water molecules at a time scale of 100 milliseconds.\nTo probe the lipid membranes’ hydration, the researchers combine two lasers of the same frequency (femtosecond pulses) in a process that generates photons with a different frequency: this is known as second-harmonic light. It is generated only at interfaces and reveals information on the orientation of water molecules. “We can observe what’s happening in situ, and we don’t need to modify the environment or use bulky markers like fluorophores that would disturb water molecules’ movement” says Orly Tarun, the publication’s lead author.\nUnexpected charge fluctuations are observed\n With this method, the researchers observed charge fluctuations in membranes.

What criteria should one use to circumscribe the disease? It is to summarize these issues that in 2000 Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg published the famous Hallmarks of Cancer. Earlier this year, they updated this flagship publication, one of the most referenced to date in the history of oncology. Hanahan has now taken over as Director of the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC). Logically, the ISREC 2011 Symposium logically revolves around these hallmarks, and speakers include top worldwide experts, including three medicine Nobel Prize winners.\n There are 6 hallmarks, to which Hanahan and Weinberg have added two “emerging” candidates in their recent update. Hallmarks include enabling replicative immortality, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death or activating metastasis. Each Symposium session is specifically dedicated to one of these aspects. This is the first international meeting to date to be fully devoted to the hallmarks and to take each of these into account.\n Since they were published, the Hallmarks of Cancer have become a definite interpretation grid for oncology research. “They provide a functional classification as well as a conceptual tool”, Douglas Hanahan explains. “To become cancerous, cells must acquire these hallmark traits.

As part of a study conducted at EPFL, researchers from the Brain Mind Institute were able to show that purely biological elements played a crucial role in the development of aggressive behavior. This study has been published online in \nTranslational Psychiatry\n (a Nature Publishing Group journal).\nCarmen Sandi and her team’s research targets a deeper understanding of human domestic violence. \"But it is unimaginable to isolate human beings from social interaction to see the personality they would develop,\" indicates the researcher. Hence, she carried out experiments with rats in order to conduct her research.\n The experiment begins with male rodents who were exposed several times during their youth – that is, around puberty – to two types of psychological stress. They were thus subjected to short sessions in which they were put in a location without any place to hide, which they by nature dislike. On the other hand, researchers also exposed them to the characteristic odor of one of their natural predators, the fox.\nLike father, like son\n As adults, when these rats were put in contact with females, they showed a more aggressive behavior towards them than their peers who had not been stressed during adolescence. But the most interesting part was still to come. \"The male offspring of these stressed rats showed an aggressive behavior towards females, just like their fathers had done\", Carmen Sandi continues \"and yet our protocol had allowed us to eliminate any 'social influence' as the rat couples had been separated before the birth of their offspring.\"\nFor researchers, this demonstrates that certain behavioral traits are rooted in biological factors and not only in social ones like imitating a role model.\nMany possible explanations\n As for the females subjected to stressed males, they went through considerable behavioral, hormonal and neurological changes. The other females, put into relationships with only second generation aggressive males - who accordingly had not been directly stressed - showed exactly the same characteristics. This proves that the violence they suffered translated into long-term damage which was not exclusively psychological.\nIn the wake of this research, several additional studies will try to explain more accurately the mechanisms at work. The reasons for the transmission of aggressiveness in males could be epigenetic (inherited changes in the expression of certain genes), or might be related to physiological changes in the mother during pregnancy, observed after exposure to an aggressive male. An imperceptible deficit of maternal care in the offspring’s first days of life could also play a role in some cases, but the study in question only took into account families where such care did not differ from the one provided by an unstressed mother.\nIt would obviously be risky to immediately extrapolate these results to humans. Many analogies could, however, \"lead us to revise the way we regard the origin of the development of domestic violence as exclusively psychological and social\", Carmen Sandi explains. If biological factors do not explain everything, they constitute nevertheless a heavy legacy, which may favor drifting towards such kinds of behaviors. \"From this knowledge, we can work to develop treatments that would be able to block the expression of this biological transmission,\" the researcher concludes.", "summary": "In an experiment carried out with rats at EPFL, it was observed that aggressive behavior passed from one generation to the other, even without any contact between the parent and its offspring.

As EPFL’s Dr. ​Rebekah Overdorf, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the , part of the  said, “social media manipulation is a problem wherever social media is, and social media is everywhere.”\nCurrently, Overdorf is studying cyber disinformation and election interference in the former Soviet Republic of Kyrgyzstan, sandwiched between Russia and China and sometimes referred to as ‘the island of democracy’. As she told the conference, “most research on social media manipulation’s effect on democracy is done almost exclusively in the United States or Western Europe but this kind of manipulation happens all over the world, so it’s also important to study it in non-Western contexts.” \nEarlier this month, the prime minister of Kyrgyzstan stood down a week after post-election protests in support of opposition groups who said the October 4 ballot had been subject to widespread manipulation and voter suppression. Overdorf said her research focused on the manipulation of Facebook to spread fake news and other disinformation in the lead-up to the election, “With a local team of journalists, students and activists we have been looking at the three key ways used to control information: noise - to drown out opposing voices with fake accounts like troll farms; disinformation - fake news to destroy trust, which can work when the audience is in a state of alarm or is disenfranchised; and, attacks – for example publicly outing a candidate’s sexuality, not only aiming to damage that person but creating fear in others that they might also be attacked if they speak out.”\nAnother speaker, Steve El-Sharawy, the Head of Insights at EzyInsights told the conference that global manipulation is out of control. “In 2019 Facebook reported that it had removed 2.19 billion fake accounts. This means that there are a lot of fake accounts but these numbers need to be considered in context. It doesn’t mean that Facebook has removed everything. Is it 50% of fake accounts, or 25% is it 99%, there are still a lot of fake accounts.” He went on to say social media platforms are overwhelmed by the scale of manipulation, but with no formal reporting required anywhere in the world regarding any aspect of information manipulation, it is virtually impossible to define the size and scale of the problem at this time. \nEPFL Professor Karl Aberer, also with the  urged society to take not only a defensive stance against cyber manipulation through legislation/regulation but also an offensive approach, “the incentives to consume quality information are decreasing because usually you have to pay for it and people are spoiled by social media platforms, getting information for free. We should promote the production of quality information and its consumption through education and digital literacy so that people appreciate and understand how it interplays with democracy.”\nBut, to conclude, he also worried that it may be too late, “the whole issue [of digital misinformation] reminds me of what is happening with climate change and whether the stakeholders can get their act together, and make some serious decisions that hurt, before we get to the point of no return and we can no longer fix the problem – and by that I mean that democracies have been so damaged that they are probably turning into other systems that we value less these days.”\nThe conference, “Manipulating elections in cyberspace: Are democracies in danger?” was a joint  -  -  event that can be viewed .", "summary": "EPFL Professor compares digital disinformation to the issue of climate change, asking whether we are past the point of no return to fix the problem.", "claim": "EPFL Professor compares digital disinformation to the issue of climate change, asking whether she are past the point of no return to fix the problem.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [14, 14], "noise": false}

The finished article, called \nOrion\n, unveiled at a special event on Tuesday, 9 April, will take part in Formula Student Electric – one of three event classes alongside internal combustion-engine and driverless cars. “It was a hugely challenging endeavor, but we recognize the importance of sustainable engineering,” says Pierre Georges, the president and a Master’s student in mechanical engineering. “We’ve gained valuable experience in a sector of the automotive industry that’s only going to grow in the future.”\n is the European arm of Formula SAE, a competition launched by the US-based Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in 1981 in which students are tasked with designing and building a prototype single-seater racing car. Once the technology-packed vehicles are ready, teams put them to the test in a series of track demonstrations, including an endurance race.\nAsking the right questions\nThe EPFL team is supervised by Mario Paolone, a motorsports fan and professor in electrical engineering, and Anders Meibom, a professor in environmental sciences and engineering. “Formula Student is an exercise in cutting-edge engineering,” says Paolone. “It’s a chance for students to gain new technical skills, and to think and work as a team. For my part, solving engineering problems with students is an immensely rewarding experience. They always bring a range of interesting ideas to the table.”\nLausanne Racing Team’s electric car, measuring 2.5 meters long by 1.6 meters wide, features a single, rear-mounted electric engine along with a composite body made from linen fiber, a natural and mechanically robust material. The students bought the engine, but decided to design their own battery management and cooling system – a formidable task that the team is still grappling with. “The real challenge is asking the right people the right questions,” says Pierre Dussaux, the team’s technical director and a Master’s student in mechanical engineering. Last fall, for instance, the team spent two days at Ferrari’s headquarters in Maranello, Italy, and they are still in touch with engineers there from time to time.\nStudent drivers\nLausanne Racing Team is an interdisciplinary project supported by EPFL’s Vice Presidency for Education. Aside from premises and help to develop their prototype, the students also received support from EPFL professional workshops. “It’s not simply a question of designing a track car,” explains Meibom. “It’s about using cutting-edge technologies and materials to make a vehicle that can outpace the competition – and keep the driver safe, too. When I see how enthusiastic the students are, and how hard they’re working on this project, I have no doubt they’ll rise to the challenge.”\nFor its debut year, Lausanne Racing Team will take part in two races: the first at the  (5-11 August), and the second (20-25 August). The students have until August to put the finishing touches to the car and test it on the track. Six drivers, all members of the team, will put the vehicle through its paces. “We chose drivers who’d been involved in building the car because they’re best placed to tell us where things need improving,” explains Georges. Sponsored among others by Saint-Sulpice and Lausanne Porsche Center, the team is also looking for sponsors to help cover the design and development costs, which so far stand at between 90,000 and 100,000 francs. “At the start, Formula Student seemed like an impossible dream, but we’ve done it – and we want to keep showing we’ve got what it takes,” says Dussaux.", "summary": "EPFL is set to make its debut in Formula Student this year, pitting a brand-new electric racing car developed by Lausanne Racing Team – and unveiled at an event at the Rolex Learning Center on Tuesday, 9 April – against other universities in races held across Europe.", "claim": "EPFL is set to make our debut in Formula Student this year, pitting a brand-new electric racing car developed by Lausanne Racing Team – and unveiled at an event at the Rolex Learning Center on Tuesday, 9 April – against other universities in races held across Europe.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 5], "noise": false}

The most optimistic forecasts estimate waters rising one foot, and the most pessimistic talk of more than one meter.\nVenice and the Nile Delta could be wiped off the map. Moroccan coastal areas would disappear too. The risks of erosion, saltwater intrusion into crops or groundwater, undersized dams unable to withstand the hydraulic variations – these scenarios must be given serious consideration.\nHa Phong Nguyen considered the prospect of a dam at Gibraltar: “The goal is to close the Mediterranean with two dams, one between Spain and Morocco and the other between Djibouti and Yemen, to control the water level.” The simplest solution is to close the Strait over the narrowest distance. While that point is only 14km across, its depth is 800 meters. “For this to be realistic, I had to locate the dam to the East of Tangier in the Mediterranean. The distance between the two continents there is 27km, but it’s half as deep.”\nPartly closing the Strait of Gibraltar \n The young engineer tested numerous configurations before finding a geometry that contains water while allowing the 300 daily ships and Russian submarines located in this area to pass, and without interrupting the crossover of animal species that migrate to the sea in winter and go into the ocean in the spring. “By closing the Strait of Gibraltar 90% and leaving an opening of 1 km, it’s possible to maintain a constant level in the Mediterranean, assuming that the level of the Atlantic increases by 50 cm.”\nHis master’s project was to build a numerical model to simulate the currents in this passage. To validate the model it was necessary to compare data with historical values taken during campaigns in the 1970s and 1990s. The Spanish navy holds essential topographic data which are considered confidential documents. Special requests were required to gain access.\nOperation of the dam\n By closing the Strait, the flow speeds of water increase, which can help generate energy. Currents in the Strait go in two directions. Water from the Atlantic flows into the Mediterranean to compensate for evaporation of sea water; colder and less salty – therefore less dense – water remains on the surface. There is also movement from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Plus, the phenomenon of tides must be considered. “In my model I also took into account the tides due to the sun and the moon. In Gibraltar there are two high tides and two low tides each day.”\nBut with the tidal coefficients being low, the dam must rely on other energy inputs to produce the equivalent of a nuclear power plant. “With the tides, I arrived at values between 600 and 1,300 gigawatt hours,” says Ha Phong Nguyen. “Mühleberg produces 2000–3000 gigawatts per year. It is essential to combine them with other systems that produce energy, such as wind turbines and geothermal wells.”\nHa Phong’s project will probably never see the light of day, even if it shares part of a common dream with Swiss engineer Giovanni Lombardi who envisioned a rail tunnel connecting the two continents but was unable to achieve it. The movement of the African and European tectonic plates remains one of the biggest obstacles to such constructions.", "summary": "Summer Series – Student Work (5): For his master’s work, a student in hydraulic engineering has conceived of a dam in the Strait of Gibraltar to contain rising waters in the Mediterranean.

How can you be sure that you won’t miss a talk relating to your field of research? Three students at the EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences have invented a software application called TrailHead, which uses a visualization system to sort through this information. With their software application, Jonas Arnfred, Amine Mansour and Yannik Messerli have found a way to target presentations according to specific scientific interests. Already used at symposiums, the TrailHead web interface received 1,472 visits in 2012.\nAn algorithm as a magical formula\n In order to sort through a large group of presentations, the students developed an algorithm based on text recognition and semantic analysis. Jonas Arnfred, the student who initiated the project, enthusiastically explains: “One of the exciting aspects of TrailHead is that we had to combine several methods from different disciplines – such as automatic text extraction, automatic learning or graphic design – to produce a very concrete tool.” The first step was to gather the various articles on individual presentations to be given at the same symposium. The next step was to automatically convert these articles into raw data that could be recognized by the future software application.\nAmine Mansour, who later joined the project, continues: “It was not an easy matter to find an algorithm that could calculate similarities between articles and therefore link the presented subjects to specific research fields.” He first tested an algorithm that could detect word similarities and calculate the number of occurrences of the same terms in these texts. It later became apparent that an additional algorithm was needed to assess lexical fields so that groups of words associated with the same research field could be identified.\nA well-designed and practical visualization system\n Instead of producing a copious list of dozens of presentation abstracts, the application proposes a map of the various presentations linked according to subject matter. “The difficulty of this method of visualization was to make it both intuitive and fluid,” explains Yannik Messerli, who set about creating a web interface that would be compatible with the greatest possible array of peripherals. “An algorithm graphically outputs the conference presentations to make closely related subjects appear grouped together.”\nTrailHead generates a personalized symposium schedule\n Once you have selected the desired research field(s) and have clicked on the presentations that the software application suggests that you attend (based on the criteria selected), TrailHead allows you to generate a personalized symposium schedule and choose from among various options (e.g. add presentation abstracts to schedule). It also has a feature that lets you synchronize your schedule with your electronic agenda.\n“We have continuously worked to improve this software application by introducing more powerful search filters as well as other features. The project has been quite an undertaking – 2 years – and has enabled us to earn a living during most of our studies. We are very thankful to our Professor, , for having guided and supported the project,” explains Yannik. Amine adds: “The interesting aspect is that we were given the opportunity to create a specific tool from start to finish and now this tool is being used by the scientific community.”\nIndeed, TrailHead was used for the first time in 2012 at the International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), which included 700 presentations and over 1,000 participants. The TrailHead web interface received 1,472 visits, with a peak in traffic of 563 hits five days before the start of the symposium. TrailHead was also used by participants in the Information Theory and Applications (ITA) 2013 symposium as well as in the ISIT 2013 symposium.\nIn the future, TrailHead could also prove useful to participants at festivals, enabling them to choose from among the various cultural events, concerts or open-air films over the summer.

The algorithms used by social media platforms like Facebook learn what our preferences are and provide more and more content that matches our interests. The risk is that we will never be shown anything that goes against our opinions, and this can distort our view of the world. “By ever more carefully selecting what we see, these algorithms are distorting reality. Social media platforms effectively become echo chambers in which opinions can become increasingly extreme,” explains Elisa Celis, senior researcher in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) at EPFL.\nAnd this can have an impact on the reader. “Numerous studies have shown that if you are undecided about something, your decision will ultimately be influenced by the frequency and order in which you are presented with information. So these algorithms can actually shape your opinion based on biased data,” says Celis. In response to this problem, Celis worked with Nisheeth Vishnoi, professor in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) at EPFL, to develop a system to prevent users from being fed totally one-sided content.\nAn algorithm that's just as effective\nThey designed an algorithm that can be altered to ensure that users are shown a minimum amount of diverse content. “A social media platform could, for instance, opt to have views that oppose those of the user make up at least 10% of the newsfeed to ensure the user’s view of the world remains more balanced,” explain the researchers. The algorithm could be easily integrated into current systems. The main challenge is getting the large corporations on board. “For platforms like Facebook, these algorithms have to be effective in order to generate advertising revenue. We wanted to show that it is possible to create an algorithm that is just as effective but that allows content to be customized in a fairer and more balanced manner,” explains Vishnoi.\nRaising governments’ awareness of this issue will be a key factor when it comes to filling the legislative gap in this area. Several human rights organizations have already shown interest in the researchers’ project, which they recently presented to delegates of human rights agencies in Geneva, including to members of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. “These algorithms are currently totally unregulated because the impact of the bias they generate is not yet properly understood.

{"id": 1826, "text": "For decades, physicists, engineers and mathematicians failed to explain a remarkable phenomenon in fluid mechanics: the natural tendency of turbulence in fluids to move from disordered chaos to perfectly parallel patterns of oblique turbulent bands. This transition from a state of chaotic turbulence to a highly structured pattern was observed by many scientists, but never understood.\nAt EPFL's Laboratory (School of Engineering), Tobias Schneider and his team have identified the mechanism that explains this phenomenon. Their findings have been published in \n.\nFrom chaos to order\nThe equations used to describe the large variety of phenomena occurring in fluid flows are well known. These equations capture the fundamental laws of physics that govern fluid dynamics, a subject taught to all physics and engineering students from undergraduate level onwards.\nBut when turbulence comes into play, the solutions to the equations become non-linear, complex and chaotic. This makes it impossible, for example, to predict weather over an extended time horizon. Yet turbulence has a surprising tendency to move from chaos to a highly structured pattern of turbulent and laminar bands. This is a remarkable phenomenon, yet the underlying mechanism remained hidden in the equations until now.\nHere’s what happens: when a fluid is placed between two parallel plates, each moving in an opposite direction, turbulence is created. At first, the turbulence is chaotic, then it self-organizes to form regular oblique bands, separated by zones of calm (or laminar flows). No obvious mechanism selects the oblique orientation of the bands or determines the wavelength of the periodic pattern.\nConcealed in simple equations\nSchneider and his team solved the mystery. “As the physicist Richard Feynman predicted, the solution was not to be found in new equations, but rather within the equation that was already available to us,” explains Schneider. “Until now, researchers didn't have powerful enough mathematical tools to verify this.”\nThe researchers combined one such tool, known as dynamical systems theory, with existing theories on pattern formation in fluids and advanced numerical simulations. They calculated specific equilibrium solutions for each step of the process, enabling them to explain the transition from the chaotic to the structured state.\n“We can now describe the initial instability mechanism that creates the oblique pattern,” explains Florian Reetz, the study’s lead author. “We have thus solved one of the most fundamental problems in our field. The methods we developed will help clarify the chaotic dynamics of turbulent-laminar patterns in many flow problems. They may one day allow us to better control flows.”\nAn important phenomenon\n In fluid mechanics, stripe pattern formation is important because it shows how turbulent and laminar flows are in constant competition with each other to determine the final state of the fluid, i.e., turbulent or laminar. This competition arises whenever turbulence forms, such as when air flows over a car. The turbulence starts in a small area on the car’s roof, but then it spreads – because turbulence is stronger than laminar flow in this particular case. The final state is therefore turbulent.\n When the stripe pattern forms, it means that the laminar and turbulent flows are equal in strength. However, this is very difficult to observe in nature, outside of the controlled conditions of a laboratory. This fact points to the significance of the EPFL researchers’ success in explaining a fundamental property of turbulence. Not only do their findings account for a phenomenon that can be observed in a laboratory, but they could help to better understand and control flow-related phenomena occurring in nature as well.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL have found the mechanism that lies behind a mysterious physics phenomenon in fluid mechanics: the fact that turbulence in fluids spontaneously self-organizes into parallel patterns of oblique turbulent bands – an example of order emerging spontaneously from chaos.

{"id": 1833, "text": "Already in use in some airports, compressed air vehicles developed by the French company Motor Development International (MDI) could soon charge their tanks in less than three minutes, instead of the several hours that have been needed up to now. In the context of a partnership with the company, researchers from Professor Alfred Rufer’s Industrial Electronics Laboratory (LEI) at EPFL have developed a prototype for a quick-stop recharge station that can fill up a tank of compressed air the same amount of time it takes to fill up a regular gas tank, for an autonomy of about 70 km.\nTransferring air in stages\n The new recharge process is done in two stages (see schematic below): first the air is compressed in a high-performance compression station and transferred to an intermediate storage station. Because it’s continually being refilled from the compression station, the intermediate storage station is able to maintain quasi-constant pressure conditions.\n In the second stage, the compressed air is transferred from the intermediate storage station to the car’s tank, this time very rapidly, using a flow-limiting process in which very little energy is dissipated. The only problem is that during this accelerated compression, the air heats up in the vehicle’s tank. When it cools down, it contracts, reducing the pressure in the reservoir and, consequently, decreasing the vehicle’s autonomy.\t\nThe solution: recirculating the air\n In order to fill the tank in an optimal manner, Rufer’s team designed a system that recirculates the air during fill-up, which instantly cools the reservoir. The air that’s warmed up by pressurization is sent back to the storage station, then replaced by cooler air, all under constant pressure conditions. The fill-up is thus done in two stages, allowing the density of the air in the tank to be increased and the temperature to be stabilized. “Using this method, the yield from the transfer is theoretically close to 95%,” notes Rufer.\nLonger version of the article: \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; _fcksavedurl=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Cliquer ici pour installer le lecteur&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\"Car of the Future\", from , the World Economic Forum at Davos\nPlus d'informations:", "summary": "As part of a partnership with a French company that develops compressed air vehicles, EPFL scientists have solved the main drawback of this technology: vehicle recharge time.

{"id": 1834, "text": "At EPFL, innovation is at work in all fields – including that of teaching itself. A growing number of instructors are taking an interest in new pedagogical methods to revamp their traditional lecture-hall courses, and they’re taking their cues from research being conducted by experts in learning strategies. EPFL’s  has just released a series of videos that were filmed in the classrooms of five instructors who are leading the way in these new methods.\nAn MOOC for laying the foundations\nJean-Cédric Chappelier, a computer programming teacher, totally restructured his course when he adopted the flipped-classroom approach. His 350 first-year students now learn the basics of programming at their own pace by taking a MOOC before heading to the classroom to flesh out their knowledge of the subject. Chappelier spent a lot of time with his colleagues Jamila Sam and Vincent Lepetit developing the videos in which he teaches the foundations of his course, and he feels that his effort has paid off. “There is a lot more give-and-take in class,” he says. “The students come to the practical sessions better prepared and ask much more pointed questions.” The flexibility that this approach gives the students, who are allocated blocks of time in their schedule for the online work, is also appreciated. “The impact is positive in two respects: the students prefer this approach, and it makes them better,” adds Chappelier.\nIn-class clickers and apps\nIn order to boost participation in her classes, physics professor Cécile Hébert opted for clickers, which let students vote for a multiple-choice answer when the professor asks a question. “This creates an interactive dynamic that is very constructive,” says Hébert. Getting students actively involved is clearly one of the secrets to improving their grasp of the material. “To learn, they really need to ‘do’ something: join in, speak up, write – anything is better than just sitting there and listening,” says Denis Gillet, who, in the class he teaches with Adrian Holzer and Samuel Bendahan takes a similar approach through the.\n It takes just a couple of minutes for a question sent out through the app to gauge the class’s level of understanding, enabling the professors to zoom in on the weak spots. “Without this app, that would be impossible in an auditorium with a hundred students where not everyone can speak up,” says Holzer.\nInstructor workshops\n With this initial series of videos, the Teaching Support Centre hopes to encourage other teaching initiatives within EPFL and support any instructor who is hesitating about taking the leap. “It’s not easy to put a completely new method into practice, and it's important for instructors to be inspired by what their colleagues are doing,” says Siara Isaac, a teaching advisor at the Centre. To make the leap easier, the Centre provides guidance and workshops on various topics related to innovation in teaching, and it is also developing other types of videos. “These days, professors are no longer there to simply impart knowledge – since now everything is just a click away – but to help students learn skills,” adds Isaac. “Coming up with more effective methods based on active participation is rewarding for everyone – both students and professors alike.”\nThe Teaching Support Centre’s next two workshops for instructors are on Flipped Classrooms (4 July) and Effective interactive Teaching (11 July).

{"id": 1835, "text": "Hydrogen is often touted as the fuel of the future. But because this gas is highly explosive, it must be stored and transported under pressure in specialized and expensive containers. Hydrogen therefore has issues in terms of safety, logistics, and profitability that could significantly limit its wider use. However, a solution might lie in research by EPFL scientists, who have developed a simple system based on two chemical reactions. The first reaction transforms hydrogen into formic acid, a liquid that is easy to store and less flammable than gasoline, while the second reaction does the reverse and restores the hydrogen. Another possible application of their technology would be to use atmospheric CO\n2\n to synthesize a number of useful chemical products.\nGabor Laurenczy’s team has already developed a process for transforming formic acid into hydrogen gas. The method was the subject of several articles, one of which appeared in Science, and it is currently under industrial development. But a complete and coherent system would also require the inverse process: transforming hydrogen into formic acid. This has now been achieved, completing the cycle, thanks to the financial support of EOS Holding. The scientists in Laurenczy’s team have described the process in a Nature Communications article.\nThe researchers synthesized formic acid in a single step, starting with hydrogen and atmospheric CO\n2\n. Conventional methods to accomplish this involve several steps, which are complicated to carry out and generate undesirable chemical byproducts.\nThe two chemical reactions – hydrogen to formic acid and back to hydrogen - are catalytic: the advantage is that nothing is lost in the transformation, and the process can thus be used in constructing sustainable devices.\nWith their two catalytic reactions, the researchers now possess all the technology they need to build a complete, integrated device. Laurenczy envisions small energy storage units in which the current from photovoltaic cells produces hydrogen by electrolysis, which is then transformed and stored as formic acid, and finally transformed back into hydrogen to produce electricity at night-time. “Our procedure is simple enough that it can be implemented at the domestic level,” he says.\nAnother possible application of this technology would be to use atmospheric CO\n2\n, a greenhouse gas, as a building-block for chemical synthesis. Formic acid is the basis of numerous organic syntheses, e.g. in the textile industry. As Laurenczy explains: “We are killing two birds with one stone: we could sequester part of the 35 gigatons of CO\n2\n that are emitted into the atmosphere every year, and also use it to synthesize materials.”", "summary": "EPFL scientists have completed their solution for transforming hydrogen gas into a less flammable liquid fuel that can be safely stored and transported.

{"id": 1836, "text": "In the autumn, lakes undergo their annual water exchange as high winds, inflows from rivers and variations in water temperature mix up the water. During these colder months, the surface water, which is rich in oxygen, cools, sinks and mixes with the deeper layers, which brings fresh oxygen into the lakes’ depths. But because Lake Geneva is so deep – going down 310 meters – the water exchange is only partial. The lake gets fully re-oxygenated only every eight years or so. A long-term shortage of oxygen could destroy the flora and fauna living in the lake's depths.\nTo better understand how lakes breathe, Robert Schwefel from EPFL’s Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory probed the depths of Lake Geneva in order to measure oxygen levels there. He took samples at different depths using a robot capable of descending several hundred meters. Thanks to the robot’s microprobes, he was able to measure oxygen concentrations micrometer by micrometer, in both the water and the sediment. Samples were taken at seven locations, and the results were quite telling: “We were able to collect data that is essential for estimating oxygen depletion in the sediment – something that had never before been measured out in the field.”\n175 natural lakes in Switzerland and as many reasons to be concerned\nSince the middle of the last century, anthropogenic – or human – activity has caused water temperatures to rise and has led to eutrophication, whereby nutrients build up in water and cause algae to proliferate. That has destabilized lakes’ entire ecosystems. In the past, toxic chemicals and other waste used to be disposed of through drainage systems that ran straight into our lakes, as it was thought that the lakes could clean themselves. However, it became apparent that this was not the case, and measures began to be put in place starting in the 1960s: water treatment facilities were improved, and a ban was placed on phosphates in washing powders in 1985. As a result, Switzerland's lakes have become much cleaner. Yet, despite all these efforts, they still don't have enough oxygen.\nWith all the algae that have accumulated over the last 50 years, there is an immense amount of organic matter in deep-water sediment, and the bacteria that break down this matter consume a lot of oxygen. “Just because we've reduced the amount of phosphates coming from farming and industry doesn't mean that everything is as it should be. It'll take time before our lakes can breathe properly again,” says Damien Bouffard, who was involved in the research.\nBy precisely measuring the oxygen concentration throughout entire water columns and the sediment below, the researchers were able to explain how the oxygen is being depleted, with the sediment accounting for 30% of total oxygen depletion. The researchers were also able to create a model showing how oxygen depletion varies with depth, and they demonstrated how lake morphometry and decreasing organic matter mineralization in the water column largely affect oxygen depletion.\nUsing these micrometric data, the researchers created a large-scale model of oxygen dynamics in the lake and drew on their knowledge of water flows to predict what may happen going forward. Although the researchers hope that oxygen depletion in the sediment will gradually decrease, climate change will continue to have an impact on water exchanges. Further studies are therefore needed.\nThe findings were published in \nLimnology and Oceanography.\nPress Kit\nContacts\n Sandy Evangelista EPFL Press Service\n +4121 693 21 85\nRobert Schwefel Doctoral Assistant at the Laboratory of Aquatic Systems Physics\n +4121 693 37 87\nDamien Bouffard group leader at the Laboratory of Aquatic Systems Physics\n +4177 461 18 37", "summary": "In order to gain insight into how lakes breathe, EPFL scientists have studied oxygen depletion in the depths of Lake Geneva – the first time such research has been carried out.

{"id": 1840, "text": "Some genes are involved in the development of the fetus. However, studies have shown that the same genes control different body parts, e.g. digits and genitals. Furthermore, these genes are also regulated in the same way, which makes it even harder to know how the same genes give rise to two distinct types of organs. In a breakthrough study published in Science, EPFL and University of Geneva scientists have shown that a family of developmental genes called the “Hox genes” are regulated by a nearby, long DNA sequence. This sequence loops around and covers the Hox genes, allowing only certain genes to be active at a time.\nOne of the greatest revelations that came from mapping the human genome in 2001 was that, despite our body’s complexity, we actually don’t have many more genes than simpler animals like worms. The reason is that, in mammals, genes are used and re-used many times for different purposes. This phenomenon is particularly true for genes that regulate the development of a fetus, such as the family of Hox genes. These are a group of 39 related genes that produce the complete blueprint, or body plan, of an animal by regulating the placement of segment structures in early embryonic development; in other words, Hox genes dictate where body parts will go.\nThe Hox genes sit clustered together in the cell’s DNA, surrounded by long sequences of DNA that contain no genes whatsoever. However, these seemingly empty spaces of DNA actually contain small, discrete sequences that have been shown to bind and interact with the Hox gene cluster and regulate the Hox genes. The question is, since Hox genes are responsible for different tissues and organs, are they controlled in the same way?\nAn EPFL team of researchers led by Denis Duboule has now shown that these long DNA sequences actually enable Hox genes to be expressed in multiple tissues in the fetus. This allows the Hox genes to produce diverse organs of the developing body. The researchers call the long DNA sequences a “regulatory archipelago”, while the small, discrete sequences are “islands”. The idea is that the archipelago folds over the cluster of Hox genes and binds to them with its “islands”. Then it subtly shifts around to activate the Hox genes needed for that particular tissue or organ.\nTo go into more detail, when the archipelago covers the Hox genes, it forms a DNA complex. This is in turn controlled by chemical signals coming from surrounding cells. These signals act on the 3D structure of the DNA complex, causing changes in its structure. Though subtle, the changes nonetheless determine which combinations of Hox genes are going to be expressed at any given time. In this way, the same Hox genes can be used to regulate different structures in the body.\nIn this study, lead author Nicolas Lonfat focused on one member of the Hox gene family, Hoxd13, which controls the development of digits (fingers) and genitals in mice. He discovered two DNA “island” sequences, one interacting only with Hoxd13 in digits, while the other in exclusively in genitals. This way, he was able to connect each “island” with the part of the body it controlled.\nThe study has significant implications of how we understand the evolution of gene regulation. “Since animals with four limbs are late in terms of evolution, it would seem as if nature ‘hijacked’ some of these genes to make genitals and digits,” says Denis Duboule. In addition, the findings help explain how congenital diseases and deformities arise, such as hand-foot-genital syndrome, which results when a Hox gene is incorrectly regulated. As Duboule explains: “The ‘regulatory archipelago’ is a very precise mechanism that allows tremendous efficiency for the cell. The downside, however, is that is it is fragile and susceptible to errors.”\nThe study’s authors suggest that this system of gene control extends beyond developmental genes and variations of it may exist for all pleiotropic genes.\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL with the University of Geneva.\nReference\nLonfat N, Montavon T, Darbellay F, Gitto S, Duboule D.

Under this program spearheaded by EPFL, the students spent 16 days in Hong Kong and Shenzhen learning about the different steps involved in making a prototype. By the end of the Camp, four groundbreaking devices were developed and then unveiled in a presentation to the public this fall. “It was an impressive achievement, because the students had an average of only one day a week to work on their projects,” said Marc Laperrouza, head of the CHIC program.\nBecoming a musician without an instrument\nOut of the students’ four innovations,  is the most fun. This system includes two sensor-equipped drumsticks, an accelerometer and a gyroscope that let you play the drums virtually. It also comes with an application, so you can record your songs, run a metronome or play with other users through a multi-player feature. “With Tikku, we are targeting more the games market than the market for simulators,” said the students, who plan on continuing the development work alongside their studies. \nAnother invention, , is a food container that lets you take meals with you and heat them up on the go. This wireless, battery-powered device can be programmed using a smartphone application. “Too many people wolf down a sandwich at lunch because they’re short on time. We wanted to develop a practical system that lets people eat a hot meal, even when they’re away from home,” said Chenyue Xu, a materials engineering student at EPFL and part of the group that came up with Hibachi.\nSharing your mailbox\nThe third innovation is , which lets people exchange items through a secure physical mailbox using a virtual key sent via an application. The device is affordable and sturdy, and can be tailored to any type of mailbox. It’s a clever system that can be used in an entire neighborhood or at a university, for example, to set up a common post box.\nAnd the fourth, , aims to make cycling safer with a connected bicycle helmet equipped with an audio GPS and turn signals. “By improving bike riders’ safety, we hope more people in cities will switch to cycling as a means of transportation,” said Audrey Marullaz, a microengineering student.\nWhile each of the four projects was unique, the students all faced some of the same challenges. “The hardest part was learning to work together despite our very different ways of seeing things,” said Victor Guittet, a student at ECAL. “And the language barrier was a big hurdle when we were in China. We had to be creative and come up with inventive work-arounds. It was a great learning experience.”\nThe 2017 Camp kicked off this fall with a workshop attended by 45 students from EPFL, UNIL, ECAL and UNIGE.

You’ll be able to touch and move real-world objects just like their virtual counterparts. And if you look down, you’ll see your fingers; your virtual hands will reproduce even the slightest movement. This kind of unparalleled immersive experience is exactly what Hugo Hueber, a Bachelor’s student in computer science at EPFL, is aiming to create through an enhanced VR video game he is working on as part of his project.\n“My goal was to develop a video game that combines the latest technology with the 3D interactive research we’re carrying out at the lab. That will let video gamers interact physically with a virtual environment that can be transferred to any location – a living room, office or even classroom – instantly,” says Hueber.\nThat requires first measuring real-world objects like a chair and then modeling and calibrating them in the video game, which can be done in just a few clicks. Once this is done, players can use the object in the game at the same time as they physically touch it with their fingers. Achieving this was a formidable technical challenge for the Master’s student, but it seriously enhances the immersive experience for users.\nSeeing your fingers in 3D\nAnother feature of Hueber’s technology is that it improves users’ perception of their fingers, further blurring the line between virtual and reality. His system doesn’t require a joystick – a piece of equipment that lessens the sense of reality. Rather, users can see each of their fingers and move them with a great deal of precision, for instance tapping them together or picking up an object with ease. And that’s not all – by placing sensors on their bodies, users can see themselves move inside a video game. “The system tracks the sensors’ movements and generates real-time images of those movements as they affect different parts of the body.

In the summer, the heat generated by people packed into unairconditioned cars spills out into the platforms, and in the winter, the railcar heating system ends up warming the tunnels, too. Margaux Peltier, a scientific assistant at EPFL’s Laboratory of Soil Mechanics (LMS), came up with an idea for recovering this excess heat with geothermal panels, and then using it to heat water in the summer or nearby buildings in the winter. Her invention was selected to represent Switzerland in the finals of the ClimateLaunchPad competition, which will be held in Amsterdam on 14–15 November.\nSoon to be tested in a Lausanne parking garage\nThe geothermic panels were developed by Enerdrape, a startup that Peltier founded in 2018. They consist of layers of a heat-absorbing material and a system of tubes that run behind the panels and contain a heat transfer fluid. For the past year, Peltier has been enhancing the design of her panels through research conducted under the supervision of Lyesse Laloui at the LMS. “We were able to achieve yields of 70–100 Watts per square meter in our initial lab tests, which is excellent,” she says. Another benefit to her panels is that they appear to generate a fairly constant amount of energy, which makes them practical for real-world applications. The second prototype, built specifically for pilot runs, should be tested in a Lausanne parking garage soon. Because Peltier’s panels are modular, they can be installed on any type of wall configuration, including those found in parking garages, subway stations, train tunnels and more.\nCompeting against 50 other countries\nThe innovative geothermal panels were selected this past September as Switzerland’s entry in the international ClimateLaunchPad competition.

{"id": 1861, "text": "A group of scientists in EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, under the leadership of EPFL professor Michael Grätzel, has improved the efficiency of the famous Grätzel solar cells to 12.3%. This performance is now comparable to silicon-based solar panels that are on the market today. And the costs of using this technology have come down slightly. Their results appeared in an article in the November 4 issue of Science magazine.\nThe challenge was to increase the efficiency of the dye-sensitized cells, in order to produce more electricity. To do this, the chemists replaced the standard dye components – ruthenium and iodine – with porphyrin and cobalt. This combination allows them to increase the absorption of sunlight and results in a more efficient electron exchange. It’s this exchange of electrons from the dye to the substrate that produces electricity.\nGrätzel cells mimic the process of plant photosynthesis, and these new dye-sensitized cells take the imitation even closer -- the new chemical combination gives them a greenish tint. This color increases the efficiency of the process that converts light energy into electricity. To get the most out of the light coming from the Sun, the cell absorbs the colors of the spectrum with the highest energies and rejects the rest, which includes the green wavelengths.\nGrätzel cells can be used to create flexible, transparent solar panels. They’re a promising alternative for certain applications in which traditional rigid, silicon-based panels cannot be used. In addition, this new efficiency benchmark brings them well within the efficiency range of silicon cells: the theoretical maximum efficiency of Grätzel cells is now 30%, compared with 26% for silicon.\nSource:\nPorphyrin-Sensitized Solar Cells with Cobalt (II/III)–Based Redox Electrolyte Exceed 12 Percent Efficiency\n, Aswani Yella, Hsuan-Wei Lee, Hoi Nok Tsao, Chenyi Yi, Aravind Kumar Chandiran, Md.Khaja Nazeeruddin, Eric Wei-Guang Diau, Chen-Yu Yeh, Shaik M Zakeeruddin, Michael Grätzel, \nScience\n, Vol. 334 no. 6056 pp. 629-634, 4 novembre 2011.\nLink:", "summary": "Dye-sensitized Grätzel solar cells have just set a new efficiency benchmark.

{"id": 1862, "text": "Dominique Pioletti’s first visit to EPFL came at the age of three when he accompanied his father, an Italian immigrant truck driver. At the time, the campus was still a building site. Fast forward to today and Pioletti, whose mother is Swiss, goes to the School every day in his role as an associate professor. On sunny days, he likes to make the journey in his red 1960s Fiat 500 – a car he’d long dreamed of owning before he finally got his hands on one. “Every time I get behind the wheel, it’s like a new adventure,” he says. “I can never be sure it’s going to start.”\nPioletti, whose background is in physics, enrolled as a student at EPFL in 1987. A self-confessed risk-taker, he enjoys the thrill of teaching. “I thrive on pressure,” he explains. “The students are demanding and you get instant feedback. As a researcher, it’s important to remain grounded.” Pioletti spends a lot of his time teaching. Last year, he , giving students a chance to work directly on clinical problems encountered by doctors. Pioletti has received the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching 2019 in recognition of his project-based model, the implementation of new lab sessions, and of the overall standard of his teaching.\nPutting knowledge into practice\nConvincing busy surgeons in Lausanne, Geneva, Bern and Zurich to give some of their time to students was no easy task. But as luck would have it, Pioletti has built up an extensive network of contacts over the years. He even considered a career in medicine at one stage, but decided to opt for engineering after realizing that dealing with patients wasn’t his thing. Despite his change of heart, he’s never lost his interest in devising new ways to “take better care of people.” In his own words, Pioletti has long been “immersed in the world of medicine” – ever since he wrote his thesis on the mechanical behavior of cruciate knee ligament tissue. He’d even torn his own cruciate ligaments twice before completing his PhD: once playing soccer and a second time while skiing.\nThe students enrolled in his Master’s class last year enjoyed the full benefits of Pioletti’s interdisciplinary expertise. They spent 14 weeks, in groups of four or five, dealing firsthand with real-life problems encountered by the doctors who agreed to take part. “The students were much more motivated than I could have hoped for,” says Pioletti. “The projects force them to apply their knowledge while taking into account real-world constraints, and to interact with people from different disciplines. It helps get them ready for working life.”\nFor Pioletti, who heads up EPFL’s Laboratory of Biomechanical Orthopedics (LBO), there’s no substitute for the hands-on application of classroom learning. That is why he reworked his experimental methods in biomechanics course, a Bachelor’s-level mechanical engineering class, along these lines. Pioletti gives the students six open-ended questions inspired by research at LBO. For instance, he recently asked students what biomechanical tests they would recommend to a surgeon working with an artificial tendon. After a brief introduction to the theory behind each question, the students are divided into pairs and have six hours to design a protocol and draw conclusions from their experiments. “The exercise teaches students how to conduct scientific experiments and how to keep a laboratory notebook,” explains Pioletti. “Ultimately, the process matters more than the end result.”\nPioletti says that he’s “rediscovered the joy of teaching” since introducing these new approaches, and that he “no longer gets frustrated by seeing students listen passively without applying what they’ve learned.” He also admits that the new class formats have forced him to “step outside his comfort zone”. For the proud owner of a 1960s Fiat 500, uncertainty comes with the territory.", "summary": "Dominique Pioletti, an associate professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering, has won the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching 2019.

Innovation Park is an ideal base for us, given our desire for long-term collaboration with our partners,” says Tobias Kober, Head of the Lausanne branch of Siemens.\nFor a decade now, a Siemens’ research team has been working on the facilities of CIBM and CHUV. The close collaboration began with the CHUV radiology department jointly developing, along with clinicians, new methods of brain and heart imaging to improve both diagnosis and patient comfort. In particular, this has resulted in the ability to automatically quantify the volumes of key structures in the brain, which helps in the diagnosis of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Results have already been implemented on commercial devices. “Since 2010, thousands of patients have benefited from these new techniques,” says Reto Meuli, Chair of the Radiology Department at the CHUV.\nIn addition, research in connection with EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS5, led by Jean-Philippe Thiran) and the research center CVMR (CardioVascular Magnetic Resonance, led by Matthias Stuber) has now resulted in a method that has already significantly improved image contrast. The goal now is to expand the range of conditions for MRI diagnosis by enhancing the quality and speed of acquisition. “MRI is a growing field,” affirms Tobias Kober.\n A dozen researchers, including two doctoral students supervised by Jean-Philippe Thiran, Professor at EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory and the Radiology Department of the CHUV, are working at this new center in Lausanne. On the hospital grounds of the CHUV, a group of 18 researchers supervised by Professor Matthias Stuber are developing new quantitative methods for MRI.\nOpened in 2010, EPFL Innovation Park encourages collaborations between industry and academia by hosting researchers and engineers from major corporations.

{"id": 1864, "text": "Some Swiss health insurance companies offer incentives to encourage people to walk 10,000 steps a day. This works out to about seven kilometers and over an hour of walking a day, in addition to any steps taken indoors. For most people, their already busy schedules mean it is not easy to find extra time to go walking, even if the steps do not have to be taken all in one go and can be broken down into 10- to 30-minute bouts. For his thesis, Derek Christie, a researcher in EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, spoke to over 70 of these frequent walkers in the Lake Geneva region. He looked at how these men and women organize their time, what they get out of so much walking, why they do it, and whether their behaviour might herald a change towards more sustainable mobility practices.\nFirst of all, Derek Christie’s thesis, which he presented on 20 April 2018, shows that regular walking is achievable for most people without a disability. To get started, you just need to be organized and highly motivated. From there, it’s possible get into a routine in which walking becomes part of your daily life. Most of the people he spoke to had begun frequent walking because of a particular event or in the context of a change in lifestyle – similar to what has been observed in people who give up smoking. The use of a pedometer, either mechanical or on a smartphone, often played a decisive role. Other triggers included Nordic walking, health problems (particularly cardiovascular issues) and the desire to lose weight.\nA simple way of improving one's well-being\nOnce they had made the change, most of the frequent walkers found it easy to keep up their routine over several months without being put off by inconveniences such as the weather. For the most part, they kept up their routine simply because of the pleasure they got out of it. Another key motivation was personal health, usually described as a general sense of well-being. \nA total of 74 volunteers took part in the study; 41 semi-directive recorded interviews were held, and 48 people were equipped with an offline GPS tracker that they carried in their pocket. Some people took part in both the interviews and the GPS monitoring, while others were involved in just one of the two phases of the study. A third phase, which comprised medical tests conducted in collaboration with the Geneva University Hospitals Health Bus (Bus Santé), involved 27 volunteers. This partnership with the Unit of Population Epidemiology in Geneva will form the basis of a more ambitious study planned for a later date. The aim will be to determine the relationship between regular walking and glycemia, total cholesterol, blood pressure, resting heart rate, body mass index and the waist-hip ratio.\nFacilitators and obstacles to walking\nA cross-analysis showed that time-management strategies like getting up earlier or changing the route on the way out or back were common. Walking was also facilitated – but not decisively – by parks and other green spaces. Some of the obstacles encountered included road traffic, narrow or missing sidewalks, slow traffic lights, and exposure to traffic noise, air pollution or tobacco smoke. Environmental motivations were rarely mentioned, and the researcher found no evidence of an informal community of frequent walkers, who usually do not know each other and tend to switch off while walking, keeping themselves rather closed off socially. Individual rather than collective motivations clearly emerged from the analysis.\nFinally, the thesis looked at whether these frequent walkers could be viewed as a pioneer group that might herald a shift towards a healthier model of walking-based mobility. Dr Christie found that most of these people like to keep to themselves while walking and are therefore unlikely to start a frequent walkers’ revolution. But the researcher concluded that: “public authorities, as well as the private sector and civil society organizations, can learn a lot from these pioneering walkers. It would be worthwhile to look in greater depth at what prompts people to take up this activity and what needs to be put in place in public spaces so that they can keep up their routine over the long term. This would be beneficial for both the walkers’ health and for mobility and the environment in general.”", "summary": "For his thesis, Derek Christie studied people who walk outdoors for more than one hour per day.

{"id": 1868, "text": "The Discovery Learning Program, fruit of a long-term educational reflection process, is taking shape today. For several years, various School stakeholders – professors, administration, deans, and teaching staff – have volunteered their time and shared their ideas to find solutions for the lack of time and space availability for EPFL’s practical laboratory courses. As the renovation of the ME building, where many of the new teaching laboratories will be located, nears completion, Thomas Rizzo, Dean of the School of Basic Sciences, shares his vision of the project with us.\n-\tYou’re among those who initiated this program… \nThis dates back to 2004, the year when I became dean of the School of Basic Sciences. Didier Trono, at that time Dean of the School of Life Sciences, and I were thinking about how we could bring our disciplines together and create more cross-disciplinary exchange. That’s how the idea was born. After that, a number of other professors got on board to develop it and define the academic content. Today it has become truly a group project. It’s maybe even the most transversal and bottom-up project that EPFL has ever undertaken.\n-\tWhat motivated you back then?\nThere were three sources of motivation. The first was the state of our laboratories; they were dated and lacked state of the art equipment; they really needed to be renovated. The second was the lack of space available for laboratory instruction in the new life sciences building. Finally there was a willingness and interest in recognizing the reality of the interdisciplinary dimension of scientific problems, and in offering our students the right sets of tools to tackle these problems in all their complexity.\n-\tWhy is it important to break down the barriers between disciplines these days?\nBecause in reality, problems don’t come with labels like “100% chemistry” or “100% physics”. And we want our students, who will have to deal with this reality in the professional workplace, to be capable of solving them. An important part of our new program is to encourage interdisciplinary projects, in which students from different sections work together, each bringing his or her own expertise to the endeavor. In this way they’ll learn to work with scientists in other disciplines, to understand the differences in jargon, approaches, and techniques. But to be able to do this, they must first of all be excellent in their own subject area! That’s why we need to maintain our primary priority on providing a solid educational foundation in every discipline.\n-\tUp until recently we were still talking about the Teaching Bridge. Why was this abandoned? \nIn 2010, the architect commissioned with renovating the ME building proposed the Teaching Bridge concept, which captured Patrick Aebischer’s interest. The architecture itself was very enticing, but it wasn’t well adapted to what we wanted to do and to the reality of our needs. Although the building has changed, the academic project, as a background concept, is still the same: create laboratories by subject area, then allow various degrees of overlap between disciplines, from simple collaborations to full-fledged interdisciplinary projects.\n-\tIn the future, will education favor practical laboratory courses over lecture courses and theory?\nI think that theory, computer simulation, and practical courses are all equally important and complement one another. I don’t think that education will fundamentally change. But we need to think about the way in which our students learn – will they do so with the same tools? Will they read books like they used to? And so on. We need to adapt to who they are today. When you learn something by experimentation – discovering it for yourself by touching and testing it, by noticing directly the consequences of this or that manipulation, by starting over again differently if it doesn’t work – you learn in a different way than if you simply discuss it. That’s why we chose this name, the Discovery Learning Labs.\n- Are the Discovery Learning Labs part of the same evolution we’re seeing with MOOCs?\nThe two are complementary. MOOCs, like our new way of organizing laboratory courses, are not designed to reduce contact between professors and students, but rather to provide a different kind of contact. There will be fewer lecture-hall courses, but certainly more interactions in the laboratory. The theory and experimental parts of a course will be more closely connected. For example, in the middle of a laboratory course, the professor could gather the students to explain a particular theoretical point. MOOCs, lecture courses, and laboratory courses are all tools, designed or re-designed to be more flexible, adaptable, and reconfigurable, thus giving professors more freedom in how they can best educate their students.\nDiscovery Learning Program:\nThe Flash online:", "summary": "By creating the Discovery Learning Labs, EPFL is increasing the emphasis placed on practical laboratory work.

{"id": 1870, "text": "The famous idiom “seeing is believing” is not enough to help amputees with the use of their prosthetic limb. Many amputees opt out of prolonged use of their prosthetic limb because their missing limb simply does not fit their prosthesis. In other words, their own perception of the missing limb, or the brain’s representation of it, does not match-up with \nwhat they see \nof the prosthesis.\nThe underlying problem is twofold. Amputees still feel their missing limb, even if it is physically gone, and this ghost limb aka phantom limb is perceived as much smaller that the lost limb. Next, the commercially available prosthetic limb does not yet provide sensory feedback other than what the patient sees, meaning that the patient has no sense of touch from the prosthetic limb and must constantly watch it for correct use.\nTricking the brain to embody the prosthetic limb\nNow, in a scientific collaboration led by EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne), scientists show that amputees can actually be convinced that the prosthetic hand belongs to their own body. They do this by going beyond the “seeing is believing” idiom based on established research on how the brain identifies what belongs to its own body. Instead of using the sense of sight alone, they used an astute combination of two senses: sight and touch. The results are published today in the \nJournal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry\n.\n“The brain regularly uses its senses to evaluate what belongs to the body and what is external to the body. We showed exactly how vision and touch can be combined to trick the amputee’s brain into feeling what it sees, inducing embodiment of the prosthetic hand with an additional effect that the phantom limb grows into the prosthetic one,” explains Giulio Rognini of EPFL’s Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroprosthetics led by Olaf Blanke, in a collaboration with Silvestro Micera of EPFL and Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Italy. “The setup is portable and could one day be turned into a therapy to help patients embody their prosthetic limb permanently.”\nIn two hand amputees, the scientists provided artificial tactile sensations at the tip of the index finger – of the phantom limb – by stimulating the patient’s nerve in the stump. At the same time, the patient wore virtual reality goggles which showed the index finger of the prosthetic limb glowing in synchrony with the administered touch sensations. This combination of virtual reality with artificial tactile sensations takes the  to another level.\nBoth patients reported feeling as though the prosthetic hand belonged to their own body. Moreover, when asked to evaluate the position of their hands, both patients felt as though their phantom limb had extended into the prosthetic limb. Previous to the experiment, they both reported that the phantom hand was small and directly connected to the stump, as if the phantom limb had no forearm, a change in size referred to as “telescoping” in scientific jargon. In fact, their phantom limb extended during the experiment, and remained extended for up to 10 minutes afterwards.\nThe experiment simply requires the patient to passively observe two sensations on the fingertip, the visual glow and the artificial touch \nhappening in synchrony\n, in order for embodiment and extension of the phantom limb to take place. This is the first time that the principles of multisensory integration, in particular how the brain integrates bodily multisensory information to create the coherent and compelling experience of \nhaving\n a body, have been tailored to provoke embodiment of the prosthetic hand and reduction of telescoping.\nBuilding upon results from a European-wide collaboration\nThe study builds upon research that opened new avenues is prosthetics. In 2014, in a European collaboration led by EPFL, scientists overcame a major hurdle by giving an . Information about touch coming from sensors at the prosthetic fingertips were directly processed and relayed into the nervous system via electrodes that were surgically wired to the stump’s main nerves. The potential of this technology is still being explored, and two years later in 2016, the scientists showed that the enhanced prosthetic technology could even help the same .", "summary": "In a breakthrough approach that combines virtual reality and artificial tactile sensations, two amputees feel as though their prosthetic hand belongs to their own body.

{"id": 1871, "text": "Neurons communicate with each other by sending out rapid pulses of electrical signals called spikes. At first glance, the generation of these spikes can be very reliable: when an isolated neuron is repeatedly given exactly the same electrical input, we find the same pattern of spikes. Why, then, does the activity of cortical neurons in a live animal fluctuate and actually seem so variable?\nThere are two reasons for this. Firstly, when transmitting a signal to another neuron, the process can sometimes fail and these failures are unpredictable – like rolling a die to decide on an outcome. “We estimate the chance of a synapse between two cortical pyramidal neurons passing a chemical neurotransmitter signal can be as low as 10%,” explains lead researcher Max Nolte. This uncertainty means that a neuron will hear the same message sent by connected neurons differently every time.\nSecondly, when the two fundamental types of cortical neurons (excitatory and inhibitory) are interconnected in a network, small uncertainties in activity patterns become amplified. This leads to unpredictable patterns, a behavior that is called chaos.\nThis backdrop of noise and chaos suggests that individual cortical neurons cannot find order and fire reliable spikes, and so the brain has to ‘average’ the activity of many neurons for certainty – listen to the whole choir instead of individual singers.\nSimulation neuroscience finds the answer\nThe experimental manipulations required to untangle the noise sources in the brain and evaluate their impact on neuronal activity are currently impossible to perform in a live animal \nin vivo\n, or even in separated brain tissue \nin vitro\n. “For the moment, it is simply not possible to monitor all of the thousands of brain-wide inputs to a neuron \nin vivo\n, nor to turn on and off different noise sources,” says Nolte. The closest approximation of cortical tissue to date in a model is the Blue Brain Project’s biologically detailed digital reconstruction of rat neocortical microcircuitry (Cell 2015). This computer model provided the ideal platform for the researchers to study to what degree the voices of individual neurons can be understood, as it contains data-constrained models of the unreliable signal transmission between neurons.\nUsing this model, they found that activity that is spontaneously generated from the interconnected neurons is highly noisy and chaotic, depicting very different spike times in each repetition. “We studied the origin and nature of cortical internal variability with a biophysical neocortical microcircuit model with biologically realistic noise sources,” reveals Nolte. “We observed that the unreliable neurotransmitter signals are amplified by recurrent network dynamics, causing a rapidly decaying memory of the past – a sea of noise and chaos.”\nReliable responses amidst noise and chaos\nBut, of course the mammalian brain does not have a rapidly decaying memory. In fact, perhaps the most fascinating insight from the findings is that spike times that were highly unreliable during spontaneous activity became highly reliable when the circuit received external inputs. This phenomenon was not simply a result of strong external input directly driving the neurons to reliable responses. Even weak thalamocortical input could switch the network briefly to a regime of highly reliable spiking. At that point, the interactions between the neurons that otherwise amplify uncertainty and chaos conversely amplify reliability and allow the brain to find order.\n“Thalamocortical stimuli can prompt reliable spike times with millisecond precision amid noise and chaos,” explains Blue Brain Founder and Director, Prof. Henry Markram. “Surprisingly, we were able to demonstrate that this effect relies on the cortical neurons working as a team. Our model thus shows that noise and chaos in networks of cortical neurons are compatible with reliable spiking, allowing the brain to find order. This finding suggests that the highly fluctuating activity of cortical neurons in a live animal is reflecting order, not noise and chaos,” Markram concludes.", "summary": "How does the brain find order amidst a sea of noise and chaos?

To make this abstract subject more accessible for Bachelor’s level students, EPFL teacher Toralf Scharf came up with an experimental kit.

{"id": 1877, "text": "EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR), located within the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), has been breaking new ground in sociological research for a decade and a half. Lab head Vincent Kaufmann spoke with us about the benefits that this type of research has already brought to EPFL and the new areas he is exploring.\nWhat goals did you have for LaSUR when you set it up in 2003?\nWe wanted to go beyond the strict definition of urban sociology put forth by the Chicago school in the 1920s, which was to study “the man endowed with locomotion”. We used that definition as a starting point, then looked at how sociology can be incorporated into the fields of engineering and architecture. This vision, coupled with the work done by Luca Pattaroni and Yves Pedrazzini – both senior scientists at LaSUR – enabled us to come up with an entirely new discipline called “polytechnic sociology”. Unlike traditional sociology, our new approach also draws on engineering methods like modeling and architectural concepts like how a space is used. The idea is to look at problems from the perspective of city residents – the individuals who live there day in and day out – to better understand what a neighborhood needs to best serve its inhabitants.\nWhat purpose do the social sciences serve in an engineering school? \nEngineering is fundamentally a human science; it can’t exist apart from society. Within an engineering school, the social sciences serve to put the focus of technological development back on the humans using the technology. Buildings and other structures – whether designed by architects or civil engineers – are rarely perceived by their users in the same way as they were conceived and “created” by their designers. As humans, we have an excellent capacity to see things differently and to critique them. Our discipline of engineering sociology aims to discover how architects and engineers can use that capacity to construct more livable cities that are at once equitable and respectful of differences.\nWhat’s it like teaching sociology to engineers? \nI had to quickly learn to tone down the sociological academic jargon if I wanted to be understood. That wasn’t easy! But I came to realize that the jargon really isn’t that important – concepts can be explained perfectly well in layman’s terms. In return, I learned more about architecture and engineering and have drawn on those concepts in my teaching. At our lab we have seen that sociology can serve as a link among the various fields taught in ENAC’s interdisciplinary programs, which bring together students from architecture and engineering.\nWhat’s your impression looking back at these 15 years of research at EPFL?\nI think the social sciences have played an important role in research innovation at our school. We have published some 600 articles in trade journals for engineering, architecture and sociology. Some of our articles are cited frequently, such as those exploring the concept of “motility.” For instance, Pattaroni’s new ways of conceptualizing lifestyles show that people are influenced not only by socio-economic factors but also by the built space around them. One of our former PhD students even created her own consulting firm based on this idea. And some EPFL architects such as Inès Lamunière and Emmanuel Rey have incorporated our findings into their practice. The EPFL Transportation Center we opened with Michel Bierlaire in 2009, and with the help of Michaël Thémans, is doing well; researchers there are looking at how the social sciences can be used to develop mobility solutions for the future. Companies including Toyota, Renault, EDF and SNCF have commissioned joint research projects with the center. However, what we’re most proud of is that many of our former PhD students now work as professors in universities around the world.\nDo engineering schools often incorporate sociology into their teaching and research? \nNNot really. At MIT, 10% of research funding are dedicated to the social sciences, which is a large percentage. Berkeley also allocates a considerable sum, as do a few engineering schools in the UK. But EPFL is the only engineering school in continental Europe to take a close look at the field – and we are starting to make a name for ourselves. Researchers from other schools have been visiting us regularly over the past few years to learn more about our approach. In 2017, French transportation minister Élisabeth Borne asked us to give her a presentation of our key findings when she first took office. And in December we gave a presentation to Tongji University, since they would like to open a similar lab in Shanghai.\nWhat will LaSUR be working on in the coming years?\nWe are currently addressing three new research topics. The first aims to develop software that can help architects promote energy-efficient lifestyles. The software is intended to be used in the planning phase of a project. The second looks at “the urban pace of life,” factoring in concepts from transportation engineering. The goal is to help us understand why the pace of life has accelerated so much since the 1980s and what we can do to calm things down. The third relates more closely to sociology, and involves studying the different kinds of urban hospitality we have here in Switzerland. That is, how our country’s cities accommodate expatriates, refugees and cross-border workers. This third topic is being sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).\nSociology at EPFL\n1969\n: The Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) was created.\n1971\n: EPFL appointed its first sociology professor, within its Institute of architecture, and created the \nInstitute of Building Research (IREC)\n bringing together political scientists, economists, urban planners, geographers, architects and sociologists.\n2001\n: IREC became \nINTER, \na research institute within the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC).

{"id": 1878, "text": "Have the Swiss government’s lockdown measures been effective in stemming the pandemic? That’s the question a team of EPFL researchers set out to answer by analyzing data dating back to 28 February, the day the Swiss government banned groupings of over 1,000 people. This initial restriction was followed by a series of others that culminated in a ban on groupings of over five people, introduced on 20 March. “It’s essential for policymakers to be able to quantify how effective these measures are in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, so that they can make the right decisions for both this pandemic and future ones,” says Jacques Fellay, the study’s coauthor. Fellay, a medical researcher at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences, also sits on the Swiss federal government’s COVID-19 scientific advisory board. The team’s findings\nTheir method involves using an epidemiological model to calculate the virus’s “basic reproduction number,” or R\n0\n, over the course of the pandemic on both a national and cantonal level. The model uses detailed data on over 1,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Vaud as well as publicly available information on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in Switzerland. “We were fortunate to have access to key data such as the length of hospital stays – including in intensive care units – which isn’t always the case in this type of study. That allowed us to tailor our model to the specific clinical conditions in Switzerland,” says Joseph Lemaitre, a PhD student at EPFL’s Laboratory of Ecohydrology and the study’s lead author.\nThe research team found that on a national level, R\n0\n fell from 2.8 at the start of the pandemic to 0.4 in early April – a decrease of 86%. Looking at individual cantons, R\n0\n dropped between 53% (in Jura) and 92% (in Basel-Stadt). The reduction in people’s movements was measured using smartphone data: trips for work, shopping and recreational activities fell between 50% and 75% on a national level and between 30% and 80% on a cantonal level. The researchers also found a strong correlation between a reduction in people’s movements and a decrease in R\n0\n, even though this rate actually started declining a few days before people began changing their habits.\nCaption:\n R\n0\n time series calculated by the researchers’ model. Median = dashed line; interquartile range = dark grey; 95% confidence interval = light grey. 1 = ban on groupings of more than 1,000 people; 2 = closure of schools; 3 = closure of all non-essential businesses; 4 = ban on groupings of more than 5 people. / J. Lemaitre et al., SMW, 2020\nAccording to the study, R\n0\n began falling on 6 March – at least one week before Swiss schools were officially closed. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health rolled out its COVID-19 information campaign on 28 February and updated it on 2 March with a heightened focus on personal hygiene measures. This campaign raised awareness about the gravity of the situation and prompted people to follow the government’s personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations. As a result, R\n0\n started falling before the recommendations became mandatory. “R\n0\n was already close to 1 when the government banned groupings of more than five people and asked that everyone stay at home. Of course, that may be partly due to the fact that people saw those requirements coming and changed their behavior accordingly – by adopting social distancing measures, for example – even before the official announcement, as suggested by data on internet searches,” says Lemaitre.\nThe researchers’ model indicates that 3.9% of the Swiss population has been infected by the new coronavirus (as of 24 April), with cantonal rates ranging from 1.9% in Bern to 16% in Ticino.\nCaption: \nPercentage of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland up to 24 April.

Unmodeled cantons are shown in grey with points indicating the national-level estimated incidence proportion of 3%. / J. Lemaitre et al., SMW, 2020\nNow that the lockdown measures are gradually being lifted, the research team plans to publish their R\n0\n estimate daily. Tracking this metric closely will be essential since the spread of the virus can only be slowed through people’s behaviors, and not by waiting until we achieve herd immunity – which is still far off. “Will we see a rise in infections now that restaurants and shops are opening back up? Could that rise be contained through a more aggressive testing and tracing strategy? And how helpful are masks?” says Fellay. “We still don’t have the answers to those questions – which is why we must track epidemiological indicators closely. Daily R\n0\n figures will be a useful guide for public-health policymakers in the coming months. Researchers can help by continually enhancing their models with new data, such as the results of the serological tests that are being carried out or the more detailed information we now have on how COVID-19 develops in clinical patients.”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have modeled the effects of measures taken in the country to slow the spread of coronavirus.

{"id": 1881, "text": "2D materials, which consist of a few layers of atoms, may well be the future of nanotechnology. They offer potential new applications and could be used in small, higher-performance and more energy-efficient devices. 2D materials were first discovered almost 15 years ago, but only a few dozen of them have been synthesized so far. Now, thanks to an approach developed by researchers from EPFL's Theory and Simulation of Materials Laboratory (THEOS) and from NCCR MARVEL for Computational Design and Discovey of Novel Materials, many more promising 2D materials may now be identified. Their work was recently published in the journal \nNature Nanotechnology\n, and even got a mention on the cover page.\nThe first 2D material to be isolated was graphene, in 2004, earning the researchers who discovered it a Nobel Prize in 2010. This marked the start of a whole new era in electronics, as graphene is light, transparent and resilient and, above all, a good conductor of electricity. It paved the way to new applications in numerous fields such as photovoltaics and optoelectronics.\n\"To find other materials with similar properties, we focused on the feasibility of exfoliation,” explains Nicolas Mounet, a researcher in the THEOS lab and lead author of the study. \"But instead of placing adhesive strips on graphite to see if the layers peeled off, like the Nobel Prize winners did, we used a digital method.\"\nMore than 100,000 materials analyzed\nThe researchers developed an algorithm to review and carefully analyze the structure of more than 100,000 3D materials recorded in external databases. From this, they created a database of around 5,600 potential 2D materials, including more than 1,000 with particularly promising properties. In other words, they've created a treasure trove for nanotechnology experts.\nTo build their database, the researchers used a step-by-step process of elimination. First, they identified all of the materials that are made up of separate layers. \"We then studied the chemistry of these materials in greater detail and calculated the energy that would be needed to separate the layers, focusing primarily on materials where interactions between atoms of different layers are weak, something known as Van der Waals bonding,\" says Marco Gibertini, a researcher at THEOS and the second author of the study.\nA plethora of 2D candidates\nOf the 5,600 materials initially identified, the researchers singled out 1,800 structures that could potentially be exfoliated, including 1,036 that looked especially easy to exfoliate. This represents a considerable increase in the number of possible 2D materials known today. They then selected the 258 most promising materials, categorizing them according to their magnetic, electronic, mechanical, thermal and topological properties.\n\"Our study demonstrates that digital techniques can really boost discoveries of new materials,\" says Nicola Marzari, the director of NCCR MARVEL and a professor at THEOS. \"In the past, chemists had to start from scratch and just keep trying different things, which required hours of lab work and a certain amount of luck. With our approach, we can avoid this long, frustrating process because we have a tool that can single out the materials that are worth studying further, allowing us to conduct more focused research.\"\nIt is also possible to reproduce the researchers' calculations thanks to their software AiiDA, which describes the calculation process for each material discovered in the form of workflows and stores the full provenance of each stage of the calculation. \"Without AiiDA, it would have been very difficult to combine and process different types of data,\" explains Giovanni Pizzi, a senior researcher at THEOS and co-author of the study. \"Our workflows are available to the public, so anyone in the world can reproduce our calculations and apply them to any material to find out if it can be exfoliated.\"", "summary": "A team from EPFL and NCCR MARVEL has identified more than 1,000 materials with a particularly interesting 2D structure.

{"id": 1882, "text": "While the technology for recycling PET already exists, the systems currently out there have a number of limitations. For example, there is no way to create plastic bottles made entirely of recycled PET – at least some of the raw materials must be new. “That means purchasing them from refineries, which convert oil into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, the two compounds needed to make PET,” says Samantha Anderson, founder & CEO of DePoly and a PhD student at the Laboratory of Molecular Simulation (LSMO) at EPFL’s Valais-Wallis campus. In addition, many PET containers can’t be recycled because they contain chemical and food contaminants, additives or dyes – most of these containers end up being incinerated.\nRecycling through depolymerization\nDePoly has developed an innovative method that can recycle just about any PET container using a chemical process that breaks down the plastic into its base compounds. “It doesn’t matter if the container held water, peanut butter or soap, or if it’s crystal clear or pitch black,” says Anderson. With the new method, PET containers don’t have to be sorted by color, meaning they can all be processed in one batch. The method also works with fabrics like polyester, breaking down old t-shirts, for example, into cotton and PET fibers.\nThe chemical process involves depolymerizing the PET – hence the name DePoly. “We combine the plastic with various compounds in a reactor and then apply light to the mixture to trigger a series of chemical reactions. These reactions break the bonds between the ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, freeing up the compounds for further use,” says Anderson. The process results in ethylene glycol in clear liquid form and terephthalic acid as a white powder, which are then easily separable. The process also generates a small amount of dyes, additives and other waste. Anderson will not reveal any more details, since a patent for the technology is pending.\nSamantha Anderson, founder of DePoly, at the awards ceremony >>venture>>> © Alessandro Della Bella \nAn award-winning innovation\nThis year DePoly competed in the 2019 >>venture>> competition, in the Hardware category, and took home the grand prize. >>venture>> is a Swiss entrepreneurship competition held every year by EPFL, ETH Zurich, McKinsey & Company, Knecht Holding and Innosuisse. Winners receive 150,000 francs and a package of business consulting services. They also join the >>venture>> network to make contacts and boost their visibility.\nTo develop the method, Anderson teamed up with two LSMO colleagues: postdoc Christopher Ireland and PhD student Bardiya Valizadeh. “DePoly had already received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation and an Innogrant before winning >>venture>>,” says Professor Berend Smit, head of LSMO, the lab that supported the research. “I’m very proud of the team’s success.”\nMembers of the start-up DePoly: Bardiya Valizadeh, Samantha Anderson and Christopher Ireland © Patrick Favre\nTests on an industrial scale\nThe next step for DePoly will be to scale up its technology from the lab to industry. “In November, we will begin building a pilot unit with more capacity than the lab,” says Anderson. The unit, located at the Central Valais Waste Treatment Plant in Uvrier, will allow the startup to test and refine its method so that it performs well under industrial conditions. “The testing phase will probably last a year,” says Anderson. “I’m sure chemical recycling methods for PET will eventually hit the market – if not our method, then someone else’s. We aren’t the only ones working on this approach.”\nFor now Anderson is dividing her time between managing DePoly and writing her thesis.

{"id": 1883, "text": "How we move is an excellent indicator of overall health. When we feel good, we move around continually. When we’re in pain, we reduce our physical activity. This observation might seem trivial, but it has led to an original approach for evaluating chronic pain. A team from EPFL’s has developed a clever, easy-to-use visual tool to help doctors assess their patients’ pain levels. The research appears online February 23 in\n “Movement is an objective indicator of pain. You move differently if you’re in pain than you do if you’re completely healthy,” explains EPFL scientist Anisoara Ionescu. “It’s important for doctors to be able to evaluate that pain as precisely as possible.” Using data collected by sensors placed on different parts of the body, she explains, a doctor can quantify a patient’s suffering, monitor progress and adapt treatment appropriately. \n Doctors typically try to assess the severity of chronic pain with an in-depth oral evaluation using a series of standard questionnaires. This method, however, gives a very static view of the patient’s condition – how he or she felt on this day, at that time. There are other problems with this approach as well. Patients rate their pain on a scale from 1 to 10; but obviously we don’t all feel a “5” in the same way. And some patients, such as children or the cognitively impaired, are simply unable to describe or communicate their pain at all.\nMovement as an indicator\n The EPFL study monitored the physical activity of 15 healthy, pain-free subjects and 60 patients suffering from chronic pain. Sensors equipped with gyroscopes and accelerometers were attached to their chests and adjacent to their knees and ankles. The sensors recorded all the subjects’ movements and periods of rest. The result: those who reported chronic pain moved differently than the healthy subjects; in particular, their active periods were punctuated by numerous brief rest intervals. Using the new tool, the researchers were able to take data several days before, during and after treatment. Results from the different periods could be compared to obtain a precise assessment of how the treatment changed a patient’s day to day activities. \n “There is definitely a difference in behavior between healthy and chronically ill patients,” says Dr. Eric Buchser, a professor at the hospital in Morges, Switzerland, who is participating in the study. “But we’re just starting to collect data. We still need to gather more and establish objective reference values between patients.”\nPain – in all its manifestations\n The LMAM laboratory has been working with the department of anesthesiology and pain management at the Morges hospital, which Buchser heads, for ten years. “Our first studies focused on acute pain, and then we moved to the more persistent, nagging suffering known as chronic pain. However, we had very little objective information on the intensity of this kind of pain.”\n Walking, running, sitting, and lying down are all objective indicators. The scientists defined 18 different activity states: various combinations of activity type, intensity, duration, and how the activity is distributed over time. They used the temporal sequence of these different states to develop a visual tool, a kind of color ‘barcode,’ that would be easy for doctors to use on a daily basis. The structural complexity of the barcode was an indication of pain intensity. In a single glance, a doctor can see a patient’s situation, his or her progress, and the effect of an applied treatment protocol. Buchser has high hopes for the tool. “Eventually, the doctor could use this physical activity “barcode” to help make a diagnosis, better target a therapy, evaluate its effectiveness, and adapt it appropriately over time.”", "summary": "Chronic pain has a significant impact on the physical, social and emotional functioning of those who suffer from it.

{"id": 1884, "text": "EPFL Innovation Park is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and its track record speaks for itself. Building A was officially opened in 1993 and has since been joined by 12 others. That building is today being renamed to honor the memory of Claudine and Bernard Vittoz, who founded EPFL Science Park and were generous benefactors.\nEPFL Innovation Park (EIP) currently houses more than 2,250 employees, 26 large companies, 116 start-ups and more than 75 entrepreneurial projects at the incubator stage – all this on the edge of a campus containing some 340 laboratories. These are impressive figures given that the science park's first seed was planted only 25 years ago.\nIn 1991, when EPFL President Bernard Vittoz launched the Science Park Foundation, he was a pioneer. His ambition was to create a space that would stimulate innovation and the transfer of technology by bringing start-ups and companies close to the university campus, its researchers and students. In 1993, there was the official opening of Building A, the first in a blossoming complex that now features 13 buildings. That marked the creation of Switzerland's first science park, which was renamed EPFL Innovation Park in 2014.\nA new name\nOver its 25-year history, Building A has housed more than 100 start-ups. Today, after an impressive refurbishment, it is celebrating its anniversary by adopting a new name. As a tribute to Bernard Vittoz, as well as his wife Claudine who recently left part of her estate to the Foundation, the building now bears their names. “Professor Vittoz was a visionary who understood very early on the importance of physical proximity between researchers and entrepreneurs,” remembers Jean-Philippe Lallement, CEO of the EPFL Innovation Park Foundation. “His drive and charisma allowed the plan to take shape and develop. Mrs. Vittoz also gave the plan her wholehearted support.”\nThe anniversary is also an opportunity for EIP to continue its development, in order to maintain its appeal and address the needs of its various user communities as effectively as possible. “EPFL Innovation Park is now almost full, so it’s important that we foster the innovative spirit of the companies we have here.

{"id": 1889, "text": "Josué Gehring is a second-year PhD student at EPFL. On 5 February 2018, he will go to South Korea with a group of around ten researchers from other countries to collect meteorological data in the mountains, close to the Winter Olympics venues of Pyeongchang, Gangneung and Jeongseon. His two-month stay will allow him to follow the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in their entirety. He is writing about the experience on the EPFL Out There blog, on which EPFL scientists post entries from all over the world.\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in environmental science and engineering at EPFL, Josué went to ETH Zurich to complete a master’s degree in atmospheric science. He came back to EPFL in 2017 and is currently a doctoral student in the Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (LTE) led by Alexis Berne.\nFor his PhD, Josué is looking at the meteorological conditions associated with intense riming in mountainous regions. The aim of his work is to achieve a better understanding of what causes major snowfalls and to characterize them more effectively. The ultimate goal is to improve weather forecasting in mountain areas.\nNew data\n In pursuit of the same goal, EPFL has collected a large volume of meteorological data in the last few years, particularly in the Valais region of Switzerland and the Antarctic. Those data have formed the basis of several scientific articles (see  and ). In South Korea, the proximity of mountains to the ocean produces different weather conditions from those seen in the Alps. By comparing data collected in these two regions, EPFL researchers will be able to gain a better understanding of the underlying dynamics.\nFour measurement devices\n Josué Gehring has already installed four measurement devices in the South Korean mountains with Alexis Berne, Christophe Praz (another LTE PhD student) and Jacques Grandjean, from MétéoSuisse: a precipitation radar, a cloud radar, a disdrometer (to measure the size of raindrops and snowflakes) and a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). The MASC, on loan from MétéoSuisse, takes millions of high-resolution photos of snowflakes from various angles, helping researchers to understand their structure. Working with Christophe Praz, Josué will manage all these instruments. He will have eight weeks to collect as much data as possible from the South Korean mountains. And as a keen cross-country skier, he will of course be keeping a close eye on how Swiss competitors fare in the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nThe ICE-POP 2018 international scientific campaign is an initiative of the Korea Meteorological Administration, in partnership with the World Meteorological Organization.", "summary": "Josué Gehring is about to spend two months taking part in an international meteorological measurement project in the mountains of South Korea, close to the 2018 Winter Olympics host venues.

{"id": 1891, "text": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by the appearance of protein clumps within neurons in the brain, called Lewy bodies. Reproducing Lewy bodies in animals in order to model the disease for research and drug screening has proven notoriously difficult, leaving a gap in Parkinson’s research and treatment. EPFL scientists have now shown where the discrepancy between humans and animals lies. Using the knowledge, the scientists have produced cellular and mouse models that reproduce the evolution of Parkinson’s disease more accurately for both fundamental research and drug development. The work is published in \nPNAS\n.\nA century-long problem\nLewy bodies consist mainly of a protein called “alpha-synuclein”. Abundant in the brain, alpha-synuclein is normally involved in the transmission of neuronal signals. But in Parkinson’s disease, alpha-synuclein clumps up, aggregates and finally tangles into stringy knots called fibrils; these are what form the Lewy bodies.\nEven though this has been known for almost a century, we still do not know why they form or how they contribute the progression of Parkinson’s disease. The main reason is that we do not have animal models that accurately reproduce the formation of Lewy bodies. In humans, Lewy bodies form when the brain produces twice the normal amount of alpha-synuclein. When mice, which are often used to model human diseases, are used to model Parkinson’s, they are genetically engineered to overproduce it. But human alpha-synuclein does not form fibrils and Lewy bodies when produced in mice.\nThe homologue interaction\nMice produce three types of their own synuclein, which are similar to human alpha-synuclein. Because of this, they are referred to as its “homologues”. One possibility is that the way human alpha-synuclein interacts with its homologues might be preventing it from forming Lewy bodies in mice. To determine if this is the case,  looked at what happened when human alpha-synuclein was produced in neurons from mice that were genetically engineered to miss either one or all three of their synuclein homologues.\nThe study, led by PhD student Mohamed-Bilal Fares, showed that mouse neurons that were missing one or all three homologues successfully formed clumps that are similar to Lewy bodies. Tests on mouse brains yielded similar results. Finally, the scientists found that the mouse homologues directly interact with earlier intermediates formed during the aggregation of human alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies. The mouse homologies interfere with their growth and spread throughout the brain.\nWhat all this means is that human alpha-synuclein does not form Lewy bodies in mice because its homologues in the animal prevent it from doing so. This discovery explains why it is so difficult to model Parkinson’s disease in normal mice, which have all of their synuclein homologues. In other words, the key to successfully modeling the disease in mice is to genetically suppress their homologues of human alpha-synuclein.\nA new model\nWorking off their genetically engineered mice and neuronal cultures, the team developed and characterized new models for Lewy bodies for the scientific and medical community. Hilal Lashuel expects that the new insights will advance the development of neuronal and in vivo models that reproduce features of Parkinson’s disease, and allow screening for new drugs. “We now have a very well-characterized model that offers a powerful tool for rapid screening of molecular pathways involved in Parkinson’s disease,” he says. “But because it can also allow us to understand how human alpha-synuclein forms fibrils inside neurons and how that contributes to the progression of the disease, we can develop better drugs and intervention strategies to prevent this disease.”\nThis work involved a collaboration between EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute, Brain Mind Institute, with the University of California San Diego, and Cardiff University. It was funded by EPFL, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust.\nReference\nFares M-B, Maco B, Oueslati A, Rockenstein E, Ninkina N, Buchman V, Masliah E, Lashuel HA. \nInduction of \nde novo\n α-Synuclein fibrillization in a neuronal model for Parkinson’s disease.\nPNAS\n 01 February 2016.
