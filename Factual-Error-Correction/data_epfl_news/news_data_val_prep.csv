Satellite constellations
In the new space age, satellites are becoming ever smaller – and smarter. Looking ahead, it seems as though satellite constellations are the future, with smaller devices such as CubeSats operating in tandem and forming a robust network that covers more of the Earth’s surface. This development owes much to advances in Internet of Things (IoT) systems.

In fact, the problem has become so acute in recent years that scientists are having to rethink mission design with junk in mind. The need for sustainable solutions has never been greater.
Sought-after expertise
EPFL is ideally placed to make the most of this new landscape. “Our skills and expertise are exactly what the space industry is looking for,” says Sonia Ben Hamida, a researcher who recently joined the eSpace team. “In many respects, it’s the perfect fit.”
eSpace’s logistics services could support operations and activities across a broad spectrum of fields, ranging from transport, storage, packaging and distribution, to location, telecommunications, navigation, repair and resupply.

Studying cells one by one
 All cells function in their own complex way. Cancer cells, for example, produce various hormones and proteins in order to spread and to invade healthy tissue; immune cells respond to an infection or an intruder by secreting chemical mediators called cytokines that stimulate the immune system to fight the enemy. But what is the actual mechanism underlying each cell's behavior?
 Numerous studies have been run on how groups of cells function, but we have precious little information on the behavior of individual cells. Compatible with traditional microscopes, the integrated and miniaturized device developed by the EPFL researchers offers a new way to gain insight into cell processes and communication. It also sets the stage for the development of new therapies to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. “We could, for example, select the most effective immune cells to combat a given disease,” says Hatice Altug, a co-author of the study and head of the Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory at EPFL's School of Engineering.

The researchers have used their new technique to study cytokine secretion levels in lymphoma cells. “Until now, the methods used to study individual cells have always required fluorophores,” says Altug. “Yet these compounds interfere with the cells’ functioning and make real-time studies impossible.” Maria Soler, the study’s co-lead author, adds: “In our device, each nanopore is a separate sensor. Cells can thus settle naturally anywhere in the chamber, and we can analyze them the same way.”
There are numerous potential applications. “Our approach could be used to identify the most aggressive cancer cells in a tumor and decide exactly which treatment to administer to the patient,” concludes Xiaokang Li, the study’s co-lead author.

 Focussing light to improve sensing 
 The researchers used graphene to improve on a well-­‐known molecule-­‐detection method: infrared absorption spectroscopy. In the standard method, light is used to excite the molecules, which vibrate differently depending on their nature. It can be compared to a guitar string, which makes different sounds depending on its length. By virtue of this vibration, the molecules reveal their presence and even their identity. This “signature” can be “read” in the reflected light. 
 This method is not effective, however, in detecting nanometrically-­‐sized molecules. The wavelength of the infrared photon directed at a molecule is around 6 microns (6,000 nanometres – 0.006 millimeters), while the target measures only a few nanometres (about 0.000001 mm). It is very challenging to detect the vibration of such a small molecule in reflected light. 
 There is where graphene comes in. If given the correct geometry, the graphene is able to focus the light on a precise spot on its surface and “hear” the vibration of a nanometric molecule that is attached to it. “We first pattern nanostructures on the graphene surface by bombarding it with electron beams and etching it with oxygen ions,” said Daniel Rodrigo, co‐author of the publication. “When the light arrives, the electrons in graphene nanostructures begin to oscillate. This phenomenon, known as ‘localized surface plasmon resonance,’ serves to concentrate light into tiny spots, which are comparable with the dimensions of the target molecules. It is then possible to detect nanometric structures.”
Reconfiguring graphene in real time to see the molecule’s structure
 There is more to it. In addition to identifying the presence of nanometric molecules, this process can also reveal the nature of the bonds connecting the atoms that the molecule is composed of.
When a molecule vibrates, it does not give off only one type of ""sound."" It produces a whole range of vibrations, which are generated by the bonds connecting the different atoms. Returning to the example of the guitar: each string vibrates differently and together they form one musical instrument. These nuances provide information on the nature of each bond and on the health of the entire molecule. “These vibrations act as a fingerprint that allow us to identify the molecule; such as proteins, and can even tell their health status” said Odeta Limaj, another co-­author of the publication.
In order to pick up the sound given off by each of the strings, it has to be possible to identify a whole range of frequencies. And that is something graphene can do. The researchers “tuned” the graphene to different frequencies by applying voltage, which is not possible with current sensors. Making graphene's electrons oscillate in different ways makes it possible to “read” all the vibrations of the molecule on its surface. “We tested this method on proteins that we attached to the graphene. It gave us a full picture of the molecule,” said Hatice Altug.
A big step closer to using graphene for molecule sensing
 The new graphene-­‐based process represents a major step forward for the researchers, for several reasons. First, this simple method shows that it is possible to conduct a complex analysis using only one device, while it normally requires many different ones. And all this without stressing or modifying the biological sample. Second, it shows graphene’s incredible potential in the area of detection. “There are many possible applications,” said Altug. “We focussed on biomolecules, but the method should also work for polymers, and many other substances,” she added.

Starting with an unknown
While much progress has been made on detecting exoplanetary biosignatures, several question marks remain. What are the implications of this kind of research? And how should we interpret the results? What if just one biosignature is detected on a planet? Or what if no biosignatures are detected – what should we conclude? Those kinds of questions are what the EPFL-Tor Vergata scientists set out to answer with their new model.
Their work tackles the problem from a new angle. Traditionally, astronomers have looked for life on another planet based on what we know about life and biological evolution on Earth. But with their new method, the scientists started with an unknown: how many other planets in our galaxy have some form of life. Their model incorporates factors like the estimated number of other stars in the galaxy similar to the Sun and how many telluric planets might be orbiting within a habitable distance from those stars. It uses Bayesian statistics – particularly well suited to small sample sizes – to calculate the probability of life in our galaxy based on how many biosignatures are detected: one, several or none at all.
“Intuitively it makes sense that if we find life on one other planet, there are probably many others in the galaxy with some type of living organism. But how many?” says Amedeo Balbi, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics in Tor Vergata’s Physics Department. “Our model turns that intuitive assumption into a statistical calculation, and lets us determine exactly what the numbers mean in terms of quantity and frequency.”
“Astronomers already use various assumptions to evaluate how credible life is on a given planet,” says Claudio Grimaldi, a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPMC) who is also affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Rome. “One of our research goals was thus to develop a method for weighing and comparing those assumptions in light of the new data that will be collected over the coming years.”
Spreading from one planet to another
Given the small number of planets that will likely be examined in the near future, and assuming that life will emerge independently on any one planet, the EPFL-Tor Vergata study found that if even just one biosignature is detected, we can conclude with a greater than 95% probability that there are over 100,000 inhabited planets in the galaxy – more than the number of pulsars, which are objects created when a massive star explodes at the end of its life. On the other hand, if no biosignatures are detected, we cannot necessarily conclude that other forms of life do not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.
The scientists also looked at the theory of panspermia, which states that instead of emerging independently on a given planet, life forms could be carried over from another planet – such as through organic matter or microscopic organisms being carried on comets or spreading between neighboring planets. This implies that the probability of life on a planet also depends on how far it is from other planets and how easily various life forms – whose physical characteristics could be extremely different from those we are familiar with – are able to resist the extreme conditions of space travel and adapt to the new planet. Factoring in panspermia alters the inferred number of inhabited planets elsewhere in the galaxy.",One way to determine whether there is life on another planet is to look for biosignatures in the light that is scattered off its atmosphere. Scientists at EPFL and University of Rome Tor Vergata have developed an original model that interprets the results of that analysis.

The extreme conditions in the Solar system push us to find better answers to problems we face on our own planet. To reach this goal, we need the support of politicians. Our private sector partnerships have a future in the short- or medium-term. But to reach objectives as ambitious as space exploration, it will be necessary for states to come together in joint efforts.
What will you do to reach these goals?
I will above all need to work with my network of colleagues and the networks of the other members of the Space Center. We need to build connections that are missing at the national and international level. Although we were a leader early in Europe’s Space adventure, Switzerland has grown timid over time. Nonetheless, we have always had recognized expertise in many areas. A uniting vision is missing – for example, Switzerland has no university program specifically oriented towards Space science. I hope to be able to change all that.

14,"<p>As well as microtechnology, nanotechnologies and the like, EPFL also performs practical tests of great importance, as shown by the doctoral project of Michael Rupf, from the <a href=""http://ibeton.epfl.ch/default_e.asp?"">Structural concrete Laboratory (IBETON)</a>, part of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). Commissioned by the Federal Roads Office, this research involves testing the stress resistance of pre-cast concrete beams. These tests are performed on the campus in a large hall. The objective is to develop a model of calculation that will be used in the future checking of freeway bridges.<p>The enormous project to construct the freeway network in Switzerland took place between 1960 and 1980, and deployed a number of bridges made of pre-cast concrete. The checking of these structures according to current Swiss standards can sometimes cause problems, as theycontain very little shear reinforcement.</p><p>What is the impact in relation to the resistance of the bridge if the load is increased; for example, to accommodate an emergency lane? Or if there is rusting in the structure? At what juncture should the bridge be reinforced?</p><p>To address these critical safety issues, le doctoral student Michael Rupf and his team are checking concrete beams in the laboratory. These bridge components are deformed by loads applied by precisely defined levels of kilonewtons. Each level corresponds to a given stress resistance. The beam is deformed up to breaking point, and every five seconds a computer measures the strength, movement and tilt of the beam.</p><p>A measurement matrix is applied to the beam. At each level, the matrix is measured to the nearest thousandth of a millimeter and the cracks are re-drawn. The data are then sent to a computer.

The goal is to validate a future model for predictive calculation.<br/></p>","As well as microtechnology, nanotechnologies and the like, EPFL also performs practical tests of great importance, as shown by the doctoral project of Michael Rupf, from the , part of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). Commissioned by the Federal Roads Office, this research involves testing the stress resistance of pre-cast concrete beams. These tests are performed on the campus in a large hall. The objective is to develop a model of calculation that will be used in the future checking of freeway bridges.
The enormous project to construct the freeway network in Switzerland took place between 1960 and 1980, and deployed a number of bridges made of pre-cast concrete. The checking of these structures according to current Swiss standards can sometimes cause problems, as theycontain very little shear reinforcement.
What is the impact in relation to the resistance of the bridge if the load is increased; for example, to accommodate an emergency lane? Or if there is rusting in the structure? At what juncture should the bridge be reinforced?
To address these critical safety issues, le doctoral student Michael Rupf and his team are checking concrete beams in the laboratory. These bridge components are deformed by loads applied by precisely defined levels of kilonewtons. Each level corresponds to a given stress resistance. The beam is deformed up to breaking point, and every five seconds a computer measures the strength, movement and tilt of the beam.
A measurement matrix is applied to the beam. At each level, the matrix is measured to the nearest thousandth of a millimeter and the cracks are re-drawn. The data are then sent to a computer. The analysis of the measurements enables an understanding of the behavior of the specimen beam. The model developed using the experience gained will be validated by the trial data. The goal is thus to obtain and refine a robust predictive tool.
The Federal Roads Office has a significant interest in this project, because this calculation tool will allow the validation of the decision whether or not to begin large-scale and costly repair work. It is even more important because – at this point in time – very few data are available.

In addition to the above institutions, the region is home to: ISSUL, a specialized sports training and research institute based at UNIL; SSU, the university sports service at UNIL and EPFL; and AISTS, a foundation that offers a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) in sports management.
Complementary roles
Initial estimates suggest that the above institutions house more than one hundred laboratories active in fields that are or could be directly applicable to sports. These laboratories each have their own unique expertise and areas of focus that complement those of the others. On that basis, they will be asked to contribute to specific projects as needed. Having access to such a broad range of know-how is a major asset, since sports are by nature a highly cross-disciplinary field.
The academic network is a flexible platform that will foster collaborations between member institutions and both local organizations (such as sports federations and ThinkSport) and international ones. It will also make it easier to coordinate projects, create contacts and identify the services available in a range of fields, thereby cultivating cross-disciplinary projects. The network offers a single point of entry for partners, helping them to easily find the expertise they need.
The network is seeking to strengthen the academic sector's involvement in sports in the run-up to a number of major upcoming sporting events in this region and in support of the region’s institutional development and economic growth

But for the longer-term studies, Asteroid Vesta is a kind of movie star for planetologists.

Computer simulation reconstructs collisions between asteroids 
 Using a three-dimensional computer simulation, Martin Jutzi from the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern has now accurately reconstructed how Vesta collided with other asteroids twice over a billion years ago. The models show that the protoplanet owes its elliptical shape to these collisions and that they also scarred its surface structure. They are presented in a study published today on the front page of 
Nature 
magazine.
The simulations also enable detailed conclusions on the composition and properties of Vesta’s interior to be drawn for the first time, which helps us to better understand the evolution of the solar system. «Based on the sort and distribution of this material at the surface of the asteroid, we are able to precisely reconstruct the various inner layers of Vesta down to a depth of 100 km», explains Philippe Gillet, head of EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory.

18,"<p>It’s an important decision, and one that shapes the rest of your life. Two days of immersion is not excessive when helping the future students to make an informed choice. Today and tomorrow, as well as on Thursday and Friday next wek, the School will be opening its doors to the undergraduates of the future. These visits are becoming more popular every year: 2050 have registered for this year’s event, 400 more than in 2010, and 600 more than in 2009. “The growing reputation of EPFL certainly accounts for the high attendance”, comments Maya Fruehauf, who is responsible for promoting undergraduate courses. The large majority of the sixth formers come from French-speaking Switzerland (a special day is organized in January for those from the German-speaking area and Ticino), but over 450 are travelling from France. “Our visits to certain high schools and a stand at the “Salon de l’Etudiant” student fair in Paris, as well as word-of-mouth, have all worked well”, she points out.

The large majority of the sixth formers come from French-speaking Switzerland (a special day is organized in January for those from the German-speaking area and Ticino), but over 450 are travelling from France. “Our visits to certain high schools and a stand at the “Salon de l’Etudiant” student fair in Paris, as well as word-of-mouth, have all worked well”, she points out.

22,"<p>The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.<p>They realized that one building in particular – the Saint-François parking lot – was at the core of the problem. This building links the city center with the Flon neighborhood, meaning that it could play a strategic role in turning downtown Lausanne car-free. So they decided to expand and completely transform it. “Our building holds a restaurant, a co-op market with local products, and a hotel that offers medium-term accommodations such as for artists, conference-goers and businesspeople,” says Flavien Davin. “There would also be common spaces and a co-working area to promote interaction between these groups.”</p><p>The students also added a public staircase along the side of the building. “We felt that this ‘patchwork building’ deserved an important role, as it sits above one of Lausanne’s public transport hubs,” says Bernard Valette, co-author of the study. “Currently, people who use the parking lot do not have direct access to the various means of public transport beneath the building. Our aim was to better coordinate the building’s different purposes.”</p><p><strong>Pedestrian zone and distribution depots</strong></p><p>Their project also encompasses the Flon train station, which is the third largest in French-speaking Switzerland in terms of passenger numbers. “Our vision was to transform the downtown area, between the Flon neighborhood and Saint-François, into a huge pedestrian zone. That would require expanding the public transport system and totally redesigning the city’s logistics,” says Valette. The students’ project takes into account the future M3 metro line, which will strengthen the link between the north and south of the city, as well as the future tram line that will connect the western side of the city to its center. They would add yet another tramline, between Morges and Lutry, in order to relieve throughtraffic south of the city.</p><p>Maintaining the flow of goods to stores and residents in a car-free city center would require some radical thinking. For this, the students designed three major ‘automated distribution depots’ in the city through which all goods headed for downtown stores and residents would pass. These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.</p><p>According to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.</p><p><strong>Changes ahead </strong></p><p>Is all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”</p><p><strong>Solving two problems at once</strong></p><p>The students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”</p></p>","<p> A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035. Similar initiatives are underway in other European cities.<br/></p>","The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.

These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.
According to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.
Changes ahead 
Is all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”
Solving two problems at once
The students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”","A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035. Similar initiatives are underway in other European cities."

29,"<p>Can a home run entirely on solar facades? Apparently so, according to NeighborHub, a house designed and built for the 2017 Solar Decathlon by Swiss students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg (HEIA-FR), the Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD Genève) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR). With NeighborHub, the students wanted to show that it makes both practical and economic sense to install solar panels on a home’s facade – thereby maximizing the surface area put to use – even though sunlight can sometimes struggle to penetrate urban areas. “Unlike rooftops, facades are more likely to be in the shade since other buildings can block the sunlight,” says Philippe Couty, the engineer coordinating the project for HEIA-FR. “That could sharply reduce the amount of power that solar panels generate. But we wanted to show that solar energy can indeed be produced on facades, even in areas packed with a lot of buildings.” The project team went about searching for technology that could prove them right. Peter Cuony, head of solar power systems at Groupe E Connect and a member of the project team from the very beginning, came up with the idea of using power optimizers.

Achieving energy independence
 Thanks to this novel way of using existing technology, NeighborHub can run entirely on the power generated from its facade-installed solar panels. It even generates more energy than it needs. What’s more, its rooftop remains free for other purposes, like promoting biodiversity – the space can be used to cultivate a variety of plants.
The energy independence achieved by the one-story house offers encouraging prospects for residential buildings. Each story could generate enough power for its own needs. That could be a major benefit for cities that are growing vertically.
“Our house demonstrates that it is possible to produce enough energy for an entire building using solar panels installed only on the building facades,” says Cuony.
NeighborHub’s open house next Saturday will give the public a unique opportunity to check out the next-generation house before it heads off to the Solar Decathlon competition, which will be held in Denver from 5 to 15 October 2017.

Scarcity fosters diversity, diversity promotes flexibility
 In a recent paper in the journal 
Nature Microbiology
, researchers working with Frank Schreiber have shown that individual cells in bacterial populations can differ widely in how they respond to a lack of nutrients. Although all of the cells in a group are genetically identical, the way they process nutrients from their surroundings can vary from one cell to another. For example, bacteria called 
Klebsiella oxytoca 
preferentially take up nitrogen from ammonium (NH4+), as this requires relatively little energy. When there isn’t enough ammonium for the entire population, some of the bacteria start to take up nitrogen by fixing it from elementary nitrogen (N2), even though this requires more energy. If the ammonium suddenly runs out altogether, these cells at least are prepared. While some cells suffer, the group as a whole can continue to grow. “Although all of the bacteria in the group are genetically identical and exposed to the same environmental conditions, the individual cells differ among themselves,” says Schreiber.
Detailed insights thanks to the latest technology
 Schreiber and his colleagues were only able to reveal the astonishing differences between the bacteria by studying them very closely. “We had to measure nutrient uptake by individual bacterial cells – even though these are only 2 μm large,” explains Schreiber. “Usually, microbiologists study the collective properties of millions or even billions of bacteria. It was only thanks to the close collaboration between the research groups, and by pooling our expertise and technical equipment, that we were able to study the bacteria in such detail.”
Bacteria are individualists, too
 The present study shows to what extent individuality – in bacteria and in general – can be essential in a changing environment. Differences between individuals give the group new properties, enabling it to deal with tough environmental conditions. “This indicates that biological diversity does not only matter in terms of the diversity of plant and animal species but also at the level of individuals within a species,” says Schreiber. 
 Next, Schreiber and his colleagues plan to study whether the individualistic behavior of specific individuals is of equal importance in natural environments.

The analysis was performed using cells from the Blue Brain’s virtual rodent cortex. The researchers expect other types of neurons – non-cortical or human – to operate in the same way.
Their results show that when a neuron receives input, the branches of the elaborate tree-like receptors extending from the neuron, known as dendrites, functionally work together in a way that is 
adjusted to the complexity of the input
.
The strength of a synapse determines how strongly a neuron feels an electric signal coming from other neurons, and the act of learning changes this strength. By analyzing the “connectivity matrix” that determines how these synapses communicate with each other, the algorithm establishes when and where synapses group into independent learning units from the structural and electrical properties of dendrites. In other words, the new algorithm determines how the dendrites of neurons functionally break up into separate computing units and finds that they work together

32,"<div>EPFL’s new brand identity is centered on its acronym. The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.<div></div><div>The School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.</div><div></div><div>The font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time.

The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.
The School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.
The font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge. The School profoundly affects the lives of those who study or teach there. As a hub of research and knowledge, EPFL is a source of personal and professional fulfillment. We wanted to reflect all of that in the new design,” says Caroline Moser, CEO of Moser Design.
The new visual identity consists of more than just the logo, as it covers the full range of graphic elements that convey the School’s brand. The logo itself figures prominently on campus, in the form of a 2.6-meter-high metal sculpture next to the Rolex Learning Center.
Modern-day agora pays tribute to the past
The symbolic launch of the School’s 50th anniversary celebration would not have been complete without paying tribute to Maurice Cosandey, the visionary who in 1969 turned what was then a local engineering school into a Swiss federal institute of technology.
The Lombard Odier Agora was therefore inaugurated today in Place Maurice Cosandey – the square named after EPFL’s first president – in a ceremony attended by the Cosandey family.
Place Maurice Cosandey sits at the southern entrance of the campus, between the Rolex Learning Center and ArtLab. It was chosen for the Agora as part of an initiative originating with the ArtLab project to revamp this area. The redevelopment project was led by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE), which is headed by architecture professor Dieter Dietz. “Our goal for this project was clear: to get the entire EPFL community – especially students – involved in order to breathe life into a neglected part of campus,” says Dietz.

Recipe revealed
First, the proposal had to be approved by the European Space Agency (ESA). Once officials from Human Spaceflights and Exploration, in Germany, gave it their thumbs-up, a long list of practical details had to be addressed together with the chocolatier, HUG, a small company in the Canton of Lucerne.

And the manufacturer had to provide a full and detailed list of ingredients, thus revealing part of its trade secret.

The boxes were then sent to the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), in the Netherlands, whose work includes testing satellites and their sub-systems by simulating the conditions they will experience when launched and once in space.
“All objects going to the ISS have to undergo testing to ensure they are not flammable, do not produce fragments that could spread around the cabin, and cannot injure the astronauts,” said Bernd Rattenbacher, from the Center of Competence in Aerospace Biomedical Science & Technology at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.
ESTEC’s main task was to ensure that the boxes did not have any sharp corners or edges presenting a risk of injury.

Once the laws of thermodynamics that govern a given city’s growth are identified, the next step will be to learn how their spatial-temporal evolution affects the functioning of their ecosystem. More specifically, the idea is to determine how a city’s growth and form influence its energy consumption, changes in land cover, biodiversity and human well-being.",An EPFL researcher is modeling cities in order to understand their metabolism and determine their ecological impact when they grow and change. Her research is aimed at identifying the urban form that is most efficient and consumes the least amount of natural resources.

“What we have is a fully functional robot which is entirely powered by vacuum, which has never been done before,” says EPFL roboticist Matt Robertson who worked on the project. “Previous work has shown individual components powered by vacuum, but never in a complete system.”
Vacuum-powered components are a recent addition to robotics – and, more importantly, they’re safe. Today, most actuators on the market are activated by applying positive pressure, i.e. by injecting air into their components. But containing positive pressure requires stiff high-pressure pneumatics, which also pose a safety threat: in extreme situations, they can explode. By comparison, vacuum-powered actuators are safe, soft, and simple to build.
“What's more is that our soft building blocks are designed to be plug-and-play, so ultimately we can assemble several types of robots from the same basic units,” says EPFL scientists and lead researcher Jamie Paik. “They can be reconfigured to perform different tasks like crawling, gripping canisters, and climbing a vertical wall.”
A five-module robot can move like a tentacle; a four-module robot with a suction gripper can grab an object and drop it on a target; a three-module robot can crawl on the ground; a two-module robot can be equipped with suction-cup feet to climb a smooth, vertical surface, like glass. The enormous versatility of the new robots can be exploited for studying locomotion and for future applications at an industrial level.
This research was funded in part by NCCR Robotics.","EPFL scientists have created the first functional robot powered entirely by vacuum: made up of soft building blocks, it moves by having air sucked out of them.

Three tips from a data scientist
 EPFL professor Robert West offers some advice for how to navigate COVID-19 data without falling victim to false information, whether from fake news or simple misinterpretation.
Check the sources of data interpretations…and of the data itself. 
“I think it’s obvious advice, but even I have to remind myself of it, because as humans we have an innate hunger for sensational news,” West says. In addition to looking for reputable sources (universities and respected news outlets top social media, for example), he advises always reading graph and infographic captions carefully. Since different countries have different approaches to collecting epidemiological data and testing for COVID-19, their numbers aren’t always comparable.
Read the axis labels. 
Check to see if graphs are linear or , as this makes a big difference when it comes to understanding exponential growth.
Keep perspective. 
Bear in mind that data on the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing. “What we’re seeing online reflects events that are unfolding in real time, and what we read today may be different tomorrow,” West says.","With the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a race against the clock to implement science-based measures to protect society’s most vulnerable populations.

Nowadays, the demand for high capacity hard drives has increased more than ever. Computer users handle large files, databases, image or video files, using software, all of which require a large amount of memory in order to save and process the data as quickly as possible.

However, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Photographic_Experts_Group"" title=""Joint Photographic Experts Group"">Joint Photographic Experts Group</a> (JPEG) has just introduced a new image compression standard that could resolve this problem.

The JPEG XS standard compresses files by no more than a factor of six and is not meant to replace the popular JPEG format. “Compressing the images with JPEG XS doesn’t compromise quality at all: even experts can’t tell the difference between an original and a compressed picture or movie,” adds Ebrahimi.</p><p><strong>Wide array of applications</strong></p><p>JPEG XS could come in handy whenever images and videos need to be sent to a processor as fast as possible.

The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), based in Hollywood, is already considering adopting JPEG XS as its editing format. “With JPEG XS, professional movie editors can take images created with different devices and import them directly into their editing software,” says Ebrahimi. Currently, every brand of video camera that uses high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging techniques has its own proprietary coding format. That means individual files must be transcoded before they can be edited. JPEG XS will change this situation by providing a universal format.</p><p><br/><strong>Tested and approved at EPFL</strong><br/> In addition to coordinating the development of the JPEG family of standards, Professor Ebrahimi came up with a new evaluation methodology together with his team in order to assess how well JPEG XS performs. These tests proved that the technological side of the new format is sound. The multimedia industry is currently awaiting final approval by the member states of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Once that is obtained, JPEG XS-based products and services can be launched.<br/><br/> “In the immediate future, JPEG XS will be put to use in professional applications like movie editing, space imagery and professional-grade cameras. Consumer electronics will come next, including self-driving cars, virtual reality, augmented reality, and wireless connections between multimedia devices and TV monitors or projectors,” says Ebrahimi. “To be able to use JPEG XS, consumers will need to own the next generation of devices. In terms of software, they will probably just need to run an update, like they do from time to time on their computers and smartphones anyway.”</p><p></p><ul><li><div style=""background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;"">10 to 15 billion.

Another advantage of JPEG XS is that, like all previous JPEG formats, it is open-source. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), based in Hollywood, is already considering adopting JPEG XS as its editing format. “With JPEG XS, professional movie editors can take images created with different devices and import them directly into their editing software,” says Ebrahimi. Currently, every brand of video camera that uses high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging techniques has its own proprietary coding format. That means individual files must be transcoded before they can be edited. JPEG XS will change this situation by providing a universal format.
Tested and approved at EPFL
 In addition to coordinating the development of the JPEG family of standards, Professor Ebrahimi came up with a new evaluation methodology together with his team in order to assess how well JPEG XS performs. These tests proved that the technological side of the new format is sound. The multimedia industry is currently awaiting final approval by the member states of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Once that is obtained, JPEG XS-based products and services can be launched.
 “In the immediate future, JPEG XS will be put to use in professional applications like movie editing, space imagery and professional-grade cameras. Consumer electronics will come next, including self-driving cars, virtual reality, augmented reality, and wireless connections between multimedia devices and TV monitors or projectors,” says Ebrahimi. “To be able to use JPEG XS, consumers will need to own the next generation of devices. In terms of software, they will probably just need to run an update, like they do from time to time on their computers and smartphones anyway.”
10 to 15 billion. That’s the estimated number of JPEG images shared daily over social media around the world.
25 years. That’s how many years have gone by since the first JPEG standard was created to store and send highly compressed images.
10. The typical image compression ratio with JPEG.","The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), an international committee headed by an EPFL professor, has just unveiled JPEG XS. With this new format, the image-compression process uses less energy, and higher-quality images can be sent with low latency over broadband networks like 5G. JPEG XS will have applications in areas such as virtual reality, augmented reality, space imagery, self-driving cars and professional movie editing."

The researchers took advantage of the temporal limits of our visual capacity to design an algorithm that creates special video seals. They came up with a “tempocode,” a video made of moving patterns that can mask the varying frequencies of an image.
Only a camera or smartphone app can reveal the hidden image. They have a feature that the human eye lacks – adjustable exposure time – which can be used to temporally average the images.

Already well understood in the area of optics, the phenomenon of refraction is illustrated by the deflection of a light beam when it encounters an alteration in the propagation medium.

To “flow” around an object
Negative refraction is not found in nature. It can be produced by using artificial structures called “metamaterials”, which have the property of further bending – or inverting the path of – light rays, resulting in their potential to “flow” around an object, at least theoretically. Some scientists believe that this phenomenon could one day be used to make objects invisible or transparent, a bit like Harry Potter’s cape!
For the first time, EPFL scientists have succeeded in demonstrating the possibility of obtaining negative refraction in the domain of acoustics using a discrete device; this work was based on a recent PhD thesis in the domain of electromagnetism**. Sound is defined by two essential properties of a fluid (a material medium) in which it travels: its mass, put in movement by an acoustic disturbance, the acceleration of which is normally directed according to the forces of acoustic pressure (inertial force); and its compressibility, which allows it naturally to oppose such forces (restoring force).
Using the device they conceived, the EPFL scientists obtained, simultaneously, negative values for these two parameters; that is to say, to further compress the particle of fluid subjected to excessive acoustic pressure, and to determine that its acceleration oppose the forces of pressure. This combination is a prerequisite in obtaining negative refraction, a property that has been initially observed in a digital model of acoustic metamaterial. Similar results have also been observed in a second phase, using an experimental prototype which enabled the validation of the theoretical concept.
Even though we are still a long way from a genuine acoustic “invisibility cape”, these results demonstrate the performance of a tangible physical system representing negative refraction, while constituting an important achievement for research in this area.

Its reduced size is the result of an innovative concept similar to the way a Segway keeps its balance, but instead of relying on an internal system the stabilizer is built right into the magnetic components.</p><p><strong>So simple</strong><br/> “It is such a simple solution that it has been patented.” says Francesco Mondada head of the MOBOTS group, where the research was done.<br/> Power generators are ferromagnetic environments made of metal tubing and shafts. And magnetically adhesive robots have been getting larger and more complicated to rise to more difficult challenges. But Rochat’s solution goes against this trend. Its novel magnetic arrangement in the wheel creates sufficient holding force to keep it attached to surfaces even while going around corners upside-down. At the same time, this magnetic force maintains system balance by keeping the motor in place. He thus radically reduced the robot to a match-book size while making it more agile at the same time.</p><p><strong><br/> Technology transfer to industry</strong><br/> “It is a design solution that did not seem possible,” explains Rochat, “but now future possibilities have opened up that could save millions in costly shut-downs.”</p><p>The novel design is already being augmented in the laboratory. Plans are being developed to create a robot that is water resistant, which would allow for inspections without purging the system of water.

Designed at the Robotics Systems Laboratory at the EPFL by Frédéric Rochat, the miniature robot will be used to inspect power generators where—in order to avoid costly shut-downs that human inspection entails—it can work its way into the smallest corners. Its reduced size is the result of an innovative concept similar to the way a Segway keeps its balance, but instead of relying on an internal system the stabilizer is built right into the magnetic components.
So simple
 “It is such a simple solution that it has been patented.” says Francesco Mondada head of the MOBOTS group, where the research was done.
 Power generators are ferromagnetic environments made of metal tubing and shafts. And magnetically adhesive robots have been getting larger and more complicated to rise to more difficult challenges. But Rochat’s solution goes against this trend. Its novel magnetic arrangement in the wheel creates sufficient holding force to keep it attached to surfaces even while going around corners upside-down. At the same time, this magnetic force maintains system balance by keeping the motor in place. He thus radically reduced the robot to a match-book size while making it more agile at the same time.
 Technology transfer to industry
 “It is a design solution that did not seem possible,” explains Rochat, “but now future possibilities have opened up that could save millions in costly shut-downs.”
The novel design is already being augmented in the laboratory. Plans are being developed to create a robot that is water resistant, which would allow for inspections without purging the system of water. The robot’s design was partially financed by ALSTOM under the Swiss Innovation Promotion Agency (CTI) program.",Researchers from the Robotics Systems Laboratory (LSRO) recently presented a novel miniature robot destined for the inner chambers of power generators.

Now, scientists led by Etienne Meylan at EPFL, have identified the source of the problem and have developed an alternative model that addresses its shortcomings. The work is published in

.
By attempting to deplete neutrophils in mice, the animals’ bone marrow produces new neutrophils – which defeats the model’s entire purpose. The researchers have now identified these neutrophils, and determined that the reason they survive is because they have a lower chance of being targeted by the antibodies.
To address this, the scientists have developed a double antibody depletion strategy that enhances neutrophil elimination. The method increases the killing rate of the antibodies, resulting in a profound, specific and long-lasting reduction in neutrophil numbers in blood and tissues.
“Our study could be useful to address the functional importance of neutrophils in acute or chronic infection, in inflammation or in cancer,” says Meylan. “In particular, transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection coupled to our standardized neutrophil depletion strategies may help establish a causal link between this innate immune cell type and COVID-19.”

55,"<p>More than 200 operations per minute! It’s not a firearm, but rather an outstanding packaging tool. The Delta robot made light work of hundreds of packets of Smarties at the Triennial Interpack Exhibition in Düsseldorf. The inventor of the concept, Reymond Clavel, was presenting in Germany the most recent version of the Delta robot, resulting of a collaboration with Bosch. The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. <br/><br/><strong>Increasing speed and maintaining precision</strong><br/><br/> The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot.

And – unthinkable at the time – a quarter of a century later, it has become a standard in industrial packaging. Reymond Clavel explains: “In fact, I was astonished to note that around 140 Delta robots were working all around the Düsseldorf fair.” A belated success for this robot, which had taken off rather too slowly for its inventor’s liking. He continues: “To be honest, when we had developed the first Delta, I was so enthusiastic that I expected lots of companies to rush to my office to buy one. Not at all! In fact, two years passed before we signed our first licence transfer, because our robot had scared off the industrialists.

It’s not a firearm, but rather an outstanding packaging tool. The Delta robot made light work of hundreds of packets of Smarties at the Triennial Interpack Exhibition in Düsseldorf. The inventor of the concept, Reymond Clavel, was presenting in Germany the most recent version of the Delta robot, resulting of a collaboration with Bosch. The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. 
Increasing speed and maintaining precision
 The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot. Scientists have now been able to take advantage of the progress made in motorization – in both power and cost – and this avoids the use of any such linking components. Thus, they have really gone up a gear. Reymond Clavel reveals: “The idea of direct drive had been tucked away in a drawer for ages, but then again, twenty years ago the cost of such motors would have been much too high.”

Deviated trajectories
Scientifically, this phenomenon can be explained by light refraction. When light rays hit a transparent surface, they continue their trajectory but are bent as a function of the surface geometry and optical properties of the material. The light passing through is thus not uniformly distributed. It gets concentrated in certain points, forming some zones that are more intense and others that are more shaded.
Pauly and his colleagues studied the principles of this distribution, and were able to identify the curves and undulations they would need to give to the surface in order to direct the beams of light to a desired area. They then developed an algorithm, to calculate the trajectories very precisely and thus form a specific image.
One of the most interesting and eagerly awaited applications of this method is in architecture. It could be applied to display cases, windows, fountains, and ornamentations on museums and monuments. In design it could be used for decorating glasses, vases, carafes, jewelry and many other objects. It has considerable potential in other, more technical applications as well, such as automobile headlights and projectors.
*Thomas Kiser (EPFL), Michael Eigensatz (Evolute), Minh Man Nguyen (WAO) and Philippe Bompas.","When beams of light hit a pool of water or a glass object, they produce beautiful, seemingly random patterns on surrounding surfaces. EPFL scientists have developed an algorithm to control these patterns and organize them into coherent images. The work could open the door to interesting new architectural applications."

All electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!

People trained in Switzerland have an excellent level of education, and many countries envy the complementary education offered by the universities of applied science and the institutes of technology. However, we mustn't rest on our laurels – we need to keep innovating to stay ahead of the game. Secondly, we can improve production management within companies, by adopting leaner practices for instance. This involves detecting and then eliminating wastefulness at all company levels by recognizing useless tasks, superfluous movements, inadequate machines and overproduction. Toyota adopted this practice very early on and became the world's leading carmaker as a result. But this method does require caution, and extremes must be avoided. People should always be at the center of our concerns – it’s not about creating a tyrannical system that is obsessed with profitability. <br/><br/><strong>To make certain products, Swiss companies already have to work with foreign companies. Isn’t the idea of 100% Swiss rather utopian?</strong><br/> In medical devices fabrication, it's almost always impossible not to go offshore for part of the product. For instance, our startup, Symetis SA, manufactures heart valves abroad. But we still make the catheters here. Our headquarters are still in Switzerland, and we oversee all our operations from here. I think over time having some offshore manufacturing could become the norm for the development of medical device, and even for microengineering companies, at least for the products that involve a lot of manual work. <br/><br/><strong>When faced with globalization, many entrepreneurs could be tempted to give up…</strong><br/> And it would be a real shame if they did. Over the last 50 years, Switzerland has invested a great deal in order to offer a very high quality of education. Thanks to these efforts, we are now able to create high-performance products and drive the Swiss economy forward. So it’s essential that we maintain our production capacity. <br/><br/><strong>What pitfalls do we need to avoid if we are to keep manufacturing in Switzerland?</strong><br/> It's important that there's not too much of a gap between engineering schools and industry. When designing a highly sophisticated product, you need to plan its development over the long term and make sure that there's a market demand. Unfortunately, engineering schools sometimes develop extremely interesting products that can't be sold because of a lack of forward planning. <br/><br/><strong>What needs to be improved in the area of entrepreneurship? </strong><br/> The Swiss are generally very calm and quite introvert. They don't always have the entrepreneurial spirit of people like Nicolas Hayek. We need to take more risks and not be afraid of getting our hands dirty, even if it means failing to begin with. By combining this appetite for risk with the right amount of humility to want to constantly improve, Switzerland would have everything it needs to succeed.</img><p><img alt="""" height=""55"" src=""//actu.epfl.ch/static/upload/fckeditorimage/58/82/5232f9d1.jpg"" width=""200""/></p><p>Fabrice Jendly is speaking at 11am on Friday 24 August.<br/> Micro12: from 23 to 25 August 2012	<br/> Aula des Jeunes-Rives, Neuchâtel	<br/><a href=""http://www.micro12.ch/"">www.micro12.ch </a></p><p></p><p></p></p>","<p>Does Swiss manufacturing have a future in microengineering?

64,"<p>Being required to stay at home most of the day and night is prompting people across Switzerland to change their daily routines. Which changes are the most difficult? Which routines will they keep once the lockdown is over? Which people are suffering most from this unprecedented situation? In order to better understand how Swiss residents are coping with the lockdown, researchers from EPFL, Idiap and UNIL have created <a href=""https://fr.surveymonkey.com/r/WY7DG2T"">an online survey available in English, French, Italian and German</a>. <p>In addition to asking a series of questions, the survey displays emergency phone numbers, options for online chats and links to useful websites and videos in order to provide support resources to people who are distressed, bored or suffering from domestic violence. The survey results will be used to identify the inequalities that are arising in the face of the pandemic and to develop coordinated and collaborative strategies to avoid them in the future, should a similar situation arise. </p><p>The survey takes around 15 minutes and is designed to get a better idea of what types of housing and living conditions make people more mentally resilient – or susceptible – to the lockdown. For instance, are women taking on more of the household chores and childcare responsibilities? If so, to what extent, under what conditions and predominantly in which areas of Switzerland? Which people feel loneliest? Which people are the least informed about existing support networks? </p><p><strong>Citizen research</strong></p><p>At the end of the survey, participants can leave their email address if they would like to use a new application called Civique App (available on iPhone and Android). The app will enable them to report on how they are adapting week after week by sending in text messages, remarks from friends and family, and photos of individual spaces serving as home office, gym and school at the same time.

Which changes are the most difficult? Which routines will they keep once the lockdown is over? Which people are suffering most from this unprecedented situation? In order to better understand how Swiss residents are coping with the lockdown, researchers from EPFL, Idiap and UNIL have created . 
In addition to asking a series of questions, the survey displays emergency phone numbers, options for online chats and links to useful websites and videos in order to provide support resources to people who are distressed, bored or suffering from domestic violence. The survey results will be used to identify the inequalities that are arising in the face of the pandemic and to develop coordinated and collaborative strategies to avoid them in the future, should a similar situation arise. 
The survey takes around 15 minutes and is designed to get a better idea of what types of housing and living conditions make people more mentally resilient – or susceptible – to the lockdown. For instance, are women taking on more of the household chores and childcare responsibilities? If so, to what extent, under what conditions and predominantly in which areas of Switzerland? Which people feel loneliest? Which people are the least informed about existing support networks? 
Citizen research
At the end of the survey, participants can leave their email address if they would like to use a new application called Civique App (available on iPhone and Android). The app will enable them to report on how they are adapting week after week by sending in text messages, remarks from friends and family, and photos of individual spaces serving as home office, gym and school at the same time. The developers are using the app to create citizen research groups. By leaving their email address, participants will also have the option of scheduling a video conference where they can discuss their feelings, situation and coping mechanisms in more detail with a psychosociological expert. Once all the data are collected – on people’s emotions, creative ways of adapting and overall experience – they will provide policymakers with valuable information on Swiss residents’ basic needs and how emergency response measures can be better targeted, whether in the short-term for this crisis or to help anticipate future ones.

Circadian rhythms
Since the discovery of melanopsin 20 years ago, scientists have taken a growing interest in how a shortage of natural light and excessive exposure to artificial light from screens affect our bodies. Melanopsin, a blue-light-sensitive photopigment found in the human eye, helps keep the body’s internal clock on track and tells our brain whether it’s day or night. It is responsible for synchronizing all our circadian rhythms, and this has a significant impact on our health, from regulating our sleep and our hormone cycle – including the production of melatonin at night – to the ability of our immune system to function properly.
“We urgently need to pay more attention to our ‘light hygiene’,” says Professor Marilyne Andersen, the director of LIPID and an expert in the field for some 15 years. “We spend so long indoors, which means we’re suffering from a chronic shortage of daylight, and staring at screens all the time, which has especially negative effects at night. We should in fact be getting plentiful light that is rich in blue wavelengths during the day, in order to accumulate a sufficient amount, as this will make us feel better, and limiting this exposure well before bedtime.”
Gap to fill
Various types of wearable light sensors exist on the market. Yet none of them can truly measure our exposure to the spectral range of light, i.e., as a function of the light’s wavelength (all the constituent “colors”). That’s what’s new about the prototype developed by EPFL. There is currently not enough data on the type of light to which we are actually exposed as a result of our daily activities and the environment in which we live and work. The physiological effects of light depend not only on its intensity and how long we’re exposed to it, but its spectrum as well. That’s the gap that the new Spectrace sensor is meant to fill.
 Forrest Webler, as part of his PhD research at LIPID, which is being jointly supervised by Prof. Andersen and Dr. Manuel Spitschan at the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology, is working on the concept of the “spectral diet” in order to develop a light exposure classification system.

67,"<p>Neurons communicate with each other at synapses through complex mechanisms. The synapses establish contact between the neurons and convert their electrical signals into chemical signals, the release of neurotransmitters. Study of these phenomena is one of the essential keys to understanding the brain. The team from the EPFL’s Laboratory of Synaptic Mechanisms, headed by Ralf Schneggenburger, has shed some light on previously unknown functions of proteins in the release of neurotransmitters.<br/><br/> In the first paper (1), the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to deactivate a protein selectively in the calyx of Held, the brain’s largest synapse. This novel method enabled them to discover a direct, unexpected role for the protein RIM (Rab3 interacting molecule), which increases the density of calcium ion (Ca2+) channels, a type of ion channel that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release.<br/><br/> In the second article (2), the scientists used mice that had been genetically modified so they would not produce a specific protein, synaptotagmin. This Ca2+-sensing protein is known to bind calcium ions (Ca2+), thus initiating neurotransmitter release.

Careful comparison enabled them to reveal a double role of this protein. The function of synaptotagmin is in fact not limited to initiating neurotransmitter release; it also inhibits other Ca2+- sensing proteins present in the nerve terminal.

71,"<p>Today’s consumers want a cleaner, greener society. There are a number of concepts out there addressing this goal, such as green economy, green growth, sustainable development, bioeconomy and circular economy. These terms have even been adopted by non-profit organizations, lobbies and international organizations for use in their names and initiatives. But that doesn’t necessarily mean we’re all clear on exactly what these concepts mean. At least that’s according to a recent study carried out at EPFL. The research, published this month in <em>Journal of Cleaner Production</em>, looked specifically at the concept of the green economy. Scientists compared 140 definitions found in journal articles (117) and white papers (23) published over the past ten years. 95 of these definitions were of “green economy” and 45 of “green growth,” a similar term that is often used as a synonym. <p>The concept of a green economy first appeared in the scientific literature in the 1990s but didn’t really gain traction until 2008 – in the wake of the global financial crisis – especially in political and academic circles. The United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were also major drivers of this trend. “The number of journal articles published on this topic every year went from zero in 2008 to 200 in 2018,” says Albert Merino-Saum, the study’s lead author and a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS). But the problem is that each article has its own definition of what the green economy is. While everyone seems to agree that a green economy is based on various social, economic and technological factors, the way each one is described and the importance given to each one can vary from one study to the next.</p><p>“We were surprised to see that all these articles were being published without referring to a seminal study or benchmark paper giving a clear definition of ‘green economy.’ That’s highly unusual for scientific research, where people first try to establish a common conceptual basis.

The scientists found that the definitions could be grouped into three main families. The first is what they call “econocentric,” or focused on economic factors like trade and finance to achieve environmental and social goals. “This family is closest to the idea of ‘green growth,’ except that discussions of green growth generally don’t account for the fact that natural resources are limited,” says Merino-Saum. The second family focuses more heavily on human well-being. Here the emphasis is on reducing inequality in the distribution of wealth and access to natural resources. The third family sees science and technology as a solution for environmental problems and a vector for sustainable economic growth. “Going forward, we’d like to see journal articles start by stating which ‘green economy’ conceptual family they are referring to,” says Merino-Saum. </p><p><strong>An idea on its way out? </strong><br/> But that assumes that the green economy concept is here to stay.

This surge could be due in part to reports issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has become a thought leader on the topic, and to the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan. Merino-Saum believes that the green economy concept will only last if researchers make a clear distinction between it and its cousin, sustainable development – such as the fact that the former is more practice-oriented.

For instance, priorities like access to water, water quality and access to healthcare can differ from one country – or region – to the next.

79,"<p>Making a foray into the business world is an essential rite of passage for all EPFL engineering students. They must spend 2–6 months working for a company, after which they can also opt for an in-company master’s project to cap off their studies (<em>see text box</em>). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.<p><strong>A wellspring of innovation</strong></p><p>But EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.</p><p>The reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”</p><p>Josep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.</p><p><strong>Support for small businesses</strong></p><p>The students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&amp;D.</p><p><strong>“The best possible transition”</strong></p><p>As delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.</p><p>Eve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said.

). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.
A wellspring of innovation
But EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.
The reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”
Josep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.
Support for small businesses
The students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&D.
“The best possible transition”
As delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.
Eve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said. And it was clearly a positive experience on both sides, because the firm hired her as soon as she graduated. Indeed, many students go on to be hired by the companies they work for. “We hire about 20% of our interns,” said Solà i Carós. “The advantage is that they already know our company. Internships bring us a lot of benefits in the short and long term.”
Internships also give businesses an opportunity to form ties with EPFL laboratories. That could open the door to broader joint research projects financed by Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which aims to encourage technology transfer to industry.
EPFL internships and master’s projects
Internships are in general paid and give engineering students an opportunity to spend several months working for a company. They take place away from an academic setting, and the subject must be approved by the school.
Master’s projects are students’ final research projects and are closely overseen by an EPFL professor. They are graded (unlike internships), and typically take place in a laboratory. However, EPFL is also looking into ways to have the projects carried out at company sites, which would more effectively combine the research with business aspects.","As part of their degree programs, EPFL students spend several months far from the academic world, working on internships or master’s projects.

Matheminecraft, , is a video game around Eulerian graphs with a tutorial and four levels.

Graph theory
The mathematical theory behind the game is vast and well known. It’s graph theory and was first mentioned as such in 1736 by Leonhard Euler. Euler laid the foundations of graph theory in his paper about the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad in Russia). This is a famous problem related to the urban geography of the city: can we found a walk through the city that would cross each bridge once and only once.
Euler proved that there was no solution to that problem. The graph theory gives us tools to answer our initial question: given a graph, can we visit each vertex, pass by each edge once and end up at the starting point? Let us restrict ourselves to undirected, connected, graphs, which simplifies the answer.
If we can answer ""yes"", the goal is reached and the graph admits an Eulerian cycle. Furthermore, the starting and ending point does not matter.
If the answer is ""no"", then some of the requirements are not verified. That is the case with the Königsberg bridges. But there exist graphs where we can visit each vertex, pass by each edge once but end up at a different vertex. In such cases, the graph admits an Eulerian trail or path.
If the mathematical proofs might not be suitable for schoolchildren, testing whether an undirected graph is Eulerian (with a cycle or a trail) is easy – depending of course on the graph at hand and one’s ability at counting. To know if a graph is Eulerian, we need to define the simple notion of degree or valency of a vertex of a graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex – in layman's terms that is the number of edges arriving (or leaving) a vertex.
If each vertex has an even degree then the graph admits an Eulerian cycle. If there are exactly two vertices with an odd degree then the graph admits an Eulerian trail. In the latter case, the starting and ending points are the vertices with odd degree.
If Matheminecraft does not cover Eulerian trails, the theory is nevertheless explained in a very mathematical way, on a blackboard – or on a whiteboard for a lack of better options.","Using the famous computer game Minecraft, Mathematicians at EPFL have developed a video game around Eulerian Cycles.

86,"<p>This may be Switzerland’s last stand, since its eligibility for European research and funding programs is in jeopardy. The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.<p>EPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).</p><p>EPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.</p><p>However, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants. This restriction was temporarily lifted on 15 September 2014.</p><p>This grace period will end on 9 February 2017. Swiss researchers can therefore still respond to calls for proposals whose deadline falls before that date.</p><p></p><p><strong>EPFL H2020 Advanced Grants</strong></p><p><strong>Smit, Berend – MaGic</strong></p><p>The Materials Genome in Action</p><p>It is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>De Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare</strong></p><p>Integrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care</p><p>This proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.<br/> The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.<br/> The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.</p><p></p><p><strong>Forro, Laszlo – PICOPROP</strong></p><p>Photo Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites</p><p>The recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.<br/> We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.<br/> The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.<br/> We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.</p><p></p><p><strong>Duboule, Denis – Regul<em>Hox</em></strong></p><p>Topological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm</p><p>The aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.</p><p></p><p><strong>Trono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X</strong></p><p>Transposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks</p><p>Transposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.</p><p></p><p><strong>Chergui, Majed – DYNAMOX</strong></p><p>Charge carrier dynamics in metal oxides</p><p>Transition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.<br/> In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (&lt;400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.</p><p></p><p><strong>Shaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM</strong></p><p>From Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach</p><p>The Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.<br/><br/> This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.<br/> The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.<br/><br/> Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.</p><p></p><p><strong>Unser, Michael – GlobalBioIm</strong></p><p>Global integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging</p><p>A powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.<br/> We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope.

The Materials Genome in Action
It is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.

Integrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care
This proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.
 The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.
 The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.

Photo Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites
The recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.
 We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.
 The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.
 We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.

Topological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm
The aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.

Transposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks
Transposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.

Charge carrier dynamics in metal oxides
Transition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.
 In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.

From Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach
The Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.
 This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.
 The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.
 Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.

Milli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing
The Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.
 The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.
 Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).
 Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.
 Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.

89,"<p>Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels means turning to plant-derived biofuels and chemicals.

Complex, but energy-dense
Lignin is an enormously complex biopolymer, filling the hard wall that surrounds each plant cell. In fact, lignin makes up almost a third of plant biomass, and its molecular structure gives it an energy density 30% greater than that of the sugars that are traditionally processed into biofuel. The problem is that lignin is difficult to extract and transform. Due to its instability, lignin usually rapidly gets destroyed during its extraction and most researchers have failed to efficiently break it apart for upgrade into fuels or chemicals.
Now, an international team of researchers led by , has shown that they can easily break lignin apart simply by adding the chemical formaldehyde to the process. Formaldehyde is one of the most widely used chemicals in industry, and it is simple and cheap to produce. The researchers found that formaldehyde stabilizes lignin and prevents it from degrading, leading to high yields of building blocks that can be used to make substitutes for petrochemicals. These yields were 3-7 times higher than those obtained from lignin without formaldehyde.

also draws an interesting parallel between Switzerland and post-Brexit UK in the book’s preface. Vincent Kaufmann tells us why this essay is important.
What gave rise to this essay?
Switzerland has been dealing with mobility-related issues for decades: the introduction of the Erasmus program, truck traffic crossing the Alps, limiting trucks to 40 tons, the AlpTransit initiative, the free movement of people, the modal shift from road to rail, and so on. All these issues have one thing in common: mobility. And yet, they are never analyzed together. On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people voted on two separate questions that, in reality, were both rooted in mobility. On that day, the people approved the “Stop mass immigration” initiative, which called for immigration quotas. They also gave the go-ahead for a fund to upgrade the country’s rail infrastructure. In a way, Swiss people paradoxically voted for “less mobility” and “more mobility” at the same time. Since then, there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric but very little sociological analysis of what really happened in that vote. Seeing this, Ander Audikana and I wanted to show how important it is to look at all these mobility issues together, in Switzerland but also in the EU, in order to get a better idea of what the consequences will be.
What are your main conclusions?
In the first part of our essay, we look at the EU’s founding documents. It’s clear that the free movement of people – much more than economic interests – was at the core of the European project. These documents show that mobility was considered the only way of unifying the member states and erasing the differences in their political and welfare systems. The Erasmus program, for example, clearly states this goal in its founding texts. But there are two sides to mobility: movement and “moorings”. Moorings refer to the connections a person makes once they have moved to a new place: building meaningful social relationships, absorbing the culture, learning the language, making use of public spaces, coming to identify with the place and building an emotional bond with it etc. Unfortunately, EU policies largely overlook this, and instead demand that people move from place to place while failing to assess the consequences of widespread geographical mobility on regional development, the ability of diverse groups of people to live alongside each other, and wage dumping. These problems are left to the individual member countries, and we think this is a major shortcoming.
How does this shortcoming affect Switzerland?
In theory, an EU company could win a contract to plant trees in a small Swiss town, and no local landscaping companies would be able to compete on price. This is a good example of mobility without moorings: the cross-border deal is encouraged without first looking at whether this scenario is fair. While people consider these types of situations totally unfair, the EU has created a legal apparatus that is simply oblivious to this. It’s this type of mechanism that Europeans are now rallying against, as we see in the rise in populism. The mobility demanded by the EU creates as many problems as it solves.
You interviewed the leaders of the six main political parties in Switzerland about this issue. Yet they are cited anonymously in your essay. Why did you do this?
We wanted to get away from partisan politics and take an anthropological approach. Rereading these interviews, we saw that mobility-related questions did not fit neatly into the left-right paradigm. We see, for example, very liberal views on both sides: the idea that the world will be a better place the more people move around. At the same time, there’s a need for the state to be more assertive and get a better grip on the flow of money, people and goods. We think that where these two positions meet is where we can find compromises and solutions. In Switzerland, local identity is important and is currently seen as being under threat. The people want the government to do something about this.
Is this what the EU could learn from the Swiss experience when it comes to rethinking mobility and the elimination of borders? 
Switzerland is seeking a better balance between mobility and moorings. The fact that the EU is so dogmatic about being borderless is a problem for Switzerland, since this country doesn’t work that way. The Swiss don't subscribe to dogmas – they reach compromises through discussion and direct democracy. For EU countries, Switzerland is an interesting laboratory. Debates that do not happen elsewhere take place here. We feel that the way in which the Swiss achieve compromises on questions of mobility and the free movement of people could help the EU overcome some of the hurdles it faces. Our analysis shows, for example, that the EU should not have focused so much on a policy of 
mobility
 in its founding documents but rather on a policy of 
accessibility
: access to services, to infrastructure and to other countries. The EU’s overriding goal should not be to make sure that people move from here to there at all costs. It should be to guarantee a certain level of fairness when people, goods, and services move across borders. Returning to the example of EU companies competing in Switzerland: in order to gain access to the Swiss market, these companies should apply Swiss prices.
In your essay, you foresee a return to medieval, walled-in cities in Europe. Is the situation that dire? 
The current border situation will require a strong political response by the EU. Failing that, we believe there’s a good chance that walls, watchtowers and barbed wire could indeed pop up all over Europe, transforming the continent into a gated community.

A multifunctional space...
The Swiss team has designed an instigator of change, a neighborhood house that can be integrated into various urban settings. The aim of NeighborHub, as it is called, is to bring neighbors together, working with them on more energy-efficient solutions. There are seven issues to consider: energy, mobility, choice of materials, biodiversity, food, waste management and water management.

Sunshine and plants for the building envelope
In line with the Solar Decathlon’s competition rules, solar panels have been installed on NeighborHub’s exterior surfaces, providing 100% of its power. Contrary to common practice, however, these panels are not fixed to the roof; instead, you’ll find the solar and thermal panels on the building’s façades and doors. The external surface consists of photovoltaic cells, together with opaque polycarbonate panels and transparent acrylic panes. ‘The unit also has vertical greenhouses, and an aquaponic system for growing fruit and vegetables with a fish tank below,’ adds Axelle Marchon, the student in charge of coordinating the architectural team.

The international nature of the Solar Decathlon competition means the project is subject to an extremely tight timetable.

A house like no other
As a competition, the Solar Decathlon has focused on traditional dwelling models, featuring a single family home with a car, with various proposed energy and environmental solutions. The competition criteria and rules were therefore devised from this perspective. But are detached houses really in keeping with today’s social and environmental imperatives? ‘NeighborHub not only satisfies the Solar Decathlon criteria, it boldly presents an alternative way of living on a neighborhood scale, that is both collective and environmentally friendly,’ explains Marilyne Andersen, Dean of EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) and the Faculty Advisor of the project.

100,"<p>Targeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is a surgical procedure on patients with amputations that reroutes residual limb nerves towards intact muscles and skin in order to fit them with a limb prosthesis allowing unprecedented control. By its nature, TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input; however the detailed brain mechanisms have never been investigated before and the success of TMSR prostheses will depend on our ability to understand the ways the brain re-maps these pathways.

By its nature, TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input; however the detailed brain mechanisms have never been investigated before and the success of TMSR prostheses will depend on our ability to understand the ways the brain re-maps these pathways. Now, EPFL scientists have used ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI to show how TMSR affects upper-limb representations in the brains of patients with amputations, in particular in primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex and regions processing more complex brain functions. The findings are .
Targeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is used to improve the control of upper limb prostheses. Residual nerves from the amputated limb are transferred to reinnervate and activate new muscle targets. This way, a patient fitted with a TMSR prosthetic “sends” motor commands to the re-innervated muscles, where his or her movement intentions are decoded and sent to the prosthetic limb. On the other hand, direct stimulation of the skin over the re-innervated muscles is sent back to the brain, inducing touch perception on the missing limb.
But how does the brain encode and integrate such artificial touch and movements of the prosthetic limb? How does this impact our ability to better integrate and control prosthetics? Achieving and fine-tuning such control depends on knowing how the patient’s brain re-maps various motor and somatosensory pathways in the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. 
The , in collaboration with Andrea Serino at the University Hospital of Lausanne and teams of clinicians and researchers in Switzerland and abroad have successfully mapped out these changes in the cortices of three patients with upper-limb amputations who had undergone TMSR and were proficient users of prosthetic limbs developed by  and his group at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.
The scientists used ultra-high field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow across it. This gave them an unprecedented insight at great spatial resolution into the cortical organization of primary motor and somatosensory cortex of each patient.
Surprisingly, the study showed that motor cortex maps of the amputated limb were similar in terms of extent, strength, and topography to individuals without limb amputation, but they were different from patients with amputations that did not receive TMSR, but were using standard prostheses. This shows the unique impact of the surgical TMSR procedure on the brain’s motor map.
The approach was even able to identify maps of missing (phantom) fingers in the somatosensory cortex of the TMSR patients that were activated through the reinnervated skin regions from the chest or residual limb.
The somatosensory maps showed that the brain had preserved its original topographical organization, although to a lesser degree than in healthy subjects. Moreover, when investigating the connections between upper-limb maps in both cortices, the researchers found normal connections in the TMSR patients, which were comparable with healthy controls. However, preservation of original mapping was again reduced in non-TMSR patients, showing that the TMSR procedure preserves strong functional connections between primary sensory and motor cortex.
The study also showed that TMSR is still in need of improvement: the connections between the primary sensory and motor cortex with the higher-level embodiment regions in fronto-parietal cortex were as weak in the TMSR patients as in the non-TMSR patients, and differed with respect to healthy subjects.
This suggests that, despite enabling good motor performance, TMSR-empowered artificial limbs still do not move and feel like a real limb and are still not encoded by the patient’s brain as a real limb. The scientists conclude that future TMSR prosthetics should implement systematic somatosensory feedback linked to the robotic hand movements, enabling patients to feel the sensory consequences of the movements of their artificial limb.
The findings provide the first detailed neuroimaging investigation in patients with bionic limbs based on the TMSR prosthesis, and show that ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI is an exceptional tool for studying the upper-limb maps of the motor and somatosensory cortex following amputation.
In addition, the findings suggest that TMSR may counteract poorly adapted plasticity in the cortex after losing a limb. According to the authors, this may provide new insights into the nature and the reversibility of cortical plasticity in patients with amputations and its link to phantom limb syndrome and pain.
Finally, the study also shows that there is a need of further engineering advances such as the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prosthetics that can enable them to move and feel as real limbs.

Following in the footsteps of Swissmetro
Elia Notari has just obtained his Master’s in civil engineering from EPFL. He came up with this visionary train line for his Master’s project, which was supervised by Aurelio Muttoni, a full professor and director of EPFL’s Structural Concrete Laboratory (IBETON). Those with a sharp eye will no doubt notice some similarities with the Swissmetro project, an idea for a futuristic metro system developed at EPFL in the 1990s. Swissmetro was intended to link the main towns in Switzerland at a speed of 500 km/h. Notari’s Master’s project is in fact a variation of the Swissmetro design, which put the trains in underground tunnels rather than through Lake Geneva.
But is it really possible to build a metro through Lake Geneva? What some consider sacrilegious is a fascinating technical challenge for others – one that draws on multiple disciplines, covering everything from structural design and hydraulics to geotechnics and the environmental impact.
A submerged bridge
Notari focused on designing and calculating the dimensions of a double-track tunnel made out of reinforced concrete: an ‘underwater bridge’ – or to be more specific, a ‘floating underwater tunnel.’ Covering a distance of around 55 kilometers, the tracks would use magnetic levitation – or maglev – to get the train to travel at high speed. With this type of system, one set of magnets is placed on the tracks; a second set on the bottom of the train is repelled by the first, which pushes the train up off the track. In some cases, the repulsive force of the magnet is controlled by a current running along the track.
Fig.1: The double-track tunnel and its compartments containing ballast. © EPFL 2018 / E. Notari
This kind of system is not yet used in transportation, but several countries are now testing prototypes and plan to start building soon. In 2015, the Shinkansen Maglev prototype developed by Japanese company JR Central set the world record when it reached a speed of 603 km/h. For his work, Notari drew on policy guidelines developed in Germany, which are better suited to short distances, like that between Geneva and Lausanne.
Several options to choose from
There are several options available to an engineer looking to build a train that can run under water. The tunnel can, for example, be set under the ground, as is the case with Eurostar, which was opened in 1994 across the Channel and connects London with several cities in mainland Europe.
Norway is looking into another option to link its fjords with its cities – an underwater tunnel suspended at a series of floats that can be seen on the surface. Yet another solution involves putting metal rods in the ground to anchor down the tunnel. However, this will only work if the tunnel itself is buoyant enough.
Yet none of these options was quite right for Lake Geneva. This was mainly because its clear waters make it popular among sports enthusiasts and esthetes, which meant the student had to design a tunnel that was at least 20 meters deep and not visible from the surface.
30 meters underwater
Notari therefore went with a bridge located 30 meters below the surface and supported by piers made of reinforced concrete. This solution was the most rigid, which is a crucial factor for a high-speed train. It was also the most secure in the event of internal flooding. Other advantages also guided his choice. With this solution, the temperature would be constant throughout the entire structure, which would prevent any thermal deformation as a result of the changing seasons. Waves are also at their weakest at that kind of depth, and the bridge would not get in the way of any existing structures.
What’s more, the hydrostatic pressure would be a bonus in terms of the solidity of the 199 modules making up the concrete tunnels. The engineer’s tunnel measures 14.5 meters in diameter and is designed to withstand earthquakes, internal and external explosions, flooding, tsunamis and landslides. The structure would include compartments containing ballast to make it possible to stabilize the tunnel at any time based on Archimedes’ principle. To adjust to the lake’s varying depth, the height of the pillars, which are 6 meters in diameter, would range from 7.5 to 45 meters. The bridge’s route would follow the lakeshore (see Fig.2. on the left). And the two ends of the line would be connected to the Geneva and Lausanne train stations via elevators.
Too technically feasible to be utopian
The idea of an underwater bridge in Lake Geneva doesn’t seem so utopian to the freshly graduated engineer. “The concept of an underwater bridge has been around for a century,” says Notari. “Our know-how has advanced significantly thanks to projects like oil platforms and offshore wind farms. What’s missing is a pioneering investor who’s ready to put up the money to fund the construction of a prototype.”
For Aurelio Muttoni, high-speed transportation projects have great potential: “The solution that Elia studied is technically realistic. I myself came up with a similar solution in the 1990s when studying the feasibility of crossing Lake Lugano as part of the southern extension of the Gotthard high-speed train line.” Muttoni adds that he was inspired by Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s ultra-fast train, when suggesting the topic to his student. (See the .)
But given the complexity of the situation, the environmental challenges and the high costs of this kind of project, Muttoni is convinced that it will be many years before Lake Geneva gets an underwater tunnel.","Summer series. Students' projects (5/9) - Drawing inspiration from Elon Musk’s Hyperloop and the Swissmetro initiative, a civil engineering Master’s student has looked into the possibility of building an underwater high-speed train route through Lake Geneva."
103,"<p>They are a group of 30-odd architecture students from EPFL, ETH Zurich, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW, Basel) and Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany), and they are preparing to don hardhats and work boots. Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.<p></p><p>This Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”</p><p></p><p>The structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.</p><p></p><p><strong>Between tradition and modernity</strong></p><p>Yannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction.

A group of around 30 Master’s students in architecture from EPFL and other Swiss universities will spend a month constructing a rammed-earth mock-up in St. Gallen on a site devoted to the arts. Opposite the worksite, an exhibition about the history of rammed-earth construction will open on 20 August.<br/></p>","They are a group of 30-odd architecture students from EPFL, ETH Zurich, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW, Basel) and Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany), and they are preparing to don hardhats and work boots. Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.
This Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”
The structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.
Between tradition and modernity
Yannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction. So while the base of the pavilion can be constructed with conventional rammed earth – erected and dried on the building’s foundations – the upper floor of the pavilion will be composed by earthen blocks that will be used as prefabricated components. This approach will help cut down the building time. The earth needed for the columns of the mock-up will be taken from local construction sites and tested by experts.
The two students continue to marvel at the wonders of rammed earth: “We think that the sensible thing to do is to use materials available to us, and that includes earth – which is 100% recyclable,” says Claessens. “In our project, the earth walls – and not the concrete – are load-bearing. We are turning normal building codes on their head.” Pretolani is equally enthusiastic: “We felt we had a free hand in terms of project design because there is so much potential in rammed earth, which is not a contemporary material in terms of its aesthetics and does not have well-developed building standards.”
Pilot project
The mock-up could also serve as a pilot project for a new technique – prestressed rammed earth – in which steel cables, linked together to meet seismic standards, will run through the building’s earthen columns from top to bottom. For that reason, the engineers backstopping the students will monitor the project once it’s completed, making up for the lack of building standards.
Many architects steer clear of earth as a building material, since they feel it slows the speed of construction and leads to higher costs. The St. Gallen pavilion could upend such conventional thinking, according to Boltshauser, since it will only take a month to build: “By combining prefabricated earth blocks with other prefabricated concrete components, the pavilion is a glimpse at what could be the future of rammed-earth construction. It will also allow us to calculate the associated savings in terms of costs and gray energy.”
Textiles and rammed earth go way back 
The Sittertal valley was a manufacturing region, specializing in dyeing textiles, until the 19th century. The buildings, located between the Sitter river and a canal, have been maintained and renovated and are now dedicated to the visual arts and artisanal crafts. They play host to artist residences, a library, material archives and exhibitions. “Expertise in earth building spread from France to Switzerland through the linen trade, starting in the 17th century. Using the rammed-earth technique for a building on a site that was once devoted to textiles is our way of acknowledging that history,” adds Boltshauser.
One week after the construction work begins, an exhibition describing the history of this building technique, called “Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” will open. This exhibition was first shown at EPFL’s Archizoom space in the spring of 2017. In St. Gallen, it will be set up in the Sitterwerk library, just opposite the students’ pavilion project.

Polarization-based measurements
SensUs aims to encourage the development of biosensors, targeting a different application each year – although the objective always relates to measuring a biomarker with an impact on public health. The objective is chosen by a panel of experts that includes Professor Renaud. Existing tests to measure vancomycin require a great deal of time, a considerable amount of blood and a special machine that costs tens of thousands of Swiss francs.

How does it work? “We first created a peptide that bonds specifically to vancomycin, and then we added a fluorescent compound,” says Faillétaz. “As the vancomycin bonds to the fluorescent peptide, the peptide’s movement slows and the light it emits becomes more and more polarized. By measuring the degree of light polarization, we can calculate the vancomycin concentration in a patient’s blood.” According to Professor Renaud, this method already exists but has never been used to make a portable biosensor.
At the competition, the EPFL team will have to not only prove their biosensor’s efficacy by analyzing various samples, but also demonstrate its benefits for the healthcare industry and its market potential. “By changing the synthesis compound, our biosensor could be used to detect other antibiotics and biomarkers,” says David Vilela, a Master’s student in life sciences.

113,"<p>How can we bring to life a musical heritage now preserved in a digital format? How does this newly digitised heritage change our perception of the past? And what new cultural perspectives does it open? An interdisciplinary research project by the EPFL + ECAL Lab, Metamedia Center and the ALICE laboratory set out to address these questions. It all began when Audemars Piguet joined forces with Montreux Sounds and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) to digitise, restore and preserve the treasured archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was founded by the late Claude Nobs exactly 50 years ago. The tremendous collection comprises thousands of hours of recordings by the finest musicians on the planet. It is the first audiovisual library to have earned the accolade of UNESCO Memory of the World. “The project was inspired by the work of Claude Nobs. He was a faithful friend and so we are delighted to take part in this initiative. We are proud to participate in the colossal technological efforts needed to transform this unique heritage into a first-class digitised resource for future generations,” says Olivier Audemars, Vice-Chairman of the Audemars Piguet Board of Directors.<p>Work to preserve this legacy began in 2008 and is almost complete. Over the years the archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival have taken many different formats. “All the master copies have now been digitised and work on the original tapes will be finished by the end of the summer. We can now make full use of this heritage for research purposes,” continues Alain Dufaux, Operations Director at Metamedia Center. In the past 8 years, more than 11,000 hours of video recordings (in HD since 1991) and 6,000 hours of high-quality audio recordings have been preserved in uncompressed digital formats utilizing the very latest technology. Since 2010, this unique collection has used as a database for a number of research projects at EPFL.</p><p><strong>Living heritage</strong><br/> The study conducted by the EPFL+ECAL Lab, the research centre for design at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the ALICE architecture studio ALICE (at EPFL), proposes a new vision for this digitised heritage. The aim is not to reconstitute the past, but instead to create a specific experience for a digitised archive. “The original concert experience is the backdrop of Lake Geneva and the mountains, the ambiance of festival-goers in their thousands, the unfolding of events on-stage, and above all the flesh-and-blood presence of the musicians. We can’t recreate this. Instead we need to make the most of what digital has to offer to create an alternative experience, a complementary experience,” explains Project Manager Nicolas Henchoz. The first private booth was launched in 2012 and awarded the Design Preis Schweiz the following year.</p><p>A ramped-up version of the booth, dubbed Montreux Heritage Lab2, opens to the public in November in the brand new Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL. Montreux Heritage Lab2 unlocks the lion’s share of the archive footage, immersing up to 20 viewers at a time in an intense audiovisual experience.</p><p>EPFL was guided by three principles in developing the new booth. First, the content and its cultural value take front and center. Stunning, well-preserved archival footage dominates the space, appearing on a screen whose sophisticated geometry gives the viewer a sense of depth and proximity to the stage. Then comes the surround sound – so fundamental to the immersive effect – which was orchestrated by Audioborn and Illusonic (two startups founded by former members of the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory, LCAV) with help from Hervé Lissek's Acoustic Group (LTS2) and the Yverdon-les-Bains company Relec with its PSI Audio high-precision speakers. The viewer’s experience is thus shaped by live footage and music – the very essence of the archive. The sense of immersion is further enhanced by the lateral walls of the booth, where mirrors reflect the selected footage and display information and visuals through an LED underlay. The experience is rounded out by anecdotes on the history of the festival showing up on the screens. The booth is structured to direct its light toward the Montreux Jazz Café next door and, in the evening, towards the heart of the campus. </p><p>Purpose-designed controls afford an overview of the archive footage, placing more than 44,000 tracks at your fingertips.</p><p>---</p><p><em>From the outset, the project saw the light of day thanks to the crucial support from Audemars Piguet, who has been involved since the beginning. Loterie Romande, Fondation Ernest Göhner and external technological partners have also provided invaluable support.</em></p></p>","<p> Montreux Heritage Lab2 is an immersive audiovisual experience that places nearly 6,000 hours of archive footage from the Montreux Jazz Festival at the fingertips of the public.

We can’t recreate this. Instead we need to make the most of what digital has to offer to create an alternative experience, a complementary experience,” explains Project Manager Nicolas Henchoz. The first private booth was launched in 2012 and awarded the Design Preis Schweiz the following year.
A ramped-up version of the booth, dubbed Montreux Heritage Lab2, opens to the public in November in the brand new Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL. Montreux Heritage Lab2 unlocks the lion’s share of the archive footage, immersing up to 20 viewers at a time in an intense audiovisual experience.
EPFL was guided by three principles in developing the new booth. First, the content and its cultural value take front and center. Stunning, well-preserved archival footage dominates the space, appearing on a screen whose sophisticated geometry gives the viewer a sense of depth and proximity to the stage. Then comes the surround sound – so fundamental to the immersive effect – which was orchestrated by Audioborn and Illusonic (two startups founded by former members of the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory, LCAV) with help from Hervé Lissek's Acoustic Group (LTS2) and the Yverdon-les-Bains company Relec with its PSI Audio high-precision speakers. The viewer’s experience is thus shaped by live footage and music – the very essence of the archive. The sense of immersion is further enhanced by the lateral walls of the booth, where mirrors reflect the selected footage and display information and visuals through an LED underlay. The experience is rounded out by anecdotes on the history of the festival showing up on the screens. The booth is structured to direct its light toward the Montreux Jazz Café next door and, in the evening, towards the heart of the campus. 
Purpose-designed controls afford an overview of the archive footage, placing more than 44,000 tracks at your fingertips.

From the outset, the project saw the light of day thanks to the crucial support from Audemars Piguet, who has been involved since the beginning. Loterie Romande, Fondation Ernest Göhner and external technological partners have also provided invaluable support.","Montreux Heritage Lab2 is an immersive audiovisual experience that places nearly 6,000 hours of archive footage from the Montreux Jazz Festival at the fingertips of the public. Made possible with the support of Audemars Piguet, the viewing booth was designed and built on-site at the EPFL + ECAL Lab through collaboration with Metamedia Center and the ALICE laboratory, and showcases cutting-edge research in design, architecture and technology. Montreux Heritage Lab2 will has been unveiled at the EPFL+ECAL Lab today."

The researchers have discovered that long life involves a network of some 750 genes. A third of these play an important role, particularly in the ability of cells to generate energy from food. Experiments have shown that in mice, for example, the presence or absence of these genes can change life expectancy from 350 to 900 days.
“Looking at a whole group of genes and their interactions to understand longevity is an original approach,” Johan Auwerx explains, “because until now researchers were looking more at individual genes to find the answer.”
The long-term goal of this research is not only to allow people to live to a ripe old age, but also to get them there in good health,” notes Riekelt Houtkooper.
It will be recalled that Professor Auwerx and his team have also made significant discoveries concerning lipid metabolism and the pathogenesis of complex metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) and arterial hypertension.","GENETICS – A complex network of genes, in combination with a low-calorie diet and exercise, appears to be a key factor in a long life expectancy.

Collagen VI is a type of collagen that recent studies have found in multiple sites in the body, such as the heart, neurons, immune cells, tendons, lungs, and the skin. Depending on the type of tissue, it plays different protective and mechanical roles, but it has also been shown to be involved in a number of diseases, including the growth of cancer tumors.
The EPFL researchers studied HFS nodules in mouse models as well as a human patient. The female HFS mice characteristically suffer from accumulation of collagen in the uterus, which makes them sterile. The human patient had nodules at various body sites including the scalp and behind the ear. Studying tissue samples, the researchers found that the nodules in both mice and human were rich in collagen VI.
Wanting to understand the relationship between CMG2 and collagen VI, the team developed double-knockout mice in which the genes for both proteins — CMG2 and collagen VI — had been deleted. Previous studies have shown that CMG2-knockout mice are infertile due to uterine nodules that render them infertile. But remarkably, the scientists found that when the gene for collagen VI was deleted too, the mice regained their fertility, confirming that CMG2 and collagen VI are somehow connected in HFS.
Further studies showed that CMG2 physically binds collagen VI through a specialized domain. The CMG2 protein then acts as a receptor, sending a signal into the cell, causing collagen VI to be internalized and degraded inside the cell’s lysosomes.
The study reveals a major physiological function for CMG2 and demonstrates its interaction with collagen VI. This interaction explains how major HSF symptoms arise when mutation of the

118,"<p>Swarm robotics is offering innovative solutions to real-world problems by creating a new form of artificial intelligence based on insect-like instincts. Mirko Kovac, from EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, is a young robotics engineer who has already made leaps forward in the field with his grasshopper-inspired jumping robot.<object height=""340"" width=""560""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/dYDR-yC3wK0?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR""/><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""/><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""/><embed allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" height=""340"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/v/dYDR-yC3wK0?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""560""/></object><p></p><p>He and his collaborators have created an innovative perching mechanism where the robot flies head first into the object, a tree for example—without being destroyed— and attaches to almost any type of surface using sharp prongs. It then detaches on command. The goal is to create robots that can travel in swarms over rough terrain to come to the aide of catastrophe victims.<br/> “We are not blindly imitating nature, but using the same principles to possibly improve on it,” explains Kovac, who recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL. “Simple behavioral laws such as jumping, flying and perching lead to complex control over movement without the need for high computational power.”<br/><br/> Jumping, gliding and perching allow for mobility over rocky territory or destroyed urban areas. This new form of AI takes its inspiration from the insect world, but is more as an abstract reflection on their instincts and design principles than merely imitating their morphology.

Mirko Kovac, from EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, is a young robotics engineer who has already made leaps forward in the field with his grasshopper-inspired jumping robot.
He and his collaborators have created an innovative perching mechanism where the robot flies head first into the object, a tree for example—without being destroyed— and attaches to almost any type of surface using sharp prongs. It then detaches on command. The goal is to create robots that can travel in swarms over rough terrain to come to the aide of catastrophe victims.
 “We are not blindly imitating nature, but using the same principles to possibly improve on it,” explains Kovac, who recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL. “Simple behavioral laws such as jumping, flying and perching lead to complex control over movement without the need for high computational power.”
 Jumping, gliding and perching allow for mobility over rocky territory or destroyed urban areas. This new form of AI takes its inspiration from the insect world, but is more as an abstract reflection on their instincts and design principles than merely imitating their morphology. This simplicity allows for greater mobility since the robots are not bogged down with heavy batteries. Kovac imagines swarms of his robots equipped with different sensors and small cameras that could be deployed over devastated areas to transmit essential information back to rescue command centers.

 Alongside this effort, EPFL is also engaged in an initiative at the national level to help develop the country’s hydroelectric power. Cameroon is one of four countries on the African continent with significant hydroelectric potential. 70% of electricity production in the country is already the result of hydropower, but that represents only 5% of the potential capacity of this energy source. At the same time, the electrification rate is 50% in cities and 5% in the countryside.
Academic and industry partners in Switzerland put together a consortium that is concentrating on small and medium-sized power stations. “At this stage, there is a serious shortage of power stations in Africa with capacity between several hundred kilowatts and several dozen megawatts, and this is a range in which Switzerland has special expertise,” said Crettenand, who ran this project as part of his mission with EPFL’s Energy Center.
The consortium aims to work, with local partners, in a spirit of integrated and sustainable development. “We want to develop projects in which hydropower complements other sources of renewable energies and, insofar as possible, provides ways to store energy in storage plants and pumped-storage stations. This type of storage helps with the technical regulation of the power grid and with developing small grids,” said the researcher. The consortium, still more of an interest group at this stage, hopes eventually to help alleviate the electricity problems, especially for the hospitals.","EPFL has teamed up with Swiss and Cameroonian partners to address major issues like stabilizing the country’s existing grid, improving energy efficiency and developing hydroelectric potential."

Normally, cells regulate the entry of foreign material very tightly, to prevent invasions from pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. As a result, the invaders have evolved various mechanisms to overcome the barriers and gain entry into cells.
For example, one route involves hijacking the cell’s own machinery and tricking it into internalizing the virus or bacterium inside a vesicle that the cell itself makes. This process, which is one of the regular ways cells take in large molecules, is called “endocytosis"".
The scientists used various vesicle systems and computer simulations to study a bacterial invasion mechanism that seems to have some unique properties. The mechanism is used, among others, by the bacteria that cause shigella and that produce a small, rigid protein called Shiga toxin.
The study found that Shiga toxin particles bind tightly to certain lipids, or fats, on the membrane surface of the cell to be invaded. They then begin to form clusters on the membrane, which cause the membrane to curve inwards, creating tube-shaped invaginations, through which the toxin particles enter the cell. Once inside, the Shiga toxins modify the cell’s genetic mechanism, and infection has begun.
But the major discovery was that the toxin actually exploits a generic, physical force in the cell’s membrane to produce the invaginations. This is called the “Casimir force” and was first described as a theoretical force acting between two charged, parallel, conducting surfaces.
In terms of biology, the Casimir force is thought to act between membrane-bound proteins in cells, existing on all fluid biological cell membranes and arising only when the pathogen binds tightly to the membrane surface.
The researchers propose that 
Shigella
 bacteria, and other pathogens, have evolved to take advantage of the Casimir force arising from the fluctuating plasma membrane to infect cells. In addition, because the fats that the toxin binds to are used by the cell for its own operations, the Shiga toxin cannot be blocked from entering without disabling or modifying the normal functions of the cell.
Nanoparticles for drug delivery
But because the Casimir force is thought to arise for any tightly bound nanoparticles on the surface of the cell’s membrane, there is the potential for producing a novel, nanoparticle-based pathway for drug delivery. First, we would have to bind nanoparticles tightly to the surface of the cell where they will cluster. Second, the nanoparticles must also slightly increase the cell membrane’s curvature to exploit the Casimir force and gain entry into the cell. Once inside, they can begin making beneficial, defensive changes in the cell’s behavior.

128,"<p>The brain uses glucose for energy in a very efficient manner. However, given the brain’s structure and metabolic constraints, the way it achieves this efficiency is a mystery. The key is the little-understood relationship between neurons, blood vessels and the other cells of the brain, the glia. Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have now developed the first computer model of this relationship, which has successfully matched previous experimental in vivo and in vitro data in the field. The model, published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, is now being integrated into the detailed brain model of the Blue Brain Project.<p>The brain is more than neurons passing information between them. Over half of the brain is actually composed by glial cells, which support and insulate neurons, supply them with energy substrates, protect them from pathogens and even clear out dead neurons from the brain. In fact, glial cells, neurons and the brain’s blood vessels form a functional unit, the neuron-glia-vascular unit (NGV) that regulates the brain’s energy management.</p><p>A team led by Pierre Magistretti (EPFL, KAUST), working with Renaud Jolivet (University College London), has now developed a detailed computer model that accurately captures the dynamics of this relationship. Specifically, the model shows how glucose is shuttled between the three elements of the unit to produce energy for activated neurons.</p><p>Previous experiments from Magistretti’s group show that glucose flows from a type of glia cells called “astrocytes” to neurons in the form of lactate. However, some theoretical studies have proposed that lactate could go the other way – from neurons to astrocytes.

However, given the brain’s structure and metabolic constraints, the way it achieves this efficiency is a mystery. The key is the little-understood relationship between neurons, blood vessels and the other cells of the brain, the glia. Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have now developed the first computer model of this relationship, which has successfully matched previous experimental in vivo and in vitro data in the field. The model, published in 
PLOS Computational Biology
, is now being integrated into the detailed brain model of the Blue Brain Project.
The brain is more than neurons passing information between them. Over half of the brain is actually composed by glial cells, which support and insulate neurons, supply them with energy substrates, protect them from pathogens and even clear out dead neurons from the brain. In fact, glial cells, neurons and the brain’s blood vessels form a functional unit, the neuron-glia-vascular unit (NGV) that regulates the brain’s energy management.
A team led by Pierre Magistretti (EPFL, KAUST), working with Renaud Jolivet (University College London), has now developed a detailed computer model that accurately captures the dynamics of this relationship. Specifically, the model shows how glucose is shuttled between the three elements of the unit to produce energy for activated neurons.
Previous experiments from Magistretti’s group show that glucose flows from a type of glia cells called “astrocytes” to neurons in the form of lactate. However, some theoretical studies have proposed that lactate could go the other way – from neurons to astrocytes. This has major implications for our understanding of brain energy metabolism.
The model has now confirmed in quantitative terms that lactate flows from astrocytes to neurons. It is also the first such model to successfully simulate the actual timeframe of this process, a breakthrough that provides a measurable picture of how neurons and glial cells tightly coordinate brain energy metabolism.
A better understanding of the metabolic relationships between neurons and glia has also important implications for understanding the signals detected with functional brain imaging techniques, such as fMRI and PET, which monitor glucose utilization, blood flow or oxygen consumption changes that occur in register with neuronal activity.
“This is the first time-dependent and multi-scale model of the neuron-glia-blood vessel that accurately reflects experimental observations from multiple cells types and organisms,” says Pierre Magistretti. The model is now being integrated with the accurate brain model being developed by the Blue Brain Project at EPFL. “By adding the extra layer of neuron-glial dynamics, we can take a step toward more accurately modeling the real working of the brain.”

132,"<p>A leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, colon cancer is famously resistant to treatment. There are many reasons for this, but one has to do with a group of persisting cancer cells in the colon that cause relapses. Conventional therapies against them are mostly ineffective. EPFL scientists have now identified a biological mechanism that can be exploited to counteract colon cancer relapses. The approach activates a protein that is lost in the persisting cancer cells. The researchers were able to reactivate it using vitamin A, thus eliminating the cancer cells and preventing metastasis. The study <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610815004225"">is published in <em>Cancer Cell</em>,</a> and introduces a new way to treat colon cancer.<p>When a colon-cancer patient receives treatment, e.g. chemotherapy, most of the cancer cells die off. But the genetic mutations that caused the cancer in the first place can survive in a specific group of cells of the colon. These are actually stem cells, meaning that they are premature cells waiting to grow into full-blown, normal cells of the colon. After cancer treatment ends, the surviving stem cells, still containing the cancerous mutations, can reappear and cause a relapse.</p><p><a href=""http://huelsken-lab.epfl.ch/"">The lab of Joerg Huelsken at EPFL</a> studied how differentiated colon cells come from stem cells in the gut. Using an array of different techniques, the team looked at cells, mouse models and samples from human patients.</p><p><strong>Proteins and signaling pathways </strong></p><p>The study focused on a protein called HOXA5, which belongs to a family of proteins that regulate the development of the fetus. These proteins are made during early development and work together to make sure that every tissue is correctly identified and that the fetus’s body and limbs are patterned properly. In the adult body, proteins like HOXA5 regulate the body’s stem cells to maintain both the identity and function of different tissues. Huelsken’s team found that in the gut, HOXA5 plays a major role in restricting the number of stem cells, as well as the cells that make them.</p><p>Like all proteins, HOXA5 originates from a specific gene. The study showed that the cancerous stem cells of the colon use a biological mechanism that blocks it. This mechanism is called a “signaling pathway” because it involves a domino of molecules, each activating the next one down the line. The purpose of a signaling pathway is to transmit biological information from one part of the cell to another, e.g. from the outer membrane all the way to the nucleus. By blocking the HOXA5 gene, the cancerous stem cells of the colon can grow uncontrollably and spread, causing relapses and metastasis.</p><p></p><p><strong>Retinoids: a way to fight back </strong></p><p>The researchers looked for ways to reverse the blocking of HOXA5. The answer came from vitamin A. This small chemical structure is called a retinoid, and it has been known to induce differentiation of stem cells in the skin. The EPFL scientists found that retinoids can re-activate HOXA5. In mice that had colon cancer, the treatment with retinoids blocked tumor progression and normalized the tissue. By turning the gene for HOXA5 back on, this treatment eliminated cancer stem cells and prevented metastasis in the live animals. The researchers got similar results with samples from actual patients.</p><p>The new study suggests that patients that may profit from this well-tolerated treatment can be identified based on their expression pattern for the HOXA5 gene. Retinoid differentiation therapy could be significantly effective against colon cancer, not only for treatment of existing disease but also as a preventive measure in high-risk patients.</p><p><em>This study included contributions from EPFL’s core facilities, Kyoto University, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency.

EPFL scientists have now identified a biological mechanism that can be exploited to counteract colon cancer relapses. The approach activates a protein that is lost in the persisting cancer cells. The researchers were able to reactivate it using vitamin A, thus eliminating the cancer cells and preventing metastasis. The study  and introduces a new way to treat colon cancer.
When a colon-cancer patient receives treatment, e.g. chemotherapy, most of the cancer cells die off. But the genetic mutations that caused the cancer in the first place can survive in a specific group of cells of the colon. These are actually stem cells, meaning that they are premature cells waiting to grow into full-blown, normal cells of the colon. After cancer treatment ends, the surviving stem cells, still containing the cancerous mutations, can reappear and cause a relapse.
 studied how differentiated colon cells come from stem cells in the gut. Using an array of different techniques, the team looked at cells, mouse models and samples from human patients.
Proteins and signaling pathways 
The study focused on a protein called HOXA5, which belongs to a family of proteins that regulate the development of the fetus. These proteins are made during early development and work together to make sure that every tissue is correctly identified and that the fetus’s body and limbs are patterned properly. In the adult body, proteins like HOXA5 regulate the body’s stem cells to maintain both the identity and function of different tissues. Huelsken’s team found that in the gut, HOXA5 plays a major role in restricting the number of stem cells, as well as the cells that make them.
Like all proteins, HOXA5 originates from a specific gene. The study showed that the cancerous stem cells of the colon use a biological mechanism that blocks it. This mechanism is called a “signaling pathway” because it involves a domino of molecules, each activating the next one down the line. The purpose of a signaling pathway is to transmit biological information from one part of the cell to another, e.g. from the outer membrane all the way to the nucleus. By blocking the HOXA5 gene, the cancerous stem cells of the colon can grow uncontrollably and spread, causing relapses and metastasis.
Retinoids: a way to fight back 
The researchers looked for ways to reverse the blocking of HOXA5. The answer came from vitamin A. This small chemical structure is called a retinoid, and it has been known to induce differentiation of stem cells in the skin. The EPFL scientists found that retinoids can re-activate HOXA5. In mice that had colon cancer, the treatment with retinoids blocked tumor progression and normalized the tissue. By turning the gene for HOXA5 back on, this treatment eliminated cancer stem cells and prevented metastasis in the live animals. The researchers got similar results with samples from actual patients.
The new study suggests that patients that may profit from this well-tolerated treatment can be identified based on their expression pattern for the HOXA5 gene. Retinoid differentiation therapy could be significantly effective against colon cancer, not only for treatment of existing disease but also as a preventive measure in high-risk patients.
This study included contributions from EPFL’s core facilities, Kyoto University, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency. It was funded by EMBO, the Swiss League against Cancer, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the NCCR in Molecular Oncology.

This alliance, created in support of economic development for the region, allows the partners to pool their resources in the field of digital trust, to position and give a global resonance to the Lake Geneva region. Today, manufacturers have followed suit. Indeed, since the launch announcement
 3 months ago, this initiative has become a public-private partnership actively supported by captains of industry such as ELCA, GCSP, Kudelski, SGS and SICPA, SMEs, large groups, startups, scale-ups, as well as academic institutions in the Lake Geneva region (IHEID, HEIG-VD, HES-SO Geneva, EPFL, UNIGE, UNIL). Strategic partnerships are under discussion.
During the launch, EPFL President Martin Vetterli stated: ""It is now time for the population to regain the control over their data.""
Strategic alliances for concrete actions
Alliances are being established with new partners such as the Cyber Peace Institute, PWC and Wisekey. But also since June:
- 38 companies and organizations have expressed their interest in joining the ""TRUST VALLEY"".
- 14 organizations have been added to the Lake Geneva map dedicated to digital trust and are presented on the Trust Valley website.
- More than 12 projects have been submitted to the initiative via a dedicated marketplace.
The ecosystem is growing thanks to the support and involvement of startups such as Aequivalent, ProtonMail, Yes We Hack; of scale-ups such as Sysmosoft; of SMEs such as eXperts Solutions, Exoscale, MSF Partners, AdNovum, Netguardians, Uditis; as well as the Transports Lausannois.
On the German-speaking side of Switzerland, the initiative attracts the support of Sygnum Bank, as well as contributors from large companies like Fortinet and the NGO Cyber Peace Institute.
Clear international support was given:
""We need to work together. It is always important to find the best local solutions to local problems. I am aware that what you (the TRUST VALLEY) do is of fundamental importance to the world.

139,"<p>Most rod-shaped bacteria divide by splitting into two around the middle after their DNA has replicated safely and segregated to opposite ends of the cell.

A finite energy source
In 2017, Doris Leuthard, then-president of the Swiss Confederation, called geothermal energy an “incredible energy source” but warned that it’s not infinite; it needs to be extracted according to specific rules. For instance, the borehole heat exchangers used in GSHPs should be installed a certain distance apart to prevent thermal interference – the heat-exchanger equivalent of a short circuit – and prevent the ground from cooling. “The heat-transfer fluid absorbs the heat that’s in the ground,” says Alina Walch, a PhD student at EPFL’s . “If too many of these exchangers are packed into a tiny space, the ground will cool off, which is something we absolutely need to avoid.”
Thermal interference is one of the factors that a team of scientists, including Walch, took into account in  on 18 November. They calculated the technical potential of GSHPs in the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva. “The technical potential is the maximum amount of geothermal energy that can be extracted by the heat pumps using all the available area in the two cantons, assuming they operate at at least 80% of their rated power,” she says.

They then simulated GSHPs installed throughout that area based on factors such as ground temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. “We incorporated the various technical constraints and estimated the optimal borehole spacing that would both comply with installation standards and maximize the extractable heat,” says Walch.

Decisions, feedback, learning
Decision-making comes in two major into two types: Markovian and non-Markovian, named after the mathematician Andrey Markov (1856-1922). Simply put, in Markovian decision-making, the next decision step depends entirely on the current state of affairs. For example, when playing backgammon, the next move depends only on the current layout of the board, and not on how it got to be like that. This relatively straightforward process has been extensively modeled in computers and machines.
Non-Markovian decision-making is more complex. Here, the next step is affected by other factors, such as external constraints and previous decisions. For example, a person’s goal might be to travel on the train. But what will happens when he arrives at the door to the train depends on whether or not he has previously visited the ticket booth to buy a ticket. In other words, the next step depends on how he got there; without a ticket, he cannot proceed to the desired goal. In neuroscience, the “buy-ticket” step is referred to as a “switch-state”.
A new model of decision-making
A team led by Michael Herzog at EPFL and Walter Senn at the University of Berne developed the first biologically plausible model that can handle non-Markovian decision-making. Herzog’s group has now tested it with humans as well as various computer models. The model, developed in a previous study, was now validated with two distinct tests, designed by Aaron Michael Clarke and Elisa Tartaglia in Herzog’s lab. The tests were performed by human subjects, and three computer models with different degrees of learning ability. In addition, the test were also taken by an advanced brain model called a “spiking neuron network”, which makes decisions based on whether the majority of neurons in a population fired a signal, or “spike”, and simulates human performance in a very realistic manner.
The first experiment tested the impact of the switch-state on people’s decision-making and learning. Users played a computer game where they had to navigate through eight icons (a gun, a car etc.) to finally reach the end goal (called “Yeah!”). Each icon came with three buttons, each leading down a different route, and the user had to decide which one to take. Although there was a relatively short route from the first icon to the goal, it was impossible to go through it unless the user first went through a switch-state icon – an image of a computer. Users repeated the experiment multiple times, becoming increasingly better at deciding which routes to pick. For example, most people took over 80 clicks to get to the goal when they began, but after 40 games, they needed fewer than ten.
The second experiment tested how delayed feedback affects decision-making and learning. Here, users were shown a set of experimental images and told that each image belonged to either category one or category two. Each category corresponded to either the left or the right arrow on the keyboard, but the participants were not told which arrow went with which image beforehand. Next, the users were shown each image one at a time, and had to press either the left or right arrow depending on the category of each icon. In response, the screen produce a RIGHT or WRONG feedback message. As the test went on, the feedback became delayed, to the point where feedback from one icon would come after the feedback for the next icon had appeared.
Decision dynamics
The results of the study drew three major conclusions. First, that human decision-making can perform just as well as current sophisticated computer models under non-Markovian conditions, such as the presence of a switch-state. This is a significant finding in our current efforts to model the human brain and develop artificial intelligence systems.
Secondly, that delayed feedback significantly impairs human decision-making and learning, even though it does not impact the performance of computer models, which have perfect memory. In the second experiment, it took human participants ten times more attempts to correctly recall and assign arrows to icons. Feedback is a crucial element of decision-making and learning. We set a goal, make a decision about how to achieve it, act accordingly, and then find out whether or not our goal was met. In some cases, e.g. learning to ride a bike, feedback on every decision we make for balancing, pedaling, braking etc. is instant: either we stay up and going, or we fall down. But in many other cases, such as playing backgammon, feedback is significantly delayed; it can take a while to find out if each move has led us to victory or not.
Finally, the researchers found that the spiking neurons model matches and describes human performance very well. The significance of this cannot be overstated, as non-Markovian decision-making has proven to be very challenging for computer models. “This is a proof-of-concept study,” says Michael Herzog. “But the study makes an important contribution toward understanding, and accurately modeling, the human brain – and even surpassing its abilities with artificial intelligence.”
This study represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute with the University of Berne.

There are many subtypes of hepatoblastoma, the two major ones being fetal and embryonal. Clinically, pure fetal cases have the best prognosis.

Meylan’s lab built on the genetics of hepatoblastoma, which involves frequent mutations in the gene CTNNB1. This gene produces the protein beta-catenin, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription. Because of its dual function, mutations of the CTNNB1 gene can have diverse and far-reaching consequences, including in cancers like hepatoblastoma. Beta-catenin is a component of a signaling pathway called Wnt/beta-catenin, which is responsible for regulating the expression of multiple genes. What is of interest is that many components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are affected and overactive in various tumors.
Something that is becoming increasingly significant in oncology is that different types of cancers show characteristic metabolic profiles, e.g. in the way they produce, store, and use glucose, glutamine, fatty acids etc. Based on this, the EPFL researchers looked at the relationship of the CTNNB1 gene and the cell’s metabolism.
The researchers first showed that beta-catenin, as part of the Wnt signaling pathway directly regulates the expression of a gene that produces a glucose transporter protein (GLUT3).
Next, they used RNA sequencing to identify molecular and metabolic features that are specific to hepatoblastoma. This approach revealed that several enzymes involved in the metabolism of glucose are overexpressed in embryonal hepatoblastoma cells as compared to fetal hepatoblastoma cells. 
Finally, the scientists found that embryonal hepatoblastoma cells show high levels of glucose uptake. In addition, they also found that these cells are very sensitive to the perturbation of an enzyme involved in the cell’s use of glucose, which might hint to a metabolically driven therapy in the future.
Working off their discoveries, the researchers used immunohistochemistry of three metabolic biomarkers to better distinguish embryonal from fetal components out of a large panel of human hepatoblastoma biopsies, collected from French and Swiss university hospitals.
The study shows that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is crucial for reprograming the energy management of tumor cells. It also provides a new, metabolic classification of human hepatoblastoma that can help oncologists develop novel diagnostic methods and even treatments.

, scientists lead by  in collaboration with TES Pharma have found a new way of increasing NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme competing with its production.
The 
de novo
 synthesis of NAD+ in the cell begins with the amino acid tryptophan. One of the key enzymes involved in this process is ACMSD, which limits the amount of NAD+ produced by the 
de novo
 synthesis pathway.
The scientists were able to show that ACMSD controls the levels of NAD+ in the cell through a mechanism that doesn’t seem to have changed during evolution: case-in-point, the researchers found that, in both the earthworm 
Caenorhabditis elegans
 and mice, blocking the enzyme resulted in higher NAD+ levels and enhanced mitochondrial function.
The inactivation of ACMSD also increased the activity of Sirtuin 1, an enzyme that NAD+ works with in its role as co-enzyme. Sirtuin 1 is known to play major roles in mitochondrial well-being, and as a result, the boost of NAD+ levels ultimately enhanced mitochondrial function.
The team then used two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD, developed by . “Since the enzyme is mostly found in the kidney and liver, we wanted to test the capacity of the ACMSD inhibitors to protect these organs from injury,” explains Elena Katsyuba, first author of the paper.
Both inhibitors were shown to preserve kidney and liver function in animal models of acute kidney injury and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, offering much promise for their future therapeutic potential in humans. “The fact that ACMSD is exclusively present only in the liver and kidneys reduces the risk of negative repercussions of its loss on other organs,” says Katsyuba. “Put simply, the enzyme will not be missed by an organ that does not have it anyway.”
“Given the beneficial health effects of boosting NAD+ levels that we have seen in worm and mouse models of disease, we are looking forward to bringing these compounds soon to the clinic to the benefit of patients suffering from liver and kidney diseases, two areas with a large unmet clinical need,” says Johan Auwerx.

149,"<p>How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.<p>Human comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”</p><p>Coccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”</p><p>Coccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average.

EPFL researchers have analyzed the campus as if it were a town in its own right in order to come up with specific solutions that bring together biometeorology and architecture and could be implemented in the near future.<br/></p>","How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.
Human comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”
Coccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”
Coccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average. The researcher’s first step was to assess the campus’ energy balance; she looked at individual buildings and the effect that buildings have on each other. Summers will be hotter and hotter, and this will be felt more in built spaces than in wooded ones. Existing buildings will have to be renovated, and new buildings will require design changes. Particular attention will have to be paid to the exterior of buildings: “Vegetation moderates microclimates and blocks solar and infrared radiation, evapotranspiration reduces the air temperature, and plants provide shade,” says Coccolo. “These factors completely change our perceived thermal comfort.”
Turning climate challenges into design opportunities
To offset the expected rise in summer temperatures, the study shows that, in addition to proper insulation, buildings and their immediate surroundings will need to provide more shade through protective features according to the level of solar radiation, the direction the building faces and the season. For Coccolo, this goes beyond simply multiplying the number of plants and trees; the focus should be on what truly enhances comfort. This may include such things as foliage density and plant height. Replacing asphalt with grass, for example, can radically change our thermal perception.
The Urban Systems group at the LESO-PB believes that, in the future, architects and urban planners will need to work together in designing the space between buildings, which is just as important as the space inside them (leso.epfl.ch/urbansimulation).

 The digital revolution is nothing less than a goldmine of opportunity for Switzerland. The country’s long tradition of neutrality, together with its world-caliber expertise recognized by research institutions across the globe, make it ideally placed to lay the groundwork for the new concept of digital trust. “Digital trust will be at the core of our strategy,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, the Center’s academic director. “We want to become a center of excellence in the field, where all of our partners – regardless of how they are using digital services – can find answers to their questions and support for their goals.”
The Center will address the three critical challenges of this digital era: cybersecurity, which involves making sure that data transferred across networks cannot be hacked; transparency, which means making it clear how data is processed, sent and stored; and personal data protection, so that sensitive information, such as bank account details and medical records, stays out of malevolent hands. Engineers at the Center will work in parallel to develop new systems and methods in all three areas.

 The Center will combine EPFL’s renowned expertise in cybersecurity, sensitive data protection and blockchain and smart-contracting technology with the advanced capabilities of institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), as well as companies including ELCA, SICPA, Swisscom, Swissquote, SGS and SwissRe, who have already stated their strong interest in joining the Center.
These partner organizations are in direct contact with individuals and businesses, and will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution. The organizations will also contribute their own experts to the research being done at EPFL in order to develop solutions to concrete problems, and will help to fund the Center.
Two new EPFL chairs and 24 labs involved
 EPFL has created two new teaching and research chairs in digital trust, and the search for candidates is already under way. The School also has 24 research labs in this field, mostly within the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, the School of Life Sciences and the College of Management of Technology. “It’s a genuine ecosystem that addresses the needs of the entire population. The challenges are so great that there’s no way we could overcome them without a cross-disciplinary approach,” says Hubaux. The first step will be to develop trust technologies and systems that can form a bedrock of trust between users and service providers – thereby encouraging the adoption and effective use of new technology.
Designed with ambitious goals in mind, the Center got an additional boost from the Swiss Federal Parliament’s decision to cap budget cuts in the areas of education, research and innovation. EPFL will leverage this opportunity to invest in research that will tackle not only the challenges mentioned above, but also those that are bound to come.
Support from the Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland
 The Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland (the cantons of Vaud, Neuchatel, Valais, Geneva, Bern, Fribourg and Jura), currently headed by Pierre Maudet, a member of Geneva’s cantonal government, has applauded the initiative. “This new partnership between the public and private sectors will position Switzerland as a major player in both cybersecurity and the digital trust that our society needs. We encourage all companies and research institutions working in this field to join in,” says Maudet. Philippe Leuba, the member of the Vaud cantonal government who handles innovation-linked relations between the cantonal government and EPFL, adds: “Our region is home to businesses and institutions at the forefront of digital technology, and which attract top-quality international investment. Their position as pioneers in this new partnership with EPFL augurs well for the development of Industry 4.0 in our country.”",EPFL President Martin Vetterli has today unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust. Eight institutional and industrial partners are already willing to join. This new research platform will aim to be a center of excellence for IT security and personal data protection in the digital era.

How does this seemingly simple structure support complex behaviors? To answer this question, scientists have longed for a way to observe the spinal cord’s function in vivo. Until recently, they needed to resort to animal studies, but the advent of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is now providing a new window into the richness of spinal cord signals, directly in humans.
© 2020 EPFL / Highlighting the spinal cord's functional architecture reveals an active spinal cord even for subjects at rest.
Now, scientists at EPFL have combined tailored protocols for spinal cord fMRI with advanced analysis techniques, in order to disentangle these signals and clearly view the spinal cord in action. Tested on 19 healthy subjects, the scientists obtained unprecedented views of the spinal cord’s functional architecture and showed for the first time just how dynamic the spinal cord is, even for subjects at rest. The results are published in today’s issue of Neuron.
“One of the main challenges about observing spinal cord function is getting rid of noise from the rest of the subject’s body, like breathing, the heartbeat, or simply seeing beyond the surrounding vertebral bones,” explains Nawal Kinany, first author of the study. “We managed to decompose spontaneous spinal activity into meaningful networks, with a level of neuroanatomical detail that had never been reached before.”
The study was done at Campus Biotech in collaboration with Silvestro Micera who is the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Translational Neuroengineering at EPFL and Professor of Bioelectronics at Scuola Sant’Anna in Pisa, Italy, as well as with Dimitri Van De Ville who leads EPFL’s Medical Imaging Processing Lab and is also affiliated with the Department of Radiology and Medical Informatics of the Geneva University.

From the perspective of the subject, one simply has to lie down in an fMRI scanner and remain immobile throughout the scan, typically around 10 minutes. The images resulting from the scan are then analyzed to provide a 4-dimensional view – through space and time – to view the dynamics of spinal circuits within the anatomy of the subject.
“These results are clear evidence that spinal resting-state activity is richly organized and thus must bear physiological relevance beyond what was assumed so far,” explains Van De Ville. 
Given its central position at the interface between the brain and the rest of body, the spinal cord is a key player in all human behaviour. The scientists targeted the cervical level because of its involvement in controlling arm and hand muscles. Their approach could help understand how spinal circuits are orchestrated to support the wide range of movements we perform in our everyday life.
“Only a deeper understanding of human motor control can allow for the development of more effective neurorehabilitation approaches. Our new method provides a very important tool in this direction,” furthers Micera.
Tested for now on healthy subjects, the scientists believe that these new protocols will one day be a valuable tool for evaluating the status of dysfunctional or injured spinal cord circuitry, which could promote the development of targeted therapies that rebalance spinal activity or optimally harness the spared connections.","EPFL scientists have developed a non-invasive technique for unraveling the complex dynamics generated by spinal cord circuits to unprecedented detail, a first in functional magnetic resonance imaging that may one day help diagnose spinal cord dysfunction or injury."

Continuous recycling of water and heat
Kermani tested out his theory on kraft pulping – by far the most popular paper-making method in the industry.
Wood chips are wetted, cooked (in digesters), washed, dried and bleached to make pulp. All of this produces vast amounts of steam which, in addition to being used in the process itself, generates more than enough electricity to power the plant. The surplus energy can then be sold.
According to Kermani, however, the current system is far from optimal. “Huge amounts of water and energy go to waste because the stages of the process aren’t connected,” he explains. “For instance, the mill uses cold water to wash and cool the pulp. But that water, which contains valuable heat, is then discarded. Likewise, high-pressure steam is produced by burning black liquor at extremely high temperatures – around 1,200°C. The steam powers turbines to generate electricity and provides a heat source for other processes, but it’s too energy intensive to produce.”
Organic fluids
 In his paper, Kermani outlines several ways in which the heated water could be reused. He also recommends introducing organic Rankine cycles, which rely on a special property of organic fluids: the fact that they turn into high-pressure steam at relatively low temperatures (250°C). “Using organic fluids would allow the mill to produce the steam it needs using recovered hot water at low-to-medium temperatures,” he explains.
The Canadian firm has expressed interest in Kermani’s model. “As compared to strictly mathematical and limited methods, the proposed approach provides insightful information for the preliminary design of industrial heat exchanger networks involved in pulp and paper,” says Canadian industrial process expert Marzouk Benali, who is tasked with optimizing that company’s processes. “Its flexibility offers opportunities to assess the direct impacts of integrating emerging biorefinery technologies within existing large facilities.”
Kermani’s model has potential applications in other sectors and industries as well.

These Platforms are designed to help the scientific community to accelerate progress in neuroscience, medicine, and computing.
The Platforms released today consist of prototype hardware, software tools, databases and programming interfaces, which will be refined and expanded in a collaborative approach with users, and integrated within the framework of a European Research Infrastructure. The public release of the Platforms represents the end of the Ramp-Up Phase of the HBP and the beginning of the Operational Phase.
Karlheinz Meier, Co-leader of the Neuromorphic Platform, said, “The HBP invites scientists everywhere to work with our prototype Platforms and give us their feedback. This will help us improve their functionality and ease of use, and hence their value to society”.
The HBP Platforms are designed to help researchers to advance faster and more efficiently, by sharing data and results, and exploiting advanced ICT capabilities. The Platforms should, for example, enable closer collaboration between scientists to create more detailed models and simulations of the brain. A first step in opening up the Platforms to the wider scientific community has already been taken, through the funding of the first HBP Partnering Projects via the EU’s .
The six HBP Platforms are:
•	The Neuroinformatics Platform: registration, search, analysis of neuroscience data.
 •	The Brain Simulation Platform: reconstruction and simulation of the brain.
 •	The High Performance Computing Platform: computing and storage facilities to run complex simulations and analyse large data sets.
 •	The Medical Informatics Platform: searching of real patient data to understand similarities and differences among brain diseases.
 •	The Neuromorphic Computing Platform: access to computer systems that emulate brain microcircuits and apply principles similar to the way the brain learns.
 •	The Neurorobotics Platform: testing of virtual models of the brain by connecting them to simulated robot bodies and environments.
All the Platforms can be accessed via the , a web portal where users can also find guidelines, tutorials and information on training seminars. Please note that users will need to register to access the Platforms and that some of the Platform resources have capacity limits.

A different Corbusier comes into focus; poet, mystic, philosopher and artist.
You recently published a book about Le Corbusier’s work and life after World War II. Why research this period specifically?
For Le Corbusier, the Second World War and its horrors made him completely rethink the notion of the civilisation machiniste that had been central to his buildings constructed in the 20s and 30s. Le Corbusier saw the war as the machine being turned against civilization itself. What better place to start than when he began to redefine himself? We let him lead us away from his antecedent vision of architecture that has tended to defined how we look at him until this very day.
Le Corbusier is the architect with probably the most books already written about him. What are you trying to accomplish with your current research?
How would characterize this new vision?
If we look specifically at the period after World War II until his death in 1965, we see an artist who was constantly searching for new ideas, ready to transform his notion of architecture and subsequently of all modern architecture. When going through these archives, I discovered an architect who was at the same time a poet, a philosopher and a visionary. He is, still today, at the avant guard of architecture.
For example, his research on what is now called “climate adapted architecture,” has only been cursorily explored. Le Corbusier was already designing buildings adapted to local climatic elements in the 40’s and 50’s using a technique he called the “climate grid,” or grille climatique. Sunlight played an essential role in how he conceived architecture, and he was already thinking about how to draw as much light into the living spaces without raising the temperature.
Your research focuses greatly on the notion of Béton Brut, could we finish this interview with a word about that?
Do not forget that Le Corbusier was an artist and an artisan. He saw beauty in the spontaneous creation of concrete being struck from the formworks and wanted these marks and even mistakes to be part of the esthetic qualities of the building. He wanted his concrete to be left raw, not polished nor glossed over. His vision of what brut signified also transformed over his life’s work, from a maniacal control over each element to embracing hazard as a positive force, perhaps as a direct result of time spent in India.
It seems that Le Corbusier was receptive to many cultural influences...
He took inspiration from his travels to India and his readings of the Surrealists while never forgetting his origins as a decorator from La-Chaux-de-Fonds. From these influences he infused his buildings with tapestries of his own design, sculptures embedded directly into the concrete taken from his own drawings, as well as color schemes that were meant to evoke emotional reactions. Modern architecture is still being defined by his vision and we hope this research will bring new perspectives to his vast influence.

163,"<p>A pollen grain suspended in water appears to move about randomly; this is what is known as “Brownian Motion.” The grain is hit on all sides by water molecules, which make it quiver. At the human scale, on the contrary, a swimmer plows forward in the water by continuing to move in the direction of her propulsion; her motion is aided by the eddies that she leaves in her wake. For the first time, physicists have observed and measured the effect of these eddies at the microscopic scale. They have found that the viscosity of the water doesn’t completely inhibit the momentum that the water molecules transfer to the pollen grain. As Einstein suspected back in 1905, his formula describing Brownian motion needs to be adjusted.<p>By observing at very high speeds the shadow cast by a the particle on a detector, researchers in EPFL’s Laboratory of Complex Matter Physics were able to show, and measure, the existence of eddies formed by a particle in motion in a liquid. These tiny vortices dissipate after just five microseconds. “The rate at which the vortex dissipates depends on the size of the particle that creates it and the density and viscosity of the liquid,” explains Sylvia Jeney.</p><p><strong>Optical tweezers</strong></p><p>The challenge was to measure the characteristics of these vortices. To do this, the physicists used what they refer to as “optical tweezers.” Using a laser, they are able to hold very small objects, such as a particle in a liquid, as if the particle was attached to the end of a spring. By measuring the vibration of the particle against the spring, they can demonstrate that the vortex increases the particle’s fluctuations. And, inversely, it is possible to determine certain properties of the particle, such as its size or shape, from the characteristics of the vortex. It’s as if one could deduce the size or shape of a swimmer’s body from the wake she leaves in the water.</p><p><strong>From biology to sensors</strong></p><p>These developments hold promise for making improvements in many areas. “In biology, exchanges between the cell and its surroundings take place in a liquid medium; proteins or viruses that pass through the membrane are one example,” notes Jeney. Elsewhere, micro-sensors used in viscous media currently lack precision. They are used to test interactions in a liquid between a drug and various molecules attached to a microscaffolding. These results could help scientists improve these interactions.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><br/> Resonances arising from hydrodynamic memory in Brownian motion, Thomas Franosch, Matthias Grimm, Maxim Belushkin, Flavio M.

These tiny vortices dissipate after just five microseconds. “The rate at which the vortex dissipates depends on the size of the particle that creates it and the density and viscosity of the liquid,” explains Sylvia Jeney.
Optical tweezers
The challenge was to measure the characteristics of these vortices. To do this, the physicists used what they refer to as “optical tweezers.” Using a laser, they are able to hold very small objects, such as a particle in a liquid, as if the particle was attached to the end of a spring. By measuring the vibration of the particle against the spring, they can demonstrate that the vortex increases the particle’s fluctuations. And, inversely, it is possible to determine certain properties of the particle, such as its size or shape, from the characteristics of the vortex. It’s as if one could deduce the size or shape of a swimmer’s body from the wake she leaves in the water.
From biology to sensors
These developments hold promise for making improvements in many areas. “In biology, exchanges between the cell and its surroundings take place in a liquid medium; proteins or viruses that pass through the membrane are one example,” notes Jeney. Elsewhere, micro-sensors used in viscous media currently lack precision. They are used to test interactions in a liquid between a drug and various molecules attached to a microscaffolding. These results could help scientists improve these interactions.

-	Why was this operation such a huge challenge, from a space engineering point of view? 
In the heat of the operation, Wednesday, someone dared to compare this adventure with the first human moon landing. And I share that opinion. Because this operation is very different from others that have involved a lander. For the missions on Venus or Mars, for example, we were dealing with bodies that had been studied for a long time, and we understood the precise nature of the ground we’d be landing on. In addition, they were much larger targets, with many appropriate landing spots.

Managing to do this successfully, from 500 million miles away, is quite simply incredible!
-	What will Philae allow us to study, and how will it operate? 
The Philae mission is a true success, even if the lander has experienced some anchoring issues and only two of its three feet appear to be stable. We still don’t know what the consequences of this will be on the analysis operations. If all goes as planned, the lander and orbiter will remain for an entire year in this configuration, accompanying a comet for the first time ever in its trip around the Sun. As it approaches the sun, its core will begin to melt, and thus it will release gases that will react with others already in suspension.

07.06.17 - One day, a virtual version of your own heart pumping may help doctors diagnose heart disease and determine the best treatment for you, without the need of surgical intervention or other invasive clinical practices. The goal of the Chair of Modelling and Scientific Computing is precisely this as he builds mathematical tools to simulate heart function with increasing accuracy and that can be personalized to your heart based on medical scans. 
09.06.17 - An EPFL study has for the first time measured the impact of climate change on alpine streams, and the results are quite worrying: after a low-snow winter, these streams release more carbon dioxide than they absorb.","Coral reefs that can survive global warming, an expedition around Antarctica, a booster for genetic research, a personnal virtual heart, a National Center for Data Science... Some of the EPFL's research and milestones that marked the year 2017."
166,"<p>In artificial intelligence (AI), machines carry out specific actions, observe the outcome, adapt their behavior accordingly, observe the new outcome, adapt their behavior once again, and so on, learning from this iterative process. But could this process spin out of control? Possibly. “AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped,” says Rachid Guerraoui, a professor at EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory and co-author of the EPFL study. That means AI engineers must prevent machines from eventually learning how to circumvent human commands. EPFL researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots; they will present their findings on Monday, 4 December, at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in California.

But if, on a rainy day for example, a human operator interrupts the robot as it heads outside to collect a box, the robot will learn that it is better off staying indoors, stacking boxes and earning as many points as possible. “The challenge isn’t to stop the robot, but rather to program it so that the interruption doesn’t change its learning process – and doesn’t induce it to optimize its behavior in such a way as to avoid being stopped,” says Guerraoui.</p><p></p><p><strong>From a single machine to an entire AI network</strong></p><p>In 2016, researchers from Google DeepMind and the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University developed a learning protocol that prevents machines from learning from interruptions and thereby becoming uncontrollable.

In 2016, researchers from Google DeepMind and the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University developed a learning protocol that prevents machines from learning from interruptions and thereby becoming uncontrollable.

If the human in the first car brakes often, the second car will adapt its behavior each time and eventually get confused as to when to brake, possibly staying too close to the first car or driving too slowly.
Giving humans the last word
This complexity is what the EPFL researchers aim to resolve through “safe interruptibility.” Their breakthrough method lets humans interrupt AI learning processes when necessary – while making sure that the interruptions don’t change the way the machines learn. “Simply put, we add ‘forgetting’ mechanisms to the learning algorithms that essentially delete bits of a machine’s memory. It’s kind of like the flash device in

,” says El Mahdi El Mhamdi, another author of the study. In other words, the researchers altered the machines’ learning and reward system so that it’s not affected by interruptions. It’s like if a parent punishes one child, that doesn’t affect the learning processes of the other children in the family.
“We worked on existing algorithms and showed that safe interruptibility can work no matter how complicated the AI system is, the number of robots involved, or the type of interruption. We could use it with the Terminator and still have the same results,” says Maurer.
Today, autonomous machines that use reinforcement learning are not common. “This system works really well when the consequences of making mistakes are minor,” says El Mhamdi. “In full autonomy and without human supervision, it couldn’t be used in the self-driving shuttle buses in Sion, for instance, for safety reasons.

Dozens of tools at hand
This gap exists despite the dozens of tools urban planners have at their disposal for collecting data on how residents use city services: social media, crowdsourcing platforms and mobile apps, to name just a few (see photos galery). Hasler visited Singapore and saw that its city officials use such tools on a daily basis because city residents willingly share their personal data and ideas with local authorities. A few years ago, the city set up a website where residents can view plans for current and future projects and give their opinions. The website encourages dialogue and prevents residents from having to make a trip to the local planning office.
Changing city
So what tools does Geneva have? “Things are changing and I wanted my thesis to make a positive contribution to the city’s development,” says Hasler. She found that Geneva currently uses data only for broader management purposes, such as to reduce traffic congestion or improve energy efficiency. And efforts to solicit residents’ opinions relate primarily to getting feedback on existing projects rather than spawning new ideas.

She also points out a dichotomy unique to Switzerland: “This country has a highly developed sense of democracy as well as advanced technology, but the two are not always combined,” she says.
List of digital platforms
So how can city officials improve things? Hasler’s thesis includes a list of digital platforms that they could use to better listen to and incorporate residents’ ideas. She came up with the list after testing around 50 such platforms worldwide, which she grouped by type of urban project they are meant to address.
Hasler prefers to talk about “responsive cities” rather than “smart cities,” as the former implies putting residents’ needs first. “Urban planners have to serve as coordinators between politicians, experts and residents.

In addition to efforts to more fully involve city residents, Hasler states that Geneva city officials could also work on streamlining their processes and combining the 15 district maps into a single application that all city staff could use. That would help prevent people from working in silos and eliminate discrepancies among the maps.

168,"<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an extremely common herpes-family virus that infects people for life.

Spintronics
Spintronics (spin-transport or spin-based electronics) is a technology that exploits a quantum property of electrons called spin. Although difficult to describe in everyday terms, electron spin can be loosely compared to the rotation of a planet or a spinning top around its axis. Spin exists in either of two directions: “up” or “down”, which can be described respectively as the clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the electron around its axis. Ultimately, spin is what gives electrons their magnetic properties, influencing the way they behave when they enter a magnetic field.
The different directions of electron spin can be used to encode information, much like the binary code used in digital communication. Spintronics can therefore open up a new generation of devices that combine conventional microelectronics with spin-dependent effects, overcoming the limitations of today’s electronics like speed and energy consumption. The main challenge is being able to actually control electron spin, turning “up” or “down” as needed. This can be achieved with certain materials, but the problem is that these are often susceptible to interference from the charge of electrons.
An ideal material for spintronics
The team of Hugo Dil at EPFL, working with scientists from Paris and the PSI, has shown that a transparent insulating material, which normally does not conduct electrical charge, shows spin-dependent properties. The scientists used a method called SARPES, which has been perfected by Hugo Dil’s group. The data showed that the electron gas at the surface of strontium titanate (SrTiO
3
) is spin-polarized, which means that it could be used to control the spin of electrons.
“This is interesting because it is the first evidence of a large spin polarization effect on a truly insulating substrate”, says Hugo Dil. The discovery has significant implications for the future of spintronics, because it can lead to the development of spin-polarized materials that are not susceptible to interference from non spin-polarized electrical charge, allowing for finer and better control of electron spin.
A new particle for a different kind of quantum computer
Beyond spintronics, this insulating material might also be important for quantum computing, as it could be used to directly observe an elusive, strange particle called the Majorana fermion. This particle is unique because it actually is its own antiparticle as well. Sometimes referred to as the “ghost particle”, the Majorana fermion has zero energy, zero moment, zero spin, and, so far, has never been observed unambiguously. In the future, Majorana fermions could become the foundation for a different kind of quantum computer that would, in theory, be exceptionally stable, as it would not be susceptible to external interference and noise.
 This work represents an equal collaboration between Hugo Dil’s group at EPFL (ICMP-SOIS), a group from the Université Paris-Sud (CSNSM & CNRS/IN2P3), and experts at Paul Scherrer Institut (Swiss Light Source). This work was partly funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

170,"<p>The “classical” role for a gene is to produce proteins, which are essential for the functioning of cells. However, our genomes also encode genes that produce long non-coding RNAs, whose functions are more mysterious. Yet, since four or five years ago we know that thousands of these still poorly understood genes are present in the human and mouse genomes. How and in which organs are they activated?

A team led by Professor Henrik Kaessmann at UNIL’s Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) compiled an authentic catalog of long non-coding RNAs in eleven species. By adopting an evolutionary approach, they discovered that about 2500 long non-coding RNAs first appeared at least 90 million years ago in the common ancestor of most placental mammals.

First author of the 
Nature
 article, Anamaria Necsulea, scientist at the Laboratory of developmental genomics of EPFL, expanded the scope of the investigation on these long non-coding RNAs to six primate species (man, macaque, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan), and to mouse, opossum (a marsupial mammal), platypus (a monotreme mammal that lays eggs and nurses its young with milk), as well as to an ""external group"" composed by a bird (chicken) and an amphibian (frog). The common ancestor of all these species goes back over 350 million years.
Genes maintained during evolution
The biologists used the CIG genomics platform and the Vital-IT computing center at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to identify long non-coding RNAs in several major organs of the 11 species under scrutiny. ""Thanks to bioinformatics, we discovered RNA sequences produced from genome locations where no genes had been previously mapped,"" she said. ""We then analyzed these genes to find out whether or not they encoded proteins. Thus, we could identify between 3000 and 15000 long non-coding RNA genes, depending on the species.""
In the second phase of the research, a comparison among the different species allowed the scientists to pinpoint the emergence of these genes in the evolutionary history. While 11,000 long non-coding RNAs are shared by all primates, 2,500 go back to an ancestor common to man and mouse, about 90 million years ago. Only a hundred genes of this kind stem from an ancestor common to all eleven species considered, including birds and amphibians.

This suggests that, among the 2500 long non-coding RNAs conserved during the evolution of placental mammals, a large percentage may function specifically in embryonic development.""
New network of interactions
The third phase of the research allowed the scientists to highlight a network of interactions (specifically, co-expression interactions, that is: genes are activated in the same organs or cell types) involving both long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. For instance, they found that some non-coding genes are strongly associated to protein coding genes involved in brain function or in spermatogenesis, which suggests similar functions for these long non-coding RNA genes.
 In the case of the H19X gene - one of the most ancient long noncoding RNA genes identified in this study - its association to the placental mammals’ H19 gene (which was the first long non-coding RNA identified years ago) helped to uncover its functioning: ""The H19 prevents the placenta from excessively growing inside the mother's womb,"" said Anamaria Necsulea.

Extracting music style with probabilities
EPFL’s deep artificial composer avoids traditional music theory altogether. Each style of music has its own set of rules, and existing AI generated music often uses the Western musical language of harmony and counterpoint. In fact, the EPFL algorithm determines its own composition rules by extracting probability distributions from existing melodies using neural networks, requiring only the computation power of graphic cards that can speed up calculations by a factor of ten compared to standard computers.
The DAC extracts the style of the music by learning how a given piece of music transitions from one note to the next, and calculates the probability of the next note’s pitch and duration. The algorithm then trains on multiple scores of music, of any given style, in order to improve its ability to correctly predict the pitch and duration of the upcoming note.

The DAC can also determine itself if the composition is original enough by comparing phrases of notes with existing patterns in its database of melodies. Similarly, the algorithm can determine the musical genre – Irish or Klezmer folk in this case – of the generated scores.
The generated music is not limited to Irish or Klezmer traditional folk music: any style of music could be used. It just so happens that many Irish and Klezmer melodies are already digitized and easily accessible.
Insight into the human brain
The computing power behind the artificial intelligence is an artificial neural network, known as “long short-term memory” and invented twenty years ago at the IDSIA in Lugano. It has already proven useful for speech recognition and is widely used by the largest software companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.
“The success of the deep artificial composer provides insight into how the human brain works,” says Gerstner. “Neural networks with memory spanning different time scales are needed to successfully create music, implying that the ability of the human brain to retain information, even after a long period of time, is key to composing music.”
For Colombo and Gerstner, the work is preliminary since the DAC is limited to single voice compositions. In the long-run, Colombo hopes to generate a score for an entire orchestra.","A deep-learning algorithm developed by EPFL scientists can generate melodies that imitate a given style of music.

The peculiarity of these liquids is that they contain only ions and no neutral solvent molecule. Evaporation of the liquid and its degradation are, thus, prevented.
In the belief that viscosity was limiting the capacity of the medium to let current flow through it, the scientists studied its conduction properties between its solid state, cooled to –93°C, and its liquid state, at room temperature. They were very surprised to discover that more than twenty degrees below the melting point, the conduction was almost identical to that of the liquid. This observation, contrasting with the existing model of mobile electrical charges, demanded further research.
The phenomenon was therefore studied in more details by applying terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.

This achievement was made possible thanks to ultra-short laser pulses that generate THz radiation, which lies between the infrared and the microwave frequency range. This radiation has the property of interacting with mobile electrical charges and low-frequency vibrations of the matter.
It was thus possible to observe in an ionic liquid, containing iodide and triiodide ions, a bond-exchange phenomenon. In this scenario, an iodide ion (I-) binds to a neighboring triiodide (I3-) ion, while at the other end of the chain a bond is broken and a new I- ion is liberated.

The scientists studied the bacterium 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
, an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in soil. It is one of the most medically concerning bacteria: a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and of serious infections in cystic fibrosis, traumatic burns, and immunocompromised patients, it is now ranked #1 in the World Health Organization’s antibiotic resistant watch-list.
But do single bacteria orchestrate type IV pili motion to power their motility? “In our studies of type IV pili and mechano-activation of virulence in 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
, one technical paradox has been a source of frustration: pili, but also fimbriae, flagella, and injection systems permanently extend outside single cells, so why can’t we directly visualize them?” asks Talà.
To overcome this, the scientists explored an emerging microscopy method pioneered by their collaborator Philipp Kukura at Oxford University. Using a technique called interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), they were able to see these nanometers-wide filaments in live cells, without any chemical labels, at high speed, and in three dimensions.
“iSCAT represents a major technological advance in microbiology,” says Persat. “We  the visualization technique and received extensive positive feedback among scientists across a variety of disciplines simply because we could finally dynamically observe pili in live bacteria straight out of culture.”
To understand the coordination of type IV pili movements, the scientists focused on precisely timing the succession of surface attachment, retraction, and cell body displacements using iSCAT. The approach revealed three key events that lead to successful and energetically efficient movement across surfaces.
First, contact of the pilus tip with the surface activates a molecular motor that initiates retraction. Second, this retraction enhances the attachment of the pilus to the surface, increasing the bacterium’s displacement. Finally, a second, stronger molecular motor enforces the bacterium’s displacement under high friction.
This sequence shows that pili act as sensors, and reveals a new mechanism by which bacteria interact with surfaces. It also reveals that bacteria use sensory mechanisms to coordinate the dynamic motion of their motility machineries, in a striking analogy to the way higher organisms, including humans, move their limbs to generate displacement.
“The human central nervous system processes mechanosensory signals to sequentially engage motor components, thus triggering muscle contraction and resulting in gait,” explains Talà. “Our work shows that in the same manner, bacteria use a sense of touch to sequentially engage molecular motors, generating cycles of pili extension and retraction that result in a walk pattern.”

A personalized virtual heart for preventing cardiovascular disease
The human heart is an extraordinarily complex organ that pumps an estimated 180 million liters of blood, which would fill more than seven Olympic-sized swimming pools in one’s lifetime, thereby ensuring that oxygenated blood reaches the entire body. Cardiovascular problems may lead to malfunction, disease, or death. Heart disease causes 40% of deaths in the EU and costs an estimated 196 billion a year, yet 80% of acquired heart diseases and stroke episodes are preventable.
Quarteroni aims to help prevent or treat cardiovascular disease by providing a personalized virtual heart to patients, essentially a detailed mathematical description of a patient’s heart and how it functions – or malfunctions.
Every person’s heart is unique. Correctly modeling the intricacies of each individual heart therefore requires a customizable mathematical description of both its geometry and its dynamics. But doing so in a mathematically sound way is no easy task; it requires large amounts of patient-specific data and computational power to solve complex equations. Thanks to increasingly powerful computers, building a realistic virtual heart is becoming a reality.
How to build a virtual aortic valve
In constructing a virtual heart that is complete and functional, the aortic valve cannot be neglected. Quarteroni and his team recently added to their heart model the way blood flows from inside the heart into the aorta, taking into account the complex shapes and properties of the aorta’s physiological membranes: the valve leaflets.
“A mathematical description of the aortic valve and its interaction with blood flow exists in the literature, but not at this level of detail for a specific patient,” says Quarteroni.
From MRI scans of a patient, they reconstructed the shape of the aorta, which they represented using a 3D computational mesh. Using mathematical tools to characterize the mechanics of the valve, they described the movement of three triangular-shaped leaflets that make up the aortic valve. To determine how blood flows inside of the atria, the heart’s cavities, they next approximated and numerically solved the mathematical equations (Navier-Stokes) that describe viscous fluid dynamics, adapting them for a patient-specific geometry. Even with this preliminary work, it is a relatively easy task to personalize the model to another patient by using a new set of MRI scans.
As the director of iHeart, an EU-funded project, Quarteroni’s long-term vision is to build patient-specific virtual models of the entire cardiovascular system, including the heart, all of the body’s blood vessels, and of the approximately five liters of blood flowing through the body. 
“If successful, 
iHeart 
will help clinicians to tackle important questions efficiently, both in diagnostics and treatment, with a tremendous impact for society,” says Quarteroni. “It will provide a unique, unprecedented research environment for exploring the heart with an immensely powerful and non–invasive mathematical microscope, making it possible to simulate cardiovascular disease, like carotid stenosis and aneuryisms that can affect the heart, the abdomen, the brain and other parts the body.”
Quarteroni believes that a personalized virtual heart model may become clinically available in less than a decade. Earlier prototypes of the virtual model may be developed and tested sooner, possibly within a five-year horizon. This will require significant investment in the development of robust mathematical and numerical tools to simulate heart function that is tailored to a specific patient.",EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni and his team are building a virtual heart model based on personalized medical images that may one day help cardiologists and cardiac surgeons non-invasively diagnose pathological heart conditions.

All of these objects serve a practical function at the heart of the living room. The EPFL+ECAL Lab invited four leading design schools from around the world to work together on this device that is iconic to the extent that television has become the window of preferred access to digital content.
So far, the evolution of remote controls has focused above all on performance, with ever increasing features. However, as recent studies in the humanities have shown, physical ergonomics and the simplification of interfaces alone do not develop exciting and compelling solutions. It is necessary to take into account what this object represents, the value it carries, the references it invokes, the sensations it produces.
With 63 projects, 29 of which were selected for the exhibition, Lazy Bytes opens the field for reflection with its amazing ideas, such as 
Rolling Control
, which is based on an old game, or 
Zap
, the book with conductive ink that combines handwriting and digital control. Also presented here are concrete projects capable of changing our lives in the near future, for instance the small 
Free Hand
 that adheres to glass or a can to turn it into a remote control. Functional versions of many of these projects are now being tested.
These objects are not intended to replace the previous generation of multi-function remote controls. They seek to propose an alternative, to create new experiences, and to create new relationships between the user and the devices that surround him.
Through support from the Leenaards Foundation and the Loterie Romande, Lazy Bytes combines an academic approach with prospects for practical innovation with the involvement of the Kudelski Group and its expertise in the field of digital television. It is part of a larger program that explores our relationship with the digital world, whose importance in our personal and social lives is constantly growing.
After Lausanne, the Lazy Bytes exhibition begins its international tour in 2013, notably in Paris, London, and New York.","Sixty years after its creation under the name “Lazy Bones”, the remote control is poised to change our relationship with digital content.

A major advance for pharmaceutical research 
Without the need to introduce dyes or electrodes, DHM can be applied to High Content Screening—the screening of thousands of new pharmacological molecules. This advance has important ramifications for the discovery of new drugs that combat or prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, since new molecules can be tested more quickly and in greater numbers.
“Due to the technique’s precision, speed, and lack of invasiveness, it is possible to track minute changes in neuron properties in relation to an applied test drug and allow for a better understanding of what is happening,” Magistretti says. “What normally would take 12 hours in the lab can now be done in 15 to 30 minutes, greatly decreasing the time it takes for researchers to know if a drug is effective or not.”

But often the results obtained

 do not resemble what actually happens in the animal or human body. Thus, the researchers reconsidered the basis of the

In an article published in the journal 
Small
, EPFL researchers explain how such issues can be avoided by replacing conventional static 
in vitro
 tests with dynamic tests that approximate complex living conditions – comparable to those that occur in the body’s blood and lymphatic systems.
The researchers were able to “replicate” the varying real-body conditions in a lab, and test the behaviour of nanoparticles in different blood and lymph flows. They also reproduced the “cleaning” effect of nanoparticles, which go through in lymph nodes, by “washing” lymph off them and reinjecting them into the blood serum.
“Current incubation conditions are static,” says Marijana Mionić Ebersold, a former post-doc at EPFL, leading author of the study in the framework of a Nano-Tera project and currently working as a scientific collaborator at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV). “Nanoparticles or drugs to be tested are carefully added to the typically static fluids and cells, and then there is a waiting period in static conditions before the interaction and the effects can be studied for instance under the microscope”, she adds. “In the human body, fluids and cells never stay nicely static. It’s an extremely dynamic and complex environment. The conventional static 
in vitro
 methods do not therefore allow for the translation of results from 
in vitro

in vivo

Reproducing the conditions in blood and lymphatic systems
 For their study, the researchers used the protein corona as the parameter which reflects this 
in 
vitro
/
in vivo
 discrepancy. The protein corona forms around nanoparticles when they come into contact with a biological environment. Its presence influences the behaviour of nanoparticles in the body by altering their chemical properties, destination, and their interactions with other cells.
The protein corona is affected by both the flow and type of fluid, i.e. blood or lymph, as the study shows. “Surprisingly, the influence of lymph on the protein corona and the fate of nanoparticles has so far been completely neglected – although subcutaneously injected nanomedicines immediately contact the patient’s lymph”, says Mionić Ebersold.
The study revealed that a change in both the flow and fluids is an extremely important factor when it comes to the formation of the protein corona. For example, the flow conditions would change and the protein corona would be different in a patient with different blood pressure troubles as compared to a healthy person. Nanoparticles may thus behave quite differently and in various patients and have different effects on them.
Dynamic tests would therefore be extremely useful for observing the formation of the protein corona in various 
in vitro
 environments in order to predict how the nanoparticles will ultimately behave 
in vivo
. “When 
in vivo
 results are different to 
in vitro 
results, scientists tend to say that they tested their nanomedicine in the wrong animal model or that the chemicals weren’t exactly the same etc.,” says Mionić Ebersold. “We think that the problem begins much earlier, with the 
in vitro 
tests that are performed at the starting point of translational nanomedicine: their static design is what often accounts for the discrepancies with the later 
in vivo 
tests.”

, an EPFL research team led by Tobias J. Kippenberg has now demonstrated integrated soliton microcombs with repetition rates as low as 10 GHz. This was achieved by significantly lowering the optical losses of integrated photonic waveguides based on silicon nitride, a material already used in CMOS micro-electronic circuits, and which has also been used in the last decade to build photonic integrated circuits that guide laser light on-chip.
The scientists were able to manufacture silicon nitride waveguides with the lowest loss in any photonic integrated circuit. Using this technology, the generated coherent soliton pulses have repetition rates in both the microwave K- (~20 GHz, used in 5G) and X-band (~10 GHz, used in radars).
The resulting microwave signals feature phase noise properties on par with or even lower than commercial electronic microwave synthesizers. The demonstration of integrated soliton microcombs at microwave repetition rates bridges the fields of integrated photonics, nonlinear optics and microwave photonics.
The EPFL team achieved a level of optical losses low enough to allow light to propagate nearly 1 meter in a waveguide that is only 1 micrometer in diameter –100 times smaller than that a human hair. This loss level is still more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value in optical fibers, but represents the lowest loss in any tightly confining waveguide for integrated nonlinear photonics to date.
Such low loss is the result of a new manufacturing process developed by EPFL scientists – the “silicon nitride photonic Damascene process”. “This process, when carried out using deep-ultraviolet stepper lithography, gives truly spectacular performance in terms of low loss, which is not attainable using conventional nanofabrication techniques,” says Junqiu Liu, the paper’s first author who also lead the fabrication of silicon nitride nanophotonic chips at EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi). “These microcombs, and their microwave signals, could be critical elements for building fully integrated low-noise microwave oscillators for future architectures of radars and information networks.”

Interview of president of the Open Science Strategic Committee, Katrin Beyer.<br/></p>","When the World Wide Web was invented at CERN 30 years ago, no one talked about open science. But the internet has become one of the pillars of open science, providing researchers with a way of sharing information with colleagues around the world.
In January 2017, soon after taking office, EPFL President Martin Vetterli launched the  in order to raise awareness about this important topic. One key element was the creation of the Open Science Strategic Committee (OSSC), whose members provide EPFL’s Senior Management with input on how to best promote open science. We met with Professor Katrin Beyer, who chairs the OSSC, to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by open science at EPFL and beyond.
How open is science today?
Science is definitely more open now than it was five or ten years ago, and almost certainly less than it will be five or ten years from now. It is increasingly common to share research outputs beyond the traditional manuscript - such as code and data - and this practice will soon be ubiquitous. One thing we notice when discussing the topic of open science among colleagues is that significant differences exist between disciplines. This does not necessarily mean that some are more open than others – they’re simply open in different ways.
In some fields it is standard to share preprints; in others open data has a long tradition. Open data seems to be particularly well-established in places where researchers use a large shared infrastructure, such as CERN. These communities have worked for a long time on establishing data-format and documentation standards. It seems much harder to create such standards when everybody has their own laboratory and, often, their own experimental set-up.
Open science initiatives touch on several key aspects of the research process – publications, research evaluation, career promotion, funding allocation and so on. Does that mean the whole process is flawed?
The process is certainly flawed when it comes to access to scientific literature. Some big legacy publishers now control the majority of the journals in most fields and have profit margins of 30–40%, effectively channeling public money into the pockets of private investors. Many universities simply cannot afford to pay the subscription fees. And while illegal services such as Sci-Hub bring more equality to researchers around the globe, relying on pirated access to knowledge is not a sustainable strategy. We need to do better.
That said, open access as it is implemented today does not necessarily solve the economic or equality issue. If it becomes expensive to publish, everyone will be able to read the literature, but only a few will be able to publish it. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.
In terms of career promotion and evaluating candidates for funding, in theory, the framework is already in place. Many universities, including EPFL, have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which states that researchers should be judged not just on how many articles write and the prestige of the journals in which they publish, but on all types of research output, and that quality should come before quantity. However, in practice, hiring committees evaluating large numbers of applications within a short period of time can find it difficult to implement DORA, because assessing the quality of a variety of research outputs is more time consuming than looking at numbers and journal titles. This remains a challenge.
How will open science affect the research community?
One major objective of open science is to increase the reproducibility and reusability of published work, and I think this will accelerate science in general and increase its impact. Open science also implies a more inclusive research environment. Being part of an established network of researchers is not necessary anymore to get access to data or code – any researcher anywhere in the world can build on these research outputs.
Young researchers may benefit the most from open science. They also have a key responsibility: they contribute a significant part of the research and need to make sure it’s produced and documented so that others can easily build on it. Research institutions need to support them in this endeavor and ensure they have all the methodological tools they need.
What is EPFL’s strategy?
The OSSC wants to promote a bottom-up approach to open science. Researchers know best where their disciplines are going, how to innovate in the way their community shares information, and what will have a real impact in making their field more open. But it is EPFL’s responsibility to listen to its researchers and develop the services and infrastructure that will make a clear difference in supporting those striving to implement open science in their daily routine.
It is important for EPFL to provide training opportunities at the same time. The summer school session called “Open Science in Practice,” which took place in September, gave PhD students a look at projects and tools that other early career researchers have used in their research practice.

We recommend expanding this catalogue even further.
Is EPFL a pioneer in open science?
I think EPFL is ahead of the curve, since it works hard to explore the most promising avenues and tries to be innovative in its support for open science on campus. Martin Vetterli is very outspoken about it. And to be fair, many EPFL researchers started working openly well before the OSSC was set up.

The planet’s largest reef, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, is currently experiencing enormous coral bleaching for the second year in a row, while last year left only a third of its 2300-km ecosystem unbleached. The demise of coral reefs heralds the loss of some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems.

Now, scientists have shown that corals in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Northern Red Sea are particularly resistant to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The results are published today in the journal 
Royal Society
Open Science.
The implications are important, as the Gulf of Aqaba is a unique coral refuge. The corals may provide the key to understanding the biological mechanism that leads to thermal resistance, or the weakness that underlies massive bleaching. There is also the hope that the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs could be used to re-seed deteriorated reefs in the Red Sea and perhaps even around the world.
Scientists at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (Université de Lausanne) in Switzerland, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period. They found that the corals did not bleach.
 “[Under these conditions,] most corals around the world would probably bleach and have a high degree of mortality,” says EPFL scientist Thomas Krueger. “Most of the variables that we measured actually improved, suggesting that these corals are living under suboptimal temperatures right now and might be better prepared for future ocean warming.”

At the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, the scientists exposed corals of the species 
Stylophora pistillata
, collected from the Gulf of Aqaba, to water temperatures and acidification. The conditions resemble the summer conditions of a future ocean in this region if local ocean warming continues at its current rate of approximately 0.4-0.5°C per decade. They performed an overall health check of all the major physiological functions of the corals, measuring variables like energy metabolism, the ability to build a skeleton, and nutrient exchange at the molecular level between the coral-host and their algae symbionts. These physiological variables were mostly unaffected by the harsh experimental treatment. Still, further work on ecologically relevant variables like fertility or competitive performance is needed.
Symbiotic corals live together with an algae partner, much in the same way humans are in symbiosis with gut bacteria. Just as bacteria in the gut aid with digestion, providing valuable nutrients to the rest of the body, the algae that live within the coral-partner provide nutrients to the corals. The bacteria in our body thrive within our digestive tract, just as the algae benefit from living within the coral partner. Bleaching occurs when the colored algae are ejected by their coral-partner, and the symbiosis breaks down. If the algae do not return, the coral dies.

Pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance
The coral species 
Stylophora pistillata 
occurs in other regions of the world, and beyond the Gulf of Aqaba, does not necessarily demonstrate thermal resistance. The biological mechanism that underlies the robustness of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs is still unknown, but the scientists have an idea of how the species evolved to become thermally resistant.
“Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba are pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance due to the special geography and recent history of the Red Sea,” says scientist Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences.
At the end of the last ice age, corals started recolonizing the whole of the Red Sea through the southern connection to the Indian Ocean. The thermal bottleneck at the southern entrance with summer water temperatures rising to 30-32°C provided a selective barrier, allowing only highly resistant individuals to move north. Ironically, this heat-resistant founding population encountered much cooler waters once reaching the northern end, where the Gulf of Aqaba is located.
Based on this, the study hypothesized that these corals might be able to better cope with today’s ocean warming, considering that they not only descended from a heat-selected founding population, but they also started their warming trajectory from a lower temperature, compared to their counterparts in the central and southern Red Sea.
Protection of the Gulf of Aqaba Reef
Despite being resistant to global warming, the corals from the Gulf of Aqaba are still vulnerable to other stresses like pollution.
“Local disturbances, such as local oil pollution, nutrients from fish farms, herbicides from gardening, may reduce the exceptionally high tolerance of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs,” says Fine.
“This reef should receive international recognition as a natural site of great importance, because it might very well be one of the last reefs standing at the end of this century,” says Anders Meibom of EPFL. “I would like to encourage the countries around the Gulf of Aqaba – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel – to get together and create a strong protection environmental program, because even if these corals are resistant to rising water temperatures, they are still sensitive to local pollution, overfishing etc, and they need to be protected from this now.”

A better understanding of the electrical activity of neurons could provide insight into a number of processes taking place in our brains.

Complementary to Scala, Akka is a middleware designed for the distribution of tasks in large computing centers.
In parallel, Typesafe is putting in place a technical support service for its clients. “From around 15 employees today, our team will increase to 25 by the end of the year”, continues Martin Odersky. Most of the employees are developers, working in the EPFL Science Park, Cambridge, Boston – where the company is headquarted – and Uppsala. In just over a couple of weeks, Typesafe will be in the limelight during the second annual « Scala days » event – a meeting of programmers – whose initial occurrence last year at EPFL attracted many specialists.
Typesafe should thus give a real boost to the Scala language. With a smile on his lips, Martin Odersky expresses his confidence that the “really big players” in this domain will soon be joining in. But as for their names, we’ll just have to be patient . . .","Thanks to the raising of three million dollars, Martin Odersky has just created the company Typesafe. This investment will enable the Scala programming language – a promising alternative to Java – to increase its use on the Internet."

One hair, a million measurements
Thanks to the work done by EPFL’s Group for Fibre Optics (GFO), it will now be possible to maintain an extremely fine resolution even when the fiber gets longer. “We have no trouble getting a million measurement points from one optical fiber the width of a hair, for a resolution of one centimeter over 10 kilometers,” said Luc Thévenaz, the director of GFO.

Measurements made with this type of instrument have to be processed, because they include ‘parasites’. But the ratio between useful signals and noise cannot go below a certain threshold, otherwise the measurements will not be reliable.
Graphic arts to the rescue
The EPFL researchers were able to boost this ratio significantly by borrowing a technology from an entirely different field: graphic arts. “The values collected from these measurement points on the fiber can be represented as a matrix of pixels – a two-dimensional image,” said Dr. Thévenaz. ""By applying standard graphic filters to this image, like those found in Photoshop, we were able to reduce the noise inherent in this measurement technique very effectively and identify the desired values more precisely.”
Pursuing this logic further, his teams also transformed more complex measurements, which take into account several parameters simultaneously, into video sequences. Here again, the magic of ‘standard’ video filters was at work.
In Dr. Thévenaz’s view, these advances, which are described in articles appearing in

Despite its importance, finger millet has been given very little scientific attention until now.
Large and complex genome due to fusion of two plant species
Finger millet arose through the hybridization of two different plant species. The plant is therefore polyploid, which means it has a four-fold set of chromosomes and almost twice as many genes as its original species. The size and complexity of the genome are thought to have conferred the broad environmental tolerance of finger millet, while making genome research extremely difficult. For the first time, an international team of researchers from the University of Zurich has now managed to decode the complex genome of finger millet in great detail. It comprises about 2.6 million base pairs and has more than 62,300 genes – about twice as many as rice, for example.
New strategy for genome sequencing and mapping
A good 57,900 finger millet genes – over 90 percent – occur in more than two copies. As their DNA sequences are very similar, it was difficult to correctly allocate the numerous, decoded DNA sections within the entire genome. In cooperation with Ralph Schlapbach and Sirisha Aluri from the Functional Genomics Center at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, the team headed up by Kentaro Shimizu, professor at the UZH Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, has managed to overcome these difficulties. For this purpose, the scientists combined a sophisticated bioinformatics strategy developed by Masaomi Hatakeyama that uses state-of-the-art sequencing methods with a new technology that can optically map the long, individual DNA molecules in the genome. “Our newly developed strategy will help sequence the genome of other polyploid cultivated plants that have not been able to be determined until now,” Shimizu says.
Improving the supply of nutrients and drought resistance
An interdisciplinary team of researchers from Zurich and Bangalore, India, worked together on this project. The work was supported by Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (ISCB), a bilateral research and development program financed by the Swiss and Indian governments, as well as by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The objective is to improve food security and to develop the capacity of biotechnological research in India. “The newly available genome data of finger millet opens up numerous possibilities for modern plant breeding,” Shimizu emphasizes. “On the one hand, to help people with mineral deficiencies in India and in industrialized countries and, on the other hand, to make important crop plants more resistant to drought and aridness.”

By actively cooling the mechanical motion close to the lowest energy allowed by quantum mechanics, the micro-drum can be turned into a quantum reservoir – an environment that can shape the states of the microwaves. The findings are published as an <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys4121"">advanced publication</a> in <em>Nature Physics</em>.</p><p>László Dániel Tóth, Nathan Bernier, and Dr Alexey Feofanov led the research effort in <a href=""http://k-lab.epfl.ch/"">Tobias Kippenberg’s Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements at EPFL</a>, with support from Dr Andreas Nunnenkamp, a theorist at the University of Cambridge, UK.</p><p>Microwaves are electromagnetic waves, just like visible light, but with a frequency that is four orders of magnitude smaller. Microwaves form the backbone of several everyday technologies, from microwave ovens and cellular phones to satellite communication, and have recently gained further importance in manipulating quantum information in superconducting circuits — one of the most promising candidates to realize future quantum computers.</p><p>The micro-drum, only 30 microns in diameter, 100 nanometers thick and fabricated in the Center of MicroNanotechnology (CMi) at EPFL, constitutes the top plate of a capacitor in a superconducting microwave resonator. The drum’s position modulates the resonator’s resonance frequency and, conversely, a voltage across the capacitor exerts a force on the micro-drum. Through this bidirectional interaction, energy can be exchanged between mechanical vibrations and the microwave oscillations in the superconducting circuit.</p><p>In the experiment, the micro-drum is first cooled close to its lowest energy quantum level by a suitably tuned microwave tone. Every microwave photon (a quantum of light) carries away the energy of a phonon (a quantum of mechanical motion) such that the mechanical energy is reduced. This cooling process increases the dissipation and turns the micro-drum into a dissipative reservoir for the microwave resonator.</p><p>By tuning the interactions between the cavity and the cooled micro-drum, which is now an environment for the microwaves, the cavity can be turned into a microwave amplifier. The most interesting aspect of this amplification process is the added noise, that is, how much random, unwanted fluctuations are added to the amplified signal.</p><p>Albeit counter-intuitive, quantum mechanics dictates that this added noise cannot be suppressed completely, even in principle. The amplifier realized in the EPFL experiment operates very close to this limit, therefore it is as “quiet” as it can be. Interestingly, in a different regime, the micro-drum turns the microwave resonator into a maser (or microwave laser).</p><p>“There has been a lot of research focus on bringing mechanical oscillators into the quantum regime in the past few years.” says Dr. Alexey Feofanov, postdoctoral researcher on the project. “However, our experiment is one of the first which actually shows and harnesses their capabilities for future quantum technologies.”</p><p>Looking ahead, this experiment enables novel phenomena in cavity optomechanical systems like noiseless microwave routing or microwave entanglement.

In a recent experiment at EPFL, a microwave resonator, a circuit that supports electric signals oscillating at a resonance frequency, is coupled to the vibrations of a metallic micro-drum. By actively cooling the mechanical motion close to the lowest energy allowed by quantum mechanics, the micro-drum can be turned into a quantum reservoir – an environment that can shape the states of the microwaves. The findings are published as an  in

Microwaves are electromagnetic waves, just like visible light, but with a frequency that is four orders of magnitude smaller. Microwaves form the backbone of several everyday technologies, from microwave ovens and cellular phones to satellite communication, and have recently gained further importance in manipulating quantum information in superconducting circuits — one of the most promising candidates to realize future quantum computers.
The micro-drum, only 30 microns in diameter, 100 nanometers thick and fabricated in the Center of MicroNanotechnology (CMi) at EPFL, constitutes the top plate of a capacitor in a superconducting microwave resonator. The drum’s position modulates the resonator’s resonance frequency and, conversely, a voltage across the capacitor exerts a force on the micro-drum. Through this bidirectional interaction, energy can be exchanged between mechanical vibrations and the microwave oscillations in the superconducting circuit.
In the experiment, the micro-drum is first cooled close to its lowest energy quantum level by a suitably tuned microwave tone. Every microwave photon (a quantum of light) carries away the energy of a phonon (a quantum of mechanical motion) such that the mechanical energy is reduced. This cooling process increases the dissipation and turns the micro-drum into a dissipative reservoir for the microwave resonator.
By tuning the interactions between the cavity and the cooled micro-drum, which is now an environment for the microwaves, the cavity can be turned into a microwave amplifier. The most interesting aspect of this amplification process is the added noise, that is, how much random, unwanted fluctuations are added to the amplified signal.
Albeit counter-intuitive, quantum mechanics dictates that this added noise cannot be suppressed completely, even in principle. The amplifier realized in the EPFL experiment operates very close to this limit, therefore it is as “quiet” as it can be. Interestingly, in a different regime, the micro-drum turns the microwave resonator into a maser (or microwave laser).
“There has been a lot of research focus on bringing mechanical oscillators into the quantum regime in the past few years.” says Dr. Alexey Feofanov, postdoctoral researcher on the project. “However, our experiment is one of the first which actually shows and harnesses their capabilities for future quantum technologies.”
Looking ahead, this experiment enables novel phenomena in cavity optomechanical systems like noiseless microwave routing or microwave entanglement. Generally, it proves that mechanical oscillators can be a useful resource in the rapidly growing field of quantum science and engineering.
Future activities on the emerging research possibilities created by this work will be supported by two recently started EC Horizon 2020 projects:  and , both coordinated at EPFL.

219,"<p>Pharmaceuticals, energy, perfumes, polymers – all are industrially produced via chemical reactions. To carry out reactions, one needs reactors (vessels of different types and sizes ) to mix the various reagents and some catalysts, while controlling the pressure, temperature, and other parameters.<p>Usually, industrial chemical reactions take place in large vessels, producing big quantities of substances.

Remembering the Entreroches canal
 The student from the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) has, in a way, revisited the original concept behind the Entreroches canal. Currently disused, some of its course is still visible in some places between Cossonay and Morges.
 The Entreroches canal was the answer to the old European dream of a waterway linking the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The arrival of the railway combined with the lack of money during the 19th century ended this dream abruptly.
Navigation path
 Departure takes place on the harbor of Grandson, on Lake Neuchâtel. A first tunnel takes you into the Orbe plain which is crossed in the open. Then another tunnel allows you to slide unnoticed under the Mormont hill between Yverdon-les-Bains and Lausanne. In Daillens, the boat gets into a lift and continues its way underground. 6 hours later, you arrive at Lake Geneva in Préverenges.

Many of the characteristics that make people so different from each other, are often the result of small differences in the DNA between individuals. Variation in just a single base in our DNA can cause significant variation in traits like sleep length, weight, height etc. And, unfortunately, they can also become a source of disease.

. Each line in the DGRP has had its genome fully sequenced so that scientists can spot differences between genotypes and then connect these to differences between phenotypes of interest.
Most of the DNA in eukaryotic cells – the cells that make up higher organisms like fruit flies and humans – sits tightly packed inside the cell’s nucleus. But almost all eukaryotic cells also have mitochondria, an organelle often referred to as the “powerhouse of the cell”. Mitochondria are unique in that they have their own DNA with its own distinct set of genes.
Studies have hinted that variation in mitochondrial genes is associated with diseases like obesity, type-2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. The problem is that, unlike “regular” genes in nuclear genomes, we actually know very little about how variation in mitochondrial genes relates to variation in phenotypes.
This is what Roel Bevers and Maria Litovchenko from  at EPFL have addressed in a paper published in 
Nature Metabolism
. The researchers carried out a comprehensive study connecting variation in mitochondrial DNA with various traits in DGRP fruit-fly lines. The findings can be incorporated into future genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to gain more detailed information about how variation in genes – nuclear and mitochondrial, and their interactions – affect various traits and diseases.
“So far, DGRP studies have mostly focused on genetic variants in the nucleus because of low mitochondrial DNA coverage,” says Deplancke. “In this study, we wanted to investigate the impact of mitochondrial DNA variation on traits in these fly lines.”
His team re-sequenced mitochondrial genomes of 169 DGRP fruit-fly lines, which allowed them to identify 231 gene variants. They then looked at “mitochondrial DNA haplotypes”, which are groups of variants which are always inherited together, identifying 12 distinct haplotypes among the studied fly lines.
Interestingly, these haplotypes were found to be associated with a range of metabolic phenotypes and diseases. “We found many links to stress- and metabolism-related traits, including food intake in males,” says Deplancke. To confirm this, the researchers swapped mitochondrial genomes between fruit fly lines, which actually changed the eating behavior of males: the mitochondrial haplotype associated with high food intake could increase food intake in fly lines that initially displayed a low food-intake.
The work can help future studies by providing a higher resolution to connect genes and traits, e.g. feeding behavior. “There is important mitochondrial haplotype-specific metabolic variation in the DGRP,” conclude the authors. “This demonstrates the importance of incorporating such haplotypes in genotype-phenotype relationship studies.”

So pedestrian that you’d think it’s fairly straightforward with no hidden secrets. But in reality, making it requires juggling a slew of parameters that can differ not only from one company to the next, but also from one batch to the next. For instance, clinker, the basic ingredient in concrete, can vary depending on the natural surroundings of the rock it’s produced from. The temperature to which clinker should be heated can also vary, as can the residence time inside a kiln, cooling conditions, and cement-mixture composition.</p><p>Manufacturers tailor the cement they make to the building it’s intended for and the journey it will take to get there. “For example, if it’ll be used for a building in the middle of a large city, it needs to harden slowly so that builders can still work with it despite the time it will take to get it to the construction site,” said Kumar Abhishek, CEO of Nanogence. That means cement is typically enhanced with varying amounts of different additives until the ideal texture is found. The lone additive developed by the spin-off thus constitutes a mini-revolution for the industry. Manufacturers will just need to tweak the proportion to get the right consistency.</p><p>Because the additive is inorganic – that is, carbon-free – it also eliminates the porosity problem that leads to carbonatation and deterioration of the concrete. This problem stems from the carbon links and the moisture that can seep into the tiny cracks between the metallic structures that reinforce the building and the debris in the cement. But Kumar’s inorganic compound can get rid of that problem, thereby making buildings last longer.</p><p>The additive also boosts the hardness of construction materials. That means builders can make thinner walls, thus using less concrete. The ensuing savings are significant, given that concrete accounts for 5–10% of carbon emissions but is still one of the world’s cheapest and most widely-used construction materials.</p><p><strong>The secret: a thesis on concrete’s nanoscopic structure</strong></p><p>So how does this “miracle” additive work? The basic idea behind the new process came from the in-depth knowledge of concrete’s nanoscopic structure that Kumar acquired during his thesis. He then used nanotechnologies to develop chemical substances that can improve concrete’s properties. The recipes of those substances must, of course, remain secret.</p><p>This summer – two patents later – Kumar launched his startup. He’s currently in talks with two major European concrete producers and has kicked off production of a compound specifically for white concrete. This niche market is particularly targeted to high-end interior decoration. But Kumar doesn’t intend to rest on his laurels. He is also developing an additive that can improve concrete’s thermal insulation. “The idea is to eventually develop prefabricated elements that combine longevity with good thermal insulation,” said Kumar, who takes a big-picture view. “Over 40% of energy worldwide is used for construction. Rethinking construction materials will hopefully enable us to reduce this usage.”</p><p><em>Nanogence has won startup awards from the European Venture Program (EVP) and the Academia-Industry Training program sponsored by EPFL, Swissnex, and Venture Lab.

The temperature to which clinker should be heated can also vary, as can the residence time inside a kiln, cooling conditions, and cement-mixture composition.
Manufacturers tailor the cement they make to the building it’s intended for and the journey it will take to get there. “For example, if it’ll be used for a building in the middle of a large city, it needs to harden slowly so that builders can still work with it despite the time it will take to get it to the construction site,” said Kumar Abhishek, CEO of Nanogence. That means cement is typically enhanced with varying amounts of different additives until the ideal texture is found. The lone additive developed by the spin-off thus constitutes a mini-revolution for the industry. Manufacturers will just need to tweak the proportion to get the right consistency.
Because the additive is inorganic – that is, carbon-free – it also eliminates the porosity problem that leads to carbonatation and deterioration of the concrete. This problem stems from the carbon links and the moisture that can seep into the tiny cracks between the metallic structures that reinforce the building and the debris in the cement. But Kumar’s inorganic compound can get rid of that problem, thereby making buildings last longer.
The additive also boosts the hardness of construction materials. That means builders can make thinner walls, thus using less concrete. The ensuing savings are significant, given that concrete accounts for 5–10% of carbon emissions but is still one of the world’s cheapest and most widely-used construction materials.
The secret: a thesis on concrete’s nanoscopic structure
So how does this “miracle” additive work? The basic idea behind the new process came from the in-depth knowledge of concrete’s nanoscopic structure that Kumar acquired during his thesis. He then used nanotechnologies to develop chemical substances that can improve concrete’s properties. The recipes of those substances must, of course, remain secret.
This summer – two patents later – Kumar launched his startup. He’s currently in talks with two major European concrete producers and has kicked off production of a compound specifically for white concrete. This niche market is particularly targeted to high-end interior decoration. But Kumar doesn’t intend to rest on his laurels. He is also developing an additive that can improve concrete’s thermal insulation. “The idea is to eventually develop prefabricated elements that combine longevity with good thermal insulation,” said Kumar, who takes a big-picture view. “Over 40% of energy worldwide is used for construction. Rethinking construction materials will hopefully enable us to reduce this usage.”
Nanogence has won startup awards from the European Venture Program (EVP) and the Academia-Industry Training program sponsored by EPFL, Swissnex, and Venture Lab. It has also received an Innogrant and an Enable grant (an EPFL program to help laboratory researchers get new products quickly to market).","Whether it’s for drying time, hardness, or uniformity, a new additive developed at EPFL can give concrete, mortar, and cement the desired consistency, all in one shot. Made from inorganic compounds, the additive can also extend buildings’ lifetimes. A startup called Nanogence has just been created to develop and market the innovation."

Reality Substitution is on track to replace traditional virtual reality 
Until recently, virtual reality’s widespread use, both commercially and in scientific research, has been hampered by the need to develop custom virtual worlds using labor-intensive 3D animation. Researchers and engineers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and the W Science Initiative are unveiling a Reality Substitution Machine prototype at The Brain Forum that could change all of that. The project, known as RealiSM, has developed an easy-to-use virtual world creator that captures real-world situations to be played back in head-mounted displays (HMD). The system will soon be employed in the lab to study memory and peri-personal space (the space defined by what is within one’s reach) and will have numerous clinical uses for treating phobias and PTSD therapy.
“There is a positive feedback loop between virtual reality and cognitive neuroscience,” says EPFL researcher and project leader Bruno Herbelin. “On one hand, with a Virtual Reality setup we have an environment that can be completely controlled and endlessly repeated—which are ideal experimental conditions. On the other hand, insights from the cognitive sciences are leading to more immersive, extremely realistic experiences for increasingly effective clinical therapies, behavioral experiments and even better gameplay for entertainment.”
The RealiSM project aims to make this technology more accessible to the average clinician and could also bring the technology to developing countries. Other potential uses include immersive, real-time video recording to bring business calls to the next level or even help those working or serving their country abroad feel closer to home.
Real-time demonstrations at The Brain Forum 2015
 An immersion booth, dedicated to the RealiSM project and designed especially for The Brain Forum, will house a real-time demonstration of the teleconferencing ability of the new reality substitution platform until April 1, 2015.

A scientific portrait of the Human Brain Project 
The Human Brain Project will provide new tools to help understand the brain and its fundamental mechanisms and to apply this knowledge in future medicine and computing.
Central to the Human Brain Project is Information and Computing Technology (ICT). The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior.
A novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and to speed up the search for new treatments.
Finally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems.

The patient feels pain originating from the legs, even though nothing else can be felt below the lesion. Now, virtual reality may be the key to providing pain relief for this type of pain, and the solution comes from restoring a sense of touch. In breakthrough research the scientists of the Foundation Bertarelli Chair in Cognitive Neuroprosthetics show that phantom body pain can be reduced in paraplegics by creating a bodily illusion with the help of virtual reality. 
08.11.17 - Researchers at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory have developed a miniature robot that can integrate perfectly into schools of zebrafish. It can swim with fish, learn how they communicate with each other and make them change direction or come together. Their work was carried out as part of an EU research program among six partner institutions
.
15.11.17 - The EPFL Extension School is offering people with no prior university degree the chance to get an EPFL qualification. The EPFL Extension School is particularly well suited to professionals looking to study in an innovative field without having to give up their day job. It offers courses on concrete topics that are directly linked to the job market. The school's first continuing education course, Applied Data Science – Machine Learning, offers students who successfully complete the course a Certificate of Open Studies, a new type of academic qualification for the moment offered only by EPFL.
29.11.17 - Professor Xile Hu, an expert in catalysis, has been awarded the 2017 National Latsis Prize. Hu, who was born in China and came to Switzerland in 2007, founded the Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Catalysis at EPFL. He is known for his innovative approach, which consists of combining the concepts and methods associated with three different types of catalysis (homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic), which traditionally have remained separate. This approach has led to unprecedented understanding of fundamental catalysis and enabled the discovery of new catalysts with properties superior to those of previous materials.
01.12.17 - In artificial intelligence (AI), machines carry out specific actions, observe the outcome, adapt their behavior accordingly, observe the new outcome, adapt their behavior once again, and so on, learning from this iterative process. But could this process spin out of control? Possibly. AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped. EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots. Their work makes a major contribution to the development of autonomous vehicles and drones, for example, so that they will be able to operate safely in numbers.
12.12.17 - Thanks to a donation from the Werner Siemens-Foundation, EPFL will set up a Center for Artificial Muscles, collaborating initially with the University Hospital of Bern (Inselspital) and then with the University Hospital of Zurich. The first project, slated to span the next four years, will focus on developing a less invasive cardiac assistance system for treating heart failure. This prosthetic device – a ring around the aorta – will avoid the complications of hemorrhaging and thrombosis because it will not be in contact with blood. A facial-reconstruction project aimed at restoring patients’ ability to create facial expressions will follow.
19.12.17 - EPFL President Martin Vetterli has unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust. Eight institutional and industrial partners are already willing to join. This new research platform will aim to be a center of excellence for IT security and personal data protection in the digital era. These partner organizations will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution. The organizations will also contribute their own experts to the research being done at EPFL in order to develop solutions to concrete problems.","A dazzling victory at the Solar Decathlon, artificial intelligence generating melodies, virtual reality to reduce phantom pain, a robot-fish spy, 12 million francs for a Center of Artificial Muscles ... Some of the EPFL's research and milestones that marked the year 2017."

Rapid and irrevocable decisions
 Seven criteria of varying importance – practical, but also emotional - were developed to judge the degree to which the families adopted the robots. Put to the test and further refined by this first field study, these criteria will be useful to engineers at EPFL and elsewhere who are thinking about the domestic robots of the future.

235,"<p>Treatments for beating tumours are mainly based on CD8 T lymphocytes, which specialise in detecting and eliminating intracellular infections and in killing cancer cells. A large proportion of patients, however, do not respond to these treatments. This prompted a research team from the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman (SCCL, Switzerland) to bring together the universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL), the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), EPFL and CHUV to investigate CD4 T lymphocytes. While these play a supporting role with CD8 T cells, their ability to eliminate tumour cells directly has been a matter of controversy. Using innovative nanoimaging technologies designed at the EPFL's School of Engineering laboratory, the scientists found that when the CD4 T lymphocytes were directly put in close contact to the cancer cells, up to a third of them could also kill them.
