{"id": 4, "text": "17 hours, 19 minutes – that’s the record set last year by a Ticino-based team for visiting each and every Swiss canton while travelling exclusively by public transport. The Swiss Train Challenge was launched by Swiss broadcast journalist Nicolas Rossé in 2015, who made the journey that year in 19 hours, 46 minutes. But that was before the Gotthard tunnel was open. This Friday, a team of EPFL students including two PhD researchers will aim for the record-breaking time of 16 hours, 54 minutes. And in a first, their itinerary was calculated by an algorithm rather than by hand.\nTo develop the algorithm, the students first had to download the exact locations of Switzerland’s 22,080 train stations and bus stops as well as the geographical borders of each canton and the full train timetable. They then whittled down the number of train stations to the 110 “significant” ones, i.e., with potentially useful train connections. The next step was to download lists of all trains that go through these stations and their schedules, and see what other stations they go to in order to maximize their utility. This final step is what the students set their algorithm to work on – which it did for no less than ten days before coming up with the optimal itinerary.\nThe devil is in the detail\n“The first (positive) surprise we got from the algorithm’s itinerary was the travel time: 16 hours, 54 minutes. That means we can technically beat last year’s record. Not by much, due to the previous teams’ hard work and the redundancies in the Swiss train network, but by enough,” says Emmanuel Clédat, a PhD student at EPFL’s Geodetic Engineering Laboratory. “The second surprise was how prominently Ticino – the canton in the south that borders Italy – features in the itinerary. We thought it would be the end point of our journey or a separate out-and-back side trip of its own. But instead, it’s a stop on the way to the Canton of Graubünden. That shows that Ticino lies along one of the main routes crossing the country.”\nThe team will leave from St. Maurice, in the Canton of Valais, at 5:24am and end their journey at Jakobsbad, in the Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, at 10:18pm. The itinerary takes advantage of Switzerland’s many cantonal enclaves to shorten travel distances as much as possible. However, the route is strewn with obstacles; for instance, at the Alpnachstad train station, in the Half-canton of Obwalden, the students will have zero minutes to change trains. “The previous winners had to make the journey twice to set their record. We might also have to make a few trial runs before we reach our goal,” says Dirk Lauinger, a PhD student at EPFL’s Risk Analytics and Optimization Chair.\nThe pleasure of train travel\nLauinger’s thesis is on optimizing interactions between electric vehicles and power grids, while Clédat – his roommate with whom he decided to take part in the Challenge – is studying computer-assisted vision. So neither one of them is performing research related directly to the Challenge. Rather, they are motivated by their appreciation of train travel, as are the other students who will join them in their attempt to set a new record.\nFollow the challenge live on:\n Contact:", "summary": "A team of EPFL students will take part in the Swiss Train Challenge this Friday.

{"id": 7, "text": "In a project called METERON, the European Space Agency (ESA) is exploring how advanced robots could be used to repair satellites in orbit or probe hostile environments like the Martian and lunar surfaces. The plan is for astronauts to control the robots remotely from the International Space Station (ISS), using a haptic interface that allows them to “feel” their every move.\nFor this project, the ESA has opted for an interface based on the famous delta robot, designed 34 years ago by Reymond Clavel at EPFL’s School of Engineering. The new device, developed by  – a spin-off of EPFL’s , led by Charles Baur – reached the ISS earlier this month.\n Since there are currently no remote-controlled rovers on the Martian or lunar surfaces, the ISS crew is using robots on Earth to practice. An initial test has already taken place, and the results were very good. ISS astronauts used the delta based controller named sigma.7, to pilot a robot at an ESA facility in the Netherlands. The robot was guided over an obstacle course to a sampling site, where it collected a rock. A public demonstration also took place 25 November.\nsigma.7 during testing phase. Photo credit: ESA\nRealistic haptic feedback\nThe concept involves two pieces of machinery, each performing very different roles. The first is a variable-geometry robot packed with technology, including an accelerometer, load cells and other sensors that allow it to interact with its environment. The second is the sigma.7 haptic controller – on board the ISS – that allows for seven degrees of motion. It provides force-feedback as the robot moves around and touches objects, giving astronauts a realistic feel for the environment. “The feedback is so life-like that operators can distinguish between hard, soft, smooth and rugged surfaces,” explains Force Dimension co-founder François Conti. “The robot functions like an avatar. It’s as if the astronaut was actually there on the ground, in person.”\nThe whole thing happens in close to real time. “Earth-moon communications can experience a delay of a few seconds,” says François Conti. “But ESA is working on new technologies that will compensate for this lag time. From a space station orbiting the moon, complex teleoperation becomes possible.” In the future, astronauts will control surface robots from orbit around the moon or Mars or from inside a planetary base.\nThe robot at the ESA facility in the Netherlands\n“Even on the Moon preparing an astronaut for a sortie takes hours just to get into a suit and prepare the airlock,” says Jessica Grenouilleau, Meteron project lead at ESA’s Exploration Systems Group “by giving astronauts the possibility to control the robots nearby in the safety and comfort of their base or orbital spacecraft, much more can be achieved.”\nWithstanding vibrations during launch\n The delta robot’s speed, maneuverability and lightweight design make it the ideal candidate for space missions. But engineers at Force Dimension had to work hard to fine-tune the sigma.7 interface to make it space compatible, and to make sure it could withstand heavy vibrations from the rocket engines. “Despite an extremely tight schedule,” says Conti, “the device passed all qualification tests by the end of summer” The robot was then carefully packed before blasting off from Launch Pad 0 on Wallops Island, in the US state of Virginia. It piggybacked on the Cygnus spacecraft cargo resupply mission to the ISS on board an Antares rocket.\nThe delta robot was originally designed to package chocolates, cookies and medicines, and it was also used in the field of metrology. More recently, in its haptic version, the delta robot has been used for precision surgery and deep-sea exploration. The robot is now on its way to conquering space. “The Force Dimension engineers were able to expand the delta robot’s playground to include outer space,” says Reymond Clavel. “In developing a version that can handle the unique rigors of that environment, they have shown that the deltas still have much to offer. This is a remarkable success.”\nIn 1985, Reymond Clavel, the director of EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory 2 (LSRO2) at the time, developed the first delta robot. Consisting of three arms, it operates along four axes, or degrees of freedom. With its precise, ultra-fast, lightweight design, the robot was an instant hit in the global packaging industry. Numerous versions have been developed since then, with applications ranging from packaging and 3D printing to precision surgery and watchmaking. With Force Dimension, the delta robot is branching out in an entirely new direction: space exploration.", "summary": "The crew of the International Space Station has taken delivery of a haptic interface designed by EPFL spin-off Force Dimension.

{"id": 9, "text": "There’s something romantic about the idea of living on the moon. But a huge number of human and technological challenges will have to be overcome first. These challenges are just what students from 13 universities in nine different European countries have been working on since the start of the academic year. They are members of a pioneering project called IGLUNA that is being run by the EPFL-based Swiss Space Center under the European Space Agency’s ESA_Lab pilot project.\nIn mid-January – halfway through the project – the participants met up at CERN. All 19 teams, including four from EPFL, attended. In addition to providing progress reports, they were able to fine-tune their work thanks to discussions with the other teams. Their goal is to have a seamless fit among the systems they are developing, as they work together towards a common goal: to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a habitat in the ice of the moon’s poles where astronauts could be housed for short- or long-term missions. The results of their year-long collaborative effort will be put on public display in June, in one of the cavities of the ice palace in the Petit Cervin glacier in Zermatt.\n“This initiative is very inspiring,” says Bernard Foing, the IGLUNA project supervisor. “Not only is it teaching people about space-related issues, it is also a platform for developing innovative technologies and solutions while laying the groundwork for a Europe-wide scientific collaboration. And it’s really capturing the imagination of young people.” In addition to his work on IGLUNA, Foing serves as an adviser to the ESA and is a professor at VU University in Amsterdam. \nAll aspects of human life\nCreating a long-term habitat on the moon is fraught with challenges. “That’s why this particular goal was selected,” says Tatiana Benavides, project coordinator at the Swiss Space Center. “If you want to build a livable environment – especially one that’s far from earth – you need to take into account all aspects of human life. This includes producing food, energy and oxygen, building shelter, providing tools and enabling communications.”\nAt EPFL, a PhD student in materials science is exploring the possibility of printing 3D objects – such as an ice saw – within the habitat. A team of environmental engineering students from EPFL and UNIL are putting their heads together to come up with a long-lasting and self-operating greenhouse for growing vegetables. And students from EPFL’s architecture and civil engineering program either have a hand in designing the habitat’s structure – a vault made from carefully assembled blocks – or are part of a virtual reality team whose goal is to create an interactive virtual environment with indoor surroundings.\nTeams at other universities are hard at work on their own tasks. They are developing oxygen and electricity production processes; a mechanism to grow algae; a system to use urine to fertilize plants; exercise facilities; a laboratory; a communications and control system; inflatable living modules; a robot to dig paths into the ice – and more.\n“We have architects, biologists, computer scientists, geologists and engineers from all over Europe: it’s an extraordinarily multidisciplinary and multicultural project,” adds Benavides. “With this initiative, ESA’s goal is to encourage these young people to work together even though they live in different countries and study at different schools.”", "summary": "Students from 13 European universities, including EPFL, have joined forces to design a lunar habitat as part of IGLUNA, a project sponsored by the European Space Agency (ESA) and headed by the Swiss Space Center.

{"id": 14, "text": "By 2017, quantum physics will help reduce the energy consumption of our computers and cellular phones by up to a factor of 100. For research and industry, the power consumption of transistors is a key issue. The next revolution will likely come from tunnel-FET, a technology that takes advantage of a phenomenon referred to as “quantum tunneling.” At the EPFL, but also in the laboratories of IBM Zurich and the CEA-Leti in France, research is well underway. As part of a special issue of Nature devoted to silicon, Adrian Ionescu, an EPFL researcher, has written an article on the topic.\nTransistors that exploit a quantum quirk\n Today's computers have no less than a billion transistors in the CPU alone. These small switches that turn on and off provide the famous binary instructions, the 0s and 1s that let us send emails, watch videos, move the mouse pointer… and much more. The technology used in today’s transistors is called “field effect;” whereby voltage induces an electron channel that activates the transistor. But field effect technology is approaching its limits, particularly in terms of power consumption.\n Tunnel-FET technology is based on a fundamentally different principle. In the transistor, two chambers are separated by an energy barrier. In the first, a horde of electrons awaits while the transistor is deactivated. When voltage is applied, they cross the energy barrier and move into the second chamber, activating the transistor in so doing. \n In the past, the tunnel effect was known to disrupt the operation of transistors. According to quantum theory, some electrons cross the barrier, even if they apparently don't have enough energy to do so. By reducing the width of this barrier, it becomes possible to amplify and take advantage of the quantum effect – the energy needed for the electrons to cross the barrier is drastically reduced, as is power consumption in standby mode. \nMass production is imminent\n “By replacing the principle of the conventional field effect transistor by the tunnel effect, one can reduce the voltage of transistors from 1 volt to 0.2 volts,” explains Ionescu. In practical terms, this decrease in electrical tension will reduce power consumption by up to a factor of 100. The new generation microchips will combine conventional and tunnel-FET technology. “The current prototypes by IBM and the CEA-Leti have been developed in a pre-industrial setting. We can reasonably expect to see mass production by around 2017.”\nAn essential technology for a major European project\n For Ionescu, who heads the Guardian Angels project (a project vetted for a billion Euro grant from the EU), tunnel-FET technology is without a doubt the next big technological leap in the field of microprocessors. “In the Guardian Angels project, one of our objectives is to find solutions to reduce the power consumption of processors. Tunnel-FET is the next revolution that will help us achieve this goal.” The aim: design ultra-miniaturized, zero-power electronic personal assistants. Tunnel-FET technology is one of the first major stages in the project’s roadmap. IBM and the CEA-Leti are also partners in the project.", "summary": "Electronics could be 100 times less energy-hungry thanks to a quantum phenomenon known as the tunnel effect - by 2017 in consumer electronics", "claim": "Electronics could be 100 times less energy-hungry thanks to a quantum phenomenon known as the tunnel effect - by today in consumer electronics", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [21, 21], "noise": false}

As decided by the Conference of Cantonal Directors of the Economy (CDEP) on 20 June 2013, the two Federal Institutes of Technology will be the main hubs in the Swiss network, which will also include some secondary sites to be subsequently selected by the CDEP. The federal parliament will ratify the final organisation of the PNI in 2015.\nThe cantons of Western Switzerland - Vaud, Valais, Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Geneva - have therefore signed a memorandum of understanding with EPFL and drafted a comprehensive concept for implementation of the decentralised Western Switzerland Hub. The concept will be further developed by the end of June 2014 for submission of the complete dossier to the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research. The file is based on a description of locations either existing or to be developed, as well as joint governance and representation structures in which both the cantons and EPFL are represented. Beyond its main campus in Lausanne which already includes an innovation park offering nearly 1,700 jobs, four other satellite sites are being developed in Neuchâtel (Microcity), Sion (Energypolis), Fribourg (BlueFactory) and Geneva (Campus Biotech). The decentralised hub aims to capitalise on the fields of economic and scientific excellence of each site.\nEPFL plays a central role in this scientific and innovation ecosystem relying on four universities, Switzerland’s largest university of applied sciences, two university hospitals and renowned research institutes such as CSEM and CERN. This exceptional density of skills is already making a decisive contribution to the influence of Swiss innovation.\nIn order to develop close collaborations between EPFL and the academic and economic actors on the various sites, local governance structures will be established under the leadership of each canton.

{"id": 19, "text": "Although there is fairly good consensus on the architectural quality of historical buildings, the issue of the historical value of modern buildings is much less clear cut. Prefabricated, or “pre-fab,” buildings still have an undeniably negative image; they’re thought of as flimsy, ugly, made from shoddy materials, with minimal acoustic and thermal insulation, and so on. “People who have lived in these buildings have a hard time being objective about them, they overwhelmingly see the downsides,” explain Franz Graf Giulia Marino, architects from EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM). “Our role is to make a scientific assessment of that heritage.”\nThe researchers, specialists in modern architectural heritage, have just wrapped up a three-year study on the issue of restoring recent architecture, in collaboration with the Accademia di architettura de Mendrisio, ETH Zurich and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland. The research will produce a reference work for architects.\nRenovation is an architectural act\n The post-war period ushered in the era of mass production – things needed to be rebuilt, and fast, without worrying about the constructions’ technical shortcomings. Today things are built in a more complex manner – a responsible response to economic and environmental concerns. “Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is less expensive overall to renovate than to tear everything down and start over again,” says Graf.\n The researchers identified the fabrication methods used in European buildings from the 1920s to 1970s. \n There’s no ideal renovation method, says Marino. Every case is unique. “When you apply a one-size-fits-all solution, you destroy heritage.” Schools built in the 1960s are a good example. They were built according to the standards of the time, but are now considered uncomfortable and energy inefficient. Renovating them becomes a true architectural project, one that respects the original work but also meets the requirements of the present day.\nThe concept of “comfort”\n When renovating a contemporary building, many historical aspects and human needs, such as room temperature and lighting, must be taken into account. “What do we do when we restore? What kind of light source do we use? In 50 years we’ve used incandescent bulbs, halogen lights, fluorescent lighting and now LEDs.” One kind of lighting cannot replace another without taking into consideration the quality and intensity of artificial lighting and the space that it must illuminate. \n In terms of temperature, we’ve become accustomed to living in spaces heated to about 22℃. People wouldn’t tolerate reverting to conditions that were considered normal just a few decades ago. \n The concept of modern comfort in our homes can be traced to the improvement in the standard of living that began in the 1920s and 1930s. Central heating progressively replaced coal burning stoves. Electricity brought light into our living spaces. \nFor future generations\n How can we preserve the ambience of an era, while also providing a level of comfort to which we’ve become accustomed today? There are rational methods that can be used to evaluate the quality of a building. The vast apartment complex of Lignon in Geneva, where 6,500 people live, is an example of industrialized architecture. This gigantic complex, the longest in Europe, was built in the 1960s and is a symbol of the baby boom era, the cities that expanded ever outward, the new suburban apartment blocks that sprung up at their edges. There are methods and techniques to adapt these constructions to current energy standards while preserving their overall architectural qualities. \n “In generating knowledge we can help the public understand that there are constructions that will be of interest to future generations,” concludes Graf.", "summary": "Is post-war industrial and pre-fab architecture worth preserving and renovating?

{"id": 21, "text": "Pierre Dessemontet recently published an article in the journal Urban Studies, co-authored with Vincent Kaufmann and Christophe Jemelin, on the dynamics of the metropolis, studied from the point of view of commuter traffic flow. It is clearly the commuters, thru their journeys, who provide the most interesting data concerning towns and cities, and the suburbs. As a result of his research, the geographer describes the changes taking place and so enables us to lay the foundations of solutions in response to tomorrow’s realities.\nFirst of all, what exactly is a metropolis?\nPierre Dessemontet\n – A metropolis is the main town or city in a given geographic region which plans and manages the functioning of the economic and cultural activities of a urban area that it dominates, organizes and regulates. In Switzerland, urban geography has only recently begun to acknowledge the notion of the metropolis, with a center and interconnected suburbs. Our aim is to show the extent of the metropolis and to understand its dynamics. Thus, Geneva cannot think of itself without neighboring France, with which it makes up a single entity. In the same way, Tessin must take into account Milan, as Chiasso is only 60 kilometers away. We noticed that commuters, thru their journeys by train or car, make it possible to establish how towns and suburbs are connected. Commuters from the Nyon-Morges area, who are stuck in traffic jams or have to stand in trains, provide concrete evidence of the problem, and show that these areas are connected and can no longer be considered in isolation.\nSo the role of the urban geographer is to help re-think the metropolis?\nPierre Dessemontet \n– Our work enables us to evaluate the new dimensions of towns, to recognize their new features, and to adapt our point of view to realities which evolve much faster than the opinions we have developed about them. Switzerland is in full growth, and if we don’t manage to adapt to this evolution, we will not be able to take the necessary measures, in particular with regard to transportation. For example, between Geneva and Lausanne, we observe that the road structure is good, but that the surrounding infrastructure is inadequate. The secondary network is not sufficiently developed, as a road-user from the Morges area can testify, sometimes spending as much time in joining the highway as he will on the highway itself. To face up to this and find the appropriate responses, it is vital to realize that Switzerland is becoming more and more urban; that it is no longer an Alpine republic; and nor is it just a large region to be merged. The geographer’s mission is to highlight these developments and to propose suitable solutions.\nYou predict no fewer than 10 million inhabitants in Switzerland in 2050?\nPierre Dessemontet \n– Yes, it is highly likely, as we are already forecasting 9 million inhabitants in 2035. Our message is a growth message: “Look we are increasing in size!” The relations between towns and suburbs are intensifying; therefore let’s not wait. And let’s ensure that we don’t become like California, for example, which didn’t monitor its development and which, behind the image of Silicon Valley and idyllic beaches, hides an appalling transport network. We have noticed that the 1970s crisis has durably cooled the politicians, who are afraid go forward too much into this area. But the signs are there, and growth is a reality. We forecast an increase of 30% in traffic in the Lake Geneva region in 2030.\nIf we sum up the situation in the Lake Geneva region, it’s difficult to see what solutions can be found.\nPierre Dessemontet \n– There is no need to be fatalistic, as long as we take into account population growth and adapt to it. In this respect Zurich is a model, and recognized as the city having the best public transport system in the world. It’s possible to live in one suburb and to work in another without having to use your car. And it’s worth mentioning that the inhabitants of Zurich did not wait to be subsidized by the Confederation to improve their infrastructures. It’s a rich canton which was able to undertake the work first and then ask for the subsidies. This could be quite conceivable in the Lake Geneva area, if Geneva and Lausanne tackled this project jointly. Together, they have more or less the same population as the canton of Zurich. But it is only recently that we have begun to consider the status of Geneva and Lausanne as two bipolar centers.

{"id": 25, "text": "It is well known that oil and water don’t mix. Less well known is the fact that when petroleum is spilt onto a water surface, a fraction of the oil immediately begins to evaporate into the air or dissolve into the seawater. These dissolved toxic hydrocarbons can threaten aquatic species, while evaporated compounds may pose a risk to rescue workers or populations downwind of an accident site. Publishing in the journal \nEnvironmental Science & Technology\n, a team of European and American researchers report on a unique study focused on the fate of hydrocarbons during the 24 hours that follow an oil spill.\nFollowing a spill, oil suddenly finds itself in a radically new environment – exposed to light, air, and the water surface after millions of years underground. “In its new environment, the oil immediately begins to change its composition, and much of that change happens on the first day,” explains Samuel Arey, a researcher at EPFL and Eawag in Switzerland and corresponding author of the study. Oil is a complex mixture of many hydrocarbon compounds. Certain volatile compounds evaporate within hours, contaminating the overlying atmosphere. Others, such as toxic naphthalene, simultaneously dissolve into the seawater, posing a threat to aquatic life.\nEspecially since the\n Exxon Valdez \ncatastrophe in 1990, which released over 40,000 cubic meters of oil into the ocean, researchers have sought to evaluate to what extent marine species in the vicinity of an oil spill are exposed to toxic hydrocarbons. But this question has largely remained debated, because many of the hydrocarbons are dispersed into the water or the overlying air well before scientists arrive at the site.\nIn order to collect data on the immediate aftermath of an oil spill, the researchers collaborated with emergency response specialists of the Dutch \nRijkswaterstaat\n to recreate a four cubic meter oil spill in the North Sea, in a shipping zone already burdened by pollutants, 200 kilometers off the coast of the Netherlands. By studying this relatively small oil release, they were able to gain a better understanding of what goes on in much larger spills, with findings that could be useful to assess the risks to underwater life, as well as to emergency response team workers at the sea surface. \n No two oil spills are alike. Aside from the sheer volume of oil released onto the sea surface, the environmental impact of an oil spill depends on external factors, such as the wind, waves, and the temperature of the air and the water. The North Sea experiment, for instance, was carried out on a summer day with two-meter high waves. Within just over a day, the surface oil slick had almost dissipated. On a cooler day with less wind and smaller waves, the slick would have likely persisted longer.\nThanks to a computer model that was tested against the data collected in the North Sea, the researchers are now able to extrapolate their findings to larger spills and other environmental conditions. Results from the study will provide the researchers with tools to better assess the immediate impact of future disasters on humans and on the environment, as well as to plan the emergency response, even in settings that differ strongly from those encountered in the North Sea.\nThe research was carried out in partnership with the Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research, the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat, the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic institution in Massachusetts, USA.", "summary": "The fate of oil during the first day after an accidental oil spill is still poorly understood, with researchers often arriving on the scene only after several days.

{"id": 27, "text": "As glaciers melt, they form glacial lakes which – despite their peaceful appearance – harbor numerous risks. They can empty suddenly and cause flooding, as the Swiss town of Zermatt recently discovered. One solution being studied is the controlled use of water from glacial lakes; that would enable engineers to drain them quickly in the event of an emergency, such as if a large chunk of glacier fell into a lake.\n“The main idea here is to explore several ideas at once, because the most effective way to improve the safety of people living in areas affected by glacial retreat is to deploy not just one but a combination of systems,” says Anton Schleiss, an honorary professor of civil engineering at EPFL and former head of EPFL’s Platform of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH).\nThe LCH has teamed up with other Swiss institutions like the University of Zurich and the Center for Research on the Alpine Environment (CREALP) on an eight-year research project on glacial retreat in Peru. Called GLACIARES+, the project is funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).\nMeasurement stations \n“We’re working with the University of Zurich and CREALP to set up systems that will use two glacial lakes as a source of drinking water for local communities as well as for crop irrigation and maybe even for small-scale hydropower generation,” says Schleiss. To help achieve that goal, Alain Foehn – one of Schleiss’s PhD students – developed a model for making hydrological forecasts. He set up measurement stations at glacial lakes to continuously monitor and predict the flow rate of rainwater as it runs off into catchment areas, along with changes in air temperature and water levels.\nEPFL researchers also developed models for predicting the lake swells that would be caused if a piece of large rock or glacier formation suddenly broke off and fell into a lake, triggering impulse waves. Their model can be used to design more effective dikes and other structures.\nThe GLACIARES+ project is being carried out in association with the NGO Care Peru as well as with a number of Peruvian universities and government agencies.

These “ebees” flying robots developed by senseFly, a spin-off of EPFL’s Intelligent Systems Laboratory (LIS), took off in September to photograph the Matterhorn from every conceivable angle. The drones are completely autonomous, requiring nothing more than a computer-conceived flight plan before being launched by hand into the air to complete their mission.\nThree of them were launched from a 3,000m “base camp,” and the fourth made the final assault from the summit of the stereotypical Swiss landmark, at 4,478m above sea level. In their six-hour flights, the completely autonomous flying machines took more than 2,000 high-resolution photographs. The only remaining task was for software developed by Pix4D, another EPFL spin-off from the Computer Vision Lab (CVLab), to assemble them into an impressive 300-million-point 3D model.

{"id": 33, "text": "It has become common practice to draw on pension fund assets to purchase a home. But this financial instrument, which will be referred to as “promoting homeownership,” is becoming increasingly controversial, to the point of being called into question altogether. Does it pose a threat to future homeowners? And was it responsible for the sharp rise in property prices?\n In his study, Philippe Thalmann, professor in economics and architecture and president of the Federal Commission for Accommodation, shows that the promotion of home ownership is not to blame for the sharp rise in property prices. However, it can put owners at risk, in particular when the market falters. Here, he responds to some preconceived notions that we put to him.\nThe Swiss government is seeking to allow a maximum number of people to own the home they live in. \n“Indeed, it is a mission that is enshrined in the Federal Constitution. The main argument for this is that Switzerland has one of the lowest home ownership rates among comparable countries. So what? We could just as well highlight the fact that Switzerland is among the countries with the highest proportion of tenants, and leads a small group of countries that came out of the 2008 economic crisis comparatively unscathed. On the other hand, homeowners are often considered to be better citizens because they have stronger ties to their neighborhood and village, and because they supposedly take better care of their homes. There is also a political argument. Simplifying, it can be said that tenants lean left politically, while homeowners lean to the right.”\nThe promotion of homeownership can only be used to reduce the down payment towards a home. \n“When you buy a home, you have to make a down payment of at least 20% of the price. Usually, the rest is financed using a mortgage, which is taken up with a bank. Pension assets can contribute to the down payment, but since 2012, only up to a maximum threshold of 10%.\nAlternatively, pension assets can also be pledged to replace part of the debt, bringing it down below 80%, which means also means lower interest payments. Although this means that you receive less benefits when you retire, you will have been able to save more leading up to your retirement – at least in principle. This approach is rarely adopted, in particular because debt is so cheap today and minimizing debt has not been a priority for people. The main obstacle when purchasing a home is finding the means to make the down payment.”\nPromotion of homeownership to purchase real estate is largely risk-free to those that decide to use it. \n“The risk lies not such much in the fact of using your pension assets. Rather, it lies in the fact of becoming a homeowner with little financial margin. It’s fine if you buy at the right time and the housing market continues to climb. If, however, you buy when the market is strong, and then it collapses, you can be in trouble. The bank may ask you to pay back part of your debt on short notice, given that your property will have lost part of its value. This happened in the 90s when the housing market collapsed. The homeownership promotion scheme is a financial tool that lets people become homeowners without being fully aware of, or underestimating, the risks.“\n“Over the past years, it has been the best possible investment, with a return on investment that I estimate at 30% per year, due to an average yearly increase in housing prices of 6%.\nBut what goes up quickly tends to come back down. The rise in housing prices was fueled by sinking interest rates and strong immigration. But now, interest rates can sink no further, and the Swiss population voted against immigration last February. Both phenomena that propped up housing prices have fallen away, which means that they will fall again. Once they begin to drop, the extraordinary returns of the past could become equally extraordinary losses. If you make a 20% down payment towards a home and its value drops by 6%, you lose one third of your down payment.\nAdditionally, by withdrawing a large part of your pension assets, you significantly reduce your retirement and freeze your wealth in your property. Remarkably, many owners have been forced to seek support from social services to pay for their health insurance. This was obviously not the objective, and social services now consider that things have gone to far. The point was not to give handouts to people that own their homes!”\nBy promoting homeownership, younger people can afford to purchase a home. \n“It is more nuanced than that. The average age at which people become homeowners, which is relatively high in an international comparison (between 35 and 40 years), stays the same, largely because it takes time to save enough to make the down payment and accrue enough money in your pension fund. But it has helped people from lower income classes become homeowners, who would never have been able to do so based on their savings alone. But again, they don’t purchase their home any earlier than their peers that do not have to rely on their pension funds.\nOver the past decade, pension funds have registered over 400,000 early withdrawals, with the number of homeowners increasing only by 250,000 units. That means that all of the withdrawals are being used to purchase a home. \n It isn’t quite that simple. Many individuals make multiple withdrawals. Sometimes, both spouses withdraw capital for the same investment. Based on a variety of indicators, I estimate that 210,000 households took advantage of homeownership promotion between 2001 and 2012. But turning to how the capital was used, the number of new owners is much higher than the increase in the number of owned accommodations. Indeed, many people became owners by purchasing an existing home or apartment from someone that lived there previously. Again here, the exact numbers are unavailable and indirect indicators have to be used. I estimate that 640,000 households became owners between 2001 and 2012. That means that the households that used their pension assets only represent one third of the pool of new owners.\nPromotion of homeownership led to the rise in housing prices. \n“We didn’t observe a sudden jump in prices immediately following the introduction of the homeownership promotion scheme in 1995. Instead, the evolution of the prices was progressive and continuous, despite the fact that the number of beneficiaries has been falling since it peaked in 2003. Therefore, it cannot be held responsible for the increase in housing prices that we’ve experienced over the past decade.”\nThe study was presented during a meeting organized to mark 20 years of encouraging homeownership on September 3 and 4 at the University of Fribourg.", "summary": "For twenty years, Switzerland has been promoting homeownership by letting residents draw on their pension fund assets to buy a home.

{"id": 40, "text": "“The big advantage I have is in joining a properly functioning center, so I can get right down to work. For this, I am very grateful to my predecessor,” said Simone Amorosi right off the bat. He became deputy director of TRACE on 1 May 2015, taking over for Michaël Thémans, the driving force behind the Center since it was founded. In January 2015, Thémans was named deputy to the Vice President for Innovation and Technology Transfer, Adrienne Corboud Fumagalli, a post he has since taken up. The director of TRACE is Professor Michel Bierlaire, head of the Transport and Mobility Laboratory (TRANSP-OR).\nIn creating the Center in 2009, EPFL positioned itself to play an important role on this issue. TRACE is attached to the Vice Presidency for Innovation and Technology Transfer and serves as an interface between EPFL and the external world. It is meant to be the nexus between academic expertise and the interests of industry. More than 75 projects have been started, and they involve some forty laboratories most of which are part of the School of Engineering or the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering.\n“I started out tightening nuts at CERN”\n Transportation and mobility projects harness a wide range of expertise, from mathematical modelling to sociology, without forgetting robotics, information and communication technologies and land-use planning. The new deputy director intends to expand this range as much as possible. Mathematics have a role in transportation, but optics and acoustics do too. Simone wants to find new applications for the laboratories’ work. “Automobile manufacturers are currently working on laser headlights. This is an interesting opportunity for our optics laboratories, which is a field far removed from transportation. Materials departments also have a greater role to play.”\nSimone’s openness is a product of his prior career experience. After his initial training in materials, this native of Italy “tightened nuts on the LHC” at CERN as part of his thesis. “I learned a lot from this experience, which got me started in research and helped acquaint me with Switzerland.”\nHe earned a PhD at EPFL in laser welding and then worked in the fields of optics and solar energy, helping launch two start-ups along the way. His next foray was into the railway sector, where he worked at MATISA, a company that makes rolling stock. He found this to be a “fascinating field” combining tradition and modernity. “The rail sector is one of the keys to the future of transportation, where it has a fundamental role to play.” Looking beyond simplistic and expensive solutions based on further expanding infrastructures, Simone prefers to optimise what currently exists through modelling.\nA role in decision making\n TRACE’s mission is also to find industrial and public partners to finance research projects. In the same multidisciplinary spirit, Simone seeks an ongoing interaction with companies at several levels. He has in mind both long-term framework contracts and assignments lasting only several months. Railways, automobiles, the sociology of mobility, aeronautics: he clearly aims to branch out into other fields of work and enter into more collaborative arrangements.\nTopping things off, the new deputy director feels that TRACE should play a greater role on the advisory boards of major public and private institutions, as is the case already with the Swiss Federal Railways. “It’s an opportunity to provide input and to influence decisions before they are taken. This is particularly important given the fact that decisions in the area of transportation are implemented over the very long term. This will allow us to involve our laboratories and to expand our collaborative undertakings. It’s a virtuous circle.”", "summary": "In the five years since its founding, EPFL’s Transportation Center (TRACE) has already begun more than 75 research projects with partners in the public and private sectors.

{"id": 47, "text": "EPFL’s Satellite bar has passed through the capable hands of 350 volunteers over the last 35 years. As well as brewing and serving countless gallons of beer, the venue has played host to no fewer than 11 Sat Rocks festivals, 75 jam sessions, 180 local comedy shows, 380 concerts, and over 1,000 games nights. Add to that a collection of 120 board games and 5,000-plus comic books (not counting those that have been damaged or lost), and it’s easy to see why the place has built a reputation for fun times. Sat, as it’s affectionately known, is going from strength to strength three-and-a-half decades on – and setting an example for others to follow.\nWhat’s in a name?\n Back in 1983, AGEPoly was mulling over ideas for somewhere its members could relax and socialize. Plans for a new nightclub – to be called Spongiflex – were eventually dropped. Marc Dikötter, then an electrical engineering student, picked up the baton, coming up with the idea of an all-day bar and café stocked with a selection of comics. He spent 12 months working on his plans, securing a 2,000-franc loan from AGEPoly to buy French comic books and sourcing furniture from Ikea. “I ended up failing my classes,” explains Dikötter. “I didn’t attend a single lecture that whole year. But I wanted to finish my studies, so I left Sat and enrolled in computer science. I wasn’t exactly a diligent student, but I found it pretty easy and graduated in 1988. After five years as a teaching assistant, he decided it was time to move on – from EPFL and Sat. “I enjoy working on new ideas, but I prefer to hand over the reins once things are up and running.” After coming back for Sat’s 25th anniversary celebrations, Dikötter missed the 30-year reunion. He’s determined not to make the same mistake this time around. “It’s funny to think that my most lasting achievement isn’t job-related but a student bar.”\nThat’s what friends are for\n The story of Sat is one of friendship. Dikötter met fellow student Pier Donini at the bar and, 30 years later, they ended up working together at the Vaud School of Management and Engineering (HEIG-VD) in Yverdon-les-Bains. Although Dikötter has severed all ties with Sat, Donini is still heavily involved to this day. “I started out taking the special mathematics course on Avenue de Cour in 1984,” he says. “Then in 1985 I joined EPFL as an undergraduate in physics. And like any good student, I used to hang around at Sat. I was 19 years old and obsessed with comic books. Because I spent so much time there, I was eventually asked to join the team. So that’s what I did – as head of the comic collection, of course.” Donini, of French and Italian descent, found life at the school rough at first. Sat became something of a second home to him. “I practically lived at Sat. I’d find any excuse to head over there. I even studied there. I wouldn’t have coped without the place. It was a lifeline.” As well as being an avid reader, Donini is a lifelong comedy fan. He invited up-and-coming comedians to perform on stage at Sat. Some of them – like François Rollin (who played there in 1989), Les Vamps, Les Chasseurs en Exil and Les Indécis – went on to become household names. Donini, now 52 and head of HEIG-VD’s Computer Science School, is still on the Sat mailing list and continues to attend committee meetings to this day.\nTalents and decisions\n Morgan Fargues graduated with a degree in environmental engineering in 2016. A dabbler with an insatiable curiosity and an appetite for new experiences, he was heavily involved in the Swiss Living Challenge’s NeighborHub solar house project, which won the Solar Decathlon competition in 2017. He also traveled to Bogotá, Colombia, to take part in air quality research. Fargues was twice involved in organizing the Balelec Festival and helped run Sat Rocks for ten years. A man of many talents, he’s now teaching himself how to brew beer. “I like to think I’ve got two or even three degrees under my belt. I gained a decade’s worth of experience at Sat.” Manon Durand-Ruel started a Master’s degree in neuroscience at EPFL in 2014. Like Fargues, she too was keen to meet people. After attending Sat Rocks, she joined the committee – and passed up the chance to go abroad, instead taking a placement at the CHUV so she could devote her time to the cause. “I made a conscious decision to stay local so I’d be there when Sat needed me,” she says. She has no regrets about her decision, and her time at the CHUV is still serving her well as she pursues her PhD.\nAll the fun of the festival\n Andreas Jaggi (computer science, 2009) enjoyed nothing more than organizing concerts. “There were some stressful times, but we all stepped up and helped each other out,” he explains. “We were a close-knit team.” He has fond memories of his time at Sat. Even though he works in Zurich, he makes regular trips back to catch up with old friends – both at the bar and at local festivals. “Lots of people I knew from Sat are now working backstage and on artist meet-and-greet at festivals like Caribana, Montreux and Paleo.” Jaggi will be there, behind his favorite bar, to mark Sat’s 35th anniversary celebrations.\nDo you know Satellite at EPFL?\nSatellite 30th anniversary video\nEvent program: info and booking\nMonday, 1 April\nBeer festival\n, outside the Sat, starting at 5pm.\nJam Session\n, with an opening performance by a group of home-grown musicians, inside, starting at 8pm.\nTuesday, 2 April\nFoosball tournament\n, teams of two, 10am.\nBoard-game Olympics\n, teams of five, 7:30pm.\nWednesday, 3 April\nLive music\n, Lost in Swing, 10am.\nConcert\n, N.O.H.A, Audio and MC Xander, 7:30pm.\nThursday, 4 April\nImprovisational theater show\n with Catch Impro, 8pm.\nTicketed event.

{"id": 51, "text": "Divided into small groups of eight, and led by a tutor who will follow them during the whole term, the students perform mammoth teaching exercises such as analysis and physics. Previously, there could be 30 to 50 students in the same classroom, with only a few assistants to help them with the exercises. This meant that anyone who was having difficulty would sometimes have to wait a long time before being able to put his or her questions. “The outcome of the evaluations we performed shows that the students are very satisfied with the format of this tutoring”, explains Nadine Stainier of CRAFT. In 2010, 11 teaching programs used this approach, and no fewer than 1250 students benefited from the support of the pool of 220 tutors. The medium-term objective of CRAFT will be to allow each student to follow at least one course of analysis or physics in this format, whatever section he or she is in.\nThe Vice-Presidency for Academic Affairs at EPFL, responsible for training, has decided to support the concept of tutoring, and to double the budget in 2011. This is because it sees the potential of offering first-year students a high-quality learning framework that also emphasizes the human and relational aspects. The students thus acquire the necessary methodology to manage to complete the exercises in analysis and physics, while at the same time successfully integrating within the campus, where they will need to find their feet and develop new relationships. They will also benefit from the group dynamics: “We’ve even noticed that some groups have continued to work together outside the tutoring program, in disciplines other than analysis and physics”, points out Jean-Louis Ricci, also of CRAFT.\n Participation in the exercise sessions remains high throughout the term, and the students appreciate the possibility of sharing and pooling problems to be solved.

{"id": 62, "text": "You have been appointed dean of ENAC until 2024. What do you hope to achieve during this time?\nWe are facing an array of challenges with major implications for our society. These challenges include climate change – as reflected in the growing #FridaysForFuture movement [a series of climate marches led by activist Greta Thunberg] – the depletion of our natural resources, the energy transition and the relentless pace of urban development. To tackle these challenges a holistic approach is required. At ENAC, we have a major strength in this respect: our skills in architecture, civil and environmental engineering give us unique competencies and synergies for developing cross-cutting innovations. Along with my colleagues at ENAC, I want to advance that potential by creating the boundary conditions for excellence in research, teaching and innovation for a more sustainable built and natural environment, on both the national and international stage.\nHow do you plan to get there? \nI plan to build on and foster ENAC’s excellent performance and successes in this respect: the NeighborHub, which won the 2017 Solar Decathlon; the Smart Living Lab in Fribourg, specialized on the built environment of the future; the Transportation Center; the Habitat Research Center; the Alpine Research Center in Valais; and our close ties with EPFL’s Energy Center. Beyond the excellent research and teaching, our research ecosystem has given rise to a number of highly promising spin-offs. My goal is to leverage these achievements and position ENAC as a center of excellence in advancing the sustainability of our natural and built environment. This will be done across all three of EPFL’s core missions: teaching, research and innovation.\nCan you give us concrete examples? \nRecently, there have been new initiatives emerging at ENAC, as are CLIMACT “Center for Climate, Impact and Action” in cooperation with the University of Lausanne and the Center of Digital Infrastructure. Together with my colleagues, I aim at exploring the role of research clusters linked to ENAC related initiatives and addressing key topics related to the sustainability of the built and natural environment. One issue I would also like ENAC to engage in, is to reflect on how digitalization can be used to stimulate sustainability, and how big data can help scientists build a collective wealth of knowledge, in order to help policymakers build livable cities. These efforts will be carried out in association with the other EPFL faculties and EPFL’s Tech4Impact initiative, which aims to find technology-driven solutions to major societal challenges. Through the latter, we will be able to turn our research into innovations that will benefit society.\nDo you have any initiatives planned in education?\nTomorrow’s engineers and architects will be required to work collaboratively in complex, fast-changing environments. So I would like to further foster our unique \"Design Together\" program, where students in architecture, civil engineering and environmental engineering join forces to find novel solutions for a sustainable future. Along the same lines, I aim at supporting and developing our \"Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory\" (SKIL), where ENAC students can suggest course subjects that will equip them for today’s challenges. Both SKIL and Design Together encourage students to develop creative and innovative solutions for our pressing problems and have generated several spin-offs – all of which serves EPFL’s mission of innovation.\nWhat do you see as ENAC’s role within EPFL?\nEPFL provides our school with a dynamic, stimulating research and learning environment. It is for us a distinctive possibility that numerous labs in other EPFL schools are also studying sustainability-related issues. Basing ourselves on ENAC’s unique disciplinary composition, which allows for bridging to other faculties, we aim at sharing and integrating knowledge with members of the other faculties of EPFL and across Switzerland for further developing the sustainability field.\nLooking at Switzerland as a whole, and even internationally, what do you see as ENAC’s strengths – and what challenges will it face – over the coming years?\nThe researchers of the three institutes of ENAC architecture, civil and environmental engineering have excellent track records and are internationally recognized. It is rare that these three disciplines are found together under the same roof. This forward-thinking structure gives us such unparalleled scope for innovation. This also implies that students and researchers from our three different disciplines need to find a common language and think creatively to deploy their full potential. So one opportunity we have is to further develop our unique approach, which can be done by embracing the digital revolution already under way and setting up processes that facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration. This is especially important at a time when our society is facing complex problems that cannot be solved from the perspective of just one field. How will climate change affect our mountains and our urban lifestyles? How can we prevent our cities from becoming suffocating hot in the summer? These are just two of the many questions we will be able to tackle at ENAC over the coming years, if we all work together.\nBIOGRAPHY \n joined EPFL in March 2016 and set up the Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS) at ENAC; she also holds the La Mobilière Chair on Urban Ecology and Sustainable Living.

{"id": 72, "text": "The availability of electricity is a pressing social issue, as the recent energy debates show. Fifty-seven percent of the electrical energy produced in Switzerland is hydraulically generated. The pumped storage system used by FMHL (Forces Motrices Hongrin-Léman) makes it possible to store energy, produced for example from wind turbines and solar sources, like a battery. Thus when the energy demand is low, the Veytaux power plant pumps the water from Lake Geneva to the Hongrin reservoir where it is temporarily stored in order to be reversed later by turbines to produce the electricity when the demand rises. The new power plant Veytaux 2 will enable the power of the existing installation to be doubled from 240 to 480 megawatts.\n To fit this new underground power plant, with a volume equivalent to Lausanne cathedral (140,000 m3) into the existing system, it was essential to study the functioning of the hydraulic circuit downstream using a physical model. The Hydraulic Constructions Laboratory was commissioned to complete this study. Anton Schleiss’s team has reproduced the two Veytaux power plants on the 1:30 scale in its hydraulic machine hall. The physical model comprises the water supply point in Lake Geneva, the old and the new factory with their two pump-turbine groups, and the outlet channel. It has all been designed to simulate the functioning of the new power plant that will be put into operation in 2014. “We can test the interactions between the two power plants, study how they function in borderline cases, anticipate problems that may arise and make our recommendations”, points out Martin Bieri, an engineer at LCH who is working on this project with Giovanni de Cesare and Stéphane Terrier.

{"id": 74, "text": "It was an unforgettable sight, when in summer of 2011 the two Russian submersibles MIR 1 and MIR 2 embarked on their first dive into the depths of Lake Geneva. The submersibles were part of elemo, an international effort to study the dynamics and the health of Europe’s largest alpine lake, which is under constant pressure from over one million residents living nearby. Ever since the three-month field campaign came to an end, scientists have been working in the lab to analyze the collected data and samples, generating a bounty of results. A selection of eight research articles reporting the results from the campaign has now been compiled into a special issue of the journal Aquatic Sciences, published June 2014. This extraordinary research campaign was made possible thanks to the support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals, and the Honorary Consulate of the Russian Federation through the FEEL Foundation.\nThe eight articles cover two main themes: gaining a better understanding of the lake’s geology, and evaluating the impact of pollutants on water quality. Among other topics, dives carried out close to the mouth of the Rhône River near Villeneuve focused on the formation and evolution of the spectacular underwater canyons formed by the river. And near the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant of the City of Lausanne, researchers used the submersibles to gain insight into the presence and persistence of micro-pollutants and their spreading within the lake.\nCanyons and contamination\nThe submersibles gave some of the research teams a unique opportunity to probe Lake Geneva’s underwater canyons, providing new insight into how they built up and are destabilized through the deposition and erosion of sediments from the Rhône River. Working on a sediment core extracted from the river delta, another group of researchers developed a novel approach to assess the impact of agricultural pollutants on the health of the lake ecosystem, which involves studying the diversity bacterial populations trapped in the sediment.\nOff the shore of Lausanne, the submersibles helped demonstrate that micro-pollutants – invisibly small compounds mainly from medical and cosmetic products that enter the lake with treated wastewater from the City of Lausanne – could be traced within an area of at least one square kilometer, reaching deep into the lake, and sometimes spreading in the direction of the drinking water intake for St. Sulpice. In a parallel study in the same area, another group of researchers established a link between certain types of bacteria and the transport and deposition of trace metals in sediments.\nA once in a lifetime opportunity\nThe special issue of Aquatic Sciences recognizes the importance of the elemo field campaign, which has already led to a total of fourteen research papers and is likely to give rise to many more. “It was a once in a lifetime opportunity for us all to use manned submersibles to study the lake in our backyard,” says Alfred Wüest, the director of EPFL’s Margareta Kamprad Chair for Lake Science.

{"id": 77, "text": "A luminous flux equivalent to 20,000 suns? The energy received over the course of one day in the desert? The exhaust of a rocket engine? The luminous intensity that occurs in space, close to the sun? An EPFL laboratory has managed to replicate the heat and light of the sun’s radiation with unparalleled precision and power. This system can be used to test solar power equipment and analyze materials in extreme temperature and heat conditions, providing a full picture in just a few hours without the vagaries of the weather. Detailed information on the system is contained in an article appearing today in Optics Express.\nThe intensity of 21,700 suns\nThe system, which was developed in collaboration with the Australian National University and the company Kinoton Digital Solutions, was designed to produce the most intense light possible that can be adjusted precisely and does not create unnecessary heat, as that could damage the materials being tested. To achieve this, 18 light sources are placed in two concentric circles around a virtual half-sphere nearly two meters in diameter. Each of these lamps consists of a reflector – a sort of cup-shaped mirror – that is lit by a Xenon bulb. The light waves given off in all directions by the bulb are thus reflected and focused on a specific point. At the spot where the light beams from the different lamps meet, the maximum intensity reaches 21,700 suns (21.7 MW m\n-2\n). This is the spot where materials and devices can be tested.\nThis system, which fills an entire room at the Laboratory of Renewable Energy Science and Engineering (LRESE), can be used to run many types of tests under stable and controlled experimental conditions. The research group headed by Sophia Haussener uses it mainly for the group’s work on new processes for converting and storing solar energy. For example, they test heat transfer between various materials, which could improve the output from commercial concentrating solar power plants (the tower or cylindro-parabolic forms, both of which are in fast-growing use in the United States and Spain) or demonstrate the viability of new approaches to harnessing, transferring and converting light energy. Other collaborative efforts are under way as well, such as for characterizing space materials.\nA versatile current that changes everything\nThe system’s unprecedented performance was achieved thanks in large part to a new type of reflector, which is produced through electroforming. “This is a method for the electrolytic deposition of metal, and it can replicate a model with unparalleled exactness,” said Gaël Levêque, a scientist at LRESE. “The precision of reflection is much better.”\nThere are more modules than in existing solar simulators and the current can be adjusted, which means the amount of power can be precisely controlled. The current provided to the lamps can be dialed anywhere from 70% to 120% of the 90 injected amps: this makes it possible to control the amount of luminous power delivered. For a given level of power or flux, the researcher has several choices: “To get 5.4 KW in power, for example, we can use six lamps – in other words just the first circle of lamps – at 120%, or nine lamps at 70%,” said Levêque. Using fewer lamps “closes” the angle of incidence of the radiation, which means that the total light beam is narrower and more powerful. Increasing the number of lamps, on the other hand, means the light beam will be wider and less concentrated, which is practical for lighting a surface more uniformly.\nA twin in Australia and an open-source method\nThis system has a twin in Canberra, Australia, which was built at the same time as EPFL’s. But it’s more than just a system, in fact: it’s an open-source method that the researchers developed in collaboration with their colleagues at the Australian National University and the company Kinoton Digital Solutions GmbH. Other systems can thus be built on the basis of these calculations, using more or fewer lamps and different dimensions. Stronger radiative fluxes could also be achieved by using more powerful lamps or adjusting several other parameters.", "summary": "Eighteen light sources arranged in a half-sphere can mimic the equivalent of several thousand times the sun’s radiation received on earth, with unparalleled power and precision.

It has caught the attention of the largest sports leagues in the world, including the NBA, which has just sealed a seven-year deal to use it in all official games starting in 2017.\nRevealing the invisible\n“Our technology makes the invisible visible, providing very detailed information to the fans, the commentators and the coaches,” said Dr. Horesh Ben Shitrit, who co-founded PlayfulVision together with Professor Pascal Fua and is now the Director of Computer Vision products at Second Spectrum Switzerland.\nThe system is based on optical trackers that capture every move by every player and by the ball, recording their exact coordinates 25 times per second. This information will be used to carefully analyze games: body position, shots, rebounds and fouls. “We provide an in-depth understanding of the games, at a greater level of detail than a coach can perceive alone,” says Shitrit.\nAugmented reality\nThis system will be a dream for commentators and fans alike. But it will also be a gold mine for players and coaches who, after studying their – and their opponents' – past games, will adapt their strategy and training accordingly. “Up until now, fans had a sense that a given pass was really hard or that a given shot shouldn't have been attempted,” said Jeff Su, the CTO of Second Spectrum. “Now, we can quantify these things and show them in images. Our approach to the game will transform the fans’ experience and how they perceive and rate the athletes’ performance, thanks to both augmented and virtual reality.”\nSecond Spectrum continues to develop its projects in close collaboration with EPFL. Funding for its projects has just been approved by the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which promotes linkages between universities and industry.", "summary": "A new technology developed by PlayfulVision, an EPFL startup bought by Second Spectrum last year, records all aspects of sporting events for subsequent analysis in augmented reality.

{"id": 99, "text": "Will the water be warm enough tomorrow to go for a lunchtime swim in Lake Geneva? Will you be sailing against the currents to Evian this weekend? What will be the best place to collect algae samples the day after tomorrow? The answers to all these questions can be found on a single website: . Initially developed three years ago by \nTheo Baracchini\n, a PhD student at EPFL’s Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory (APHYS), the project had a purely scientific goal: to enable scientists to view physical and biological data about Lake Geneva, collected over time and at different locations, that were previously difficult to obtain. But with around 330 visits a day last summer, the platform obviously became useful to more than just scientists – swimmers, sailors, beach authorities, boaters, fishermen, tourists, nature lovers and people who are simply interested in lakes. Baracchini therefore expanded his website as part of his thesis research, which he defended this Friday at EPFL.\n“Meteolakes.ch is the first platform to compile lake data from three different sources: satellite images, in situ measurements and 3D computer simulations,” says Baracchini. While the first version displayed only water surface temperature and average current velocities, the website now contains a wealth of information including algae concentrations and water oxygen levels and lets users view data at different depths. Baracchini also enhanced the website’s models of Lake Geneva by adding temperature and water-velocity readings from the four main rivers that feed the lake: the Rhône, Dranse, Aubonne and Venoge.\nAn alert system\nThe updated platform contains new features as well, such as an early warning system that can predict major disturbances – like strong storm currents or upwellings – up to four-and-a-half days in advance and send an email to people who sign up for the service.\nHere are two examples of disturbances the system could detect in 2018:\nA localized storm hit Vevey on August 6. \nIn december, a gyre in the middle of the lake created an upwelling of cold water.\nAnother new feature is a “particle tracker” that can display particle dispersion patterns (such as for pollutant particles) associated with the currents modelled on the website. This feature was used to identify the origins of calcite precipitation (which caused the water to suddenly turn white) and could be useful in search and rescue operations.\nAs part of an open science approach – and to promote cross-disciplinary research on lakes – Baracchini made it possible for users to download the raw data generated by the website’s 3D models. Users can specify exactly what location, time period, variable and water depth they are interested in; the website will extract the data and send them electronically in formatted files.\nA dynamic ecosystem\nThe final update was to incorporate real-time data feeds that operate in loops. When a satellite flies over Lake Geneva and records the water temperature, these data are incorporated into the website’s models, which are then used to plan on-site measurements, which in turn provide feedback on the satellite’s accuracy. Meteolakes therefore creates a system where each data source benefits the others. This new feature also enables the website to quantify and reduce uncertainty, making it one of the most sophisticated lake-data platforms in the world.\nBy providing a more detailed view of Switzerland’s lakes, the website makes it clear just how much is going on beneath their placid surface. “Each lake is a complex, vital ecosystem that is much more active and alive than we imagine. With Meteolakes, I wanted to not just help scientists study and predict the impacts of climate change or extreme weather events, but also to allow people who enjoy our country’s lakes to realize how dynamic they are,” says Baracchini", "summary": "A new website, , provides up-to-date information – such as water temperature, current speed, the chances of a storm and the presence of algae and gyres – on Switzerland’s main lakes.

This provided a unique and fascinating opportunity for field research at the intersection of climate science, archeology, and history.\nXavier Choitel, a master’s student in Civil Engineering, was a member of a team with students from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) studying the impacts of climate change and human activities on the arctic tundra environment. He and his team conducted granulometry tests, which can indicate the sensitivity to frost and thawing, on the grounds surrounding the abandoned railroad and camp.\n“Our project was to analyze arctic infrastructures with regard to the thawing of frost and permafrost, which is amplified by climate change. This can cause large deformations and damage to infrastructure like roads, railroads, pipelines, and buildings in general,” Choitel explains.\n“I worked primarily with environmental science students from UNIGE, and we helped each other with our work. The group was very interdisciplinary, so it was very instructive to collaborate.”\n Meanwhile, Life Sciences Engineering master’s student Jonathan Melis joined participants from UNIGE and the University of Lausanne (UNIL) in an archaeological and historical investigation into the relics of the gulag, which was built just after the Second World War. The fieldwork for this project included detailed archaeological documentation of the still-visible remains.\n“As someone that comes from a bioengineering background, I had very limited occasions to pursue my passion for archeology during my studies at EPFL prior to joining the CDH’s STAS minor. This was the perfect opportunity for me to join a program that provided excellent training and immersive fieldwork,” Melis says.\nHe adds that the unique location of the project made the experience particularly memorable.\n“My most prominent memory of the experience was the opportunity to accomplish everyday tasks in the superb landscape of the Yamal region. Sprinkled blueberries on a sea of green moss, where decaying buildings emerge from a painful period in Russian history, made for surreal scenery.”\nOther expeditions\nThe Yamal voyage was carried out for the first time this year as an addition to the two-part Arctic Floating University () program, which takes Russian and Swiss students from EPFL, UNIGE and UNIL on field research expeditions.\nFrom June to July, Mechanical Engineering student Adrien Simon and Chemical Engineering student Fanny Racine boarded the polar ship Professor Molchanov  between the islands and archipelagos of the Arctic Ocean. This expedition took a total of 10 Swiss and Russian students to conduct climatology, meteorology and marine biology field research.\nFinally, from mid-August to early September, Environmental Sciences and Engineering students Océane Hames, Joelle Perreten and Yoann Sadowski travelled to the Samoylov research station in the Lena Delta, east of Siberia, to  from previous years.\nFollow the student blog at , and view their travels on  and .", "summary": "For the first time this summer, EPFL students travelled to the Yamal Peninsula of northwest Siberia for field research.

At the final stage of EPFL’s “My Thesis in 180 Seconds” competition held this evening, the oratorical talents of 14 PhD students managed to turn sober topics into captivating listening for a non-specialist audience. In other words, a fun way for some 600 spectators to expand their knowledge.\nThree minutes and not one second more. According to the rules governing this competition, the students have 180 seconds to talk about their research to a decidedly diverse crowd.

In order to prepare most effectively, the students took part in public-speaking training that same month. The training, which took place over the course of several days and was delivered by two media professionals in cooperation with the Staff Training Service, emphasized practice. Each participant went in front of the camera several times and received constructive criticism from the trainers and their peers.

{"id": 110, "text": "The time has come. The \nAkademik Treshnikov\n will leave the port of Cape Town, South Africa today on the three-month Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). The imposing Russian research ship will carry over 120 people: some 60 researchers from 30 different countries and about the same number of crew members. In addition to circumnavigating Antarctica, they will visit around twelve subantarctic islands.\nThis is the first project put together by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI). It was Frederik Paulsen, a businessman and major philanthropist, who came up with the idea. He is also providing the ACE expedition with logistical backing, drawing on his extensive experience in Arctic exploration. Additional support is being provided by Presence Switzerland, a unit of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.\nThe idea behind the ACE expedition is to measure and quantify the impact of environmental changes and pollution in the Southern Ocean. This region plays a key role in climate regulation: currents of icy water deep in the ocean travel from the poles toward the equator, while warm water and air move across the ocean’s surface towards the cold regions. The earth’s climate can thus be compared to a huge heat engine. This process of heat transfer between polar and tropical regions is also an important component of the carbon cycle and a key factor in the oceans' ability to store CO\n2\n.\n“The poles are essential for climate balance, but they are also the regions where changes are most apparent: that’s where the largest temperature differences have been recorded,” said Philippe Gillet, vice president of EPFL, director ad interim of the SPI and a specialist in Earth and planetary science.\nFrom plankton to microplastics \nTwenty-two research projects will be run during this trip by teams from Switzerland, the UK, France and Australia, to name a few. The projects were selected by a panel of international experts following a call for proposals organized jointly by the polar institutes of eight countries: South Africa, France, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Norway, Russia and Switzerland.\nThe projects cover a wide range of fields, including glaciology, climatology, biology and oceanography. The topics of study include wave formation, geographical variations in plankton populations, chemical exchanges between air and water, biodiversity on the islands, the ocean’s CO\n2\n storage capacity, microplastic pollution and its impact on fauna, and an acoustic analysis of whale populations. This expedition will also build bridges between the various scientific fields. Not only will the researchers collaborate in their on-ship research, but they will build relationships that will set the stage for future collaborations at the international level.\nThe first Maritime University successfully completed\nThe ACE expedition was preceded by the ACE Maritime University. Fifty students studying marine and earth sciences at universities around the world took part. They boarded the \nAkademik Treshnikov \non 19 November in Bremerhaven, in northern Germany, and reached Cape Town on 15 December. The young researchers took intensive theory-oriented classes and then engaged in hands-on practicals that taught them different sampling and analytical techniques and how to handle basic instruments. The students also used this opportunity to learn about their peers’ work in other fields.\nA chair for the study of extreme environments \nThe SPI also has a new chair, which will be formalized today in Cape Town. The Ingvar Kamprad Chair of Extreme Environments will be supported by Ferring Pharmaceuticals and based at EPFL’s Valais-Wallis outpost in Sion. The new team will work in EPFL’s alpine and extreme environment research center. It will apply cutting-edge scientific and technological solutions to environmental challenges like climate change and global resource management. This approach will enhance Switzerland’s existing scientific, economic and diplomatic contribution to this effort.\nThe research ship will hoist anchor at 4pm today, and is scheduled to return to Cape Town on 19 March 2017. An initial review of the expedition will be presented the following September at an international symposium to be held in Valais.\nRegular updates on the ACE expedition will be available here:\nThis website also provides a wide range of background information on the expedition, the projects, the researchers, the ship, etc.\nPress kit:\n Press release, project descriptions, FAQs, photos: \nSocial media: \n The ACE expedition is also on ,  and Instagram (ace_expedition).\nContacts:\n- Philippe Gillet, director ad interim of the SPI, , +41 21 693 70 58\n- Sarah Perrin, press officer at EPFL's Mediacom, , +41 21 693 21 07\n- Danièle Rod, Advisor to the EPFL Presidency in Cape Town, South Africa, ,\n+27 61 445 30 57\n- Helen Gallagher, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, , +41 58 301 00 51\n--------------------------------------------\nThe Swiss Polar Institute\n The Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) is an interdisciplinary center whose mission is to conduct research on the earth’s poles and other extreme environments. It was created in April 2016. The SPI is based at the Valais outpost of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL Valais-Wallis). It is a consortium of Swiss universities and was co-founded by EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL), ETH Zurich, the University of Bern and Editions Paulsen.\nFerring Pharmaceuticals\n Ferring Pharmaceuticals is a private, research-driven biopharmaceuticals company based in Switzerland. The company is devoted to identifying, developing and marketing innovative products in the fields of reproductive health, urology, gastroenterology, endocrinology and orthopaedics.

The number of patent filings has increased in similar proportions, rising from 256 between 1995 and 2004 to 539 between 2005 and 2014. This increase is due in part to EPFL's growth. But for Gabriel Clerc, head of the TTO since it was created, this rise can also be attributed to a growing awareness among researchers of the importance of gaining market recognition for their ideas and research results.\nOver half of licenses are used by Swiss SMEs\n Of the 1500 inventions filed so far with the TTO, around 40% have been or will be put to commercial use through a license agreement with a start-up or existing company. The number of innovations currently being used by companies in the form of licenses is also twice as high now (391) as in 2005 (191). More than half of these rights were assigned in recent years to Swiss companies with fewer than 250 employees. “It is gratifying to see that most of our license agreements are with Swiss start-ups and small businesses,” said Mr. Clerc. “These companies are a major contributor to the strength of our economy and employment levels both regionally and nationwide.”\nSome of EPFL’s inventions enjoy widespread use around the world. One of its first inventions to experience widespread industrial success – Reymond Clavel’s Delta robot – was created 30 years ago. It is used by many companies and is commonly found in a number of sectors, including the rapid manipulation of small objects, watchmaking, remote surgery, measurement systems and material processing. Another major invention managed by the TTO is none other than Michaël Grätzel’s famous dye-sensitized solar cells. They have spawned many research projects and patents, not to mention industrial applications and improvements, since the end of the 1980s.\nInvention number 1500: a microscope for seeing cells in vivo\n “The most important thing for me is to form a solid team with the researchers for each invention,” said Mr. Clerc. “Nothing can be done without their expertise and enthusiasm.” Christophe Moser and Demetri Psaltis, both professors at EPFL, have indeed benefited from this precious teamwork. EPFL’s 1500th invention, which they recently filed, is the final step in a microscope capable of providing three-dimensional high-resolution images of functioning cells in the human body. These cells are smaller than a micrometer. Four years of research, in conjunction with Harvard Medical School, culminated in five patent filings for this device, which represents a major advance in the areas of medicine and microbiology. Potential uses include, for example, observing cells in the inner ear to determine whether an implant is working, and studying a functioning neuron.\nThis imaginative animated short film, produced by two young graphic designers, shows the various steps in the technology transfer process from the perspective of the invention itself.", "summary": "EPFL's Technology Transfer Office evaluated twice as many inventions between 2005 and 2014 than it did during the prior decade.

{"id": 121, "text": "With its quick and painless allergy detection and analysis system, Abionic is on a roll. This spin-off of EPFL’s Biomedical Imaging Laboratory has just obtained two million Swiss francs from private and institutional investors, including MedHoldings, Polytech Ventures, Blue Ocean Ventures, Fongit Seed Invest and the Business Angels Switzerland. This funding will allow the company to finish developing its system and aim for commercialization next year. Yesterday, the young company selected as one of Europe’s 100 most innovative companies in late April by Red Herring, a US magazine that is considered a reference for many venture capitalists. Four other EPFL startups were also on the top 100 list: Biocartis, Paper.li, HR Matching, and StereoTools.\nA multitude of allergens on a single CD\nGeared for use by allergists, pediatricians and other medical practitioners, this device resembles a DVD player equipped with a touch screen. It comes equipped with plastic capsules containing single-use biochips. It only takes about 20 minutes to diagnose a patient’s primary allergies, using a single drop of blood. This system could free millions of people throughout the world from having to undergo the tedious skin test, which consists of scratching or pricking the skin to allow exposure to various allergens, and then evaluating the skin's reaction.\nA few drops of a reagent are mixed with the blood sample. The preparation is placed in a compartmentalized capsule that contains ten biochips, each of which is prepared with a different allergen. The tiny device is mounted on a plastic surface in the form of a CD and “read” by a laser. The results appear on the screen and are automatically saved to a memory card. The doctor can read, print and save the results to his or her computer. The CD can be personalized with several dozens of different allergens.\nCounting molecules\nIn a general sense, nanofluidic biochips take advantage of various special properties that fluids exhibit at the nanometer scale. Nicolas Durand built upon this technology as part of his PhD research in EPFL’s Microsystems Laboratory, and it was further developed by the Biomedical Imaging Laboratory start-up. Here’s how it works: The blood enters into contact with allergens that have been previously deposited in the biochip. The interactions between certain proteins in the blood, which are marked with a fluorochrome (a chemical substance that can emit light upon excitation) and the immobilized allergens are measured by fluorescence. The device’s laser excites the protein-allergen molecular complexes, and they emit light. The concentration of these complexes determines the degree of the allergy. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, but in this case, you’re sure to find it if it’s there.\nNext targets: cancer and Alzheimer’s disease\nAccording to the Swiss Center for Allergies, about a quarter of the Swiss population exhibits various allergic symptoms. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has announced that close to 50% of Americans suffer from allergies. On a global scale, all allergies, including food allergies, have been on the upswing since the mid-1950s. “The world market for diagnostics in 2011 was evaluated at more than 40 billion Swiss francs,” Durand reports.\nThe company’s objectives are equally promising; in addition to reducing the analysis time on their device even further, the start-up is already looking at the possibility of using the method to detect other diseases whose blood biomarkers will be commercially available, such as certain cancers and Alzheimer’s disease.", "summary": "Abionic, an EPFL spin-off, has just brought its first round of financing to a close and was selected yesterday by Red Herring as one of Europe’s 100 most innovative companies.

{"id": 129, "text": "Sylke Hoehnel is preparing to make a 15-minute pitch on her startup, Sun Bioscience, at the Cartier Women’s Initiative Awards in San Francisco. We’ll know tomorrow evening whether she’s done enough to scoop the top prize. But she’s already enjoying the exposure and personal coaching that comes with being among the 24 finalists – who were selected from a field of over 2,000 female entrepreneurs from around the world. Hoehnel and her co-founder, Nathalie Brandenberg, have developed a simple, reliable, time-saving grid system that allows for the standardized growth of organoids – tiny three-dimensional organ fragments with powerful applications in drug trials and research. Their breakthrough couldn’t have come at a better time. Here, Hoehnel tells us more about her company’s technology, and how she plans to market the product on her terms.\nCan you tell us a bit more about your system?\nOrganoids are being used in an increasing number of applications, such as drug trials, but they need the right structure and a special environment to grow. At the moment, researchers are still doing that work by hand. It’s a time-consuming process that’s difficult to reproduce. Our solution, which we can manufacture at scale, combines a round grid with a microstructured gel that supports organoid growth. Using our technology, researchers can make multiple copies of the same organoid, all exactly the same size. That might seem insignificant to an outsider, but it’s extremely difficult to do when you’re working at a nanoscopic scale.\nAward entrants need to demonstrate they have a marketable product. Can you manufacture your product at scale yet, and who are your customers? \nWe’ve developed a robot that prints the structure onto the gel and assembles the grid. We began selling the system, which we call Gri3D, earlier this year. We’ve had several major pharmaceutical companies buy it, and the feedback’s been very good so far. We’re also using it ourselves as part of a cystic fibrosis clinical trial with Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). The system lets us observe, in three dimensions, how tissues respond to different forms of treatment.\nCould you build on your cystic fibrosis research and use the technology to trial drugs for other diseases? \nYes, that’s one of our aims. However, we recognize that it’s important to take things one step at a time. Many people, not least investors, have set their sights on cancer. It’s a vast market. But just understanding cancer in the human body is hard enough. Growing something in the laboratory then claiming “that’s cancer” is a bit of a leap. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic mutation, so it’s relatively straightforward to check whether a given molecule might work.\nWhat do you expect to gain from the week you are spending in San Francisco?\nWe’ve had invaluable support from people around us so far, and I think spending time there will help us grow our network further. Aside from the competition, there’s a week-long program of workshops for the finalists, including sessions with previous years’ winners. The awards are also an incredible opportunity to gain exposure. The whole thing is run like an ad campaign, with videos and an expansive social media presence. And tomorrow, we’ll be giving a TED Talk-style presentation on our business plan. To be honest, I’ve never seen anything like it (\nshe laughs\n). Standard startup competitions pale in comparison.\nHow did the selection process work? Did you have to prepare for it?\nEntrants were whittled down to the final 24 based on their applications. Once we’d made it onto the short list, a specialist pharma business coach helped us refine our business plan. The next step was to work on my pitch. The organizers are keen to make it a glitzy, glamorous event, very much in the American showbiz vein – we’re supposed to act like stars (\nshe laughs\n). Three entrants from eight regions have made it through to the finals in San Francisco. The judges will pick a winner from each region, based on their pitch and business plan.\nMore and more women are starting their own business these days, but you’re still in the minority. Do you find it hard being a female entrepreneur here in Switzerland?\nNot especially, no. I’ve been to quite a few business meetings where almost everyone else has been a man. On the odd occasion, I’ve felt a bit awkward as a woman among them (\nshe laughs\n). I also remember when we signed the agreement for our Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT) loan in front of a notary. He remarked that the whole document was written in the masculine gender, when in fact both of us are women. He said that had never come up before.\nWhat’s been the hardest part about setting up your business, and what are you most proud of?\nI learned a lot when I was studying for my PhD. But setting up a new business is an entirely different ballgame. It’s a steep learning curve. At first, you feel like you’re cast adrift at sea, doing whatever you can to stay afloat and juggle one problem after another. The fact that there were two of us from the outset was a real bonus.

{"id": 130, "text": "When the Mühleberg nuclear power station goes offline in 2019, the waters of the Aar River and Lake Biel will cool down. And since the Aar feeds into the Rhine, the effects could be felt as far away as southern Germany. Should we be worried? It’s hard to say. The drop in temperature, which EPFL researchers estimate at 0.3°C, should slow the local impact of global warming. But it can also be an advantage for nearby companies that draw water from the Aar and the Rhine to cool their machinery.\nThe EPFL study, which was published in \nWater Resources Research\n, showed for the first time the impact that closing a nuclear power plant in Switzerland will have on the physics of its surrounding rivers and lakes. The researchers’ methodology could be applied to the country’s other nuclear plants.\nTaking local measurements\n “Nuclear power plants have a major impact on the surrounding environment,” says Love Råman Vinnå, the study’s lead author and a PhD student at EPFL’s Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory (APHYS). “Around 70% of the heat produced by the Mühleberg plant ends up in the Aar. The remaining 30% is turned into electricity. The plant will stop generating heat in 2019, and it’s crucial to both gauge and prepare for the effect that will have on water temperature and stratification. We know, for example, that an abrupt temperature change at the local level is a stress factor for fish, and can change the composition of plankton.”\nMeasurements at three sites\n Vinnå points in particular to the importance of taking upfront measurements at multiple sites in order to better anticipate the consequences of shutting down a nuclear plant. His study draws on two years and four months of fieldwork on Lake Biel – from May 2013 to September 2015. His team of researchers attached sensors to ropes and submerged them deep into the lake at three different spots. They took continuous measurements of several variables such as water temperature at different depths and the speed of water currents. They also obtained data on air temperature, wind and rain from MeteoSwiss, along with key information from BKW – the company that runs the Mühleberg plant – including the amount of heat given off by the plant (around 700 megawatts) and data specific to its regular summer shutdown.\n1D and 3D models\n Vinnå then took 1D and 3D theoretical models that resolve temporal changes in lake hydrodynamics – in other words, how lake temperatures and currents evolve over time – and adapted them to the Mühleberg plant. “We started out by comparing our measurements from the lake with the figures predicted by our 1D model,” says Vinnå. “This model is useful because it's fast and cheap, but it’s less accurate than the 3D model, whose output did indeed correspond closely to our field measurements. The 3D model makes more sense for complex case studies or when more accurate results are needed.”\nHe then used the models to come up with precise forecasts of how the decommissioning of the Mühleberg plant will affect Lake Biel. This plant was relatively simple to model in this way since the lake’s water is completely replaced every two months, which made the results of the 1D and 3D models fairly close to each other. The researchers predict an average 0.3°C drop in temperature throughout the lake starting in 2019 – although the 3D model's extremes suggest that certain spots will experience a drop by up to 4°C in the winter. It also turns out that temperature differences may be noticeable as far away as southern Germany, since around 150 megawatts of heat are carried 350 kilometers away from Lake Biel.\nModeling for a utility company\n Vinnå’s thesis is being backed by Biel’s utility company, Energieservice Biel/Bienne, which supplies water, gas, and electricity to residents of the city and the surrounding Seeland region. Planning to upgrade its infrastructure, the company wanted to know which parts of the lake would be cleanest and coldest after 2019. The EPFL researchers used the 1D and 3D models to present the company with a series of recommendations, visualized in the form of a map.\nVinnå continues to work on his thesis and is already preparing another article that will be of use to Energieservice Biel/Bienne. These days, he is looking at the local consequences of climate change on Lake Biel after the Mühleberg nuclear plant closes down. One thing seems certain: by cooling the waters of the lake, shutting down the power plant should postpone the local effects of climate change – at least for a while.\nThis study was co-authored by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and is part of the ETH Domain (EAWAG). \nReference", "summary": "Mühleberg is the first Swiss nuclear power plant slated for decommissioning in 2019.

{"id": 131, "text": "Is it really possible to manage the power grid of a whole town on single chip? The future of energy production will surely be a combination of several power sources, and Maher Kayal’s team from EPFL’s Electronics Laboratory (ELab) are developing a dedicated hardware that manages the network a thousand times faster than current software running on a conventional computer. The first unit of this integrated circuit has just been developed and could be deployed on the scale of a town five years from now.\n Defective power lines, problems with generators, or risks of power cuts will be handled by the chip a thousand times faster than at present. This will allow their management in close to real time, and at a lower cost than existing installations. “The problem with power grids has always been that ‘fatal moment’ when there is a sudden power failure”, emphasizes Kayal. This chip will enable the anticipation of breakdowns that could occur when the network is stretched to the limit in much greater security, efficiency and speed than software coupled with hardware not developed specifically for this purpose. This increased speed will allow for modeling of thousands of possible scenarios and anticipate failures and calculate their best solutions before they even happen.\nSmart Grids\n “Apart from the increased speed, a further advantage will be an easier use of renewable energy sources that depend on climatic conditions, and therefore are non-programmable, in comparison with nuclear energy power stations, which require advance planning”, he adds.\n This way of managing the network is in line with the concept of the “smart grid”: that is, the use of electronic technologies to optimize the production and distribution of electricity and thereby match demand and supply, ultimately reducing economical and ecological impact without even limiting energy consumption. However, Maher Kayal prefers not to put a figure on the financial savings: “Everything depends on the education, the intelligence and the psychology of the users of the network.” These factors will probably take longest to address and resolve.\n Once in production, the chip should only cost a few Swiss francs, and will have the significant advantage of being both reconfigurable and programmable according to the town, the district, or any other scale of network. The company ABB, which is financing part of the research work, has now filed a patent. This new concept of the intelligent management of energy will be unveiled on June 22 and 23, during the EPFL Middle East research days, which will bring together Swiss- and Emirates-based scientists to focus on the future of energy and sustainable development. \nOperational five years from now\nThe location of the study phase has already been found: Al Hamra, a small town close to Ras Al Khaimah, in the United Arab Emirates.

{"id": 142, "text": "What were your main sources of inspiration during the architecture competition?\nKersten Geers: \nThe circumstances surrounding this project are exceptional in several ways. First, it is a fascinating environment. The fact that it’s located on a university campus, straddling UNIL and EPFL, is also out of the ordinary. Having the Rolex Learning Center as a neighbour played a crucial role in our thinking as well.\nHow do you build something next to an emblematic structure like the Rolex Learning Center?\nK.G. : \nOur project is a response to both the RLC and Under One Roof. These two buildings are distinctive for their landscape approach, so for reasons of continuity it was out of the question to envision a towering edifice. And since the entire campus is built on gentle slopes, we too adopted a landscape approach. Our building, which will have some public spaces, is meant to be a passageway between EPFL and UNIL, via Under One Roof and the RLC – we think it may even liven up the east wing of the RLC.\nYou mention openness: will the public have access to the RTS editorial offices?\nDavid Van Severen: \nThe building will not be public, but several parts of it will be accessible, including a restaurant. It will also house a day-care centre and a multimedia library. But it's really the design itself that makes it a passageway. The editorial offices resemble a large plate – a “continuous field” – hung on four blocks. The plate floats seven metres above ground, like a canopy, protecting many possible pathways and delineating ground-level spaces, some more exposed than others. For example, there will be a large overhang under which events could be held. The public could also be involved in programmes in the main studio or other events organised by RTS.\nHow many employees will the building hold?\nK.G.: \nAt maximum capacity, 600 to 700 people will be able to work there. But the electronic media industry experiences ups and downs, by definition. Add to this the unknown ways in which this industry will evolve in 10 or 20 years – hence the need for a significant modular component. Our building is designed like a city with four clusters of activity – the blocks will house the radio and TV studios, the restaurant, the administrative offices and the media library. The editorial offices, in the plate connecting the blocks, are designed to be organised and reorganised as much as needed.

{"id": 151, "text": "Nothing in biology is static. Biological processes fluctuate over time, and if we are to put together an accurate picture of cells, tissues, organs etc., we have to take into account their temporal patterns. In fact, this effort has given rise to an entire field of study known as “chronobiology”.\nThe liver is a prime example. Everything we eat or drink is eventually processed there to separate nutrients from waste and regulate the body’s metabolic balance. In fact, the liver as a whole is extensively time-regulated, and this pattern is orchestrated by the so-called circadian clock, our body’s internal metronome, as well as biochemical signals and eating rhythms.\nBut the liver also has an intriguing “geography” as it is actually divided into small repeating units called “lobules”, in which distinct zones perform different functions. This intricate spatial organization is known as “liver zonation”. For example, the breakdown of sugars during digestion takes place preferentially on one side of the lobule, the so-called central zone, while the production of glucose while we rest from stores such as fat, occurs on the other side of the liver, at the portal side.\nSo far, liver zonation has only been studied statically, looking into what each zone does independently of time, and vice-versa. And given how central the liver is in mammalian physiology, the two research approaches have to join efforts to understand how temporal and spatial liver programs interact.\nLiver zonation patterns of E-cadherin around the portal vein and of N-cadherin around the central vein, shown by immunofluorescence (scale bar: 100 micrometers).

Naef, EPFL© 2021 EPFL\nIn a first ever study, scientists at EPFL and the Weizmann Institute of Science, led by Professors Felix Naef at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences and Shalev Itzkovitz at the Weizmann, have been able to monitor the spatial shifts of gene expression within liver lobules in relationship to the circadian clock. Studying this link is a focus of Naef’s research, which has previously uncovered connections between the circadian clock and , our , and , the tightly packaged DNA in the cell nucleus.\nThe study came out of a EPFL-Weizmann joint grant from the Rothschild Caesarea Foundation.\nBy exploiting the ability to analyze liver tissue in every individual cell, the researchers studied approximately 5000 genes in liver cells at several timepoints throughout the 24-hour day. They then statistically classified the space-time patterns they uncovered with a model that can capture both spatial and temporal variations in the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA), a marker of gene expression.\nThe study revealed that many of the liver’s genes seem to be both zonated and rhythmic, meaning that they are regulated by both their location in the liver and the time of the day. These dually regulated genes are mostly linked to key functions of the liver, e.g. the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, but also include a few genes that have never been associated with metabolism, e.g. genes related to chaperone proteins, which help other biomolecules change their 3D structure or even assemble and disassemble.\n“The work reveals a richness of space-time gene expression dynamics of the liver, and shows how compartmentalization of liver function in both space and time is hallmark of metabolic activity in the mammalian liver,” says Felix Naef.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have carried out the first comprehensive study of how genes in the liver perform their metabolic functions in both space and time of day.

{"id": 155, "text": "Despite recent advances in power grid technology, engineers still struggle to measure the carbon footprint of one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy used in Switzerland. That’s because of the many different variables that must be taken into account. The carbon footprint of the country’s energy use is currently calculated as a yearly average – even though it varies considerably throughout the day.\nEPFL researchers have now succeeded in performing a more granular calculation using a pan-European database of hourly power generation figures by country over the course of a given year (2015-2016). This breakthrough can give electricity suppliers and consumers more detailed information on how they use this important resource.\nThe EPFL study shows that the carbon footprint of electricity generated at certain times of day is up to five times higher than estimated. And that’s not all: “Thanks to this data, I know that if I charge my smartphone in the afternoon, for example, I’m more likely to draw on a renewable energy source than if I charge it in the evening,” says Didier Vuarnoz, a co-author of the study along with Thomas Jusselme – both members of Building 2050, a research group at the Smart Living Lab in Fribourg. They just published their data in the open-access journal \nData in Brief\n, so that engineers and businesses can use them freely. An initial summary of their research appeared in the 24 July 2018 issue of \nEnergy.\nNew European database\nSwitzerland makes some of its own electricity and imports and exports it with France, Germany, Austria and Italy. That makes it hard to know which country the energy used at any given time comes from. Vuarnoz and Jusselme had the idea of using the pan-European database, called the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, to ascertain this information. Launched in 2015, the database contains hourly records of the electricity flowing between European countries.\nThe researchers converted the kWh from the database into a carbon equivalent based on the entire life cycle of the electricity source (nuclear, carbon, hydraulic, etc.). Each kWh generated was assigned a certain number of carbon emissions based on whether it originates from fossil fuels or renewable energy. Then they developed a series of graphs that engineers can use to quickly see what kind of energy is consumed in Switzerland on an hourly basis over the course of a year.\nNew strategies\nHowever, the idea is not to encourage everyone to shift their energy consumption to times of the day when renewable sources predominate – as that would just transfer the problem. Rather, the goal is to develop new strategies for electricity use. Vuarnoz, Jusselme and their colleagues from the smart living lab used their data to publish an article in the August issue of \nSustainable Cities and Society\n that takes the example of a building producing some of its own energy. By walking readers through their example, they illustrate the benefits of having access to hourly energy consumption information.\n“I could program my washing machine to run in the afternoon instead of at night, for instance, if I know that my apartment building draws on solar energy in the afternoon,” says Jusselme. “An hour-by-hour view lets you know when you should use the battery-stored power at a building in order to fully leverage the carbon benefits of that energy. For example, if at night you use clean energy stored in a battery instead of power generated at a German coal-fired plant, you can shrink your carbon footprint,” adds Vuarnoz.\nThe researchers hope their method will prompt consumers and businesses to be more intelligent in when they turn on the power switch. But they still believe more efforts are needed to encourage grid operators to provide more transparent information, so that their method can be improved further.\nSwiss version\nSimilar studies were carried out in France, Belgium, Sweden, and Finland between 2013 and 2015 but using other databases. Vuarnoz and Jusselme’s method is tailored specifically to Switzerland’s intricate electricity-trading system. The next step will be to automate the process of downloading power generation and consumption data in real time, so that trends can be identified from one year to the next and engineers can make reliable carbon-footprint forecasts – much like meteorologists do with weather forecasts.\nAll this matters because if Switzerland wants to become a 2,000-watt society by 2050 and support the energy transition, its engineers need accurate, reliable methods for calculating the country’s environmental impact and implementing alternatives to fossil fuels. “Our new method promises to be highly effective in helping Switzerland meet its 2050 energy goals. And the limitations of our method highlight the important work that is still needed to better understand Switzerland’s energy-related carbon footprint,” says Jusselme.", "summary": "By developing a method for calculating the carbon footprint of energy used in Switzerland on an hourly basis rather than as a yearly average, EPFL researchers have shed important light on an otherwise obscure industry.", "claim": "By developing a method for calculating the carbon footprint of energy used in Switzerland on an a given year basis rather than as a yearly average, EPFL researchers have shed important light on an otherwise obscure industry.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [16, 18], "noise": false}

{"id": 171, "text": "Radiosurgery is a kind of radiotherapy where doctors administer a high dose of radiation to diseased tissue with extreme precision, and in one go rather than over several sessions. Used mainly to treat brain damage, this method can prevent the need for conventional surgery on patients suffering from benign tumors, vascular malformation, neuralgia and Parkinson’s disease. Radiosurgery can be performed using a device called the Gamma Knife, which is able to administer gamma rays from up to 192 different beams. The challenge is to make sure the radiation hits only the diseased tissue and none of the healthy tissue around it – while keeping the procedure as short as possible.\nThe plans for this type of surgery are usually drawn up manually; neurosurgeons work with radio-oncologists and physicians to select the number, size, shape and power of the beams to be used and map out exactly where they should be directed so that the entire treatment area is covered. How effective the plans are therefore depends largely on the doctors’ experience. To take that out of the equation, Intuitive Therapeutics set out to develop software that can calculate all of the criteria automatically. The startup began working with Professor Jean-Philippe Thiran at EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory 5 (LTS5) in 2015, and together they developed a program called IntuitivePlan, which is currently available on the market.\nUsing mathematics to improve healthcare \nIntuitivePlan uses an optimal inverse planning system whereby doctors specify the radiation dose to be applied to each area of the diseased tissue as well as the maximum dose that the surrounding tissue can be exposed to. Based on these inputs, the software generates a surgical plan that optimizes the various criteria along with a preprogrammed constraint on how long the procedure should last, so as to minimize patients’ overall exposure time. “Developing the surgical plans involves a process of combinatorial optimization that is computationally expensive by nature. The calculation method we chose is called convex optimization,” says Thiran.\nThe program uses powerful processing techniques that can generate the optimal combination in under two minutes. “It takes 20 or 30 minutes to develop a plan manually – sometimes even longer for complicated procedures,” says Professor Marc Levivier, head of neurosurgery at the CHUV and director of the CHUV’s Gamma Knife Center. Levivier is one of the world’s top Gamma Knife experts. “The software often comes up with plans that we never would have thought of ourselves, or wouldn’t have been able to map out by hand,” he says. IntuitivePlan doesn’t just save time by automating the process – it also results in better plans.\nPromising initial results\nThe engineers at Intuitive Therapeutics were able to turn their original idea into a complete software program designed specifically to meet doctors’ needs. And now that their program has obtained the CE Marking, it can be used in routine clinical procedures. Doctors at the CHUV started using the new approach in July. “I trust the program fully, but for the first few procedures I also created some surgical plans by hand, and compared them with those produced by the software. Then I selected the best option for each patient. The initial results have been very promising,” says Levivier.\nFor now IntuitivePlan is compatible only with Gamma Knife devices, but the engineers are already working on adapting their program to other kinds of radiotherapy equipment.", "summary": "Engineers at EPFL and local startup Intuitive Therapeutics have developed software that can produce optimized surgical plans for Gamma Knife radiosurgery.

On the basis of their report, the EU will make its final decision.\nWith Guardian Angels, EPFL is emerging as a key player in the future of electronics. The project involves the design of self-powered devices – according to a concept called “zero-power” – and miniaturized to an extreme to ensure the wellbeing and health of the carriers. This includes work on energy consumption and the ability to draw energy from the immediate environment, for example with solar or piezoelectric technologies. Surrounding Adrian Ionescu are not only leading European universities, but also big names in industry such as IBM, Infineon and PSA Peugeot Citroën.\nHuman Brain Project conceives of a design for a model that integrates all of our knowledge about the human brain. Ultimately, it develops a model of the human brain which will serve as a research tool for neuroscientists all over the world. The European researchers gathered around this project want to provide a solution to help us better understand the extremely complex mechanisms and pathologies of the human brain. It will also allow to develop technologies inspired by the functioning of neurons, for example in the fields of robotics and supercomputers. Among the partnering universities in Europe are the Karolinska Institute, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and the Jülich Supercomputing Center.\nDuring the first thirty months and their launch phase, the two selected projects will be funded to the tune of 54 million euros each. 2014 starts what is called the operational phase.

Now put it down on the ground in Central Park, against a rock on Mount Everest, or on your kitchen table; there will always be a point on the map that sits exactly on the actual physical place it represents. Obvious? Not for mathematicians. A more complex theorem, called a “fixed point theorem,” has eluded them since 1963. “Some ideas seem evident to the human mind, but in reality involve complicated concepts that are difficult to demonstrate mathematically,” says Nicolas Monod, head of EPFL’s Chair of Ergodic and Geometric Group Theory. It turns out that the answer was there all along, simple and elegant. To reach it, the team of mathematicians had take a different approach to the problem. Their discovery will impress their fellow mathematicians, of course; but on the longer term, it also will be of interest to physicists and economists.\nThink outside the map\nSurprisingly, this theorem works for all kinds of maps, from a diagram of a metro route to a map of spaces used in quantum physics. But to prove it, a fixed point must be found for every possible case. Since the number of possible maps is infinite, the mathematicians were looking for a universal, purely mathematical method -- one that would work in any situation.\nThe challenge for the mathematicians was to find that fixed point. It was a bit like designing a method that could pinpoint the center of gravity of any object, real or purely mathematical. It seemed like an impossible task for the specialists. “That’s why this approach hadn’t been more fully explored,” Monod explains. “It was in thinking about another space and exchanging our ideas that we realized that we actually could find that center of gravity.” It was possible to determine it in a parallel space. The center of gravity was definitely there ... but outside the space you started from. It was a counterintuitive result, but one that allowed them to prove the theorem.\nTurning the page\nIn 2008, a thirty-page article, full of technical jargon, almost arrived at a proof. Even Barry Edward Johnson, who formulated the theorem and worked hard to find a proof all the way up to his death in 2002, was ultimately unsuccessful. Today, the proof is only a few pages long. In addition to the indisputable intellectual satisfaction this elegant result represents, it also opens up long-term perspectives in other disciplines; theories in physics and economics, for example, both make use of the idea of fixed points.\nSource:\nA ﬁxed point theorem for L1 spaces\n, U.

The care he took over his architectural drawings and the importance he gave to details and perspective show his desire to fill the viewer with wonder. That provided the inspiration for EPFL’s Archives of Modern Construction to put together a retrospective of the architect’s work, comprising 103 of his drawings dating from his time as a trainee in the 1920s to the end of the 1930s, along with 13 color screen prints produced between the 1970s and the 1990s. \nThis one-off exhibition, called “La macchina delle meraviglie.

It is a rare opportunity to give international exposure to an important collection held at EPFL, and thereby to promote Switzerland’s cultural heritage beyond its borders.\nAlberto Sartoris was born in Turin in 1901 and grew up in Geneva, where he attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In the 1920s, having moved back to Turin, he took an interest in avant-garde art movements and became close to the Futurists. After helping to found the International Congresses of Modern Architecture in La Sarraz in 1928, he settled in the Lausanne region. He became one of the main architects of the Modern Movement, involved in the practice, theoretical development and promotion of modern art. \nProject for an industrial building. © Acm / EPFL\nInvention through drawing\n His undeniable graphical mastery was based on a precise philosophy inspired by humanism. For Sartoris, architectural drawings were an art form in their own right, a manifestation of an idea taking shape – they must be considered and planned with great precision before being executed. Sartoris’ drawings are thus manifestos of his thoughts, or, as he liked to say, “graphic designs intended to produce architectural inventions.” \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Sartoris’ artistic ambitions took on a new form with the production of hundreds of screen prints based on his earliest drawings. Some of these prints will be shown in the new exhibition, presenting viewers with a thought-provoking contrast with today’s standardized digital templates. \nInterno metafistico. © Acm / EPFL\nParallel events\n The EPFL exhibition will form part of the inaugural Rome Architecture Week (“Settimana del progetto di architettura nel mondo”), taking place between 10 and 18 November.

French, Colombian, Australian and Dutch banners bring color to a giant workshop where students hasten among boats with different degrees of original design and accomplishment.\nThey have set their hopes in winning the competition organized by the Hydros Company, based at EPFL’s Innovation Park. These student teams are expected to make boats that are as energy efficient and operational as possible within the limits of a certain size, with a 1200W electric motor and batteries provided by the organizer. One of the rounds requires a 200 kg load and the other only 20 kg. The boats must cover from 400 to 600 meters in a record time. A total of 12 universities have submitted their teams. The competition starts today on Lake Geneva (free access to the UNIL-EPFL Nautical Center, Lausanne, until Sunday. ).\nA \"torpedo\"... \n One of the boats representing EPFL looks like an upside-down dirigible. The boat that Felix Cazalis, Sacha Pollonghini, Jordan Holweger and colleagues will present consists of a torpedo-like structure that operates one meter below the water surface and on top of which an ultrafine hull floats. \"We imagined this configuration could work for the round that requires the boat to carry a 200 kg load,\" said Felix Cazalis. Since the ballast and the motor are located in the submerged part of the boat, this guarantees the stability of the whole structure.\n… and a flying boat \n For the light-weight category, the team had a totally different approach. This time, they devised a flying boat, a.k.a. a foiler. Remote controlled \"wings\", fixed under the keel and rudder, should allow the vessel’s hull to come out of the water since the very first propeller spins so as to reduce the water resistance to its movement and thus the energy losses.\n\"We had to grope for finding a way in which the boat could fly without rearing up or losing its lateral stability,\" said Jordan Holweger. Suffice to say that the last few weeks, which were also the end-of-year exams’, were intense. \"We still have some adjustments to make for ensuring a better stability as weather conditions may be difficult,\" he said.\nThe goal of Hydros, through this competition that aims to become an annual event, is to make young engineers face the challenges – mainly energy saving –encountered by maritime transport of goods.

{"id": 195, "text": "Swiss power utility Groupe E agreed to trigger a short circuit in its power grid so that EPFL researchers could test their revolutionary technology. Their approach uses time reversal to spot a disturbance in a grid, and it requires nothing more than a sensor coupled with an algorithm – making it potentially cheaper and more efficient than existing systems.\nThe tests were carried out on the high-voltage substation serving the city of Cressier in Fribourg Canton. A team of EPFL researchers working inside the substation connected a computer to a sensor that had been installed at a specific point in the grid. Once the connection was established, Groupe E’s operators triggered a short circuit, or more specifically a ground fault, in a section containing nearly 12km of power lines. Thanks to their algorithm, the researchers were able to pinpoint the exact spot of the short circuit in less than three minutes and determine which of the line’s three phases had been affected. “This was the first time we were able to test our technology on a full-scale power grid composed of both underground cables and overhead lines. Our results are even better than we had hoped for,” says Farhad Rachidi, the EPFL scientist co-leading the project with his colleague Mario Paolone.\nBack to the future\n Two factors underlie their method: the scientific phenomenon of time reversal, and the sophisticated equations used to model electromagnetic waves. The process takes place in several steps. First, when the short circuit occurs, an electromagnetic wave is generated along the power lines and spreads throughout the grid. It bounces off other lines from all sides and creates echo waves. When these waves hit the researcher’s sensor, the algorithm analyzes them and injects waves going in the opposite direction in a computer simulation of the grid. The simulation reconstructs the waves’ pathways until they converge at the point of the original short circuit. “Each echo we receive is a source of information,” says Paolone. “As a result, the more complex and heterogeneous a grid is, the better our algorithm works,” adds Rachidi.\nTheir highly promising – and now patented – method has sparked the interest of Groupe E and another company, Streamer. Time is of the essence when short circuits occur: they must be resolved immediately to prevent a series of outages and extended blackouts. Power utilities frequently have to send operators out in the field to repair cables damaged by lightning or frost, or to replace faulty components. And these types of grid disturbances occur often – up to once a week on Groupe E’s Fribourg grid alone.\nSeveral sensors are currently installed at strategic points across the medium-voltage grid. “We can locate a short circuit quickly if we have enough sensors in a grid,” says Frédéric Richoz from Groupe E. “Otherwise we have to turn the power off and on in various sections of the grid until we find the damaged spot – but it can take us a while to determine exactly which section of the grid contains the short circuit.”\nThe researchers’ system lets operators monitor an entire grid from a single point of measurement. And the more complicated a grid is, the better their system works. That means it’s compatible with large grids that incorporate renewable energy. “Our technology would also work in an active-passive grid that includes energy generated by individuals – like solar panels on people’s houses. That’s something that today’s conventional sensors might not be able to do,” says Reza Razzaghi, a researcher at EPFL’s Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory. “We are working on improving our algorithm so it can locate short circuits even faster, in just a few seconds,” adds Zhaoyang Wang, a PhD student at EPFL’s Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory.\nThe new technology is the result of a joint effort by two EPFL labs – the  and the  – and is described in a new book entitled \n.\n-----\nBook:", "summary": "It took EPFL researchers only three minutes to detect and locate a short circuit triggered intentionally in the power grid serving Fribourg Canton.

{"id": 201, "text": "Since 2012, engineers at EPFL’s Space Center have been hard at work on a new junk-clearing satellite to capture debris orbiting the earth. The team has now shifted up a gear, founding a company called ClearSpace to pick up where the CleanSpace One project leaves off. For the first test mission, penciled in for 2024, the company has set its sights on capturing and destroying SwissCube, a nanosatellite developed by students from EPFL and other Swiss universities and launched on 23 September 2009. Looking further ahead, the startup plans to develop a viable, cost-efficient system for cleaning up the estimated 3,000-or-so derelict satellites orbiting closest to earth.\n“We have no option but to clear space debris from Low Earth Orbit,” says ClearSpace CEO Luc Piguet. “The viability of satellite technologies, which are an increasingly important part of our lives, is at stake.”\nClearSpace’s satellite, similar in design to a drone, features a tapered net that shoots out, grabs a piece of debris and then retracts, trapping the junk in its clutches. The team’s long-term plan is to launch a platform carrying multiple satellites.\nMillions of pieces of junk\nEver since the world’s first satellite was launched in 1957, space has become increasingly cluttered with junk of all shapes and sizes – from tiny nuts and paint chips to rocket stages and satellites the size of a bus. The problem is particularly acute in Low Earth Orbit, the area between around 100 km (the edge of earth’s atmosphere) and 2,000 km above the surface of the planet. Using radar technology, scientists have so far identified and tracked some 22,000 pieces of debris bigger than 10 cm. That figure does not include smaller items, amounting to around 900,000 pieces larger than 1 cm – and around a hundred million measuring more than 1 mm. All of that fast-moving debris, flying around the planet at some 8 km per second, poses an ever-growing threat to spacecraft and crew.\nYet capturing space junk is harder than it looks. The whole process demands extreme precision, and it takes place at mind-boggling speeds. The first task – actually locating a piece of debris – is challenging enough. Take SwissCube, for instance. Scientists currently know where it is to within 5 km or so, but pinpointing its exact location requires ultra-precision detection and identification systems involving lasers. The next stage of the process – the rendezvous – is just as problematic. The satellite needs to get close enough to capture the debris without touching it, because that could cause it to quickly fly off course and out of reach. The final step is to trap the junk firmly in the net before dragging it down through earth’s atmosphere, where it will burn up. The engineers have to make sure their calculations and predictions are spot on before launching the satellite. Because once it has been released, they have no way to adjust its flight path or make repairs.\nClearSpace recently signed a collaboration agreement with EPFL, focusing largely on the question of technology transfer. The startup has also secured funding from the European Space Agency (ESA) and local authorities, and it is in talks with a number of key industry partners. The company is expected to expand quickly in the coming year, yet it is already making its mark. For one, it is the only small business – alongside some industry heavyweights – to get through the first round of an ESA tender to deorbit one of the agency’s derelict satellites.", "summary": "Engineers working on the CleanSpace One project at EPFL’s Space Center have come up with a way of capturing and destroying the space debris that has built up over 60 years of low-orbit activities.

The structure was inaugurated in Belgium’s capital on 30 May, and attendees included a number of cultural figures.\nThe region’s local government, with the support of the Centre Pompidou, plans to transform the old Citroën garage and showroom into a contemporary art and architecture museum in 2019. In response to a request from the Brussels architecture center CIVA, EPFL contributed to the makeover project by loaning HOUSE 3. The structure was assembled in the former garage showroom, a 7,200 m\n2\n space with 21-meter-high ceilings.\nHand-assembled in two weeks\nThe students who designed HOUSE 3 had to follow a number of rules set by EPFL’s ALICE architectural laboratory to enhance the learning experience. First, each room in the house needed to be designed by a separate group of students, yet all the rooms had to fit together both structurally and conceptually. In addition, the overall structure had to consist of a series of spaces that could be lived in and shared. These spaces include an entryway with a pirate radio station, hanging gardens, a breakfast room, a stage, a beach, and a balcony on the upper floor. HOUSE 3, which was prefabricated in EPFL’s workshops, was hand-assembled in the Brussels showroom by the students over the course of two weeks.\nThe Citroën garage and showroom were designed in 1934 by French architect Maurice­Jacques Ravazé together with Belgian architects Alexis Dumont and Marcel Van Goethem. The modernist building, which is considered part of the country’s cultural heritage, sits along a canal near Brussels’ historical district. It has not been used since December 2017, and the work of transforming it into a museum will begin in the spring of 2019.\nSymposium in fall\nFor the past three years, EPFL’s ALICE laboratory, led by Professor Dieter Dietz, has been giving first-year architecture students the chance to build a prototype wooden house. The students’ first structure, HOUSE 1, was set up on the EPFL campus in 2016. The following year, the next group of students built HOUSE 2 in two phases: the full structure went up in Zurich, and then a smaller version was assembled at one of French-speaking Switzerland's largest unused industrial sites, in Malley (near Lausanne).\nHOUSE 2 was nominated for the 2017 Hochparterre Award in the design category.

{"id": 209, "text": "It was supposed to work for only one year. However, it has already been five since SwissCube orbits around the Earth. Launched in 2009, the Cubesat –a satellite model designed in the form of a cube of 10 cm per side- is still in good condition. It orbits at a height of 720 km and moves at a speed of nearly 7’500 meters per second, that is: about 28’000 km per hour, making nearly 15 daily tours of the Earth.\nIndeed, the satellite’s long life marks its success. Few people would have bet on it after the realization, only hours after its launch, that it was spinning too fast. In fact, it took nearly a year before its systems could finally be exploited. Moreover, its scientific mission -to document the phenomenon of aurora- has not been fully completed. But the data it provides are still the subject of ongoing research and student work.\nSwissCube demonstrates, with its endurance and the consistency of its beeps, that some risky design choices taken before its launch turned out to be the right ones. These include the use of low cost materials that had not been yet used in space, or the fact of giving it an essentially educational purpose. Conducted over three years, from 2006 to 2009, in conjunction with several Universities of Applied Sciences, the program not only allowed 200 students to study space technology, but also to learn to take responsibility, to take into account every detail and to work as a team. Thus, in hindsight, the reliability of the SwissCube systems highlights the excellent quality of these young people’s work.\n\"It was a great adventure, gushes Muriel Richard, project leader. We were lucky to find talented and motivated students, with a great sense of humor! To see them evolve, both professionally and personally, was very rewarding. Many of them became first-rate engineers. Since they were involved from the beginning until the launch of the satellite, they acquired practical knowledge and a global vision that are well worth a 10 to 15 years’ experience in business.\"\nAs for the ex-students, they emphasize the unique and very educational opportunity offered to them, also noting a particularly good and supportive atmosphere within the team. Undoubtedly, their participation in this project has served as a springboard for their careers.\n\"SwissCube put my creativity into orbit\"\nFabien Jordan was in charge of the part relating to the generation, storage and distribution of energy on the SwissCube. At the time an Energy Systems student at Yverdon’s engineering school, he worked on the project from April 2007 up to the launch in September 2009.\n\"Having the opportunity to build a satellite from the outset was just incredible!\", he says. In addition to the warm working atmosphere, the young man also focuses on the \"managing excellence\" of the supervising team.\" Since it was a first, this experience was bound to set an example. So it pushed us to provide a very high level of quality which, as SwissCube’s longevity proves, was accomplished.\"\nBut this adventure did not only make possible to project 10 cm3 of hi-tech into space, \"it simply put my creativity into orbit,\" explains Fabien Jordan. He now runs his own company, named Else, which offers a very innovative product: the xU, a platform that facilitates the assembly of electronic subsystems for cubesat type satellites. \"The idea was born from the nights spent in EPFL’s cleanrooms seeking for solutions to assemble all systems.\" A task complicated by the highly restrictive miniaturization and weight constraints imposed by the cubesats.\n\"I learned to work with people from different disciplines\"\nDuring his final year of Microengineering at EPFL, Guillaume Röthlisberger was named responsible for the satellite’s mechanical structure. \"Even though my studies provided me with valuable technical knowledge, I really learned to work thoroughly and with people from different disciplines with this project.\" A skill he currently puts every day into practice as an engineer at a distinguished watchmaking firm.\nAmong the highlights, he mentions the journey that took him to India to take the satellite to its launch base, from where it took off six weeks later. Knowing that five years later his work is still operational and continues circling the Earth is \"extremely rewarding for me and for the SwissCube team.\"\n\"Hearing the first beep was an incredible moment\"\nNicolas Steiner was an electrical engineering student at Yverdon’s engineering school when he tackled the temperature measurement systems as well as the energy production from solar panels attached to the Cubesat. Today, he works in Nyon for Ruag, a very active company in the field of space technology.\nUndoubtedly, the fact of having learned techniques specific to space work, that is to say: the most demanding in terms of rigor and quality, gave him tools to go after the labor market. \"SwissCube also allowed us to come into contact with all the stages of a project, to approach different disciplines, to solve practical problems and to experience things directly. All this taught us to be very pragmatic and to understand each challenge in all its complexity.\"\nAnd there were also moments of laughter, sharing and friendship, which remain in the form of dinners held every year on the anniversary of the launch. Nicolas Steiner also remembers SwissCube’s first beep once in orbit. \"It was an amazing moment!

{"id": 212, "text": "The race is on to optimize solar energy’s performance. More efficient silicon photovoltaic panels, dye-sensitized solar cells, concentrated cells and thermodynamic solar plants all pursue the same goal: to produce a maximum amount of electrons from sunlight. Those electrons can then be converted into electricity to turn on lights and power your refrigerator.\nAt the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces at EPFL, led by Michael Grätzel, where scientists invented dye solar cells that mimic photosynthesis in plants, they have also developed methods for generating fuels such as hydrogen through solar water splitting. To do this, they either use photoelectrochemical cells that directly split water into hydrogen and oxygen when exposed to sunlight, or they combine electricity-generating cells with an electrolyzer that separates the water molecules.\nBy using the latter technique, Grätzel’s post-doctoral student Jingshan Luo and his colleagues were able to obtain a performance so spectacular that their achievement is being published today in the journal Science. Their device converts into hydrogen 12.3 percent of the energy diffused by the sun on perovskite absorbers – a compound that can be obtained in the laboratory from common materials, such as those used in conventional car batteries, eliminating the need for rare-earth metals in the production of usable hydrogen fuel.\nBottled sun\n This high efficiency provides stiff competition for other techniques used to convert solar energy. But this method has several advantages over others:\n \"Both the perovskite used in the cells and the nickel and iron catalysts making up the electrodes require resources that are abundant on Earth and that are also cheap,” explained Jingshan Luo. “However, our electrodes work just as well as the expensive platinum-based models customarily used.\"\n On the other hand, the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen makes its storage possible, which addresses one of the biggest disadvantages faced by renewable electricity—the requirement to use it at the time it is produced.\n\"Once you have hydrogen, you store it in a bottle and you can do with it whatever you want to, whenever you want it,\" said Michael Grätzel. Such a gas can indeed be burned – in a boiler or engine – releasing only water vapor. It can also pass into a fuel cell to generate electricity on demand. And the 12.3% conversion efficiency achieved at EPFL \"will soon get even higher,\" promised Grätzel.\nMore powerful cells\n These high efficiency values are based on a characteristic of perovskite cells: their ability to generate an open circuit voltage greater than 1 V (silicon cells stop at 0.7 V, for comparison). \n “A voltage of 1.7 V or more is required for water electrolysis to occur and to obtain exploitable gases,” explained Jingshan Luo. To get these numbers, three or more silicon cells are needed, whereas just two perovskite cells are enough. As a result, there is more efficiency with respect to the surface of the light absorbers required. “This is the first time we have been able to get hydrogen through electrolysis with only two cells!\" Luo adds.\nThe profusion of tiny bubbles escaping from the electrodes as soon as the solar cells are exposed to light say it better than words ever could: the combination of sun and water paves a promising and effervescent way for developing the energy of the future.", "summary": "Today, the journal Science published the latest development in Michael Grätzel’s laboratory at EPFL: producing hydrogen fuel from sunlight and water.

{"id": 228, "text": "Oncologists treat cancer in the most effective manner possible by adapting the treatment, but first, they must identify the specific type of tumor. The new diagnostic tool developed by the start-up Lunaphore, which is both inexpensive and easy to use, enables doctors to perform an accurate assessment of the disease in merely a few minutes. Several hours are currently required.\nThis microfluidic system also improves accuracy. At the start of clinical trials carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Pathology at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), analyses were made of 76 samples of breast tumors. The traditional method of analysis gave ambiguous results for 27 of them, against 3 with this new technology. In other cases, the analysis proved to be 100% correct.\nThe current technology requires bathing the samples in a full antibody solution for a long period of time so that the entire fabric is penetrated. In this prolonged bath, the results can be false because the antibodies may cling to the wrong place. With the microfluidic chip developed by Ata Tuna Ciftlik during his PhD at EPFL, the sample is irrigated evenly over a definite time span.\nThe device comes in the form of a chip made of glass and silicone with tiny channels 100 microns in diameter. A thin section of the tumor is placed in contact with the chip in order to be uniformly irrigated by the channels. The injected fluid is rich in specific antibodies that cling to the desired proteins. The amount of protein detected is then read via fluorescence.\nSince it uses much less reagent solution, the microfluidic system reduces costs by 50–75%, says Ata Tuna Ciftlik. The creators of this Microsystems Laboratory 2 spin-off are currently fundraising and hope to see their device on the market in 2015.

{"id": 230, "text": "Most of the research conducted at EPFL takes place deep inside a laboratory, far from the public eye – but not all of it. That’s because the EPFL campus itself is a living lab. For around two months starting on 12 October, researchers will use this living lab to test out a self-driving delivery service. The delivery van will be hard to miss – bright yellow with giant screens on the front and back and small boxes on the sides. It will follow a route from the Esplanade to the Rolex Learning Center, Estudiantines student housing complex and EPFL Innovation Park.\nThe research project – called , for Autonomously Delivered Orders from Restaurants at EPFL – is designed to explore the various aspects of self-driving technology: robotics, computer science, mechanical engineering, telecommunications and interactions with road users. It’s being coordinated jointly by the EPFL Sustainability office and the Catering, Shops and Hotels unit, and involves using self-driving electric vehicles to deliver meals and other products. The pilot test will be rolled out over several weeks.\nThe electric-powered delivery van is 1 meter wide, just under 3 meters long and 1.8 meters high. It’s equipped with over 15 sensors, 5 cameras, a touch screen and a satellite antenna that employs new technology allowing the vehicle to be continuously located. It can’t carry passengers, but can carry food and other goods in its 11 side boxes, which are locked with a code. Although the van can theoretically travel at up to 50 km/h, its speed will be capped at 6 km/h on campus and a student will always accompany it. The electric vehicle was designed by Chinese firm Neolix and has been made available for the pilot test by Swiss Post, the delivery experts.\nA pilot test in three phases \nThe pilot test is scheduled to take place in three phases. The first will last around two weeks, during which the operators will familiarize themselves with the vehicle and the EPFL community will be informed about this newcomer to campus. The van will operate under its regular self-driving conditions on a route programmed into its navigation system; the route will span the Esplanade, Rolex Learning Center, Starling hotel and the Estudiantines. Stops with informative billboards have been set up at the planned delivery and presentation points. Members of the EPFL community will be able to learn more about this new service at these points from Monday to Thursday from 11am to 1pm, when they will be able to play a guessing game to win small prizes.\nThe second phase will also last two weeks and will entail delivering meals to a test group of users. The van will pick up meals independently (but with a student closeby) at the Takinoa restaurant in the Rolex Learning Center and deliver them to the Esplanade, Starling hotel, Estudiantines and Innovation Park. Users can select a delivery time and place, and when the van is around 300 meters from the stop, it will send a text message containing the code for opening the box where the meal is stored. Another text message will be sent out when the van arrives at the stop. Users can put their dirty dishes from the previous day back in the box. This phase is intended to test out the technical components of the service (e.g., the systems for managing orders, pick-up and delivery locations, and delivery times) and evaluate the overall user experience.\nA pioneering venture \nIf the first two phases go well, the service will be expanded in the third phase to the entire EPFL community, and may include other products besides food. “Our campus is a genuine living lab, and we wanted to use that opportunity to test out a novel transportation and delivery system while promoting healthier, locally sourced food, in association with our project partner,” says Luca Fontana, who is managing the EPFL Sustainability office’s role in the initiative. Other research teams may join the venture (from EPFL or another research institution) to test out related technology such as for optimizing the van’s trajectory, enhancing the security of data transfer, analyzing images or promoting the acceptance of autonomous systems.\nHowever, it’s still early days and challenges remain.

{"id": 242, "text": "The holy grail for both virtual and augmented reality is to produce objects and lighting conditions exactly as they would appear in the physical world, ray by ray. EPFL startup CREAL has moved one step closer to this goal with a disruptive piece of tech that is arousing strong interest. Instead of superimposing two flat images to create an artificial 3D effect, the device projects images in a similar way to a hologram and provides multidirectional light that is almost indistinguishable from real-world conditions. The firm raised 7.3 million Swiss francs in funding late last year, and its prototypes have caught the eye of some major players in this sector.\nExisting virtual- and augmented-reality headsets are known to cause a feeling of nausea in some users. This is because of the way they create virtual objects: the system sets a fixed focal distance and the image is given depth by a programmed 3D effect. Devices at the more advanced end of the market use eye-tracking technology to adjust focus. But even this method does not get around the problem of accommodation, or the process by which the eye naturally adjusts as the distance to an object varies – so that closer objects appear sharper than distant ones, for instance. This phenomenon occurs when we try to focus on an object at different distances with one eye closed: bring it closer and the background becomes blurred, move it away and the foreground loses sharpness. In the real world, accommodation works in tandem with another natural process known as vergence, whereby our eyes superimpose two 2D images to create a 3D picture. But once we put on a headset, the harmony between these two processes is broken. It is this discord that causes us to feel nauseous.\nUltra-realistic light\nCREAL founder and CEO Tomas Sluka has developed a disruptive technology that solves the eye strain typically caused by headsets. His invention dramatically improves the light field, which is considered a missing key to comfortable smart eyewear because the quantity of light traveling in all directions – including reflected light – is vital to producing a realistic lighting effect. CREAL’s new technology generates a sort of simplified hologram that brings real-life detail and depth to virtual scenes, with the light and color of each pixel changing according to the angle of view. This breakthrough resolves the disconnect between accommodation and vergence, allowing the wearer’s eye to function normally and eliminating the sense of nausea.\nContinuous depth resolution\nSluka is keen to maintain his firm’s competitive edge and is naturally keeping his cards close to his chest. “Our light field technology produces a more realistic effect than any other system,” he explains. “It can support hundreds of depth resolutions, from zero to infinite. The resolutions are distributed gradually, with more closer to the eye and fewer further away.” In fact, the technology is so powerful that people who normally wear corrective glasses can use it without them.\nAlthough the functional prototypes are quite bulky and the firm still has some technical challenges to overcome, Sluka is confident that his system will find its way into augmented reality goggles at some point in 2021. CREAL has recently taken on 14 new hires and is ready to shift up a gear after raising 7.3 million Swiss francs late last year, including 4.3 million francs from investors, a 2.5-million-franc grant from the European Innovation Council’s deep-tech champions program, and a 500,000-franc loan from the Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). Sluka believes that, a decade from now, we will all be wearing augmented reality goggles. If he is right, then the market for his firm’s technology – which he plans to make available under a license model – could be enormous.", "summary": "EPFL startup CREAL has developed a new technology that brings real-life detail and depth to the virtual world.

{"id": 243, "text": "On Sunday, 19 March, the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) reached Cape Town, South Africa. This marked the end of its trek around the southernmost continent, which began in this same port on 20 December 2016. The expedition was organized by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) and carried by the \nAkademik Treshnikov\n, a Russian research ship. By the end of the three-month voyage, a total of some 150 researchers had carried out 22 projects, selected from 93 proposals.\nThe overall aim of the projects, which covered fields such as oceanography, climatology and biology, was to learn more about the Southern Ocean. This will help scientists predict how the climate will change in the coming years. The Antarctic region is crucial to the planet’s health for a number of reasons. First, it serves as a major carbon sink. And in addition to influencing weather conditions in the southern hemisphere, the Antarctic continent plays a key role in how the oceans circulate around the world.\n“This expedition is a first in several respects,” explained David Walton, the chief scientist on board. “Until now, no one had ever gathered data over an entire season on one expedition or simultaneously conducted land, ocean and atmospheric research. Taken together, these projects will give us a fuller picture of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.”\nLand and ocean research\n The researchers looked at a wide range of issues in their effort to identify the effects of climate change. For example, data on how air particles form (aerosols) will be used to study the interaction of the ocean and atmosphere in new ways. And the water-column readings that were taken regularly throughout the expedition will provide researchers with detailed information on chemical changes in the ocean, including salinity levels and whether certain metals are present in the water.\nSamples gathered during stops on a number of Sub-Antarctic islands – Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, Balleny, Scott, Peter I, Diego Ramirez, South Georgia, South Sandwich and Bouvet – will provide key insights into how plant and animal life there evolves and adapts to extreme environments. And data collected by sonars capable of detecting distant sounds will be used to estimate the blue whale population. The sonars showed that the ship was never far from these creatures.\nOther researchers observed the effect of waves on ice formation and the shape of island coastlines. This had never before been looked at in depth and will teach us more about the interplay between the islands and the ocean. Ice samples taken on the islands and on the mainland will enlighten us with valuable details on our climate’s history. And samples of phytoplankton, which are at the bottom of the food chain, will show how the various regions react to ocean warming.\nThe ubiquity of microplastics, even in the most remote locations, was a troubling discovery. “There was little in the way of plastic shards, but we found synthetic fibers – mainly the result of washing clothes – at all the sites we visited,” said Peter Ryan, the researcher in charge of this project. It is not yet known how this type of pollution will affect the food chain or, more specifically, large sea birds, which were also observed and counted during the expedition.\nAn ambitious international project\n The expedition provided an opportunity for researchers from 18 different countries to work together. They broke down cultural barriers and worked across fields in their quest for significant new knowledge. Their task was made easier by generally mild weather.\n“Running so many projects was very ambitious, and it wasn’t always easy to meet everyone’s needs,” said Frederik Paulsen, philanthropist, polar explorer, and the chairman of ACE Foundation. “Overall, it was a great success. But things are really only getting started: we have years of work ahead of us to analyze all the data that was collected.”\nThe researchers have two years to publish their findings. The data will then be made available to the wider scientific community. But several events are planned before then. A symposium on polar issues will be held in Crans-Montana, Switzerland on 11 and 12 September, and the project leaders have a follow-up meeting planned for the spring of 2018.", "summary": "The Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) reached Cape Town on Sunday, 19 March, completing its three-month voyage around the great white continent.

Now I’d like to go on other expeditions, in either the Arctic or the Antarctic,” says Jocelyn Roth. “After this amazing trip, I’m sure I want to work in oceanography,” adds Amélie Séchaud. Roth and Séchaud, both Master’s students at EPFL, joined around 20 other Swiss university students for an unforgettable summer that could prove to be a boon for their careers. They flew to northern Russia in July and then boarded a polar expedition ship, the \nProfessor Molchanov,\n for three weeks of research in the Arctic Ocean, less than 1,000 kilometers from the North Pole.\nThe students – who came from EPFL, the University of Lausanne and the University of Geneva – were joined by Russian scientists in the “Arctic Floating University”. This research project was a joint initiative among the three Swiss schools as well as the Northern (Arctic) Federal University and the Geneva Global program.\nSix EPFL students were on board the Professor Molchanov, from left to right: Solange Leblois, Jocelyn Roth, Amélie Séchaud, Mélanie Gaillet-Tournier, Alexia Rousseau, Eric Sauvageat. ©A. Rousseau\n“The idea behind this expedition was to give students an international experience and an opportunity to learn more about this part of the world and its culture,” says Eric Hoesli, an EPFL professor and expert in Russia, and one of the expedition organizers. The main goal of the project was to study the effects of climate change in this particularly vulnerable part of the world. The students were divided into two groups: one was based at a research station on Samoylov Island in the Lena River delta, and the other worked on the ship.\nBringing together several disciplines\nThe EPFL students carried out the research as part of a Minor in Science, Technology and Area Studies (STAS) at the College of Humanities. It was the culmination of two semesters of courses on Russia and on the environmental challenges specific to the Arctic region. Whether on the ship or at the research station, the students performed their own research or took and analyzed samples for the Russian scientists. Every morning they also took classes spanning a wide range of disciplines such as geopolitics, international law, geography, social science, meteorology, oceanography, biology, geology, glaciology, ornithology and zoology.\n“We learned a lot of different things, some more theoretical and some more practical, like how to use certain kinds of instruments,” says Séchaud, who is studying environmental engineering. “It was really interesting,” adds Roth, who is studying biotechnology and chemical engineering. “Not only did the classes give us a multi-faceted understanding of this region, but being able to talk with the different people on the project – the Russian scientists and students from other schools – was a great opportunity.”\nThe first polar albatross\nThe expedition also led to a number of scientific discoveries, especially in geology and ornithology. One student, while carrying out field observations, photographed an albatross – which could very well be the first of its species seen north of the Arctic Circle. Some soil samples taken by pedology researchers in Franz Josef Land seem to indicate a sharp increase in organic matter below the earth’s surface, which points to a change in soil type from polar desert to tundra. And the zoology experts saw a species of mosquito never before observed at those latitudes. Such findings, if confirmed, could be tangible signs of climate change in this part of the Arctic.\nEPFL students looked specifically at CO\n2\n transfer between the air and seawater. Roth and Séchaud were also involved in a research project that measured the mass of zooplankton between the city of Arkhangelsk and Franz Josef Land. “Physiochemical changes have a direct impact on the aquatic food chain. Zooplankton is second-lowest on the chain and therefore plays an important role. Any alteration in its amount or diversity could have ramifications along the entire chain,” says Roth.\nAmélie Séchaud and Jocelyn Roth working on zooplancton data. \nIn light of the success of this expedition, a second one is planned for 2018 – providing another cohort of students a unique opportunity to perform research in this particularly remote part of the world.\nThis article was carried out in cooperation with with Garance Aymon, Jeremy Stanning and Luca Serafin, University of Geneva.", "summary": "Twenty-three students from EPFL, the University of Lausanne and the University of Geneva recently spent three weeks in the Arctic Ocean, off the coast of Russia, studying the effects of climate change.

{"id": 258, "text": "Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, after cataracts. It is characterized by the presence of too much liquidbetween the cornea and the iris. This leads to a build-up of pressure within the eye, a situation that can destroy the optic nerve if it is not handled correctly.\nProfessor Nikos Stergiopulos's team at the EPFL's Laboratory of Hemodynamics and Cardiovascular Technology (LHTC) has developed an adjustable implantable \"micro-tap\" that can drain surplus fluid in the eye. Clinical trials on this glaucoma drainage device should be starting before the end of the year and will be coordinated by Rheon Medical, an EPFL start-up. In addition to Prof. Stergiopulos, the project team is composed of LHTC members Stéphane Bigler, Adan Villamarin and Sylvain Roy.\nThe problems with current technology\t\n In a healthy human eye, a fluid known as the \"aqueous humor\" is continuously being produced at the ciliary body level in the anterior chamber which is situated between the iris and the cornea. The aqueous humor is then naturally drained out through fibrous tissue called the trabecular meshwork, which functions as a filter. In people with glaucoma, the filter becomes more resistant. The aqueous humor therefore can no longer drain as it should, and intraocular pressure increases. \"Glaucoma patients are at risk of losing peripheral vision initially, and ultimately of becoming completely blind,\" says Professor Stergiopulos.\nThere are several different approaches to lowering intraocular pressure. 90% of the time medicated eye drops are enough. For more serious cases, however, a tiny drain must be implanted in the affected eye through surgery to allow the liquid to flow out. However, there is a problem with the current drains: their diameter can't be adjusted. This means that sometimes the patient's intraocular pressure will shift from too high (ocular hypertony) to too low (ocular hypotony), which leads to post-operative complications. Often, a second operation is required.\nMagnetic disk\tand silicon tube\n Nikos Stergiopoulos and his team conceived of an entirely new type of mechanism to solve the pressure variation problems. The device contains a magnetic disk surrounded by a silicon tube that is designed to rotate around an eccentric axis. When the disk rotates it compresses the tube, to a greater or lesser extent. In this way the flow rate through the tube can be adjusted. \"There was no way of fitting electronics and motor-based devices into the space we had,\" says Professor Stergiopulos, \"so we invented a ½-millimeter thick device that functions like a tiny faucet.\"\nA simple \"pen-tool\" for pressure adjustments\t\n The prototype is called the Glafkos, which is the name of a river in Greece. It can be adjusted remotely with a small tool that is about the size of a pen with an embedded compass. To \"read\" the implant position and change the flow rate all one needs to do is to bring the \"pen-tool\" near to the implant and move it around. This makes the disk spin, changing the flow rate. \"Adjustments take only a few seconds. Clinicians are thus able to calibrate the implant and measure changes in pressure in real time and non-invasively, \"says the scientist.\nGlaucoma: an increasingly common medical condition\n If it works, the new technology could eliminate post-operative complications. But that is only part of the potential payoff for glaucoma patients: \"Since the device is smaller than current models, it might be possible to avoid cornea transplants in some patients who currently require them because their implants are larger,\" says Dr. André Mermoud, head of the Glaucoma Center at the Montchoisi Clinic in Lausanne.\nFor the moment, the device has been successfully tested only on rabbits. The next step is human clinical trials. The CHUV -Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudoisand- ethics Committee and SwissMedic should green-light this testing before the end of the year. \n Glaucoma currently affects 1-2% of people in Switzerland, mostly older people. This prevalence rate could well rise in the coming years as the population ages. \"In addition,\" says Dr. Mermoud, \"on a world-wide scale there are a great number of people who could benefit from this new technology.\"", "summary": "A tiny, EPFL-designed implantable device that can be positioned within the eye and controlled remotely may well revolutionize the treatment of glaucoma.

The remarkable vehicle, dubbed VISION AVTR and inspired by the film Avatar, is designed to showcase the interaction between humans, technology and nature. It features bodywork parts that move as the driver signals, accelerates, brakes and performs other operations. The car was unveiled for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2020, the world’s largest consumer tech show, which opens today.\nThe origami-inspired robot, which folds and unfolds in an instant, can perform multiple movements in next to no time. Designers at Mercedes-Benz were impressed by its maneuverability and ease of installation. The ultralight device goes from flat – less than two millimeters thick – to a three-dimensional moving plate in a fraction of a second. The eye-catching design adds to the effect.\nBut the tiny robot’s leading feature is the way it is manufactured, through a combination of thin layers of composite materials, each cut to exactly the right size, that make it particularly stable and solid. This layer-by-layer process means that the system can be configured to different sizes. What’s more, there are no restrictions on the shape or design of the topmost, visible layer, allowing for boundless creativity.\nA repurposed tactile joystick\nThe robot is a new version of a fold-up tactile joystick that Foldaway Haptics began developing in 2017, drawing on research conducted at EPFL’s Reconfigurable Robotics Lab (RRL) and supported by the NCCR robotics. The joystick’s force feedback function brings a sense of touch to mobile devices. “With force feedback, you can feel the texture of an item of clothing before you buy it online, or feel how much an object weighs when you’re playing a video game,” says Marco Salerno, who co-founded Foldaway Haptics with Stefano Mintchev. Mercedes-Benz reached out to the two entrepreneurs last spring, asking them to develop a version for a new concept car. They quickly accepted the challenge, repurposing the little fold-up joystick and stripping it of its haptic function. Salerno and Mintchev then headed to Mercedes-Benz’s head office in Germany, where they ran a series of tests and explained the ins and outs of their technology to the firm’s engineers.\nThe new robots – the result of several months of design and development work – also have applications in advertising and other visual media, where they can create moving images for branding or color effects.", "summary": "Yesterday evening, tiny robots developed by EPFL spin-off Foldaway Haptics were the center of attention at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

At the intersection of art, science and ritual practice, the exhibition opens up new perspectives for our embodied engagement with intangible cultural heritage.\nKung Fu Motion\n is part of a major research initiative between Switzerland and Hong Kong. It is an ongoing collaboration between the Laboratory for Experimental Museology + (eM+) at the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)'s Digital Humanities Institute, the International Goushu Association, and City University of Hong Kong.\nHong Kong is an extraordinary reservoir of intangible heritage. From the early to mid 20\nth\n century Hong Kong provided refuge to teeming thousands of immigrants from Mainland China, and among them were some of the most prominent martial artists in the world. With globalisation, urbanisation and dwindling number of practitioners, this living heritage made internationally so famous by Jackie Chan and Hong Kong cinema, is now in danger of becoming lost.\n“\nKung Fu Motion\n examines strategies for encoding, retrieving and re-enacting this intangible heritage in ways that allow these archives to be ‘alive’ in the present”, says Professor Sarah Kenderdine, Director of eM+ and ArtLab.\nThe source of the exhibition is the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive, which currently contains 19 kung fu styles and 130 motion capture data sets. These are \ntaolu\n, pre-arranged movement sequences used for learning, practicing and performing traditional martial arts.\nExhibition as experiment\n“The exhibition brings historical materials together with creative visualisations derived from advanced documentation processes including motion capture, high speed, drone-based and panoramic video,” says Kenderdine. “Archival materials are re-interpreted through motion-over-time analytics and 3D reconstruction and, re-performed through the mediums of augmented and virtual reality and media art. This living archive utilises new immersive and interactive display paradigms to perpetuate the performances of kung fu masters for future generations.”\nKung Fu Motion\n is exploring the ‘future museum’ and is designed to spark the imagination of diverse audiences: students, designers and creators of virtual reality and future cinema technologies, families and children learning martial arts, sports scientists, scholars of cultural heritage and new museology and, all those interested in the Chinese culture.\nIntersecting digital humanities\nThe digital humanities bring contemporary scientific practice into a dialogue with the most pressing cultural and societal concerns, thereby providing new tools to broaden our understanding. Digital humanities renew and reconfigure access to a multiplicity of cultural data, unleashing its potential for artists, humanists and scientists. As we enter the ‘post digital’ age, the former boundaries between art and science will actually dissolve into symbiosis.

{"id": 269, "text": "Raymond Bradley has seen his share of political intimidation. Several years after he co-authored  corroborating the hypothesis that global warming was caused by human carbon dioxide emissions, he was shoved into the limelight by politicians attempting to intimidate him and tarnish his reputation. Thankfully, he escaped unscathed and without losing his resolve to pursue his research into the causes of past and present climate fluctuations. On Tuesday, March 26, Bradley was invited to speak at EPFL by the . We met him for an interview.\nSeveral years ago, you were quite prominently confronted with high-profile climate change deniers. How do you deal with climate change skeptics today? \nI used to engage with them a lot, but I've given up because it’s a waste of time. There are a small percentage of people who will never be convinced, because they are philosophically unwilling to look at the same facts and see the same thing. Now I spend my time convincing the reasonable people in the middle who are concerned. I'm not going to waste my time with people who think they know better than I do. In the US, surveys have been done about people's understanding of climate change. They divided the population into Democrats, Republicans and members of the Tea Party. The Tea Party responders said they already had enough information to form their opinion. If you asked them whether they would like to know more, they said that they had all the information they needed...\nWhat is the main message that you would like to transmit to those that are willing to listen? \nI gave my talk the title “The Fierce Urgency of Now,” a phrase coined by Martin Luther King, about the urgent need for civil rights in the 1960s. I believe that in terms of the environmental problems that the world faces, we are under similar pressure and we need to act now. We cannot wait. But the real problems are not scientific or technological - they are political. We are confronted with environmental issues, the way in which the growth of the human population and consumption have impacted various aspects of the earth, ranging from the atmosphere to the realm of snow and ice, all the way to the acidity of the oceans. We have a good understanding of these issues, and we have a number of technological and scientific solutions. But we don't have any people with leadership. Or if they have leadership, they are stymied in the position that they are in.\nYou'd like to see the US take a leadership role in tackling climate change? \nIt has to. First of all, the US is responsible for much of the atmospheric pollution on a global scale, and we have much of the technology that can help resolve the problem. A lot of countries look to the US to lead. Many people say that Barak Obama is the leader of the free world, whatever that means. So he needs to be the leader of the environmental movement too.\nYour presentation is a call for immediate action. How long before we cross a threshold where change becomes irreversible? \nOh, I think we have already crossed a threshold to some extent. The warming that we have built into the system is already going to happen. The EU target of two to three degrees Celsius is happening - it can't be fixed. That means sea levels are going to rise, in a sort of relentless change. We’ve already made these commitments, so now we have to anticipate the changes and adapt. At the same time, we have to do our best to limit further damage.\nOn a political level, should we expect change to come from the government?\nIn the US, it is very much a bottom up movement. Individuals, small towns, and larger communities all have their climate action plans that focus on recycling, saving energy, and so on. Certain states such as Massachusetts and California are leaders in green energy strategies. Others have become leaders in wind energy. Ironically Texas is one of them, because in rural communities farmers can put up windmills and still farm, making money both ways. That bottom up movement will have an impact, because one thing industry hates is a patchwork of regulations. They don't want different states to have different standards. So at some point, the industry will put pressure on the political system requesting a national standard.\nIs that enough to rein in CO2 emissions? \nI'm a technological optimist. Just look at what is happening at EPFL, at the University of Massachusetts and elsewhere. People are working on all sorts of amazing ideas to create cars with a better gas mileage and new ways of generating solar power. I built a house five years ago and put six solar panels on my roof. Each one could generate 180 watts. If I did that today, each panel would generate around 320 watts. That's just in five years. Who knows what will happen in ten years - maybe it will be a kilowatt. The pace of technological change is amazing. In that sense, it is almost unimaginable what our energy picture will look like twenty years from now. It looks bleak now, but we have a lot of possibilities.\nSo you don’t think that it will take a change in consumption behavior? \nNo, I do think that consumption behavior is changing. For example, when you encourage people to have solar panels on their house, you empower them to think about energy use, whereas before, they just flicked a switch. And when people suddenly start making their own electricity, it encourages them to become more conscious about how they use it.\nWhat will it take to persuade people that the climate is changing?\nI think people are beginning to see that the climate is changing. There are consequences that are already pretty devastating. If you look at the Munich RE or Swiss RE reports, they see it in their bottom line - and they are not wild-eyed environmentalists, they’re businessmen. They can see that they have problem that is costing them money, and individuals can see that too. There have been a number of pretty disastrous weather events that I would not ascribe into global warming, but when these things happen frequently in places that haven’t experienced them, the general public is ahead of the scientific community. They’ve already connected the dots. They know, this isn’t right, something is happening. I think that that is how people are persuaded.\nWhat other tools are there to increase public awareness?\nOn an international level, I would say that the availability of mobile phones is a huge opportunity. Here's my thinking. For a long time, people in many countries had no voice. They were choking on pollution, but they had no way of developing a movement. We saw it with the Arab Spring. Suddenly they were able to connect with Facebook and Twitter and other mobile applications. So with six billion cell phones on the planet, people have a voice that they didn't have ten years ago, and that means that they can see not only what is happening in their own communities, but they can connect with other people. That changes everything. I think it’s a revolution.\nSo you are quite optimistic. \nYou've got to be optimistic. We have a lot of problems, but I think there is room for hope. We can't give up, and we have to keep up the pressure. We can't be the generation that screws it all up.", "summary": "Raymond Bradley is a distinguished climatologist who has travelled the globe to study climate and climate change for over four decades.

Maurice was a great man who led a very full and inspirational life,” said Martin Vetterli with great sadness. \nIt is thanks to Maurice’s tireless efforts that the school became a federal institute. When he was appointed director of what was then EPUL, he was asked by Vaud State Councillor Pierre Oguey what his strategy would be. His reply left the politician skeptical: “All I can say is that I’ll do everything in my power to turn EPUL into a federal institute.”\nWhen he took over as director of EPUL in 1963, Maurice began realizing his vision of turning the school into a federal institute, much like ETH Zurich. With support from Vaud State Councillor Jean-Pierre Pradervand and Federal Councillor Hans-Peter Tschud, he was the driving force behind the school’s transformation into the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). In 1969 he became the school’s first president, a position he held until 1978.\nBack in May of this year, during an official photo session, Maurice reminisced about the first loan he had to request for the school, in order to build sports facilities. “It wasn’t easy. The politicians didn’t understand why sports facilities took precedence over teaching and research. We had to explain to them that young people needed to stay active. They eventually got it.” There was not even a hint of bragging in his words: he was a very modest, generous and down-to-earth man.\nIt was in 1977, during Maurice’s tenure as president, that EPFL left the city center for its current campus in order to make room for a growing number of departments: mathematics in 1969, materials science in 1974 and microengineering in 1978.\nThroughout his retirement, Maurice Cosandey remained a regular visitor to the campus and always stayed up to date on the latest developments at the school. This past October – just like every year – he attended the Magistrale, the school’s graduation ceremony.\nEPFL sends its sincerest condolences to Maurice’s friends and family.\nA career devoted to science\n Maurice Cosandey’s family was from Sassel, in the northern Vaud region of La Broye, but he was born in Lausanne. He went to the local scientific high school and then studied at Lausanne's polytechnic school, graduating with a degree in civil engineering in 1940. In 1944, he was hired by Zwahlen & Mayr, a metallic construction company, where he worked for 20 years. In 1963, he was appointed president of the Lausanne University Polytechnic School (EPUL), where he had been teaching as a professor of metallic and wood construction for the previous 12 years. Cosandey was the driving force behind the school’s transformation from a cantonal to a federal institute, as EPUL became EPFL on 1 January 1969. Also during his tenure, the campus was moved from the center of Lausanne to its current site in 1977, and several fields of study were added: mathematics (1969), materials science (1974) and microengineering (1978). When Cosandey left EPFL, it was to become the president of the ETH Board, a position he held from 1978 to 1987.", "summary": "Maurice Cosandey, EPFL’s founder and its president from 1963 to 1978, died on Tuesday in his 101st year.

{"id": 283, "text": "In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  who uncovered the molecular mechanisms that control the circadian rhythm, otherwise known as the “wake-sleep” cycle. To carry out their work, the scientists used the common fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster\n, making this the sixth Nobel to be awarded to research involving it.\nFruitful fruit flies\nLife scientists have been using \nDrosophila\n for over a century now. First proposed by entomologist Charles W. Woodworth as a model organism, its use in research was pioneered by geneticist Thomas H. Morgan who ran his famous Fly Room at Columbia University in the early 1900’s.\nSharing around 60% of human DNA, the humble insect has been the linchpin of countless scientific discoveries, from genetic inheritance and gene mutation to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.\nCircadian rhythms \nDrosophila\n has also been used extensively in the study of the circadian rhythm, a process shared by virtually all living organisms, including animals, plants, and even microbes. Apart from sleeping and waking, it affects multiple aspects of our bodies, including hormone release, eating and digestion, as well as body temperature.\nIn fact, the study of circadian rhythms has grown into its own field: chronobiology. And given that a person’s circadian rhythm seems to dictate when certain drugs must be taken in order to maximize their effects, a new branch of medicine has also emerged recently: chronopharmacology.\nGene rhythms\nNow, scientists led by Maria Litovchenko and Bart Deplancke at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences have carried out an extensive study using \nDrosophila\n to study how different genes in various tissues of the animal are regulated so that they “know” when to turn on and off during the course of a day, i.e. in function of the circadian clock. “We wanted to assess how these molecular rhythms vary in a natural fruit fly population and how they are affected by genomic variation,” adds Deplancke. The study is .\nThe scientists turned to a fly resource called the , which contains more than 200 genetically distinct lines of the insect. Each line’s genome has been fully sequenced so that scientists can spot differences between genotypes and then connect them to differences between phenotypes, thereby linking genes to their functions.\nFrom the DGRP, the scientists sampled more than 700 tissue-specific “transcriptomes”. In an organism or a tissue or just a cell, genes are decoded or “transcribed” into mRNA, which is then used to put together a protein. So a transcriptome is essentially a set of all RNA transcripts from an organism’s DNA, coding or non-coding.\nIn this study, the scientists used the mRNA from a reference, “control”, fly strain and then sampled the mRNA from 141 individual DGRP lines at high resolution – at about nine-minute intervals between each line. The idea behind this was to see how the gene transcripts changed over time in different lines, and get a handle on how the fruit fly’s genetic background and circadian rhythm together affect the expression of different genes in distinct tissues.\n“It allowed us to generate the first tissue-specific reference circadian gene expression time series in \nDrosophila\n; a comprehensive circadian gene-expression atlas,” says Litovchenko. “But it also let us gain unprecedented insights into the extent and genome-wide nature of circadian gene expression variation using an innovative approach that allowed the reconstruction of dynamic cycling patterns from statically collected samples.”\nThe study revealed three major points about the circadian rhythm.\nThe Clock reigns supreme\nFirst, the scientists detected more than 1700 genes whose expression cycles under the control of the circadian clock, with only fourteen of those genes being the same across all tissues in the fruit fly.\n“At least two of these fourteen were so far uncharacterized and significantly impact several locomotor activity rhythms parameters,” says Litovchenko, referring to the fruit fly’s behavioral patterns that depend on its circadian clock. “Since these genes have orthologs (similar genes) in mice, baboons, and humans, our findings strongly suggest that they are novel, core clock-regulators in mammals as well,” she adds.\nMorning person or night owl?\nSecond, that each individual may have its own circadian rhythm, which may explain the large range of human behaviors, such as morning people, nappers, evening people, night owls etc. The researchers used a state-of-the-art statistical approach to work out the natural circadian rhythm for every tissue in every DGRP fruit fly transcriptome.\nMorning person or night owl?\nWhat they found was that the physiological clock in about a third of \nDrosophila\n lines significantly deviates from the “natural” time by more than three hours. And most of the lines showed a circadian expression variation only in one or two tissues.\n“Humans may also be impacted by such extensive variation,” says Deplancke. “There seems to be an abundant, natural circadian asynchrony in molecular circadian rhythms between various tissues, which has to our knowledge not been observed before and which may have all kinds of physiological consequences in metabolic patterns, digestive fluctuations etc.”\nLight, dark, and a mutation\nFinally, that a small genetic mutation can disrupt an individual’s “photoentrainment”, which refers to the aligning of the circadian rhythm to the pattern of light and dark in its environment.\nFocusing on a \nDrosophila\n line with the highest unaligned circadian rhythm (more than 10 hours), the researchers found that it contains a novel, loss-of-function deletion in the \nDrosophila\n clock- and light-regulated gene “\ncry\n” (for “\ncryptochrome\n”).\n“This small deletion disrupts the light-driven FAD cofactor photoreduction,” says Deplancke. “It confirms \nin vivo\n the importance of the evolutionary conserved photo-entrainment mechanism in the circadian pacemaker.”\nFrom fly to human\nThe study also reconfirmed that \nDrosophila\n is an excellent model for studying the circadian rhythm in humans, as it identified several new core clock genes that the two species share. “We have gained unique insights as to what extent the circadian clock is molecularly variable not only between individuals, but even between tissues of the same individual,” says Deplancke.\n“Obviously, we will never be able to achieve such insights in humans, as we cannot sample human tissues across 24 hours,” he adds. “But what we learned is that this variation is very extensive. Given the increasing importance of chronopharmacology, it may be good to infer the innate circadian cycle of individuals before starting important drug treatments.”\nOther contributors\nSwiss Institute of Bioinformatics\nBrandeis University", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have made breakthrough discoveries on the circadian clock and how it affects gene expression.

{"id": 284, "text": "On 14 June, a group of around 300 people gathered under the curves of the Rolex Learning Center at 11am for the women’s strike. They were responding to the call to strike issued by the UNIL-EPFL collective, which is made up of female students and staff members.\nThe event kicked off when the collective read out the \n it had prepared – a list of demands that include equal pay, recognition of the work involved in raising children, and eliminating gender violence. The group handed their manifesto over to Senior Management, which was represented by Caroline Kuyper, the Vice President for Finances, and Andreas Mortensen, the Vice President for Research. Caroline Kuyper then spoke, thanking the strikers for their action and their demands, which “are in line with initiatives that Senior Management is working on in order to make further progress towards equal opportunity on our campus.”\nThe collective then asked the demonstrators to sign the manifesto, before inviting them to a picnic lunch. At 3pm, the EPFL and UNIL strikers gathered again and headed to Lausanne to join a march in the center of town.\nAn event designed to spur change \n“The 1991 strike turned out to be an effective catalyst for improving women’s opportunities and working conditions in Switzerland. I hope this year’s strike will have the same positive effect,” says Helene Füger, who heads up EPFL’s Equal Opportunities Office. “Our School has made a considerable amount of progress, even though we still have a ways to go. But I find people are really motivated, which is extremely important.”\nBuilding awareness about gender bias \nOne of the steps taken at EPFL has been to encourage gender equality in hiring. The School started offering seminars in late 2017 to help people identify their own gender biases when evaluating candidates. The first to take these seminars were the members of Senior Management, the school deans and the heads of EPFL’s research institutes. Participants go through various exercises illustrating how the prejudices and stereotypes that they hold unconsciously influence their judgment and behavior – and how being aware of those biases can help them make more objective decisions. Starting next year, the seminars will become mandatory for members of student selection committees. People on EPFL hiring committees will also be encouraged to look more proactively for female applicants. Senior Management has set a target of offering 40% of open faculty positions to women within the next five years.\nBringing paychecks in line \nA study of EPFL salaries – conducted using the Logib application developed by Switzerland’s Federal Office for Gender Equality – found that the “unexplained” difference between men’s and women’s salaries fell from 1.9% in 2015 to 1.3% today. That implies the wage gap is shrinking, but does it necessarily mean individual employees’ pay has become more equal? “It’s more likely,” says Füger. “But if anyone has any doubts, they should speak directly with human resources.”\nIncreasing paternity leave to four weeks\nGender equality also means helping parents achieve a better work-life balance. Amendments to the ETH Personnel Ordinance that are currently under discussion would introduce two major improvements: first, an extension of paternity leave from two to four weeks; and second, paid leave for employees who need to take time off to care for a family member, such as an elderly parent. “Let’s hope these two amendments are approved,” says Füger. “I believe EPFL has an important role to play in promoting women’s careers in science and engineering in Switzerland.”\nSenior Management agreed to allow staff members who wished to take part in the strike and related events on 14 June to do so during their working hours.\nGender equality at EPFL in figures \nAt end-2018, 16% of faculty and 28% of students were women.\nWomen account for 31% of professors hired since 2015.\nThe total capacity of the School’s three daycare centers was increased from 187 children to 230 in 2018 – and 44 more spots will be added in 2020 thanks to a new daycare center in the Vortex building.\nThe Robert Gnehm grant was introduced in late 2018 to help postdocs who become new parents.

{"id": 297, "text": "Imagine taking pictures of thousands of snowflakes from three different angles with a specialized instrument installed at an altitude of 2,500 meters. Then imagine using 3,500 of these pictures to manually train an algorithm to recognize six different classes of snowflakes. And, finally, imagine using this algorithm to classify the snowflakes in the millions of remaining pictures into those six classes at breakneck speed. That’s exactly what researchers at EPFL’s Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (LTE) did, in a project spearheaded by Alexis Berne. Their pioneering approach was featured in the latest issue of \nAtmospheric Measurement Techniques\n.\n“The scientific community has been trying to improve precipitation measurement and forecast for over 50 years. We now have a pretty good understanding of the mechanisms involved in rain,” says Berne. “But snow is a lot more complicated. Many factors – like the shape, geometry and electromagnetic properties of individual snowflakes – affect how snow crystals reflect signals back to weather radars, making our task much harder. And we still don’t have a good grasp of the equivalent liquid water content of snowflakes. Our goal with this study was to better understand exactly what’s falling when it snows, so that we can eventually improve snowfall forecast at high altitudes.” Berne also sees other applications for the team’s findings, like a more accurate estimation of water equivalent stored in the snowpack for irrigation and hydropower.\nIdentifying snowflakes and their degree of riming\nTo reach their goal, the researchers acquired a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC, image 1) – a sophisticated instrument composed by three synchronized cameras that simultaneously take high resolution (up to 35-micron) pictures of snowflakes as they pass through a metallic ring.\nIn collaboration with the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss and the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, they installed the MASC at a site near Davos, at an altitude of 2,500 meters, where it took pictures for an entire winter and at a site in coastal Antarctica, where it took pictures for an entire austral summer. They then ran their algorithm to classify the snowflake images into six main classes based on existing classification: planar crystals, columnar crystals, graupels, aggregates, combination of column and planar crystals, and small particles (image 2).\nImage 1. The researchers’ Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera © LTE/EPFL\nImage 2. The six families of snowflakes used by the researchers © LTE/EPFL \nThe researchers used the pictures taken by the MASC to also determine the degree of riming of each snowflake based on its surface roughness (image 3). “Snowflakes change shape as they fall down the atmosphere – especially through clouds,” says Berne. “Some of them gather frost and become more or less rimed snow crystals [#3-5 in the image], while others remain pristin and have a very low riming index [#1-2 in the image].” Riming is important because it is the process that turns cloud water droplets into precipitation in the form of ice – in other words, snow.\nImage 3. Snowflakes with increasing degrees of riming from left to right © LTE/EPFL\nComparing Alpine and Antarctic snowflakes\nThe next step was to compare the results obtained from the pictures taken near Davos in the Swiss Alps with those taken in Adélie Land on the coast of Antarctica. That revealed significant differences in how often every snowflake family appeared. Most of the snowflakes in the Alps are aggregates (49%), followed by small particles and graupels. However, in Antarctica, the majority were small particles (54%), followed by aggregates and graupels.\nAccording to Berne, these differences can be explained. “The fierce Antarctic winds continually erode the snowpack and result in the formation of tiny snow particles. What’s more, Antarctic snowflakes have much less riming than Alpine snowflakes because the Antarctic air is a lot drier.” Another of the researchers’ findings that will perhaps disappoint purists is that the ‘stellar dendrite’ type of snowflake – the one we typically associate with the ‘ideal’ snowflake – turned out to be rare at both sites, making up only 10% of snowflakes in the Alps and 5% of snowflakes in Antarctica.\nMulti-instrumental approach To tackle the complexity of the multiple processes involved, scientists usually rely on several different instruments when making meteorological measurements and weather forecasts. The results obtained by Berne’s team will therefore provide even more insights when combined with other instruments, such as weather radars, which collect data on clouds and precipitation across all layers of the atmosphere.\nAs part of the international Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), MeteoSwiss set up a rain gauge next to the MASC at the Davos site. The data have not been yet fully analyzed, but by comparing the type of snowflakes photographed by the MASC with the amount of water collected over a given period, the team will be able to test various hypotheses on snowflake liquid water content, which remains an enigma for atmospheric scientists.\nA measurement campaign during the 2018 Winter Olympics\n To bolster their findings, Berne’s team needs to gather more data. They sent their MASC back to Antarctica for another data-collecting round this year; it will then head to the mountains of South Korea in 2018 for the Winter Olympics which will take place in Pyeongchang. “The more data we have, the more reliable our calculations will be,” says Berne.\nThis research project combines fundamental and applied research. It involves three scientists: Alexis Berne and Christophe Praz from EPFL’s Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory and Yves-Alain Roulet from MeteoSwiss (the Swiss Federal Meteorology and Climatology Office). MétéoSuisse has been working with EPFL for several years to improve its precipitation estimates and its numerical weather prediction model.\nReference", "summary": "Using a special multi-angle camera, EPFL researchers have gained important insights into the structure of snowflakes.

{"id": 302, "text": "Quantum mechanics tells us that light can behave simultaneously as a particle and as a wave. However, there has never been an experiment able to capture both natures of light at the same time; the closest we have come is seeing either wave or particle, but always at different times. Taking a radically different experimental approach, EPFL scientists have now been able to take the first ever snapshot of light behaving both as a wave and as a particle. The breakthrough work is published in \nNature Communications\n.\nWhen UV light hits a metal surface, it causes an emission of electrons. Albert Einstein explained this “photoelectric” effect by proposing that light – thought to only be a wave – is also a stream of particles. Even though a variety of experiments have successfully observed both the particle- and wave-like behaviors of light, they have never been able to observe both at the same time. \nA new approach on a classic effect\nA research team led by Fabrizio Carbone at EPFL has now carried out an experiment with a clever twist: using electrons to image light. The researchers have captured, for the first time ever, a single snapshot of light behaving simultaneously as both a wave and a stream of particles particle.\nThe experiment is set up like this: A pulse of laser light is fired at a tiny metallic nanowire. The laser adds energy to the charged particles in the nanowire, causing them to vibrate. Light travels along this tiny wire in two possible directions, like cars on a highway. When waves traveling in opposite directions meet each other they form a new wave that looks like it is standing in place. Here, this standing wave becomes the source of light for the experiment, radiating around the nanowire.\nThis is where the experiment’s trick comes in: The scientists shot a stream of electrons close to the nanowire, using them to image the standing wave of light. As the electrons interacted with the confined light on the nanowire, they either sped up or slowed down. Using the ultrafast microscope to image the position where this change in speed occurred, Carbone’s team could now visualize the standing wave, which acts as a fingerprint of the wave-nature of light.\nWhile this phenomenon shows the wave-like nature of light, it simultaneously demonstrates its particle aspect as well. As the electrons pass close to the standing wave of light, they “hit” the light’s particles, the photons. As mentioned above, this affects their speed, making them move faster or slower. This change in speed appears as an exchange of energy “packets” (quanta) between electrons and photons. The very occurrence of these energy packets shows that the light on the nanowire behaves as a particle.\n“This experiment demonstrates that, for the first time ever, we can film quantum mechanics – and its paradoxical nature – directly,” says Fabrizio Carbone. In addition, the importance of this pioneering work can extend beyond fundamental science and to future technologies. As Carbone explains: “Being able to image and control quantum phenomena at the nanometer scale like this opens up a new route towards quantum computing.”\nThis work represents a collaboration between the Laboratory for Ultrafast Microscopy and Electron Scattering of EPFL, the Department of Physics of Trinity College (US) and the Physical and Life Sciences Directorate of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The imaging was carried out EPFL’s ultrafast energy-filtered transmission electron microscope – one of the two in the world.\nReference\nPiazza L, Lummen TTA, Quiñonez E, Murooka Y, Reed BW, Barwick B, Carbone F. \nSimultaneous observation of the quantization and the interference pattern of a plasmonic near-field.\nNature Communications\n 02 March 2015.

Chowdhury himself will give a lecture at the exhibition preview on 23 September. \nBangladesh’s extreme complexity\n Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated regions on earth and its river delta landscape is an area prone to flooding, cyclones and rising sea levels. This presents a major challenge, since buildings need to be designed to withstand these extreme weather conditions. The bungalow typology has a proven track record in tropical climates and is often used to address these issues.\nPoetic and pragmatic architecture \n Kashef Chowdhury is keenly aware of the collapse of urban regions and cultural heritage due to abrupt climate change in his country, and seeks architectural solutions that benefit society and more specifically the people being pushed to its margins. His modern, pragmatic buildings include a raised village on the banks of the Brahmaputra River, a school in the Rohingya refugee camp in Ukhia, the Gulshan Society Mosque in Dhaka and the Cyclone Shelter in Kuakata. Using earth and bricks as his materials, he strikes a fine balance between functionality and sensuality, with a masterful treatment of light and space.\nFaraway So Close\n While inspired by Bangladesh’s local context, Chowdhury’s architecture translates globally: it deals with urgent contemporary matters such as the population explosion, climate change, migration and the development of rural potential.

{"id": 315, "text": "It’s the crack of dawn and they’re already behind the wheel, in the train or at the airport. Some spend several nights a week in a furnished studio in another city or a suburban hotel. These heavy business travelers (“grands mobiles” in French) are the21st century’s western nomads. They are often quite attached to their homes, but have been uprooted professionally, sometimes by choice, sometimes not.\nBased on a European study conducted in 2007 and 2011, EPFL researchers have sketched the profiles of these travelers: people who spend more than two hours a day commuting and bi-residents who spend more than 60 nights a year away from their primary residence.\nThese kinds of commuters are not outliers any more: about a quarter of the European population falls into this description. Almost half of those working on the continent experience a period of heavy professional travel during the course of their careers. Improvements in transport availability, tight job markets, rising land values, and regional disparities are all factors that have played a role in the growth of this phenomenon.\nMobility is spatial rather than relational \n Other factors not associated with work also play a role in choosing these kinds of commuting solutions. “Heavy commuters are often very sedentary; they’re spatially mobile, but not socially mobile,” explains Stéphanie Vincent-Geslin, who led the research study with Emmanuel Ravalet in EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory. “Moving to a new place, that’s a huge change. When you live somewhere, you develop a network that you don’t necessarily want to leave. These roots play a big part in the choices these commuters make.”\nLong distance commuting touches every socio-professional category, city and country dwellers alike. But it doesn’t affect them all in the same way, according to research funded by the Forum Vies Mobiles, a think tank of the French National Railway system (SNCF). These differences depend on individuals’ so-called “motility,” or their potential for mobility. Can I manage -- materially, financially, practically – a long-distance commute? To what extent can I deal with the unexpected, organize the commute, and spend my time productively while commuting? “Those who do best in this situation are those who have the most possibility to stop doing it,” says Ravalet.\nThe new normal\n Reflecting the growing uncertainties in society, heavy commuting is becoming more and more accepted – but not without social consequences. Women are choosing to wait to start a family, and when they do take the plunge, they have fewer children. Single parents are often forced into long commutes just to make ends meet. Singles start commuting and then, habituated, have a strong inclination to continue this kind of lifestyle. And finally, couples in which one partner is regularly absent run almost twice the risk of separating. “Heavy commuting goes way beyond the issue of transport,” conclude the researchers. This fall they will be publishing a short book highlighting the portraits of six fictitious commuters.\nCreated in 2011 by the SNCF (Société des chemins de fer français), the Forum Vies Mobiles is a research and exchange institute that studies mobility.

Data gathered from the MIR submersibles has enabled scientists to demonstrate a correlation between the presence of certain bacteria and heavy metals. They were also able to precisely measure how micropollutants – primarily pesticides or pharmaceuticals – spread throughout Lake Geneva from water treatment station outlets. (See press kit.)\nElemo takes to the air\nOn board their two ultralights, scientists from EPFL, Eawag and CEA (France) will study phenomena occurring near the surface of the lake, as well as the influence of air currents on the lake. Test flights will take place above the Lausanne and Nyon regions between November 26 and December 5, to test and calibrate the sensors. The official research campaign will begin in May 2013.\nThe scientists will use a “hyper-spectral” camera, a tool that allows them to decompose the light spectrum into hundreds of separate colors. From this, they can obtain an global image of certain elements close to the surface of the lake, such as bacteria, sediments, and dissolved gases. This kind of analysis is already done by satellites, but technical limitations (they can only separate a few parts of the light spectrum) and distance make many kinds of observations impossible.\nAt the same spot where the camera is pointed, a catamaran will simultaneously take water samples. By comparing the data taken from the air and from the water, the scientists hope to be able to develop new and better methods for analyzing the currents and the overall health of the lake.\nFor Michel Pettigrew, President of the Executive Board and Chief Operating Officer de Ferring Pharmaceuticals, a continuation of the company’s support of the program was self-evident. “Ferring has a keen interest in science and the environment and is especially committed to the Lake Geneva region. As a member of the local community, we are particularly proud to support the elemo project, which brings the best international scientific teams together with the objective of advancing our understanding the dynamics of Lake Geneva.”\nAs in the 2011 exploratory campaign on board the MIR submersibles, this extension of the elemo program will also continue in Russia, above the waters of Lake Baïkal – the world’s deepest lake – under the name “Project Léman-Baïkal.” By comparing results obtained in Switzerland and Russia, the scientists will be able to consolidate their knowledge and the methods they use to study lake environments.\n ---\n----\nPress kit\nElemo 2011 – some preliminary results from the MIR submersible campaign\nScientists on board MIR submersibles collected a huge amount of data on Lake Geneva, enough to keep their laboratories busy for many years to come. As we wait for the first scientific articles to be published, here is a brief overview of some preliminary results.\nAnalyzing pollution and micro-organisms\nTracing the path of pollutants and detecting them more easily\nPresent in tiny amounts in the waters of the lake, micropollutants still manage to evade most modern filtration systems. Tamar Kohn and her EPFL team have gotten a better understanding of substances emitted by the Vidy water streatment station, and how these pollutants spread through the lake. They observed significant evidence of pesticides and pharmaceuticals near the outlet of the water treatment station. They were also able to determine the presence of micropollutants by making simple measurements of the electrical conductivity of the water. This method could prove to be a simpler and more direct way of monitoring water quality.\nResistant bacteria point to pollution\nScientists from the University of Neuchâtel’s Microbiology Laboratory studied the impact of pollution, primarily heavy metals, on bacterial populations in the lake. Led by Pilar Junier, the research team concentrated on bacteria that form endospores, a dormant state that enables them to survive in a polluted area. The endospores make these bacteria excellent biological markers. Initial results indicate a correlation between the presence of endospores and heavy metal concentrations. New analyses should give further precision to this observation. This research also provides a better picture of which species survive best and will thus recolonize areas once the pollution disappears, and what to do to restore a healthy balance.\nBacteria play a role in depositing heavy metals on the lake bottom\nAssessing the ecological consequences of trace metal emissions in aquatic environments is very difficult. They are persistent; they don’t degrade over time and aren’t destroyed by human or biological processes. Once they have been introduced into aquatic ecosystems, they become involved in a number of chemical processes that are still not well understood. They take a number of different chemical forms. Mary-Lou Tercier-Waeber and Matthieu Masson from the University of Geneva’s CHIAM department took sediment samples from depths between 30m and 80m in the well-defined geographical zone of the Vidy bay, which is affected by micropollutants discharged by the Vidy water treatment station. The scientists observed that the concentrations of metals at the interface between the water and the bottom of the sediment is not correlated with the distance from the outlet of the treatment station, but rather to the bio-geochemical characteristics of the sediment. The highest concentrations were found in zones in which bacteria had colonized the sediment.\nGeology and environmental history\nConstantly changing canyons\nAs the Rhone river flows into the waters of Lake Geneva, it carves out incredible underwater structures. These so-called “canyons,” some of which are 100m deeper than the lake bottom, were extensively analyzed by the MIR submersibles. Research by University of Geneva and Eawag scientists Stéphanie Girardclos and Flavio Anselmetti has already shown that the canyons are constantly in the process of changing in response to geological and climatic events. In particular, a thick layer of sediment observed at the outlet of the main canyon is evidence of a recent underwater landslide, probably following a major flooding event in the Rhone river in 2000.\nCharacterizing the lakebed\nPillows, wavelets and plains; trenches, mattresses and depressions: for fifty years already, the landscapes on the bottom of Lake Geneva have been classified into these six categories. Nicolas Le Dantec, Yosef Akhtman, Ulrich Lemmin and D. Andrew Barry, scientists from EPFL’s Ecological Engineering and Topometry Laboratories, have refined these definitions as part of the elemo campaign. Cameras on board the MIR submersibles revealed intermediate variants. In addition, the large scope of the observations has made it possible to map the distribution of the various morphology types. These depend in part on the slope of the lakebed, and possibly also on other parameters such as the activity of certain fish and bacteria.\nBacteria tell a tale\nThe chemical and biological composition of the soil in a given ecosystem reveals much about its history. Starting from this principle, Pilar Junier and her team from the University of Neuchâtel’s Microbiology Laboratory conducted a study to explore Lake Geneva’s past. They painstakingly analyzed the genetic material in sediment samples taken from the Rhone delta. They specifically observed the evolution of the number and nature of bacteria that form endospores. These organisms can go into a dormant stage if environmental conditions are unfavorable. They thus make very interesting markers, because variations in their concentration and state at different depths reflect changes in the chemical or microbiological equilibrium that occurred over time.\nGeotechnical properties of lake sediments\nA team from EPFL and the University of Bremen looked at the geotechnical properties of the sediments on the bottom of Lake Geneva. Using Nimrod, a “dynamic penetrometer,” they developed a precise map of sediment transport in the lakebed at the Rhone delta and the Vidy bay. This device, piloted from inside the submersible, is a free-falling cylinder with pressure sensors on the bottom. These sensors measure the soil resistance along a vertical profile as the device penetrates the sediment. The team mapped the points measured and have already been able to observe that the sediment resistance is higher at the mouth of the Rhone and its channel into the lake than in other areas.\nMethane flows from the depths to the atmosphere\nMethane is a greenhouse gas produced by the fermentation of organic material. It has a larger impact on global warming than CO2. In lakes, methane is formed by bacterial fermentation in the sediment on the lake bottom, and when the soil on the lakebed can no longer resist the pressure of the gas, methane bubbles suddenly rise through the water and into the atmosphere. Preliminary studies have shown large methane emissions in the Rhone delta. During the elemo campaign’s underwater expeditions, researchers from EPFL, Eawag, ETH Zurich and other Swiss, German and Canadian universities probed the canyons of Lake Geneva, collecting sediment cores and water samples from the depths in order to determine the quantity of methane being produced on the lakebed and the amount that escapes into the atmosphere. Preliminary results show that methane emissions vary depending on the lakebed topography and the amount of sediment transported into the canyons by tributaries.", "summary": "One year after the MIR submersibles dove into the depths of Lake Geneva, the elemo program is delivering its first scientific results.

{"id": 320, "text": "Four teams of students from EPFL, ECAL and UNIL took part in the third  (CHIC), where they turned their bright ideas into functional prototypes. They met up one day a week for an entire year in order to pool their engineering, design and project-management know-how and develop blueprints for innovative devices. They then spent two weeks in Hong Kong and Shenzhen building the prototypes. Their inventions ranged from a connected watch for autistic children to a probe for measuring water levels – a sign of the participants’ strong social involvement. “By working with organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) to develop the prototypes, students got first-hand exposure to ethical issues,” says Marc Laperrouza, head of the CHIC program.\nConnected objects to solve concrete problems\nOne team developed the Livelo connected probe, for example, which can be used to measure underground water levels, meeting a genuine need. “One out of every ten people on the planet doesn’t have access to drinking water. Remedying that will require effective management of underground water reserves – but existing probes are too expensive,” says a student on the Livelo project team. The team worked with the ICRC to design a system that is five times cheaper; now the ICRC will test the device out in the field. Another team addressed the issue of children’s health, with a connected helmet that contains sensors to measure the amount of UV-ray exposure the child is getting, sending an alert to the parents if a safe limit is exceeded. The helmet works in conjunction with an app allowing parents to record their child’s skin type and receive a notification if the child takes off the helmet.\nA third team aimed to make life easier for autistic children and their parents. “When doing our research, we noticed that pictograms are often used to help these children in their daily tasks. So we devised a connected watch that displays images of the tasks they need to carry out and the time they have to do them,” says a student on the project team. Parents can program and manage the displayed images and times from an app on their smartphones. The fourth team came up with a system for making compost at home – without the unpleasant odor and other hassles of typical compost containers. The system also lets users track the compost production cycle. Through all these projects – whether they involved studying the way compost is made, understanding the specific needs of disabled children or meeting strict engineering requirements – the students had a unique opportunity to expand their horizons and acquire new skills.\nCultivating individuals’ ideas within a cross-disciplinary team\n“These cross-disciplinary projects exposed students to real-world constraints. They had to find a focus for their research that was both interesting and relevant to their studies, while respecting the needs of other team members,” says EPFL professor Denis Gillet, one of the students’ supervisors. This teamwork wasn’t always easy, but the students clearly enjoyed it. Now they’ll serve as mentors for the next lot of participants. And while the aim of the CHIC program is not necessarily for students to go on to launch their inventions on the market, they can certainly head in that direction if they so wish.\nCHIC is an elective program offered by \nthe College of Humanities as part of \nthe Minor in Science, Technology and Area Studies () at EPFL.", "summary": "Students from EPFL, the Lausanne School of Art & Design (ECAL) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL) headed to China this summer for the China Hardware Innovation Camp, where they made industrial prototypes based on research they had conducted over the year.

{"id": 321, "text": "“It was a risk to try living in my own architecture. But it turned out to be magnificent.” Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier, penned these words in a letter to his mother on 29 April 1934. The celebrated architect had just moved into the top floor of a building that he had designed at 24 Rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris, near the Bois de Boulogne park. This quote also opens one of the chapters of an EPFL book written about that apartment, which, from 1934 to 1965, served as Le Corbusier's painting studio and architecture lab.\nThe book’s authors, Giulia Marino and Franz Graf, are researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM). They were commissioned by the Fondation Le Corbusier, with funding from a Keeping it Modern Grant from the Getty Foundation, to come up with a list of guidelines for fully restoring this unique site so that it can be opened to the public. As part of their work, they had access to previously untapped sources of information, which they publish and cite in their book: these sources include photos, letters and first-hand accounts provided by people who were close to the architect.\nLe Corbusier tested out his architectural ideas in his apartment. As a result, it played host to a combination of styles dating from 1930 to the 1960s and ranging from a ‘purist’ interior to a ‘brutalist’ feel – Le Corbusier was constantly changing the apartment’s interior and trying out different materials as he experimented with architecture. So what should be considered the core period? What should be preserved? What can be done away with? What story should be told? The researchers came up against these and many other questions, always aware that they were dealing with a true legend – a legend they dented at times. We spoke with Giulia Marino in the run-up to the book launch on 7 May and the reopening of the apartment-studio to the public in June 2018.\nWhat sort of options does a restorer have in turning a famous architect’s apartment into a museum?\nThere are many examples of what can be done. You can, for example, recreate the interior, giving the impression that the architect has just stepped out. That’s how Ernö Goldfinger’s London apartment, which we visited, is set up. There, the concept is taken to the extreme, with cans of baked beans and a bottle of ketchup in the kitchen! But there’s a risk of giving the place the feel of a wax museum. At the other end of the spectrum, Milan architect Vico Magistretti’s former office has been turned into an exhibition space with offices for the foundation’s staff, although some original features have been kept. In other cases, the interior is left completely empty, like in Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye just west of Paris.\nWhat is it that stands out about Le Corbusier’s apartment-studio?\nIt’s a manifesto, a unique concentration of his inventions, such as the brise-soleil – which protects a building from sunlight – and indirect lighting. There is also Modulor Man, a human silhouette whose proportions served, among other things, to define the dimensions of his famous housing units. It is present in the form of stained glass in the dining room's bay window. In addition, we realized that the reason Le Corbusier covered some walls and ceilings with oak plywood was to hide water stains from leaks in the roof. This is rather ironic, since this type of paneling then became a fixture of modern architecture! From an ethical perspective, we found it impossible to favor one period over another. So we proposed to preserve the way Le Corbusier left his apartment – a palimpsest of eras.\nHow did the unpublished sources that you consulted help you develop your recommendations?\nA lot of photos were taken of the apartment, but many of them aren’t dated. So we had to come up with ways of putting them into chronological order, such as by carefully looking at the works of art in the images. By comparing hundreds of photos, we saw how the space changed over the decades, how furniture, materials and artwork came and went, and how certain aspects remained constant over the years, such as a red painted wall in the living room and the location of particular objects and paintings. Le Corbusier was a painter and a collector too. For us, placing carefully selected objects (paintings, rugs, sculptures) in strategic locations where they have always been is crucial if visitors are to truly understand the architecture and how the space was used. We also studied his correspondence, his bills and the impact of the countless – if not always felicitous – renovations that the apartment went through after his death. We also came up with recommendations on additional studies that are needed before any restoration work can begin, such as analyzing the layers of paint to identify all the colors used, since such things cannot be identified with any accuracy from the black and white photos. Now it’s up to the architect-restorers and exhibition specialists to review our guidelines and factor in the necessary security measures so that they can come up with a display approach that will be of interest to both researchers and the broader public.\nDoes the apartment-studio reflect Le Corbusier’s day-to-day existence?\n The apartment was indeed in keeping with how the architect and his wife lived. It was divided into two parts, separated by two pivot doors. Le Corbusier’s painting studio was on one side and the other side was where the couple, who didn’t have any children, lived – sitting room, bedrooms, kitchen and dining room. There is also a lovely terrace on top of the building. There are numerous stories about Le Corbusier’s wife Yvonne who, according to people who worked with Le Corbusier, was not allowed to enter his studio. Le Corbusier himself noted that, after his wife complained about 'living in a barrack' – an expression we find in his correspondence – he developed the principle of indirect lighting, in which artificial light is projected onto a colored wall. This invention became iconic both in his work and beyond it.\nVernissage and conference \"Les multiples vies de l'appartement-atelier de Le Corbusier\"\n Presentation of the 2nd edition of the ; Introduction with Christine Mengin, General Secretary of the Foundation Le Corbusier\n Moday 7 May 2018 - 6:30pm, Project Room, , EPFL.", "summary": "How should an iconic piece of modern architecture be restored?

{"id": 322, "text": "SBB transports close to one million passengers per day, by any weather even in tough winter conditions. In 2012, striving to better safety, SBB mandated the EPFL Transportation Center to study the phenomenon of ballast projection by very cold weather.\n The results from this study have enabled SBB to undertake measures of improvement.\nWhy does ballast fly up? Analysing this rare phenomenon, that is also an issue in foreign countries, confirms that two related factors are involved: the high speed of trains and tough winter conditions. Snow, wind and frost favour the formation of blocks of ice on the undersides of the wagons. These blocks detach from time to time, falling abruptly onto the track. The shock of the ice block on the gravel can induce the ballast to move, like a billiard ball hitting another. The gravel is flung into the air, where it ricochets off the wagon, or even further afield if it hits the wheel.\nThe researchers have discovered that some stretches of track were more affected than others. Typically, Western and Central Switzerland, and particularly the Geneva-Lausanne, Lausanne-Brig and Olten-Lucern axes had the highest number of incidents. They observed that in each case the maximum authorized speed on the stretch was between 140-160 km/h, there was significant winter snowfall along the stretch and often the train ran alongside a lake or river. One possible explanation is that snow-covered trains descending the Bern-Fribourg route warmed up in Lausanne, resulting in ballast spray along the Geneva-Lausanne stretch. It’s also worth noting that many cases of flying ballast occur inside tunnels, particularly on the Olten-Basel stretch. There too, the warming of snow and ice blocks as the train passes through the tunnel could be the cause.\nRecommendations implemented\nScientists have tried to identify all possible causes, looking, for example at wagons themselves. Finally they also investigated at track level, to determine if the passage of the wheels on “glued joints” (between to rail pieces) as well as the jonction could cause this flight of ballast phenomenon.\nAccording to researchers, there are many possibilities, starting with better incident reporting, to help better understand the evolution of the phenomenon. The SBB has already put into place a systematic reporting mechanism. They have also instituted regulations that slow the trains down in heavy snow conditions.\nEPFL scientists have recommended SBB to eliminate weak points – To replace jointed rails with long continuously welded rails in heavily populated areas; To use recent ICN type trains on sensitive stretches and consider erecting noise-buffering walls, which would also serve to stop possible flying ballast.\n“All the EPFL scientists’ suggestions, as well as others, have been taken into consideration and evaluated in terms of feasibility, efficiency and cost. The best measures have been selected for implementation” says SBB. In December 2012, SBB put into place local weather-dependent speed limits for a few hours, conducted additional wintertime car inspections, lowered the ballast level to reduce the effects of falling ice blocks, and treated the undercarriages with a lacquer to prevent ice from accumulating. This caused delay for passengers, but it guaranteed maximum security. As winter 2013-2014 has been rather pleasant, not such speed limiting measures have been necessary.", "summary": "Results of an EPFL study on ballast projections in exceptional winter conditions have enabled SBB to set-up measures to improve safety around the tracks.", "claim": "Results of an EPFL study on ballast projections in exceptional 2012 conditions have enabled SBB to set-up measures to improve safety around the tracks.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}

The month-long ACE Maritime University hosted 49 students who study water-related sciences – including oceanography, hydrology and climatology – in universities around the world.\n Before departure in Bremerhaven, Germany, Oriane Etter discussing with Philippe Gillet, Swiss Polar Institute ad interim director.\nOriane was the only EPFL student on board. And her thing is fresh water: her Master’s project focuses on a specific part of Lake Geneva, where she is studying urban waste in lakes. The vastness of the ocean provided her with a new perspective. “The discussions among students and the classes we took on the ship opened my eyes to the wide range of ocean-related fields you can study”, she said a few hours before the voyage ended.\n Sunset on the Equator...\nWanderlust \nOriane, who is from Fribourg, has always been interested in environmental issues. She lives by this ethic, which has given her a desire to explore and brought her to EPFL to study Environmental Sciences and Engineering. It has also led her to a number of interesting life experiences. Oriane first learned about oceanography during her Erasmus exchange in Norway. That came after a gap year during which she volunteered on organic farms in Germany for a few months and worked as a whale watching guide in the Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia, Canada .\nThis 25-year-old has now completed the ACE Maritime University as well. Before the trip, Oriane looked forward to meeting new people on this adventure, learning how to operate oceanographic instruments and experiencing the multidisciplinary structure of the teams and work on the ship. She was not disappointed. \nOriane with samples collected in the frame of the afternoons' work sessions on the deck.\n“I'm struck by the vastly different backgrounds of the other participants and by the depth of the discussions we have about education, critical thinking, the role of science and climate change,” she said while the boat was sailing off the Namibian coast. “In our daily lives, it's easy to get discouraged by the feeling that people don't care about environmental issues or social problems in general. But here, we realize that we’re not alone, that we share these feelings, and that we have the same desire to take action. It’s extremely inspiring.”\n Sampling wih the Bongo net\nBack to basics\nOriane will never forget watching waterspouts form off the coast of Angola, where the sea meets the sky. “It was really fascinating – but also scary, because if they kept growing we knew we were in danger!” She also mentioned some of the presentations, like the one by Kyle Neumann, a student at the University of California. He uses remotely operated vehicles equipped with cameras to take underwater pictures.\nThen there's the human dimension of living in close quarters and sharing this type of experience. “All those card games, including jass, were really unforgettable. We won people over to Swiss culture through these games – and with the help of lots of chocolate.”\nSunset off the coast of Mauritania and swing course on the helideck. Oriane dancing with a Zurich University student.\nOriane also enjoyed getting back to basics during this voyage. “We are totally taken care of, yet we’re also exposed to the forces of nature. Your senses are heightened. Eating becomes a new experience. The ocean changes so fast, there are so many textures, emotions and colors that it’s never the same. And then living in a confined space, without the internet, forces us to interact, to talk to each other, to wait, to write paper messages, where passing along information by word of mouth becomes an authentic experience. You just throw yourself into it.”\n ACE Maritime University students on the occasion of the \"line crossing\" ceremony.\nPhotos: (c)V.Sentilhes\nFollow ACE expedition on:", "summary": "EPFL student Oriane Etter and 48 other students from universities around the globe just completed the ACE Maritime University.

{"id": 329, "text": "A genuine star of the laboratory, for several decades now the fruit fly has been the model organism for research, particularly in the field of genetics and development. But nothing looks more like a fly than another fly. When it comes to observing and quantifying their interactions, it’s enough to turn one’s hair gray. Researchers from EPFL and UNIL are making life easier for scientists all over the world with their system of monitoring and identification of these insects.\n“That will allow us to penetrate many mysteries in the social lives of insects: with whom they fight, eat, or mate. With this system we will be able to observe the influence of the group and the group size on individual behavior, as well as interactions between genetically different groups of flies,” explains Richard Benton, Professor at the Center for Integrative Genomics of UNIL.\nFBI for Flies\nThis device, named FBI (Fluorescent Behavioral Imaging) – that’s no joke – makes it possible to monitor, record, and analyze the behavior of fruit flies interacting with others. Pavan Ramdya, postdoc at EPFL and at UNIL, has devised a method to differentiate flies with different genetic profiles using cameras and making genetic modifications. Fruit flies have a vital asset: they are easily genetically manipulated. Researchers turned a muscle in the chest fluorescent in a line of insects. These flies can fly and reproduce. Everything indicates, therefore, that they behave like their unmodified counterparts.\nThe tracking device refined by the research group distinguishes between flies by their greenish thorax. In order to know in real time where a fly is and to which genetic group it belongs, two cameras simultaneously film insect behavior and changes in the fluorescence.\nSoftware developed by Thomas Schaffer, doctoral candidate at EPFL, correspondingly provides an intuitive interface to orchestrate a system of cameras and LEDs required for data acquisition. The different genetic profiles of the Diptera are automatically discriminated along with statistics on their movements to facilitate the analysis of their behavior.\nNew Behavioral Studies Made Possible\nAlthough it is a tiny insect (2.5 to 3 mm long), the fruit fly is an animal that can elucidate numerous biological questions on: behavior, reproduction, relationships with other species or adaptation to an environment. The device therefore fills an important gap in methodological studies of the behavior of flies as well as other insects, such as ants. Until now monitoring tools based on morphological characteristics could hardly discriminate.\nTo illustrate the importance and the reliability of this new method, researchers examined courtship of male flies genetically modified to court other males. The question was whether they preferred individuals of their own group or unmodified flies – generally attracted to females. The comparison of these two groups of externally identical flies would not have been possible before this new method.\nTwo distinct populations of insect can now be easily compared within the same experiment. “Of course it is possible to study multiple groups simultaneously using other types of fluorophores, that will give them a different intensity or color,” says Pavan Ramdya.\nVideos:\n-\n-", "summary": "FBI, a camera system to recognize the genetic identity of fruit flies and track their movements will revolutionize the study of their behavior.

{"id": 331, "text": "To generate electricity, Switzerland has been using nuclear energy for nearly 40 years, and its five nuclear power stations provide about 38% of the electricity required. It’s the second most important source of electricity in Switzerland after hydro-electricity. However, the Swiss government recently decided on a gradual phasing-out of atomic energy, and the existing nuclear power stations will be decommissioned over the next twenty years, with the last remaining installation scheduled to be closed down in 2034. The federal law on nuclear energy stipulates that nuclear waste must be managed in Switzerland: more specifically, it states that the waste should be stored in depots located in deep strata, which is considered to be the most appropriate solution for Switzerland. So how should we prepare for the safe and definitive storage of our nuclear waste? For several years, the Laboratory of Soil Mechanics (LMS) has been contributing to research into the identification of the best place for its storage. In parallel, the LMS is also researching into various tools for the evaluation of multi-barrier systems. We asked Professor Lyesse Laloui, the director of the LMS, about the current state of affairs from a scientific and critical viewpoint.\nHow does Switzerland currently handle its nuclear waste?\n Since the moratorium voted by the parliament in 2006, Swiss nuclear waste is no longer sent to France and Germany: instead, the 8000 m3 of waste is being cooled in enormous pools in Würenlingen in the canton of Aargau. This is only a temporary measure, since it is planned to bury the waste permanently in deep geological strata.\nAre there different types of waste?\n Yes, there are in fact two categories of waste:\n • Waste that is low- to medium-level radioactive, whose lifespan is short – from a few dozen years to 300 years maximum. It comes not only from nuclear power stations, but also from medical uses, industry and research establishments. We have a lot of expertise in handling this waste.\n • Highly radioactive waste, which will take several million or even billions of years to become inactive. We call this “final waste” – that which is at the end of the re-processing chain, and which is not possible to refine further. This is the type that we have to store definitively.\nWhich scenarios are favored in Switzerland?\nStorage in deep geological strata:\n Several sites are being evaluated in Switzerland. Once the location has been chosen, it will be necessary to create a network of tunnels one kilometer deep: the waste will then be stored there.\nVitrification of the waste:\n This means mixing the waste with a glass matrix. It’s estimated that glass can withstand heat, irradiation and degradation through contact with water for about 300,000 years. Each glass cylinder is placed in a steel container: this constitutes a kind of “package” of glass waste 8 meters long and weighing about two tons.\nThe fixing of vitrified waste in sodium bentonite:\n this clay expands in volume when it is exposed to moisture. It can absorb several times its mass in water, and – when injected in the storage tunnels – it expands and fills the spaces between the cylinder and the rock. Each country is carrying out research in different directions. The Swiss strategy is not to be able to access the waste once it has been sealed in the bentonite.\nWhat is the nature of your research work? Where is it carried out? And what are the risks?\nOur research is focused on the physical phenomena that interact in the course of the life of buried waste. We have to ensure a maximum level of security with regard to both natural and man-made barriers.\n In choosing the site, we’re evidently concerned with its stability.\nSpecifically, we concentrate on the connected thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes. Heat is an important factor: the waste generates temperature of the order of 150 degrees over hundreds of years. How do we ensure that the radio-necleotides won’t damage the vitrification?\n When we consider the environment below ground, water is everywhere: we regard it as the biggest threat. It can damage the steel lining by corrosion, which would have two consequences: the formation of gas – at the LMS we are trying to understand how this gas circulates in the tunnels – and the release of radioactive particles that could be transported by underground circulation.\nTo minimize risk, it’s therefore essential to develop performant evaluation tools for the various barriers designed to seal off the waste, and to test and improve the materials that would be used in the process. We are developing scientific research on materials and also scenarios for the optimization of technical solutions.\n We have analyzed the impact of environmental elements on the behavior of geo-structures. To do this, we worked with the Mont-Terri underground laboratory in the Jura region of Switzerland. The laboratory consists of a network of tunnels located 300 meters deep, that are cut into a type of rock that can be found just about everywhere in the country. Because of this, the data gathered can be extrapolated.\n We are also carrying out research on the enhancement of the properties of bentonite, which is the final protection and sealing barrier before the rock, and are currently in the middle of trials in the underground laboratory at Grimsel. We blasted bentonite on rock walls, and then after the drying process was completed, we took some samples, which are currently being analyzed at EPFL. We need to determine its level of hermeticity, its mechanical properties, its expansion potential and its density, and use this data to develop the best possible material. We’re testing various compositions of bentonite, subjected to heating at 120° in an underground laboratory in Sweden. Our own laboratory is involved in international research, and I’m currently coordinating a European proposal as part of the 7th framework program, as well as organizing an international conference on this subject, to be held at EPFL from February 1 to 3, 2012.", "summary": "If Switzerland does indeed abandon nuclear energy within the time-frame announced by the Swiss Confederation, the question of the burial and disposal of the accumulated waste needs to be addressed.

{"id": 337, "text": "Both of the EPFL projects that applied for the European Commission’s FET Flagship program have successfully cleared the first hurdle. These projects are the Time Machine, headed by Frédéric Kaplan at the Digital Humanities Laboratory, and Health EU, run by Adrian Ionescu at the Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab).\nA total of 33 projects from universities across Europe have applied for the program, which is intended to support future and emerging technologies (FET). Only 17 of them – just over half – were selected for the second round, scheduled to end on 18 September 2018.\nA huge historical database\nThe Time Machine is based on the Venice Time Machine (VTM), a project that started in 2012 and served as a proof of concept. The VTM aimed to build a multidimensional model of the city that spans the past millennium, using millions of historical documents stored in a variety of formats. After five years, the project team has scanned 190,000 records from the Venice State Archive along with 720,000 photographs and 3,000 books on Venice’s history.\nThe objective of the Time Machine is to replicate the VTM across Europe. It will create a large-scale simulator for mapping 2,000 years of European history and turning the huge archives and sizeable museum collections into one big digital information system.\nMany universities are already in the process of building their own Time Machine to bridge their cities’ past to the present and connect the paths of history. Amsterdam, Nuremberg, Paris, Jerusalem, Budapest and Naples have all decided to dig through their archives and create a huge linked database on a national and European level.\nTo date, 170 partner institutions from 32 countries have joined the Time Machine project and formed a consortium to develop new technology for digitizing, analyzing, accessing, preserving and sharing historical and cultural documents on a large scale.\n“Making it past the first round of the selection process was critical, not just for our consortium but also for our cultural heritage in general,” says Frédéric Kaplan. “This is the first time that a cultural project of this scope – one billion euros over ten years and supported by institutions from all European countries – has been proposed. Never before has a continent-wide initiative aimed at turning our historical heritage into a key resource for education, research and the economy ever been attempted. This latest news brings us one step closer to making our dream of creating a time machine a reality for all Europeans.”\nAn avatar for managing your health\nWith Health EU, everyone will one day have their own medical avatar – a virtual replica of themselves featuring their own personal data – that could improve the way their health is managed and the treatments they are given. This international project, led by a consortium headed by EPFL and the University of Twente, aims to achieve enhanced disease prevention, early diagnosis, more accurate monitoring and customized, targeted administration of medicines and treatments, especially for increasingly common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular, chronic and neurodegenerative disorders.\nThe project’s core idea is to combine customized medicine with digital technology, using the latest technological developments such as connected objects and artificial intelligence, as well as the novel concepts of digital twins and organs-on-chips. Digital twins are essentially computer models that enable doctors to test and measure the effect of variables, processes and scenarios that would be impossible to apply in the real world. Organs-on-chips let doctors observe the biological functions of an organ or the effect of a medicine – but outside the human body. That has the advantage of avoiding side effects that can sometimes be extremely harmful and allowing treatments to be tailored as closely as possible to a patient’s needs. \n“The Health EU project will lay the foundation for a bright future for European healthcare in the 21st century,” says Adrian Ionescu. “It represents a human avatar-based revolution, where personalized medicine and the early interception and prevention of diseases will create an economically sustainable approach and enhance everyone’s quality of life.”\nProfessor Ben Feringa, who won the 2016 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the development of molecular machines, adds: “This is a very ambitious program that combines modern science and technology to create new opportunities for the future of healthcare and keep it affordable.” Professor Feringa is a pioneer in the field of molecular engines, catalysis and smart medication. \nHealth EU is being coordinated by EPFL in association with the University of Twente and HDMT (Organ on Chip association), both based in the Netherlands, and represented in the coordination board by professor Albert van den Berg.

{"id": 338, "text": "Mankind first set foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969. Five decades on, thoughts have turned to establishing a permanent settlement there. Over 150 students have descended on the mountain village of Zermatt as part of IGLUNA, a project coordinated by EPFL’s Swiss Space Center under the European Space Agency’s  initiative. The multidisciplinary teams will all be working toward the same goal: building a “habitat in the ice” that might one day be deployed on the Moon.\nSupporting human life in an extreme environment is no easy task. The students spent the 2018/2019 academic year working on answers to some of the many challenging questions – both human and technological – that such an endeavor raises. How should the habitat be structured? Where will oxygen, food and power come from? How will settlers communicate and carry out research? What about their health and welfare?\nDestination: Zermatt\nThe students headed to Zermatt in the Swiss Alps on 17 June for their field work. “The students are very much working as one team, sharing their modules and concepts,” says Tatiana Benavides, who leads the project at the Swiss Space Center. “Put it all together and you can see how people might one day live on the Moon.”\nThe students’ work is on display in two separate locations: conceptual and design pieces at the Vernissage Art Gallery (Backstage Hotel), and scientific and technical pieces at the Glacier Palace – Klein Matterhorn. . “As well as presenting their work, the students are also testing out the habitat and robots, checking whether the plants grow and conducting scientific experiments,” adds Benavides. “They may not be sleeping under the ice, but they’re operating in real-world conditions all the same.”\nEPFL shoots for the moon \nAt EPFL, students from several schools have been busy working on the project since September. The team, led by architect and lecturer Pierre Zurbrügg, built an igloo-like habitat 15 meters below the surface of the Klein Matterhorn glacier, which stands 3,883 meters above sea level. The structure, made from load-bearing and insulating materials, was designed and built by students from the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) as part of the “Living on Mars” teaching unit. “We had to factor in the practical constraints of the IGLUNA field site,” explains Zurbrügg. “For instance, we needed to be able to transport the materials, assemble the habitat quickly, and work in temperatures of -4°C. We opted for a brick structure that’s relatively easy to assemble. It took just three days to build.”\nWhat would life be like inside the habitat? “Our team thought long and hard about life support,” adds Zurbrügg. “Simply surviving isn’t enough. We needed somewhere people could actually live.” The students’ idea was to harness the metabolic processes of the people and plants inside the habitat to create a life cycle and keep waste to a minimum. They also produced a complete 3D model of their habitat, with computer-generated images and an interactive animation showing what different parts of the environment would look like.\nA team from GrowbotHub – a joint initiative between EPFL, UNIL and urban farming non-profit Légumes Perchés – designed a fully automated food production system for growing and harvesting fruit and vegetables in extreme conditions. “Our job is to assemble the structure and install the robot inside the habitat,” explains Victoria Letertre, a robotics student at EPFL who was involved in programming the robot. “The SWAG team from Zürich is responsible for the aeroponics systems, and for growing and tending to crops in the lunar environment.”\nThe EPFL team considered various other aspects of life on the Moon. For instance, they used 3D laser shock peening – a technique developed at the Laboratory of Thermomechanical Metallurgy (LMTM) – to design a saw capable of cutting through the ice. In another collaboration, this time between the Swiss Space Center and EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB), cameras were installed to monitor human behavior inside the igloo. Motion-capture algorithms were used to analyze the footage and identify where habitat design and safety improvements could be made.\nAn ongoing human and scientific endeavor\n“Our fascination with space comes from our natural curiosity and our desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge,” says Benavides. “Living on the Moon is an immense challenge. Yet the technologies that the students have developed could have applications here on Earth, too – in extreme environments or in the aftermath of natural disasters, for example.”\nAs IGLUNA 2019 draws to a close, the Swiss Space Center is preparing to run the project again next year. “It’s been an incredible learning experience on both the human and technology fronts,” adds Benavides. “Some of the teams are planning to continue honing their prototypes next year. We’re also looking forward to receiving new proposals.” The  closes on 21 July 2019.\n“For me, IGLUNA is a dream come true. I never imagined I’d be working on a robot that could one day be sent to the Moon,” says Letertre. “And if an opportunity arose for me to go into space, I’d be there in a heartbeat!", "summary": "On 17 June, students from EPFL and 12 other European universities headed to Zermatt as part of the IGLUNA project.

{"id": 343, "text": "Making a skateboard from fiberglass instead of wood makes sense: fiberglass is waterproof and more resilient than the materials used in commercially available boards, and it lends itself to new skateboard designs. This is the concept behind the Master’s project thought up by Anastasios Vassilopoulos – a senior scientist at EPFL’s Composite Construction Laboratory (CCLab), which is a hybrid civil engineering/architecture lab – and Jean-François Molinari, a full professor and head of the Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LSMS), part of EPFL’s Civil Engineering Institute. People attending Vivapoly on Thursday, 24 May will be able to try out the fiberglass skateboard at the Travel GC stand.\n“We wanted to come up with a project that was a little fancier than usual. So we asked a student not only to dimension a structural component, but also to make it himself and test it, to observe its strengths and weaknesses. We thought designing a skateboard would be a good idea as it was feasible to manufacture and validate the functionality of our product. In any case, the dimensioning method is similar for composite materials whether you’re making a skateboard, a bridge or an aircraft – apart from the proportions and the specifications of course,” says Vassilopoulos. For the professor, this approach has two advantages: it forced the student to go beyond the analytical level and gave him the satisfaction of making a finished product.\nDamien Sommer, a civil engineering student who is also an elite volleyball player and avid skateboarder, took up the challenge. Because he is six feet tall, he needed to make a board that would not flex too much under his weight. As a result, the first part of his project was to calculate how fiberglass would behave under various loads, based on the classical theory of laminated composite materials. To do that, he used quality standards regarding the flexural rigidity of a skateboard derived by the French engineer Anthony Bert, whom he contacted.\nOn that basis, he was adapt the flexural rigidity of the fiberglass skateboards to the usual values preferred for the conventional wooden skateboards. Sommer validated his design by making prototypes and performing several experimental investigations, using equipment from the Structural Engineering Group (GIS/ENAC) and the Laboratory of Applied Mechanics and Reliability Analysis, part of the School of Engineering (STI).\nLonger life\n These days, composite materials like glass or carbon fibers reinforced polymers are only used in certain parts of a skateboard, to strengthen the basic wooden structure. However, many skis, snowboards and bicycles are made entirely of fiber reinforced polymer materials, giving them unique mechanical properties. What is the reason for not having composite skateboards yet? “Maybe skateboard manufacturers just like to stick with what they know. Developing a 100%-fiberglass skateboard requires a little more technical knowledge. Nevertheless, materials and manufacturing are not much more expensive, and a fiberglass skateboard will have a much longer life than a wooden board that absorbs moisture and always ends up breaking,” notes Sommer.\nHe is well aware of this problem, since he has a whole collection of broken skateboard pieces in his attic, which he upcycles into frames for sunglasses. In terms of how they feel to ride, fiberglass skateboards initially take skaters by surprise, according to Sommer: “For the first few minutes, you really have to adjust your technique, because when you land a trick, you feel the board flexing under your feet. This is when traditional wooden skateboards normally break.”\nFuture developments\n Sommer first started working on this idea in a semester project in winter 2017, where he focused on a fiberglass-reinforced wooden skateboard. Then came his Master’s project. According to Sommer and the two professors who supervised his work, the fiberglass board could be made even more rigid, making it possible to perform more tricks. The time required to make the skateboard, its thickness and its cost could also be reduced.\n“The beauty of composite materials like fiberglass reinforced polymers is that they offer much more design possibilities than conventional materials. For example, we can decide how rigid and thick we want the board to be by adjusting the fiber architecture of the material, and therefore make more versatile skateboards,” says Vassilopoulos. As a result, the quest for the perfect skateboard is continuing this spring at EPFL: a new semester project is under way and a new Master’s project, this time focusing on design and on optimizing skateboard production process is offered to interested students of EPFL.\nPress kit (documents, images and videos): http://bit.ly/Skateboard_EPFL", "summary": "For his Master’s project, a civil engineering student at EPFL dimensioned and then made a fiberglass skateboard.

{"id": 346, "text": "The new “heart” of EPFL will be decked-out in grand style. Situated just up from the Rolex Learning Center, the mechanical engineering halls and the former central library will be completely transformed and extended.\nAt the end of the call for bids involving several main contractors, who in turn appointed renowned architects, it was the Swiss group Karl Steiner that won the business, thanks to the architectural designs of the Frenchman. The work of Dominique Perrault includes the creation of France’s National Library (the François Mitterand site) in Paris (1995), but also the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, the Ewha Women’s University in Seoul, South Korea and the Fukoku Tower in Osaka. In Switzerland, Dominique Perrault is currently redesigning the whole site of the Swiss Federal Railways station in Locarno.\nThe budget for this project will be partly covered by the credit of 67 million Swiss francs accorded by the Federal Parliament at the end of 2009. Starting this year, the work is a follow-up – to a certain extent – to the building of the Rolex Learning Center, since the content of the central library has been moved to EPFL’s flagship building, freeing up significant space. The project will enable the regrouping of part of the central services of the school, and the creation of several new laboratories intended for the students of the School of Engineering. The Center for Neuroprosthetics, which was started at the end of 2008, and is supported by several foundations – including the Bertarelli family and Defitech (Sylviane and Daniel Borel) – will thus benefit from a dedicated and perfectly equipped location.\n“The winning project convinced us because it establishes a strong link between the older buildings on the campus and the new constructions on the South side of the campus”, explains Francis-Luc Perret, Vice-President of EPFL, responsible for real estate and president of the jury. The architect has created a new, dynamic space, halfway between the Rolex Learning Center and the Center of Congress under construction on the North side.\nIn a second stage, a rather unusual building, the highest on the campus, may be constructed just up from the Avenue Piccard, which crosses the site from South to North. Dubbed the “Teaching Bridge” by the architect, this structure – subject to the availability of funding – will house several levels of buildings intended for teaching. “As well as giving back life and coherence to what is rather an oddly conceived passage, this new space dedicated to training puts the emphasis on the modern pedagogical forms that our school wishes to promote”, concludes Francis-Luc Perret, who is pleased to note that the architect has integrated in his reasoning a genuine urbanistic reflection “that creates a new dynamic at the heart of the campus”.\nHigh-res pictures:", "summary": "The project to transform the former mechanical engineering halls and the central library of EPFL has been awarded to the Karl Steiner company.

{"id": 347, "text": "As one year ends and another begins, this is a good time to reflect on what has been a truly remarkable 12 months for EPFL. For starters, the School celebrated its  as a federal institute of technology with a year-long program of special events. Yet it’s been a busy year on other fronts, too: EPFL’s students and researchers have continued to push the boundaries of science; the School has launched a string of initiatives in teaching and research; startups and spin-offs have gone from strength to strength; and the awards and honors have come thick and fast. There have been so many highlights that it’s impossible to list them all. But here are some of the standout moments of 2019.\nTaking research as our starting point, robotics, artificial intelligence and energy technologies took center stage this year. The robot cast list reads like something from a science-fiction movie: biocompatible elastic microrobots, robots that recreate the gait of extinct animals, gummy-like robots that stimulate biological tissue, robots that enable bees and fish to talk to each other, robot-ants that can communicate, fly-like robots designed by artificial intelligence, and even a robotic insect that can survive being flattened by a fly swatter.\nTurning to energy technologies, the honor roll is no less impressive: photovoltaic panels that use snow to create more solar power in the winter, more energy-efficient cruise ships, energy-producing buildings, a device that generates hydrogen by concentrating sunlight, a system that turns wastewater sludge into energy and mineral salts, and perovskite solar cells tested for real-world performance.\nThe year’s breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have been just as remarkable: an AI-based app to save bees, another to predict when and where lightning will strike, an AI-driven system that uncovers security flaws, algorithms developed to study the dynamics of network structures using Wikipedia or to detect outside influences on the media, a solution for detecting deepfakes, and a big data toolkit for precision medicine.\nOther research highlights include a strong, lightweight concrete, a self-healing advanced composite, a photonic chip for at-home disease detection, a metal-organic framework that mimics DNA, a chip to measure vacuums, an important step towards understanding tumor biology, bioprinted living tissue, and a model of the flight of dandelion seeds.\nResearchers aside, students have played their part in raising EPFL’s profile on the international stage this year. In July, the EPFLoop team headed to Los Angeles for the Hyperloop Pod Competition, organized by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, where they secured an impressive third-place finish. In August, an EPFL team walked away with the energy efficiency award for their lightweight boat in the HydroContest challenge, held on Lake Neuchâtel in Yverdon-les-Bains. And in November, the EPFL bioengineering team won the grand prize of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition for their diagnostic test for grapevine disease. EPFL students will take part in no fewer than ten interdisciplinary challenges in 2020, as well as the international IGLUNA project.\nCollaborations with other institutions\nTeaming up with leading partners is yet another hallmark of EPFL’s performance – and it’s been a particularly busy year on this front as well. In 2019, the School joined forces with the Defitech Foundation, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL) to set up NeuroRestore, a new center aimed at restoring lost neurological function. Other highlights included a new joint Master’s degree in Cyber Security with ETH Zurich, a cooperation agreement with the Canton of Vaud for specific initiatives related to digitalization and innovative teaching methods in EPFL’s core subjects, and the Enterprise for Society Center (E4S), a joint initiative with UNIL and IMD to train future managers to meet the challenges of sustainability and social responsibility.\nThe year has also been a resounding success for EPFL’s startups. Two spin-offs, Flyability and Lunaphore, took first and second places in the 2019 TOP 100 Swiss Startup Awards, ClearSpace was selected to lead a major European Space Agency (ESA) space debris capture and deorbiting project, and Learn To Forecast (L2F) launched the Giotto project, an open-source, free-of-charge library that pushes AI forward by making it more reliable and intuitive.\nHonors and appointments\nAnd there’s more. EPFL appointed 37 new professors in 2019, including 15 women, and the School celebrated 1,028 new Master’s graduates in October. That same month, Claudia R. Binder – a professor at the Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS) – was named the new dean of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC); she will take up this position on 1 January 2020. Also in 2019, Michael Grätzel, who directs EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, claimed the number-one spot in a new ranking of the world’s top 100,000 scientists across all fields. The ranking method is based on new, more accurate standardized citation metrics developed by scientists led by Stanford University.", "summary": "EPFL held a series of events to mark its 50th anniversary throughout 2019.

This ecological step is available to everyone, and provides a simple way to become an “active consumer”. Developed by Laurent Fabre and Fabrizio Lo Conte, doctoral students at the Laboratory of Electronics, these intelligent units communicate with one another via the electricity network, which enables an easy and rapid installation. \n Easily adaptable, this system can be added to ceiling lights or directly into the wall sockets of new buildings. For this invention, the two doctoral students have won the first prize of the PERL trophy, awarded for the 8th year by the town of Lausanne. The prize of 50,000 Swiss francs that accompanies the award will enable them to create a start-up company to commercialize the solution.\n The information is transmitted in real-time to a software program. Through an interface, which can be a computer, a touch-screen , an iPad or a mobile telephone, anyone can obtain a detailed list of their electricity consumption, remotely switch on or off lights and appliances, and even decide to have softened lighting in some rooms. The system can also include a gauge which turns red when the electricity consumption becomes abnormally high.\nLet’s imagine that all the sockets are equipped with such devices: we can then know in real-time – or almost – the consumption of a building, district, town or even a country. “The technology developed by Laurent Fabre and Fabrizio Lo Conte is the first link of a vast network of responsible management of energy”, emphasizes Maher Kayal, director of the laboratory. The electricity grid will thereby become intelligent: the goal is to optimize the relation between supply and demand by using electronic technologies.\nMany research projects are being conducted in this area, also known as “smartgrid”. However, the Laboratory of Electronics has set its sights even higher. It is working on putting this network on a tiny chip which will enable the management of this information practically in real-time for a cost lower than that of the current installations. “This technology will encourage the use of sustainable energies”, envisages the professor, “because they can adapt easily to demand – unlike nuclear plants, for which advance forecasting and planning is necessary to adapt the production.”\nMindmaze receives the second prize\n The second prize of the PERL trophy – 20,000 Swiss francs – has also been awarded to an EPFL doctoral student. Tadi Tej, of the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, is working on the development of a device that will enable people with brain injuries to perform daily activities using virtual reality.

{"id": 359, "text": "SolAce – which opened its doors today at the NEST building in Dübendorf – is a pilot unit where researchers will test new technology for sustainable living and optimal user comfort. The building will generate more power than it uses (for heating and electricity) and will be carbon neutral or even carbon negative. Intended to be a combined working-living space, it has a bedroom with two separate beds, a kitchen and a living room. “By reducing the amount of commuter traffic from people going to and from work, we can make a substantial cut in carbon emissions. Two researchers will live and work at SolAce for two years to try out our idea of a dual-purpose building,” says Jean-Louis Scartezzini, head of EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) and the SolAce project leader.\n SolAce is the fifth pilot unit to open at NEST, which is a modular building where researchers work with construction-industry businesses on joint R&D projects through an initiative spearheaded by Swiss federal research institutes Empa and eawag. The building consists of a central tower or ‘backbone’ surrounded by three open platforms where pilot units equipped with the latest sustainable-living technology can be installed on a plug-and-play basis. Units already at the building include Urban Mining, which is built entirely from recycled materials, and Vision Wood, which is exploring revolutionary new ways of using wood. SolAce joins them as a 100 m² apartment-laboratory where LESO-PB researchers can test out sensors and other technology they have developed under real-world conditions.\nA façade that doubles as a solar power plant \nThe unit’s façade is designed to be energy positive all year long. It’s covered with a special colored glazing for photovoltaic (PV) sensors and thermal collectors. “Because the nano-coating is highly transparent, it allows for minimal absorption and very little energy loss,” says Andreas Schüler, head of the Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Conversion research group at LESO-PB. This technology was developed and patented at EPFL and is currently being marketed by EPFL spin-off SwissINSO. The large surplus in solar power that SolAce generates will be stored in NEST’s Energy Hub so that anyone at the building can use it, including researchers at other pilot units.\nSmart windows \nSolAce’s special triple-glazed windows have a selective coating that lets mobile-phone waves pass through. Their glazing also contains 3D microstructures that can redirect light to darker areas of the unit. These ‘micro mirrors’ are invisible to the naked eye; in the winter, they can reflect light up to the ceiling to create more uniform interior lighting and help distribute solar heat. In the summer, they can bounce sunlight back outside the unit to prevent it from getting uncomfortably hot.\nCameras that imitate the human eye\nAs another comfort-enhancing feature, the LESO-PB researchers have installed mini cameras that respond to light in the same way as the human eye. These prototype sensors continually measure the amount of lighting and glare that a building occupant experiences, and software linked to the sensors instantly adjusts the unit’s blinds and electric lighting accordingly – while taking into account the occupants’ circadian rhythms. “We plan to carry out further research to make interior lighting even more comfortable and distribute light exactly when and where it’s needed, in order to match users’ circadian rhythms. We hope our technology can help naturally enhance the productivity of people working in an office,” says Ali Motamed, a post-doc researcher at LESO-PB.", "summary": "EPFL’s SolAce pilot unit was inaugurated today at the NEST R&D center on the Empa campus in Dübendorf, Switzerland.

{"id": 361, "text": "The Arctic is warming two or three times faster than the rest of the planet. This amplified warming is due to several factors, but the relative importance of each one remains still unclear. “We do know, however, that clouds could play an important role,” says Julia Schmale, an EPFL professor who heads the  and holds the Ingvar Kamprad Chair. “By reflecting the sun’s rays back into space or trapping heat close to the Earth’s surface like a blanket, clouds help either cool off or warm up the planet.”\nSchmale – along with scientists from the and Stockholm University’s  and  – spent several weeks collecting data near the North pole in August and September 2018, as part of the US-Swedish expedition \nArctic Ocean 2018\n on board the Swedish icebreaker \nOden\n. The scientists measured the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric molecules and aerosol particles to better understand the conditions leading to cloud formation.\nHow aerosols are formed in the Arctic \n“One of our objectives was to investigate how new aerosol particles could form in the Arctic atmosphere,” says Andrea Baccarini, a PhD student at the Paul Scherrer Institute and now scientific collaborator in the extreme Environments research Laboratory. “Under the right conditions, gas molecules condense together into small clusters that can grow, eventually forming aerosols.” If these aerosols grow even just a small amount larger, they can function as cloud condensation nuclei, which are essential for cloud formation.\nIn the Arctic summer and fall, the concentration of aerosols is extremely low. “The contribution of newly formed aerosols can be extremely important and even a small change in aerosol concentration in the high Arctic could have a major impact on cloud formation or alter clouds’ radiative properties,” says Baccarini. It is also still not clear how important local aerosol processes are to cloud formation in comparison to regional or long-range transport, for example. “With this expedition, we could investigate the exact sources of aerosol particles that are needed to form clouds” adds Paul Zieger, an assistant professor at Stockholm University who led the research project on aerosol-cloud processes of the 2018 expedition.\nIodic acid appears in early fall \nThe research team found that iodic acid, a chemical compound which had not previously been observed in the region, triggers the formation of new aerosols between late summer and early fall. “There is less ice in the Arctic at the end of the summer, a lot of open water and the concentration of iodic acid is very low at that point,” says Schmale. “Towards the end of August the temperature drops and the water starts refreezing, marking the beginning of the so called \nfreeze-up\n period. This is when the iodic acid concentration sharply increases leading to frequent new aerosol particle formation events’’.\nThe team developed a simple model to explain the variability of iodic acid in the atmosphere, which largely depends on local meteorological conditions. They were also able to describe the full chain of events that leads all the way from new particle formation to clouds, from the gas molecule that initially creates a particle to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei. “Observing and describing this process under real-world conditions was an extremely rare opportunity”, says Schmale.\nTheir findings, recently  provide greater insight into the role of biogeochemical processes for cloud formation over the Arctic pack ice and potentially also for Arctic warming.\nResearch partners\n*Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen PSI, Switzerland\n*Department of Environmental Science & Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University, Sweden\n*Department of Physics & Atmospheric Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada\n*School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, UK\n*Department of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate, Institute of Physical Chemistry Rocasolano, CSIC, Spain\n*Department of Meteorology & Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University, Sweden\n*School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, EPFL, Switzerland", "summary": "An international team of scientists from EPFL, the Paul Scherrer Institute and Stockholm University has identified a novel driver of new aerosol particle formation in the Arctic during the summer to fall transition.

{"id": 366, "text": "A century ago, Switzerland decided to electrify its railways. Out went coal, coal pollution and energy dependency. Today, what about switching all our cars over to electricity? The air would be cleaner, but what would be the impact on electricity demand, employment and tax income? This is the topic of Cihan Cavdarli’s Master Thesis in Energy Management.\nHis first conclusion: if all cars in Switzerland were electric, total electricity demand would rise by 19-24% depending on the scenario. Should this make us think twice? Not at all, if we look at the bigger picture. To measure the impact of the widespread use of electric vehicles, Cihan took many other factors into account – economic, environmental, technological and tax-related. “The positive impact of switching to electricity generally outweighs the negative impact, apart from some extreme cases,” said Cihan.\nAnticipating the country’s phasing out of nuclear power, Cihan looked at two scenarios. One assumes a high carbon footprint, with nuclear energy replaced by gas. The other boasts a low carbon footprint, with renewable energies stepping into the nuclear breach. “This latter scenario is the best fit for electric cars,” added Cihan.\nHe based his work on the scenarios drawn up by the research institute Prognose. He also used the  calculator, developed by the Energy Center, to estimate marginal electricity generation - in other words. the source of the additional kWh to power electric cars for each scenario.\nCihan took into account primary energy consumption (before transformation, storage and transport) for both internal-combustion and electric vehicles. Under the assumption that energy efficiency will improve, the consumption of primary energy by electric vehicles will decrease. Depending on the scenario, this decrease is expected to be 16-23% by 2035. So that evens things out.\nThe environment also stands to gain. Private vehicles currently account for 25% of CO\n2\n emissions. In the best case this figure would fall to 5% (with a second life for batteries); in the worst case, 10%. In addition, even if only a third of vehicles were electric, nitrogen oxide emissions would be cut in half.\nA tax on electrical vehicles?\nWhen it comes to the impact on tax revenues, things get a little more complicated: taxes on fossil fuels currently account for 8% of Switzerland's tax income. “Tax revenues will go down unless the tax on mineral oils is shifted to electric vehicles,” said Cihan. But the tax impact would be reduced. This is because internal-combustion engines are becoming increasingly efficient, which means that fuel consumption is on the decline. And the country will save money on fuel imports. The savings will be even higher since the energy will come from locally produced renewable energies.\nIn view of their price tag, electric vehicles are not yet economical. But by 2020 they should cost the same as gas-powered ones. As long as the government doesn’t tax electric vehicles – and oil prices don’t rise to $180 a barrel.", "summary": "Summer Series on Student Projects - Cihan Cavdarli has analyzed the various impacts of a complete switchover to electric cars in Switzerland.

It only takes 30 seconds to make a booking. The website is initially being launched for the Motor Show, starting on 1 March, and will then be a permanent fixture. A life-size test for the start-up. And for Palexpo, who intends to use its services for other shows. \" The simplicity of use of this technology could be useful for the reservation of our rooms for other large-scale shows \", underlines Manuel Garcia, director of technology and finances at Palexpo.\nThe system is designed to be flexible and collaborative. People with space to rent propose time slots directly to the user. They set the price, which can change in real time in order to draw in users and maximize occupancy. Users can rate the spaces for such things as quality and confidentiality. “This latter point is very important for business meetings,” said Nicolas Fete, who heads the start-up. “For example, the highest level of confidentiality means that the room can be reached without walking through the main hallways.” This service indeed appears to fill a gap, since a variety of organizations, including the Geneva train station, are keen to use it.\nFête is full of ideas and ambition for developing the website further. To ensure his platform has a solid technological base to which these options can be easily added, Fete is working in collaboration with Christine Vanoirbeek, head of group at the MEDIA research lab.

No luck. “When you’re abroad, it’s even harder to find an office,” he said. “The advantage of GetYourDesk is that users don’t have to be familiar with the region to find an office, because the website guarantees the quality of the workspaces.” He also plans to expand his service beyond Switzerland’s borders in the near future. Isn’t there already something similar on the market? “Nothing as flexible and efficient.” Fête believes that his concept could change the way people work: “This platform could help reduce work-related travel by providing an alternative to working at home.

{"id": 371, "text": "On 4 October 2016, Hurricane Matthew wrought havoc in southwestern Haiti. The cholera outbreak that it triggered, coming in the middle of the rainy season, simply added to the prevailing chaos in that country.\nResearchers at EPFL were soon contacted by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and asked for their help in predicting the number of new cases of cholera in real time. What for? To provide organizations battling the epidemic on the ground with the information they need to make the right decisions at the right time.\nThis is the first time that EPFL and MSF have teamed up to fight an epidemic. Their approach is based on a mathematical model that EPFL built in 2010; the researchers simply had to redesign it so that it would provide real-time projections. The model factors in a broad range of data associated with the spread of cholera, including the latest recorded cases, people flows, and rain forecasts.\n“When Hurricane Matthew hit, MSF saw a need for EPFL's model, which is widely recognized in this field. We were familiar with the model and asked the researchers to apply it to the current epidemic,” says Anton Camacho, who specializes in modeling infectious diseases. Camacho works for Epicentre, an association that conducts epidemiological research for MSF.\nIn mid-October, two researchers in EPFL's Laboratory of Ecohydrology (ECHO) took up the challenge: Flavio Finger, a PhD student in environmental engineering who specializes in modeling cholera epidemics, and Damiano Pasetto, a mathematician doing a postdoc at EPFL with expertise in real-time projections. The researchers turn their projections into best- and worst-case epidemic scenarios, and the information is then sent to Camacho at Epicentre, who includes them in the reports provided to the specialists working to contain the outbreak.\nObjective and non-political data\nThe scenarios that the researchers predict add a scientific component to the information gathered on the ground. Their projections supported the World Health Organization's (WHO) decision to run a vaccination campaign in departments in southern Haiti in November: “The researchers’ objective and non-political data proved crucial when the World Health Organization decided to deliver a million vaccine doses this past fall during the rainy season,” says Camacho. “Their model is very flexible. We can factor in ongoing vaccination efforts, predict how the epidemic will develop over time and plan future vaccination campaigns.” Flavio Finger adds: “That said, we must bear in mind that our projections always include a margin of error. For example, the rain forecasts provided by NASA are accurate in the short term but less so over longer periods. It can also be hard to predict where people will go, especially in the midst of an outbreak.”\nFinger had already worked on this model in 2013 in Haiti and this past spring in Senegal (see article links below). In both cases, however, modeling was carried out after the cholera epidemics had ended. That back-testing approach – mapping out how those epidemics spread – was used to refine the existing model, and in Haiti’s current crisis, the model’s real-time capability is crucial. This is where Pasetto’s math skills and Finger’s in-depth knowledge of the subject come into play.\nWorking together seamlessly\n“Working together and seeing the impact immediately adds a whole new dimension and sense of urgency to our research,” said Finger. Camacho notes: “This initiative is a good example of how an NGO and the academic world can work together effectively. We were able to act quickly in response to an evolving epidemic. Analyzing data in real time forced us to work differently – this included automating our processes in order to save time.”\nMSF decided to publish the researchers’ data on an  throughout the process.

{"id": 374, "text": "Do you think you know all there is to know about Star Wars? You may change your mind after reading this article. Using a new computer program, EPFL researchers revealed some interesting statistics on the famous saga. Drawing on the principles of graph theory, which harnesses computing power and mathematical calculations, they analyzed hundreds of web pages devoted to the legendary film series created in the 1970s by producer George Lucas. Apart from highlighting Star Wars geeks’ prodigious output, their study could prove interesting for a large number of scientific fields when it comes to extracting and analyzing data.\nThe Star Wars universe is huge. In addition to seven full-length films, the story is further developed in ways the general public may not follow, such as books and video games, which have gradually added episodes and expanded the saga. The EPFL study, which was conducted at the Signal Processing Laboratory 2 (LTS2) under the direction of Professor Vandergheynst, gives some idea of the scope of the saga.\n80% human beings\n“Fans will be surprised to learn, for example, that we came up with over 20,000 characters,” said Kirell Benzi, a PhD student and the project lead. Among them, 7,500 play an important role. There are also 1,367 Jedi and 724 Sith. All the characters are spread among 640 different communities on 294 planets. And an analysis of the 10 largest communities reveals an aberration: nearly 80% of the galaxy’s population is human.\nPart of the Star Wars character graph colored by era. Black nodes represent missing values. Red nodes: the Rise of the Empire Era (episodes 1,2,3). Blue nodes: the Rebellion era (episodes 4,5,6). Green ones: both eras.Figure 2: Result of the label propagation algorithm. Black nodes have been replaced by the best compromise using their neighbors. \nMapping out connections\nThe researchers want to use this study to demonstrate the program’s ability to extract and analyze digital data. “The program maps out connections in the mass of unorganized data available on the net,” said Benzi.\nGiven a huge amount of information, the algorithms developed by the LTS2 researchers offer a service that cannot be matched by human beings. In addition to extracting data according to extremely precise criteria, the algorithms can also create links among data points, sort them, quantify them, interpret them and find missing information. All this in very little time. The results are then presented in the form of interactive charts that are easy to read and understand.\nIn the long run, this tool could find applications in many fields. “Once enough documents and archives have been digitized,” said Bresson, “this method could be useful in filling knowledge gaps that remain in historical and sociological research and in numerous scientific fields as well.”\nHere is Kirell Benzi’s blog, where he summarizes the results of the study. In the future, he intends to pursue the analysis with the transmission of the “force” from Jedi and Sith masters to their pupils.\nAnother example of the application of graph theory: performers at the Montreux Jazz Festival.", "summary": "Using a new computer program, EPFL researchers offer unusual insight into the universe of Star Wars, which includes more than 20,000 characters spread among 640 communities over a period of 36,000 years.", "claim": "Using a new computer program, EPFL researchers offer unusual insight into the universe of Star Wars, which includes more than 20,000 characters spread among 640 communities over a period of the 1970s.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [32, 33], "noise": false}
{"id": 376, "text": "The great Lake Kariba, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, is contained by an imposing 128-meter-high arch dam, built between 1955 and 1959. The lake is twice the volume of Lake Geneva, and drains a basin equivalent to 16 times the surface area of Switzerland.\nThe nature of the climate of this tropical zone obliges the owner of the dam, the Zambezi River Authority, to regularly open the enormous spillway gates during floods. This operation, however, has consequences: in the bed of the Zambezi river, a huge scour hole has been eroded by high-velocity jets leaving the six spillway openings – each 9 meters by 9 – with a rate of 9 million liters per second. “This scour hole is now 70 to 80 meters deeper than the river bed”, explains Anton Schleiss, Director of EPFL’s Hydraulic Constructions Laboratory. \nWorld-renowned for its competence in the study of the erosion of rock formations by high-velocity jets, the laboratory was commissioned by the Zambezi River Authority to assess the gravity of the situation. “However, no sensor would be able to resist the violence of the water flowing into this river”, explains Michael Pfister, scientific employee at the LCH. “This is why it was necessary to proceed with creating a model of the dam and the river below it.”\nThe physical model was designed and developed in about three months by teams from EPFL and some external providers. It’s 65 times smaller than the actual dam. “Mathematical similarity laws enable us to extrapolate the measurements that we take on our physical model, to determine what happens under real conditions”, explains Anton Schleiss. And this, “even though certain parameters such as the viscosity of the water don’t change with respect to the scale”, adds Michael Pfister. “This is the essence of the art of modeling: to choose the right scale in order to get usable results, while keeping the hydraulic model to a reasonable size.”\nThe systematic measurements, taken using pressure sensors installed in the bottom of the model, were began last week. The model dam is powered by the laboratory pumps, working in a closed circuit, that enable the circulation of more than 300 liters per second.\nThe scientists will now try to modify certain parameters, in order to identify practical solutions and mitigation measures which should avoid the problems that the owners of the dam will certainly face if the erosion continues at the same rate. “It will probably mean enlarging the scour hole in downstream direction, using underwater mining methods, to allow a more efficient dissipation of these enormous amount of energy”, believes Anton Schleiss. However, only the results of the measurements and simulations performed on the model after its transformation will allow us to evaluate whether this approach is appropriate or not.", "summary": "The dam creating Lake Kariba and its spillway have been modeled in EPFL’s Hydraulic Constructions Laboratory.

{"id": 377, "text": "Competing against athletes from five countries (United States, Russia, Korea, India and France) Swiss paraplegic athlete and handbike champion Silke Pan took part in the, a cybernetic race organised by ETH Zürich. The former acrobat adorned the TWIICE exoskeleton especially designed for her by EPFL scientists. She raced through a 40 meter-long circuit that included seven types of obstacles like stairs, inclined slopes, rough terrain and a slalom around tables.\nTWIICE is a lower limb exoskeleton developed by the EPFL research group . It consists of actuated segments at the hip and knee joints that are rigidly interfaced with the thighs and the tibiae. A smart controller coordinates these segments to move according to desired gait trajectories that enable a person with spinal cord injury to walk.\nSilke Pan took the silver medal in the finals on Saturday afternoon, just behind the Korean Byeong-Uk and his team Angel Robotic 1. \"A second place is just wonderful!\" she reacted after the results were announced. \"I was responsible for bringing to success all the work that had been done before by the TWIICE team. We worked together to perfect every aspect of the race. On D-Day we all gave our best, and we have nothing to regret. We can be proud of what we have achieved, of all the improvements we have made to the exoskeleton since 2016. The Cybathlon is a motivation to go even further and in that sense it has allowed us to progress.\"\nMohamed Bouri, , was not hiding his satisfaction: \"The team has invested itself fully and this result is well deserved. We are particularly happy for Silke, who wanted a victory so badly and was afraid of disappointing us. It couldn't be the case, because it was a team effort. There are no winners or losers, only hope, because the Cybathlon pushes us to make assistive devices more accessible for people with disabilities. Looking ahead, I would be happy to see this development result in a product marketed by a future startup that would have every chance of becoming a technological flagship in the Lake Geneva region. The Cybathlon has allowed us to explore several control strategies and efficient trajectories. To do even better, we need to push back the limits of our knowledge even further, and that is the beauty of science\". Mohamed Bouri also thanked the people in the TWIICE team: Tristan Vouga, Romain Baud, Jemina Fasola, Alireza Manzoori and Julien Pache.\nTristan Vouga, EPFL Cybathlon team leader and co-designer of the TWIICE exoskeleton, believes that \"the Cybathlon has achieved its goal, because all the teams have made great strides in their technological developments since 2016. Today there are no losers, we are all victorious while facing the limits that a disability can represent. I am very proud to be part of such a close-knit and dynamic team. I would like to thank Silke for this magnificent feat, she has inspired us throughout this great adventure with unfailing determination!\"\nThe result of extensive training\n A professional athlete, Silke Pan is more than acquainted with intense competition. Throughout the year, she trains daily on the handbike and in hand balancing, 3 to 5 hours per day during the height of the training season. Every day, she goes outside with her handbike and does endurance, interval and power training in preparation for various hand-bike regional and international competitions, like Europe's Cup, the World Cup, the World Championships and the Paralympics, that are planned to resume in 2021.\nFor the past month and a half, Silke Pan and the EPFL TWIICE team have been training one afternoon per week at EPFL's Lausanne campus in preparation for the race. Wearing TWIICE, Pan started by learning all the gestures of the circuit with slow and deliberate movements. As the training sessions continued, Pan progressively stepped up the intensity and tempo of her movements to increase her speed. During the race, she was followed by two scientists to ensure her safety.\nImprovement of the exoskeleton \n “Since the beginning of the training sessions, the exoskeleton has been in constant improvement thanks to Silke's input and her drive to win,” explains Tristan Vouga. “We gained 4 minutes in the last month and 45 seconds during the last training session alone. Our latest upgrade consists of a more flexible foot that can conform to the terrain. More generally, the latest version of the exoskeleton is much more ergonomic and provides more autonomy for its pilot, so Silke for instance can now go directly from her wheelchair into the exoskeleton by herself.\"\n The current version of the exoskeleton, called TWIICE One, is more compact due to improved design of the motors, thanks to a collaboration with Swiss industry partner Sonceboz SA, specialized in electrical motor manufacturing. According to Vouga, TWIICE One is therefore easier to use than the 2016 model: it is closer to the body because the motors are two times more compact and two times stronger. Other strategic partnerships include a collaboration with the local company Fischer Connectors for improving the ergonomics and usability of cables.\nOnline race\n The latest coronavirus sanitary measures prevented the Cybathlon from happening live in Zürich. Silke Pan's participation in the exoskeleton race was therefore organized and pre-recorded at EPFL. The winner was determined based on three rounds of the race. The performances of each athlete was recorded in the presence of a referee from the Cybathlon committee, in their country of residence.\nA fundamental right to mobility\n “An exoskeleton to assist a person affected by paraplegia does not only concern mobility. It also concerns basic human rights, the right to live as others, the right to share social spaces, the right to walk and to own vertical space,” says Bouri. “Alongside our colleagues in Zürich, our participation via EPFL at the Cybathlon promotes an attitude in favor of increasing access to exoskeleton technology for providing daily assistance to a wider audience.”\n The development of TWIICE first began in 2015. The exoskeleton team has won 3 years in a row the \"Cybathlon experience\", a European exoskeleton competition also organized by the Cybathlon committee. The Cybathlon is a Swiss-organized competition that happens every 4 years to promote\n technologies that assist people with impairments in their daily activities.\nThe EPFL Vice-Presidency for Innovation supports the Cybathlon , which consists of around forty laboratories at the service of sports for the physically challenged, for health and for performance. The initiative is part of , which brings together 9 regional academic players and contributes to making the Lake Geneva region a prime place for developing projects related to sports and health. The Cybathlon demonstrates how a sporting event can stimulate research and development, can drive knowledge creation for society, and open up economic prospects by fostering an entrepreneurial spirit.\nEPFL’s participation at the Cybathlon is possible thanks to the generous support from EPFL's Vice Presidency for Innovation and its initiative Smart Move, the Fondation Avenir Plus, the Bâloise Group, Fischer Connectors SA, Sonceboz SA, NCCR Robotics and EPFL’s Center for Intelligent Systems.\nContact for the media:", "summary": "Paraplegic athlete Silke Pan brilliantly represented EPFL at the 2020 Cybathlon this weekend.

{"id": 381, "text": "Launched just six weeks ago, Smapshot is a public web portal on which anyone can geotag aerial photographs of Switzerland from the 1960s. They superimpose the provided photos onto a virtual map of contemporary Switzerland that was built from data provided by the Federal Office of Topography (Swisstopo). Users can then add anecdotes about the location, provide additional topographical information, chat with other users and share their discoveries on Facebook. And as thanks for their help, they are allowed to print the archival photo that they geotagged.\nThe crowdmapping project, a joint initiative of EPFL and HEIG-VD (the Vaud School of Management and Engineering), could lead to some interesting applications in research, urban development and augmented reality. An exhibition organized by EPFL’s Modern Construction Archives (ACM), from 27 to 31 March 2017, will describe how Smapshot works and the promise that it holds. The display will include archival photos of the A1 highway under construction, the city of Lausanne, the Vaud landscape seen from Lake Geneva and the Gotthard Pass.\nInitially a business venture\nIn the 1960s, Perrochet SA was a thriving photography business in Lausanne. Aerial photos were its calling card, and its main product was postcards for tourists. In 1960, Perrochet SA created Pleinciel, a company that spent the next eight years taking aerial photos of the entire country. The oblique photos were taken relatively close to the ground, and interesting features of the landscape and built areas often stand out.\nFifty years later, the Perrochet Pleinciel Collection of photographs, held at the ACM, gives us a full aerial view of Switzerland in the 1960s. In this it prefigures Google Earth – and it represents a gold mine for researchers. “Pleinciel was initially a business venture. Its creators had no idea how important their work would be,” said Salvatore Aprea, EPFL scientist and the deputy curator of the ACM.\nMajor research value\nThese photos are extremely valuable for research purposes, especially if Smapshot is a hit with internet users. “By geotagging these archives, we’ll see how Switzerland has changed over the past 50 years – melting glaciers, receding forests and the impact of development on the countryside. It will give urban planners, geographers, civil engineers and landscape architects a broader historical perspective of a given site, which will help them plan future development,” said Timothée Produit, a scientist at HEIG-VD. The Smapshot project arose out of Produit’s dissertation, which he conducted in EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems and completed in 2015. Aprea adds: “We could also recreate 1960s Switzerland using augmented reality, giving viewers the chance to travel back in time through the stories and facts provided by contributors.”\nFor the deputy curator, this pilot project will encourage people to view archives as a living depository of knowledge rather than a simple database. “I really believe that intelligent digitization and an open-source approach, guided by a defined goal, is the future of archives. At the ACM, we think we can achieve that by working together with other Swiss organizations.”\nSo where’s Google?\nSo far, around 1,200 of the 35,000 archival photos in the Perrochet Collection have been uploaded to Smapshot. They are mainly aerial views of the lower Valais region. Since Smapshot went live, 40% of those photos have been geotagged by volunteers. The ACM would eventually like to see the entire Perrochet Collection imported into the website’s virtual globe.\nBut Produit is thinking bigger: “I’m surprised that a company like Google doesn’t offer this type of service with Google Maps and Google Earth, you know, a feature for adding scanned archival photos to Google’s maps, the same way Smapshot does.”\nExhibition", "summary": "A crowdmapping project developed by EPFL and HEIG-VD gives volunteers the chance to compare the Switzerland of the 1960s with that of today through archival photos.

{"id": 382, "text": "Luzzone, located some 2,150 meters high in Ticino’s Malvaglia valley, was a small hamlet used by mountain herders and their livestock. It was abandoned in the 1950s and today lies mostly in ruins. But this past weekend, the workshop’s 120 participants teamed up to restore and remodel the ancient structures.\nOf the hamlet’s original ten buildings, one is still being used, one is falling down and six others are in ruins. “These functional buildings were made entirely of stone and measured just four meters long by four meters wide. They served as stables and as mountain huts for herders during the summer and were typical of life in the Alps, and especially Ticino, at the time,” says Patrick Giromini, a PhD student in architecture and assistant at EPFL’s Arts of Sciences Laboratory (LAPIS) and one of the workshop organizers.\nRemodeling, not rebuilding \nThe students first identified the original layout of the buildings’ walls – which are now nothing more than piles of stones. Any stones sitting outside the perimeter of the hamlet were carried back to their original structures and used to rebuild some of the walls. This helped restore the volumes of the original buildings. Rather than reconstructing the buildings, however, the students put their creative juices to work in order to remodel them.\nTicino architect and EPFL graduate Martino Pedrozzi () came up with the idea for the project. Currently a guest lecturer at the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture at the Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI), he has been involved in this kind of remodeling work for over 20 years. “There are many examples of this rural heritage scattered throughout the Alps, not just in Ticino. The question is, what should we do with these ruins? Given their remote locations, they are virtually useless. But by remodeling them, we can give them a purpose: to serve as landmarks. That is a function they once had but have since lost,” he says.\nThe students’ project therefore aimed not just at preserving the region’s heritage, but also at bringing it to people’s attention and underscoring the importance of our rural memory. “It also introduced the students to the rigors of rural life. Every summer, for example, the farmers had to repair snow damage,” says Giromini.\nSurprisingly popular \nThe workshop was run jointly by three Swiss architecture schools: the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture at USI, EPFL’s architecture department and ETH Zurich’s Institute for Spatial and Landscape Development. This was the first time these three schools teamed up for a workshop. The project also received support from the municipality of Serravalle, where the ruins are located.\n“We expected around 30 students to sign up – ten from each school. But we ended up with 120 people on the registration list. We never thought our workshop would be so popular!” says Nicola Braghieri, head of EPFL’s architecture department and of LAPIS.\nAn unforgettable experience \nThe workshop also gave the students a chance to team up with peers from a variety of backgrounds. They travelled from Mendrisio, Lausanne and Zurich to the foot of Mount Luzzone, which they hiked up for 90 minutes to reach the ruins. After spending the day remodeling the hamlet, they camped out there for the night. “A workshop like this is always a unique experience and I enjoy them every time,” says Agathe Loeb, a Master’s student in architecture at EPFL and program participant. “You usually meet people from different schools and even different countries, who bring an entirely different perspective on architecture. Speaking with them can be really interesting – it opens your mind and breaks you out of your routine ways of thinking.” Not to mention that the entire experience – from performing back-breaking work to camping out in rustic conditions – is bound to leave a lasting impression.\nWhile this particular workshop involved remodeling stone structures in Ticino, the same format could be used for just about any kind of abandoned heritage site in the Alps. “At LAPIS, we have been studying the preservation of mountain huts and pastures for five years now, mainly in the canton of Valais. But since many of those structures are made from wood in addition to stone, we would have to adapt the workshop format slightly. It’s definitely something worth considering,” says Braghieri.", "summary": "Around 120 architecture students, including some from EPFL, took part in a unique workshop on Mount Luzzone in Ticino on 6–7 July 2019.

{"id": 389, "text": "Humanitarian aid organizations are now facing unprecedented challenges, which science and technology can help to overcome. For this reason, ETH Zurich, EPFL and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have joined forces in the Engineering Humanitarian Aid initiative. The goal is to put the expertise of the two federal institutes of technology at the service of humanitarian aid. Under its aegis, projects will be carried out in three strategic areas: energy and the environment; data sciences and digital technologies; and personalized health and related technologies.\nThe three partner organizations have already worked together on a number of projects over the years. But this initiative aims to accelerate efforts to leverage new technology to improve the provision of humanitarian aid. “The potential for using digital technology to support humanitarian aid programs is still largely untapped,” says Joël Mesot, the president of ETH Zurich. “Our two federal institutes of technology can draw on our engineering know-how to make a difference and facilitate the ICRC’s job out in the field. To that end, we can rely on our past experience in development cooperation.”\nOur new initiative with ETH Zurich and the ICRC gives our work added meaning because we know what we do will have a concrete, positive impact on people's daily lives\nMartin Vetterli, EPFL President\nR&D and technology transfer are indeed central to both ETH Zurich and EPFL. “This collaborative effort is in keeping with the humanitarian tradition of French-speaking Switzerland,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli. “EPFL has been carrying out joint projects with the ICRC for several years. These include creating the Humanitarian Tech Hub in 2016 and developing an innovative foot prosthesis for conflict victims. Our new initiative with ETH Zurich and the ICRC gives our work added meaning because we know what we do will have a concrete, positive impact on people's daily lives.”\nA spirit of innovation\nAccording to ICRC President Peter Maurer, “throughout the ICRC’s history, there has been a spirit of innovation and of partnering up to develop new solutions. From 1863 to today, we have endeavored to leverage the best of science to aid those living in war and conflict. This is especially critical today, given the enormous, complex humanitarian challenges caused by violence, climate change and pandemics. We need to make sure that humanitarian services evolve so as to remain relevant, efficient and inclusive – and to meet peoples’ most pressing needs.”\nSeveral projects are already underway and others are in the pipeline. One current project, led by Carmela Troncoso, a professor at EPFL's Security and Privacy Engineering Laboratory, addresses privacy issues related to biometric data. Biometric data could be an effective way to eliminate redundancies in aid provision and make sure that the ICRC help reaches as many people as possible. Yet these types of data raise privacy concerns. Troncoso's project seeks to identify the ICRC's on-the-ground security and privacy requirements when processing beneficiaries' biometric data, and to design a system that keeps these data confidential.\nAnother project involves using artificial intelligence to map vulnerable populations. By compiling information such as satellite images and social media posts, the project will estimate the size and density of these populations, as well as associated information such as settlement type and changes in population. The resulting data will be fed into terrain maps. This project is being carried out by Konrad Schindler, from ETH Zurich’s Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry, and Devis Tuia, the head of EPFL’s Environmental Computational Science and Earth Observation Laboratory.\nIn the area of technology for personalized healthcare, a project led by Stephan Wagner, the Chair of Logistics Management at ETH Zurich, deserves special mention. His project aims to improve the availability of medical equipment in conflict zones. The goal is to reduce shortages and cut down on the waste of certain medical products. By analyzing medical supply-chain data and combining them with a qualitative assessment of the ICRC’s system, the project team hopes to identify the root causes of inadequate information flow, model potential improvements, and propose feasible solutions.\nETH Domain provides seed funding\nResearchers from both ETH Zurich and EPFL can propose projects under the initiative. Joint efforts that also involve other members of the ETH Domain are particularly encouraged. Proposals are reviewed by a steering committee that consists of two members from each of the three partner organizations. The ETH Board has earmarked CHF 5 million in seed funding for the projects over a two-year period (2021–2022). The partner organizations hope to expand the program over the coming year. At EPFL, efforts under the initiative are being coordinated by the , while at ETH Zurich they are being managed by ETH for Development (ETH4D).\nThe three partner organizations are committed to carrying out joint projects, developing and distributing innovative products and processes, and training students, ICRC employees and local partners.

This parasite, which has no effect on humans, causes proliferative kidney disease (PKD) – which is highly contagious and can wipe out entire fish populations. In Switzerland, this seasonal disease has been detected in rainbow trout, brown trout and char. It has been identified as one of the main causes of the decline in fish populations in recent decades and has played a major role in the extinction of local endemic species.\nResearchers from EPFL, EAWAG the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) and the University of Bern’s Center for Fish and Wildlife Health (FIWI spent three years studying the 50-km-long Wigger River – which crosses the cantons of Aargau and Lucerne in the Alp foothills – and its watershed.

It appears first in bryozoans – tiny animals attached to stones on the river floor. The parasites are then excreted into the river water as spores and enter fish through their gills and mucous membranes, where the disease first breaks out before attacking the kidneys. The spores are subsequently released through fish urine and can, in mutated form, infect colonies of bryozoans. This means the parasite needs both bryozoans and fish to multiply and mutate.\nT. bryosalmonae \ncontamination generates few symptoms in cold water but becomes apparent when the water temperature stays above 15 degrees Celsius for several weeks. Its deadly effect on both farmed and wild fish therefore lasts from the summer through early fall. Infected fish that manage to survive may continue excreting spores for several seasons. The researchers had to look at all such biological factors in order to model outbreaks.\n“We selected several stretches along the Wigger and in the watershed where we took fish samples, measured the concentration of both bryozoan and parasite DNA in the water, and calculated the hydrological and geomorphological variables,” says Luca Carraro from EPFL’s Laboratory of Ecohydrology. It turns out that the parasite flourishes in moraines, where they are protected from currents. This finding will have to be confirmed, however, and there is no shortage of rivers infested by the parasite in which to test it. As part of their sleuthing, the researchers also needed to factor an array of existing data into their findings in order to account for climate change and water temperatures, and find a way to incorporate the wealth of data collected by the scientific community into their model.\nTo help predict the spread of bryozoan colonies throughout the watershed, the researchers also came up with a model that interprets the concentration of DNA measured in the water samples. Apart from its relevance for PKD, this model could come in handy in a number of ecohydrological applications for locating either invasive or soon-to-be extinct species in freshwater habitats.\nAt this stage it is impossible to combat the disease in its natural surroundings. But the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office wants to be sure that any fish introduced into rivers for repopulation purposes are carefully checked to ensure they are free of the parasites.\nThe results of this study have been published in PNAS. \nLuca Carraroa,1, Enrico Bertuzzob, Lorenzo Maric, Inês Fontesd, Hanna Hartikainend,e, Nicole Strepparavaf, Heike Schmidt-Posthausf, Thomas Wahlif, Jukka Jokelad,e, Marino Gattoc, and Andrea Rinaldoa,g,1\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista \nPress service EPFL\n +41 79 502 81 06\nLuca Carraro\n Doctoral assistant of Laboratory of Ecohydrology\n +41 21 693 37 77\nAndrea Rinaldo\n Director of Laboratory of Ecohydrology\n +41 21 693 80 34", "summary": "In Switzerland – not to mention the rest of Europe and the United States – freshwater fish are falling victim to a deadly disease that is rampant in the summer and dormant in the winter.

{"id": 399, "text": "At EPFL, researchers challenge a fundamental law and discover that more electromagnetic energy can be stored in wave-guiding systems than previously thought. The discovery has implications in telecommunications. Working around the fundamental law, they conceived resonant and wave-guiding systems capable of storing energy over a prolonged period while keeping a broad bandwidth. Their trick was to create asymmetric resonant or wave-guiding systems using magnetic fields.\nThe study, which has just been published in \nScience\n, was led by Kosmas Tsakmakidis, first at the University of Ottawa and then at EPFL’s  run by Hatice Altug, where the researcher is now doing post-doctoral research.\nThis breakthrough could have a major impact on many fields in engineering and physics. The number of potential applications is close to infinite, with telecommunications, optical detection systems and broadband energy harvesting representing just a few examples.\nCasting aside reciprocity\n Resonant and wave-guiding systems are present in the vast majority of optical and electronic systems. Their role is to temporarily store energy in the form of electromagnetic waves and then release them. For more than 100 hundred years, these systems were held back by a limitation that was considered to be fundamental: the length of time a wave could be stored was inversely proportional to its bandwidth. This relationship was interpreted to mean that it was impossible to store large amounts of data in resonant or wave-guiding systems over a long period of time because increasing the bandwidth meant decreasing the storage time and quality of storage.\nThis law was first formulated by K. S. Johnson in 1914, at Western Electric Company (the forerunner of Bell Telephone Laboratories). He introduced the concept of the \nQ\n factor, according to which a resonator can either store energy for a long time or have a broad bandwidth, but not both at the same time. Increasing the storage time meant decreasing the bandwidth, and vice versa. A small bandwidth means a limited range of frequencies (or ‘colors’) and therefore a limited amount of data.\nUntil now, this concept had never been challenged. Physicists and engineers had always built resonant systems – like those to produce lasers, make electronic circuits and conduct medical diagnoses – with this constraint in mind.\nBut that limitation is now a thing of the past. The researchers came up with a hybrid resonant / wave-guiding system made of a magneto-optic material that, when a magnetic field is applied, is able to stop the wave and store it for a prolonged period, thereby accumulating large amounts of energy. Then when the magnetic field is switched off, the trapped pulse is released.\nWith such asymmetric and non-reciprocal systems, it was possible to store a wave for a very long period of time while also maintaining a large bandwidth. The conventional time-bandwidth limit was even beaten by a factor of 1,000. The scientists further showed that, theoretically, there is no upper ceiling to this limit at all in these asymmetric (non-reciprocal) systems.\n“It was a moment of revelation when we discovered that these new structures did not feature any time-bandwidth restriction at all. These systems are unlike what we have all been accustomed to for decades, and possibly hundreds of years», says Tsakmakidis, the study’s lead author. \"Their superior wave-storage capacity performance could really be an enabler for a range of exciting applications in diverse contemporary and more traditional fields of research.” Hatice Altug adds. \nMedicine, the environment and telecommunications\n One possible application is in the design of extremely quick and efficient all-optical buffers in telecommunication networks. The role of the buffers is to temporarily store data arriving in the form of light through optical fibers. By slowing the mass of data, it is easier to process. Up to now, the storage quality had been limited.+\nWith this new technique, it should be possible to improve the process and store large bandwidths of data for prolonged times. Other potential applications include on-chip spectroscopy, broadband light harvesting and energy storage, and broadband optical camouflaging (“invisibility cloaking”). “The reported breakthrough is completely fundamental – we’re giving researchers a new tool. And the number of applications is limited only by one’s imagination,” sums up Tsakmakidis.\n-----\nSource: \nCover image capture: \nGeneric image illustrating wave-interference and resonant energy transfer from\n one source to another distant source or object, pertaining to the fundamental concept of\n resonances.\nStudy conducted by:\nKosmas Tsakmakidis, lead author, former researcher at the University of Ottawa and currently an EPFL Fellow in EPFL's \n Linfang Shen and collaborators, Institute of Space Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China and State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China\n Prof. Robert Boyd and collaborators, University of Ottawa\n Prof. Hatice Altug, director of EPFL's \n Prof. Alexandre Vakakis, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "summary": "EPFL researchers have found a way around what was considered a fundamental limitation of physics for over 100 years.

{"id": 404, "text": "“We want to show that solar panels can be harmoniously integrated into their urban setting, even in fragile environments, as long as the necessary effort is made in terms of design and cost. 'If this effort falls short, it may be better to just postpone the work,” says Maria Cristina Munari Probst, an architect in EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB). “Inelegant solar installations end up turning away potential solar-power users. If done properly, however, they can further spur the growth of solar energy, and this will easily make up for their slightly higher cost.”\nTogether with engineer Christian Roecker, Probst designed an easy-to-use method for cantonal and municipal authorities in charge of planning and approving solar installations. How does it work? It allows the authorities to take local architectural constraints, such as historical districts, into account when analyzing where to install solar panels on existing buildings. This method should ultimately help reconcile heritage advocates and renewable energy supporters. On 16 November, the authors won the Innovator of the Year award in Sweden for their work.\n“These days, people tend to put up solar panels without thinking about the aesthetic impact on existing buildings,” says Probst. “We presented our method to representatives of both the French-speaking cantons’ energy services and heritage associations in French- and Italian-speaking Switzerland in April and October. Thanks to these discussions, we were able to refine our method and ensure that concerns on both sides were properly taken into account.” The consultations have paid off: according to the researchers, several municipalities have already expressed interest in the method, which they may apply as early as next year.\nArchitectural “criticity”\nProbst and Roecker call their method LESO-QSV (QSV refers to Quality-Site-Visibility). It is based on the new concept of “architectural “criticity”” in urban areas. Under this concept, the acceptability of solar panels is assessed against the sensitivity of the \nsite\n and the \nvisibility\n of the panels from the public space.\nThe higher the degree of “criticity” – such as the facade of a highly visible historical building – the more emphasis will be placed on harmoniously integrating the solar panels. On the other hand, a flat roof on a factory in an industrial zone will be given a much lower “criticity” rating, and, consequently, be subject to lower integration standards. \nThe researchers say that solar installations should always respect the surrounding environment. But it’s not always critical. “In the effort to promote the use of solar energy, expectations can be scaled back in certain cases, such as in industrial or commercial zones where the architectural quality is lower, or on surfaces with low public visibility, such as flat or slightly angled roofs,” adds Probst.\nObjective criteria\nBefore aesthetic standards can be established, objective criteria need to be developed. While it is often thought that aesthetics is a matter of taste, the researchers’ recent studies confirm the existence of clear criteria against which the appropriateness of solar power installations can be judged.\nThe LESO-QSV method can be used to evaluate solar installations through three simple and objective criteria: the project’s geometry, materiality, and modular pattern. These criteria provide a framework for assessing how harmoniously an installation fits into the surrounding urban environment. The results of the evaluations are expressed with colored circles. A “criticity” grid identifies nine different situations (see Figure 1) for which the municipal authorities will set quality standards in view of local considerations.\nInstructional software\nTo help the authorities set quality standards, the LESO-QSV method comes with software (\nQSV grid)\n that shows the impact of different acceptability grids on more than 100 existing buildings. These solar installations, many of which are in Europe, also serve as models for objectively evaluating quality. This database provides a large number of examples that can inspire architects, installers and building owners. More examples will continue to be added, including the most prominent cases handled by the municipalities and commissions that will use the method.\nFuture planning \nThe method also helps the authorities get ahead of the problem. It can map out the architectural “criticity” of a given city, identifying the most visible and sensitive sites. This map can then be laid over a map of the city's solar exposure, which shows which of its parts get the most sunlight. This approach makes it easier for the authorities to set their priorities in siting future solar power installations and to plan subsidies intelligently. The researchers call this system QSV Crossmapping.\nThe method is currently being used for the purposes of the International Energy Agency's Task 51 (“Solar Energy in Urban Planning”) and as core resources in three courses currently taught at EPFL and Università IUAV in Venice. In addition, extensive discussions among the three entities and the researchers now focus on an innovative solar planning project currently under consideration for the city of Carouge, led by the Swiss Federal Culture Office together with the Canton of Geneva.\nStarting in 2020, all new buildings in Europe will have to run mainly on renewable energy. This means that municipalities must now urgently come up with a strategic energy plan. With this new method, the researchers hope that municipalities will use solar power more wisely and efficiently in the future.\nMaria Cristina Munari Probst will discuss her research at the LESO Lunchtime on 2 December 2016, from 12:15pm to 1pm, SG building (EPFL), room 0213. The presentation is free of charge and open to the public and will be followed by an aperitif.\nReferences:\nM. C. Munari Probst and C. Roecker.

{"id": 406, "text": "Many forms of heart disease end in cardiac failure. Patients can be saved only by a heart transplant or a complicated assistance system. To help diseased hearts pump blood, researchers at the Integrated Actuators Laboratory (LAI) on EPFL's Microcity campus in Neuchâtel have been working for some time now on a new, less invasive cardiac assistance system. It consists of a ring placed around the aorta and controlled by magnetic induction. This project has attracted the attention of the Werner Siemens-Foundation, which has just donated 12 million francs to EPFL to set up a Center for Artificial Muscles (CAM). “With this donation, we really hope to help drive the study of muscle conditions through the advanced research that will be carried out by the Center. This revolutionary and forward-looking project aligns perfectly with the Foundation’s sponsorship criteria,” said Hubert Keiber, the Foundation’s chairman.\nA less invasive approach\n The Integrated Actuators Laboratory, which is run by Yves Perriard, will develop the assistance system together with Thierry Carrel, the chairman and head surgeon of the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at Bern's Inselspital. “Our system will obviate the need to operate on the heart. The ring placed around the aorta and controlled by magnetic induction will help the heart pump blood. This method will therefore be less invasive than current procedures used in cardiac assistance,” says Dr. Perriard.\nThe device will be composed of a series of rings made out of dielectric electroactive polymers (DEAPs). These polymers dilate when a current is applied and contract when the current is switched off. Because the reactions are immediate, the contraction-relaxation movement can be controlled in real time. “This material is unusual in that it is incompressible, which means its volume remains constant. As a result, its surface area expands elastically as it stores the energy it receives,” says Jonathan Chavanne, a PhD student at the LAI who is in charge of prototype development. When placed around the aorta, these rings will therefore help the heart pump blood.\nTreating patients earlier \n The funds provided by the Werner Siemens-Foundation will be used to create a project team at the Center to further this research. Six full-time staff – two PhD students, two post-docs and two engineers – will be devoted to developing the technique. They will benefit from the expertise of Dr. Carrel, a renowned cardiac surgeon.\nIts research group at the ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Research and the experimental surgery section of the Department for BioMedical Research at the University of Bern will make a significant contribution to the project. For the past few years, ARTORG’s cardiovascular engineering group has been working on simulation experiments in the area of mechanical circulatory assistance. This less invasive method adds an important dimension to current heart failure treatment.\nCarrel will oversee the entire first phase, which will be spread out over four years. At the end of this phase, and after the technology has been thoroughly vetted in laboratory tests, the surgeon will implant the device on animals. It is only then that the researchers will know if the technology is viable. Dr. Carrel sees a number of advantages in this device: “For patients, this technology would definitely be less invasive than current cardiac assistance systems because it does not interfere directly with the blood flow or blood cells. It may also turn out to be effective in treating terminal heart failure earlier than current methods.” EPFL President Martin Vetterli adds: “This project, at the crossroads of engineering and medicine, offers real potential. I am especially pleased with the university collaborations it has led to, including the one with Inselspital.”\nFirst the heart, then facial expression \n The ambitious plans for the Center do not stop with cardiac assistance. The Center will branch out into other fields in two subsequent phases, which will take place over eight years starting in 2022.

{"id": 410, "text": "This summer some of the Arctic’s permanent ice caps began breaking up for the first time. This worrying news came just as the EPFL-based Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) began preparing for a major research expedition to Greenland. The aim of this expedition – known as the GreenLAnd Circumnavigation Expedition (GLACE) – is to gather as much data as possible about how the ice cap covering the island is melting, how this process interacts with the surrounding ocean, and how climate change is more broadly affecting the region. The expedition will run for some 60 days, from late July to the end of September 2019. A  has been announced, so it’s time for any polar experts out there to put pen to paper – you have until 10 September!\nThe expedition, which is being supported by grants from Dr. Frederik Paulsen, is the second of its kind. From December 2016 to March 2017, the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) took about 150 researchers involved in 22 projects around the Antarctic.\nAlthough GLACE will involve just ten research projects, it is no less ambitious than its predecessor. The projects will cover fields as varied as climatology, oceanography, marine biology, microbiology, hydrology, and chemistry, to name a few. And during the expedition, samples will be taken from the air, as well as \nfrom the ocean and the ground. As with ACE, the aim is to create synergies between the various research projects and obtain a holistic view of the environmental issues affecting the polar regions, which are key to regulating the earth’s climate and have been hit particularly hard by climate change.\nThe \nAkademik Treshnikov\n – the Russian research ship that transported ACE – will also carry the GLACE researchers. It will be refitted and new equipment added for the expedition. For part of the journey, the Treshnikov will be escorted by a second Russian vessel – the \n50 Let Pobedy\n – which is the world’s largest nuclear-powered icebreaker.\nUnchartered territory\n“Even if it is starting to break up, the North Greenland ice sheet is still among the thickest in the entire Arctic,” says Danièle Rod, the executor director of SPI. “The north winds mean that the ice accumulates along the coast. The Treshnikov won’t be able to get through those areas on its own. We’re going to try and get as close to the coast as possible – it will be the first time an expedition has taken such a difficult course.”\nThe journey - a 13’500 km round trip - will take place in two main stages. The first will focus on southern Greenland (SG). Setting off from Reykjavik in Iceland, the ship will sail all the way to Ilulisat, a town with almost 5,000 inhabitants on Greenland’s western coast. So far, three stops are scheduled along the way – at the Kangerlussuaq (SG1) and Helheim (SG2) fjords and the Prince Christian Sound, the southernmost tip of the island (SG3). These locations were chosen primarily because they are home to lakes and ice tongues that have a major influence on the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and because they provide access to some of the highest mountains in Greenland, where samples of older ice will be taken. These sites also offer rich biodiversity.\n700 kilometers from the North Pole\nFor the second leg, the ship will head north (NG), making its way back to Reykjavik via the Nares Straits, which separate Greenland from the northernmost island in Canada. Four key stop-off locations have been identified along the way, including one alternative in case it’s not possible to land at one of the other three sites or in case of severe ice conditions.\nTwo of these locations are outlets for meltwater from the large Ryder, Ostenfeld (NG1) and Zachariae (NG4) glaciers. For the first time, researchers will be able to study in depth the impact that this meltwater has on the marine environment. The ship will also stop to allow researchers to gather data at Independence Fjord (NG3), which is 200 kilometers long, 30 kilometers wide and an ecosystem in and of itself. Finally, a landing is scheduled at Cape Morris Jesup (NG2), which is the northernmost tip of Greenland and just 700 kilometers from the North Pole. Samples taken there will be compared with those collected in the very south of Greenland.\nContact\n: Danièle Rod, Swiss Polar Institute Executive Director, , tel: +41 21 693 76 29.\nPicture: The Akademik Treshnikov.

The RESSlab team developed the most accurate numerical model, as measured by 11 criteria, predicting the deformation of three steel columns subjected to earthquake loading. The researchers will receive their prize and present their work on 13 April at a special session dedicated to the blind analysis prediction contest as part of the AISC Steel Conference (NASCC) in Baltimore.\nThese contests are blind because the researchers receive only partial information on a structure or component. Using just the geometry and the imposed load conditions, the EPFL researchers were able to demonstrate with a high level of accuracy that it is possible to simulate material and geometric instabilities in steel components undergoing cyclic loading similar to that of an earthquake.\n“We used simulation models and a methodology that we developed in the scope of a research project financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),” says Dimitrios Lignos, an associate professor and director of RESSlab. “The aim of this project is to use computer simulations validated by carefully designed physical experiments to deepen our understanding of the complex deterioration processes associated with geometric instabilities observed in steel structures as a result of earthquake-induced loading. We plan to share these tools with the scientific community.” For Lignos, the results of this competition also serve to highlight EPFL’s internationally recognized expertise in computer modeling across scales.\nThanks to RESSlab’s models, researchers can also forecast the dynamic behavior of steel buildings subjected to earthquakes of different magnitudes and predict if these buildings would suffer major deterioration in strength and stiffness.

{"id": 432, "text": "“Collective creation: improv-arts & engineering” was developed by Professor Simon Henein in cooperation with the Arsenic Theater (Centre d’art scénique contemporain) in Lausanne. The year-long course, which was launched in September 2017, is part of EPFL’s Social and Human Sciences (SHS) program. It introduces Master’s students from all sections to improv techniques used in the performing arts (theater, music and dance) and explores how these techniques can be applied to engineering design. The 24 students taking the class will stage their final project on 16 May in a dress rehearsal and on 23 May in their final presentation before a board of examiners. Both events are open to the public.\nEach improv performance will feature technical artifacts made ahead of time by the students. “This requirement creates tension between the creative processes involved in engineering and those inherent in improv,” says Professor Henein. “The aim is to highlight where they overlap and how they differ.” One example is the “stage machine” that one group of students came up with. Drawing on artificial intelligence and deep learning, the machine picks up sounds produced during the performance and turns them into images, and vice versa. The resulting layers of real-time visual and sound effects are part of the improv performance and evolve in step with it.\nTeaming up with the Arsenic\nProfessor Henein worked with the Arsenic Theater in Lausanne to develop this course. Around a dozen scheduled artists and artists in residence supervised the students and provided them with creative support. The Arsenic also gave Henein and his class access to its studios throughout the course, which meant that the students could truly immerse themselves in the theater.\nEngineering and improv\n“Beyond engineering, I get the sense that people have a pressing need to understand their place in the world,” says Patrick de Rham, director of the Arsenic. “And with the emergence of artificial intelligence – machines that perform as well as or better than humans – I think we have to reconnect with our typically human trait of intuition, that part of ourselves that is subjective and sensitive rather than mechanical. It’s what makes two people come up with two different ideas and lets them think outside the box, and this is what drives society forward.”\nProfessor Henein adds: “Collectively, our creative potential is huge – much greater than that of each one of us individually – but to fully tap into it, we have to be able to create together. That's why this class delves so deeply into this skill, which will be crucial in the students’ future careers. We look at intuition, expression, listening, trust and self-reflection. The students are exposed to a wide range of approaches to the creative process, from the hard sciences to engineering and stage performance. All these influences will play a part in their professional work.”\nCourse description\n“Collective creation: improv-arts & engineering” combines workshops, which explore improvisation through the theater, music, dance and performance art, and lectures, which address the history of creativity in the sciences, approaches to collective engineering design, dramaturgy and the sociology of improvisation. The course is the brainchild of Professor Henein, who runs the Instant-Lab at Microcity, EPFL’s Microengineering Institute, and has practiced improv for the past 15 years. It is open to all first-year Master’s students at EPFL. The classes are run in three-period blocks every week throughout the school year. The course will run again in September 2018.\nA booklet of proceedings documenting the course’s first year is currently being prepared.

{"id": 438, "text": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can offer high light-conversion efficiency with low manufacturing costs. But to be commercially viable, perovskite films must also be durable and not degrade under solar light over time. EPFL scientists have now greatly improved the operational stability of PSCs, retaining more than 95% of their initial efficiencies of over 20 % under full sunlight illumination at 60\no\nC for more than 1000 hours. The breakthrough, which marks the highest stability for perovskite solar cells, .\nChallenges of stability \nConventional silicon solar cells have reached a point of maturation, with efficiencies plateauing around 25% and problems of high-cost manufacturing, heavyweight, and rigidity has remained largely unresolved. On the contrary, a relatively new photovoltaic technology based on perovskite solar cells has already achieved more than 22% efficiency.\nGiven the vast chemical versatility, and the low-cost processability of perovskite materials, the PSCs hold the promise to lead the future of photovoltaic technology by offering cheap, light weight and highly efficient solar cells. But until now, only highly expensive, prototype organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs,selectively transporting positive charges in a solar cell) have been able to achieve power-conversion efficiencies over 20%. And by virtue of their ingredients, these hole-transporting materials adversely affect the long-term operational stability of the PSC.\nTherefore, investigating cheap and stable hole transporters that produce equally high efficiencies is in great demand to enable large-scale deployment of perovskite solar cells. Among various inorganic HTMs, cuprous thiocyanate (CuSCN) stands out as a stable, efficient and cheap candidate ($0.5/gr versus $500 /gr for the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD). But previous attempts to use CuSCN as a hole transporter in perovskite solar cells have yielded only moderately stabilized efficiencies and poor device stability, due to problems associated with depositing a high-quality CuSCN layer atop of the perovskite film, as wells as the chemical instability of the CuSCN layer when integrated into a perovskite solar cell.\nA stable solution\nNow, researchers at , in a project led by postdocs Neha Arora and M. Ibrahim Dar, have introduced two new concepts that overcome the major shortcomings of CuSCN-based perovskite solar cells. First, they developed a simple dynamic solution-based method for depositing highly conformal, 60-nm thick CuSCN layers that allows the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with stabilized power-conversion efficiencies exceeding 20%. This is comparable to the efficiencies of the best performing, state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD-based perovskite solar cells.\nSecond, the scientists introduced a thin spacer layer of reduced graphene oxide between the CuSCN and a gold layer. This innovation allowed the perovskite solar cells to achieve excellent operational stability, retaining over 95% of their initial efficiency while operating at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full-sun illumination at 60 °C. This surpasses even the stability of organic HTM-based perovskite solar cells that are heavily researched and have recently dominated the field.\nStructure of β-CuSCN and cross-sectional SEM micrograph of a complete solar cell (credit: M. Ibrahim Dar/EPFL)\nThe researchers also discovered that the instability of the perovskite devices originates from the degradation of CuSCN/gold contact during the solar cell’s operation.\n“This is a major breakthrough in perovskite solar-cell research and will pave the way for large-scale commercial deployment of this very promising new photovoltaic technology,” says Michael Grätzel. “It will benefit the numerous scientists in the field that have been intensively searching for a material that could replace the currently used, prohibitively expensive organic hole-transporters,” adds M.

{"id": 441, "text": "“In my study, I wanted to show that calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels tells just half of the story. What we really need to do is quantify the emissions of each product coming out of biorefineries,” says Edgard Gnansounou, professor at EPFL and head of the school’s Bioenergy and Energy Planning Research Group. To that end, Gnansounou has developed a sophisticated computer model described in an article appearing in \nBioresource Technology\n.\nBiofuels and other biomass-derived products have become viable options for replacing fossil fuels. But they have to meet certain environmental standards if they are to genuinely help cut carbon emissions. Under a new EU directive, bioethanol-based fuels – which are made by fermenting biomass – must save 70% greenhouse gas emissions compared to their fossil-fuel counterparts starting in 2021. In Switzerland, the government passed a law requiring that from 1 August 2016, biofuels must cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% relative to fossil-fuel equivalents. However, calculating the total greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels is no mean feat. The entire processing chain – not just the production of the biofuel itself – must be taken into account. For sugar cane, that would include emissions from growing and harvesting the plant, transporting it to a biorefinery, turning it into biofuel, and producing the other compounds and animals feed supplements that are generally made as coproducts. The hitch is that until now, no computer model existed for analyzing the entire life cycle of each product and coming up with a single emissions figure subject to environmental requirements.\nMany different variables involved\n One major challenge is the many different variables involved in calculating the emissions of biofuels and their various coproducts. But after five years of research, Gnansounou has come up with a model that incorporates all the various data. “I tackled the problem of allocating greenhouse gas emissions among the different coproducts by specifying an environmental requirement for each one. That lets plant engineers compare those emissions with their fossil-fuel equivalents and set up the right incentives to make their biorefineries economically viable.”\nGnansounou’s model is intended for second-generation biorefineries, which are still relatively new – only five currently exist around the world. The advantage of these biorefineries is that instead of processing crops that are also used as food, they use debris from farming (like wheat straw) and foresting. Wheat straw is the crop that Gnansounou looked at specifically, taking into account the wheat ears, which are used for food, and the stems, which are used by biorefineries to produce bioethanol for fuel, biogas for heating and electricity and phenol for the chemical industry. He also factored emissions from the fertilizer and farming machines used to grow and harvest the wheat, and whether the field had previously been used for other crops. Once he calculated a total greenhouse gas emissions figure, he used his model to divide the total up among the various coproducts.\nA scientific perspective\n With his research, Gnansounou hopes to bring a scientific perspective to the political and economic debate on biofuels. “Second-generation biorefineries should replace some oil refineries, but engineers still don’t have a clear method for calculating emissions across a biofuel’s life cycle,” he says. “What’s more, biorefineries have trouble competing with low oil prices” – since biofuels are two to three times more expensive than fossil fuels. He concludes: “Policymakers still haven’t fully grasped the emissions challenge, which is why it’s a good area for research.” Gnansounou believes that the renewable energy industry is too focused on the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels alone, whereas it should be looking more closely at the emissions of each coproduct from biorefineries, subject to climate policy constraints. That would also give consumers more information about the sustainability of biomass-derived products. Gnansounou plans to continue his research on other types of crops and publish his findings in a second article.\nReference", "summary": "A new EU regulation aims to shrink the environmental footprint of biofuels starting in 2021.

This French archipelago lies directly east of Australia and is surrounded by the second largest coral reef in the world after the Great Barrier Reef. Like so many other coral reefs, this precious ecosystem – which is a UNESCO World Heritage site – is under threat. On 20 February, Selmoni will join a research initiative launched by EPFL into how corals adapt to global warming, pollution and the anthropization of coastal areas. The project is being carried out in conjunction with the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD – UMR ENTROPIE). He will post updates, photos and videos to the EPFL Out There blog and Instagram up until the end of May.\nSelmoni’s research project combines genetics and geography: he will apply a new scientific method known as seascape genomics to coral reefs. This approach uses DNA samples from coral to identify potential correlations between genetic variation and a particular environmental condition. By sampling individual specimens that may have been affected by the bleaching of two species of coral (\nAcropora millepora\n and \nPocillopora damicornis\n), Selmoni hopes to discover genetic mutations that could enable coral to withstand global warming and ocean acidification. Coral specimens with this mutation could then be raised in a nursery and used to repopulate the damaged parts of reefs. By cross-referencing DNA and geographical data, Selmoni will also be able to map out the reefs surrounding the island, which is 300 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide. This map will support the effort to develop conservation strategies and help identify where the super coral that Selmoni hopes to discover will be most effective when replanted. This project is one of six – chosen from among 230 proposals – to be supported by the International Coral Reef Initiative, a United Nations partner.\nDiving to extract DNA \n Selmoni will spend the next three months diving for coral samples at around 20 sites. He will be assisted by a boat pilot and two professional divers. His research will take him to New Caledonia’s “customary” district, where the indigenous tribes will expect him to pay a traditional customs duty in the form of food and other goods in order to enter their territory.

Beyond these absolute figures, the recent success rate of EPFL applicants is impressive: more than 30% of applicants have been awarded a grant, compared with the average of around 10%.\n\"That illustrates just how good our researchers are,\" stated Michele De Palma, who has just been awarded a Consolidator Grant, after first receiving a Starting Grant. \"The Research Office and the central services also provide significant support when it comes to the applications and the selection interviews.\" The grants are awarded to individuals, which gives researchers more freedom to carry out their projects.

{"id": 446, "text": "What is the WCSJ and why was it created?\nThe WCSJ was set up by the World Federation of Science Journalists (WFSJ) to provide a forum for science journalists to discuss the state of their profession, share best practices and outline new goals to aspire to. It’s held every two years and attracts over a thousand science journalists from around the world. The conference – which is run by science journalists for their peers – also aims to enable science journalists from different continents to meet each other and therefore start working together more efficiently. The conference is a hotbed of ideas! But more generally, it’s an opportunity for our industry to show that we strive for independent, fact-based science journalism through a healthy critical eye, in both the specialist and mainstream press. The hope is that by sharing best practices, we can raise the overall level of our profession.\nWhat is science journalism?\nIt’s a specific branch of journalism, although it has the same fundamental role: to investigate important issues, uncover the facts, compare different points of view, go behind the scenes, interview key people and get the background story. The main objective is to provide information to our readers. But since that information is scientific, we also have to explain complicated concepts in a simple way. So our job is to make science easy to understand, yet through a critical approach so that we are sure to describe it accurately and objectively. We step into laymen’s shoes, and we enter into a kind of tacit agreement with the scientists whose findings we report so that we can explain their research clearly and stay true to the scientific facts.\nBut science journalists aren’t the only people whose job it is to explain high-tech concepts in laymen’s terms?\nNo, of course not. That’s also the job of communications officers working in the science world, for example. These professionals – some of whom are attending our conference – play an important role in the information chain. But unlike science journalists, they are not independent; they usually work for a research institution. One of the talks at our conference will be on the role that YouTubers can play in disseminating scientific knowledge. Personally I believe social media is a vector we mustn’t ignore, provided that the science is described as accurately as possible. And social media can let us reach people – especially today’s youth – who don’t necessarily read magazines or newspapers.\nWhat does the WCSJ offer to partner organizations like EPFL?\nThis year’s event is bringing some 1,200 science journalists and communications officers from 83 different countries to the EPFL campus, as well as to the campuses of other partner organizations like UNIL, CHUV, CERN and the University of Geneva. Attendees will visit these organizations’ research labs and meet the researchers during the  tours we are holding every day during the week of the conference. These tours will give researchers a unique opportunity to speak with journalists who would have never come to the school otherwise, and to build an international network.\nWhat do you hope will be the long-term impact of the conference?\nThe WCSJ offers huge networking potential. Journalists get to speak directly with researchers and vice versa, meaning that partner organizations can forge lasting ties with science journalists the world over. And for science journalists, the WCSJ enables them to build a peer network that helps them do their jobs faster and more efficiently. I’m still in touch with researchers I met at previous editions of the WCSJ – and with journalists from other countries, whom I sometimes ask for assistance when writing an article about something related to their country.\nAs the head of the organizing committee, you’ve been able to step behind the scenes. What has that taught you?\nIt definitely pulled me out of my comfort zone! I had to don the hat of a professional conference organizer – but fortunately I had a team of 45 talented people behind me, based in France, Switzerland, Italy and even Montreal where the WFSJ headquarters is located. Working with them was a fantastic experience and I’d like to thank them personally. The process also forced me to take a deep look at our profession and think about what’s important to us and our community. The answers to those questions are what informed the conference program. I learned more about the field of science communications by working with the WCSJ’s partner businesses, research institutes and philanthropic organizations. It’s gratifying to put on an event that’s useful for so many people and that adheres to its founders’ original vision of a global conference that’s independent, open-minded and innovative, and that encourages journalists to think critically yet positively.\nA competitive process for selecting the conference organizers \nAt each WCSJ, the WFSJ selects a national association of science journalists to organize the following conference. The process is similar to the one for selecting the host city for the Olympic Games: candidates must submit a bid that meets several criteria. At the last WCSJ, held in San Francisco in October 2017, the Alpine Consortium – made up of the Swiss, Italian and French science journalist associations – was selected to run the 2019 edition. This is the first time a consortium of associations was selected. The winning bid was presented by representatives from those associations and EPFL.", "summary": "The 11\nth\n World Conference of Science Journalists (WCSJ) is being held in Lausanne this week, attracting some 1,200 visitors to our city.

{"id": 447, "text": "In the past half-decade, many pre-vote polls and initial vote counting around the world have turned out to be unreliable. Perhaps the two most notorious recent examples are the Brexit ‘yes’ vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. In both cases, not only were the majority of pre-vote polls wrong but many of us went to bed with initial counting showing that the UK would remain in the EU and that Hillary Clinton would be the 45\nth\n U.S. president. The next morning’s results were confounding. \nFor the past six years a group of researchers at EPFL’s Information and Network Dynamics Lab (), part of the , have been using probabilistic modelling, large-scale data analytics and machine learning to develop , in a bid to better predict final election and referendum results from partial, early ballot counts. In August, they presented a  outlining their statistical method and results to the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Conference (ACM KDD).\nWith an obvious initial focus on Switzerland, PhD student  and Master student  (now a PhD student at ETH Zurich), led by Professors  and , have been analysing voting data, searching for structure in the voting behaviour of the country’s 26 cantons and around 2200 municipalities. “We require historical data, of course, to learn something interesting, and in Switzerland we have a lot of data thanks to direct democracy. We have now been able to input the results of more than 300 different votes going back to 1981 for these 2200 municipalities. In this endeavour, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office has been very transparent and helpful in understanding their data,” says Victor. \nWhilst municipalities are different, they are also not completely independent. The researchers have developed an algorithm that learns how voting biases (such as cultural, demographic, and historical) influence poll outcomes, and have used this to make accurate predictions from partial counts. In a country with four official languages (German, French, Italian and Romansch), the first version of Predikon, in 2014, indeed found that a municipality’s language did influence voting behaviour. Since then the tool’s algorithms have evolved, and for the four most recent votes, it was able to predict the outcome using very early results from a small number of municipalities with a margin of error of about 1%. “We take the past national vote results of every municipality and develop a model of how they relate to each other. If we compute all those results the average will vary quite a lot but our algorithm is able to correct various linguistic, cultural and demographic biases. That allows us, with a few partial results and in whatever order they come in, to make a better prediction than just taking the average, as typically reported by news outlets,” explains Victor.\nIn the last national vote held on February 9 before the coronavirus crisis hit, Predikon predicted the results of both the  and the  to almost pinpoint accuracy, within minutes of the first partial results. On September 27, we expect that Predikon will tell us very early on whether the free movement of people between Switzerland and the EU will become restricted.\n© 2020 EPFL\nThe underlying model is general and has been successfully applied to predict, in addition to Swiss referenda, the outcomes of German parliamentary elections and the popular vote of the US 2016 election. As for future applications,  can imagine Predikon evolving, for example, to turn survey data before a vote into better outcome predictions. “We could try to exploit our model to improve predictions from crowdsourced or poll data. We could also explore the dynamics of how opinions shift in different areas over time due to population and/or demographic changes.”\nAnd what of the question of Predikon’s impact? “We develop our statistical models and algorithms to make predictions and inferences and then there's always a quest to find new areas of application and opportunities for impact. Victor has been perfect to lead on Predikon’s continuing development. He cares about the environment and about society, and I think this is a project that has allowed us to do something meaningful and maybe enhance the democratic process,” Matthias concludes.\nVisit Predikon at", "summary": "On September 27 Switzerland votes for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, including on a contentious initiative to end the free movement of workers with the European Union.  will be predicting the final outcome within minutes of the release of the first partial municipal results from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office.", "claim": "On 1981 Switzerland votes for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, including on a contentious initiative to end the free movement of workers with the European Union.  will be predicting the final outcome within minutes of the release of the first partial municipal results from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 1], "noise": false}
{"id": 448, "text": "When it came time to pick a career, Simone Deparis didn’t hesitate for a second. He had known he wanted to be a math teacher ever since he was a teenager. Today a senior scientist and linear algebra professor at EPFL, he enjoys everything about math – its beauty, its contradictions and especially its complexity. “In this field you have to be tenacious, because you’ll inevitably come across times when you’re frustrated. You have to hang in there so you can eventually savor the victories,” says Professor Deparis. Originally from the Canton of Ticino, Deparis holds a mathematics degree from ETH Zurich and a PhD from EPFL; he started teaching at EPFL ten years ago. Never one to shy away from a challenge, he even seeks them out – in the 2017–2018 school year he tested . Students were responsible for learning the theory at home, and the class time was spent doing exercises. In recognition of his bold initiative in the field of mathematics and the quality of his teaching, Deparis has been given the 2018 Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.\nFlipped classrooms are being used increasingly at universities worldwide, including EPFL. But the challenge for teacher Deparis was to use the approach in a linear algebra class for first-year students who may not be particularly motivated about math. (The class is for students of all sections except architecture, math and physics.) “I completely revolutionized my class. It was a lot of work but at the same time very stimulating,” he says. And that wasn’t the first risk he’s taken. While at EPFL, he also developed a ; some 40,000 people have signed up for the English version.\nA knack for improvisation\nSimone Deparis tried out the flipped classroom with 100 linear algebra students over five weeks in the middle of the term. “Studies have shown that students learn better in flipped classrooms. And the mathematics section also wanted to see if this new approach would help motivate students who didn’t choose to study math.” For this trial run, he let students decide whether they wanted to participate and used it for only a third of the total course. “We wanted to make sure that students who volunteered to try the flipped classroom weren’t placed at a disadvantage.” \nTo develop his approach, the mathematician Deparis worked closely with Cécile Hardebolle, a teaching advisor at , and based it on . “The first lesson was a disaster because I didn’t coordinate it with the MOOC. But I quickly fixed the problem, and then the students were really enthusiastic. The experience taught me a lot. With flipped classrooms, you have to be able to respond to questions and comments that might not come up in a conventional classroom. You have to be able to improvise while remaining clear and methodical.”\nTeacher Deparis’s students enjoyed this new way of learning, even though it meant they had to do more work at home. The initial feedback indicates that by working on exercises in the classroom, students were able to better assess their level, discuss problems and help each other out. In fact, once the five weeks of the flipped classroom were over, the students didn’t want to return to the conventional approach. Deparis is repeating the experiment this fall but extending it to cover most of the course. And once again, hundreds of students have signed up.

This is plasma, a substance that could be used in the future to control the movement of small satellites and space probes.\n This machine is part of Félicien Filleul’s Master’s project. A 26-year-old physics student at EPFL, Filleul also did a Minor in Space Technologies. Through this project, which he did at the Swiss Plasma Center in collaboration with the Space Engineering Center (eSpace), Filleul contributed to the effort to develop plasma-fueled satellite propulsion engines. Research on this groundbreaking technology has been ongoing for around 10 years.\n “Plasma engines could work really well with small satellites like Cubsats, which are sent into orbit without any way to control or adjust how they move,” said Filleul. So the objective is to develop a system of low-power but steady thrusters that are highly precise and consume little energy. Scientists could use them to maintain or correct the satellites’ orbit or orientation, or to set up a constellation of Cubsats, in which several of these small satellites are networked for the needs of individual missions.\nParticle soup\n “Plasma is perfect for this type of propulsion,” said Filleul. “We make it out of xenon gas, a single gram of which provides 10 times more acceleration than the same quantity of traditional fuels.”\n Plasma is neither solid, liquid nor gas – it is the fourth state of matter. While less familiar than the other three states of matter, plasma is used in everyday items such as neon signs and television screens. It is very common in the universe and can be found in the sun and other stars.\n Plasma is made by heating xenon in a vacuum at temperatures so high that the electrons are pulled out of their orbit around the nucleus. They come to form a ‘soup’ of highly charged particles. More plasma can be generated by sending a helicon-type electromagnetic wave – which spreads as it turns like a corkscrew – through the soup. Scientists can freely adjust the substance’s density by controlling the wave’s intensity.\nHeading for Mercury\n Filleul’s project focused on the antenna used to generate the helicon wave. The antenna, designed and developed at EPFL by the startup Helyssen, lends itself to plasma engines that are both small and light. And those are two major concerns in the area of space technology. “My job was to test the antenna with different densities and qualities of plasma, in order to find the ones that will work best in space,” said Filleul.\n But the fun doesn’t stop there for Filleul.

{"id": 453, "text": "Africa’s increasingly urban populations are expected to double by 2050. This is leading to cities' exponential growth, something that is exceptionally difficult for many countries to manage. Most of these urban areas, such as the sprawling city of Lagos in Nigeria, are so vast that their boundaries are hard to identify. Africa’s new cities are being built in peri-urban areas that are able to absorb population growth. However, few countries have urban planning strategies that address this reality. Taken aback by how little these areas have been studied, Kemajou – a PhD in architecture student – decided to focus his thesis on them, and more specifically on the cities of Lomé in Togo and Yaoundé in Cameroon. On 8 December, Kemajou defended his thesis, carried at EPFL as part of the Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT), under the supervision of Jérôme Chenal. We sat down with Kemajou to talk about his work.\nWhen studying the outlying areas of Lomé and Yaoundé, you found that a harmonious urban fabric existed, albeit one that has developed outside of legal frameworks.\nThere is a considerable gap between designed cities – as established in legislation and by urban planning policies – and a “lived” city that was built up by its residents day after day. This large disconnect means that there is no oversight regarding what is being built – and that’s mainly because existing urban planning instruments and legislation are basically holdovers from the colonial era, which, until now, were modelled on urban practices from Europe. But European cities are constructed differently, and their technical, human and financial resources are totally different. This means that these instruments are not realistic for Africa and thus inapplicable. The reality on the ground is more local and more socially complex than in Europe, and this needs to be taken into account.\nThere is a collective intelligence underlying how a city is constructed\nArmel Kemajou\nAre you saying that current urban planning strategies won’t be able to meet the needs of a population that will double in 20 years?\nIn Yaoundé, the city's circumference has tripled over the last three decades. In Lomé, it has increased by a factor of 4.5. It’s clear that the resources to halt this urbanization are lacking, so a line must be drawn under what has been done. City officials can’t act as if everything that has been created by existing residents doesn’t exist. More robust and scalable plans that address this rapid urban expansion are needed.\nDevelopment of the city of Yaoundé, Cameroon, from 1984 to 2016. © Public thesis defense of Armel Kemajou\nSo, city officials should factor in building methods that residents have already been using?\nYes, exactly. There is a collective intelligence underlying how a city is constructed. For my thesis, we interviewed about a hundred residents of Lomé and Yaoundé. We wanted to find out what kind of strategies they used to achieve home ownership, and how these strategies interconnect. We found an underlying wisdom and intelligent choices. When you come in with rigid assessment methods, you get the impression that it’s all very informal, place-specific and even incomprehensible. But underneath there are very clear rationales.\nYou can’t force people to adhere to a 1960s urban planning model that hasn’t changed since independence.\nArmel Kemajou\nYou’re saying that the built environment in these two cities' peri-urban areas is not informal?\nAbsolutely not. Very few people we spoke with moved to the outskirts out of frustration, or because they had no other choice. These are people who think things through, who make plans and carry them out. This produces something that urban theorists are not accustomed to, but it is nevertheless a valid way of constructing a city. Besides, if most of a city is “informal,” how do we determine what constitutes the “real” city? If we want to design an efficient model that is in line with reality on the ground, we should take as our starting point what the majority of people are actually doing.\nA residence in the Nkozoa neighborhood in Yaounde © 2018 Armel Kemajou\nTherefore, the new cities that are being designed and built on urban outskirts are the result of local construction strategies?\nThey’re the result of collective thinking, of know-how that people draw on to construct their own living space, one that suits their needs. They build their space on the scale of a home, but they also know how to make it part of their district, in association with their neighbors – an area where families can thrive, with collective social facilities, markets, children’s playgrounds, and so on. All of this takes place outside of any urban planning framework, because that framework can’t keep pace with these collective strategies.\nBut without a comprehensive approach to urban planning, won’t the limits of this strategy eventually become clear, given Togo and Cameroon’s rapid population growth?\nIn my thesis, I don’t advocate a \nlaissez-faire\n approach – that would end in chaos. But the way urban construction is being addressed today is also not the right one. I recommend a collective urban planning method, one that can establish a dialogue among local governments, city planners, and the hundreds of thousands of “individual urban developers.” It’s at the intersection of these two ways of thinking that we will find the most appropriate form of urban planning. You can’t force people to adhere to a 1960s urban planning model that hasn’t changed since independence.\nTrès heureux de remettre le titre de Dr a Armel KEMJOU pour son superbe travail de recherche sur la construction des périphéries des  à  et \n — Jerome CHENAL (@jchenal) \nYour interdisciplinary work lies at the crossroads of urban planning, social science and economics. It also includes research in law and engineering. How did you carry out your study?\nTo take an example, let’s say you want to study Geneva. All you need to do is submit a request to the canton and you have all the data you need in digital format. But when it comes to the very local reality of these two cities in Africa, where there is a dearth of basic data, we had to be creative in our methodology. Central to the study was a qualitative analysis of those hundred or so interviews we conducted with city residents, which we cross-referenced with more rigorous methods. To understand how people get around, we attached GPS devices to about fifty motorized cabs that serve the peri-urban areas. By combining this travel data with the interviews, we were able to measure the impact of transportation methods on the development of outlying areas. We rounded this out with interviews with experts, cartographic analyses of land values, and finally an assessment of the existing legal framework.\nCould your thesis findings be immediately implemented by Togolese and Cameroonian city officials?\nStudies like this one are, in my view, essential to achieving effective urban planning. I’m very happy that colleagues who are employed by these two cities attended my online defense. I was able to immediately share my recommendations with them. I will make my thesis findings available and I hope that they will eventually translate into policies consistent with my recommendations.\nSpatial development of Lomé, Togo.

{"id": 455, "text": "More than a thousand students are starting classes at EPFL for the first time today. Together with the excitement of the new academic year, they are feeling apprehension about starting university life and pressure to learn complex subjects at a fast pace. So to help students acquire effective learning habits, EPFL has created the . The app is part of EPFL's efforts to encourage independent learning and familiarize students with scientifically proven working methods that will enable them to acquire new knowledge quickly. “The world is changing rapidly and our students need to know how to adapt,” said Roland Tormey, the coordinator of EPFL’s Teaching Support Center. The app is based on a book and a MOOC on study skills entitled “Apprendre à étudier,” both of which Tormey co-authored with Cécile Hardebolle.\nHelping students change their habits\nThe app’s website, optimized for smartphones and tablets, is divided into two main sections. “The aim is to make people aware of their own behavior, in order to increase their metacognitive skills – in other words, so they can learn how to learn,” says Patrick Jermann, the originator of the Learning Companion concept and the executive director of EPFL’s Center for Digital Education. It should be noted that no information is collected from users without their permission.\nThe first section, accessible to all users, allows them to identify their learning habits. It consists of eight questionnaires to find out how they approach things like note-taking, problem-solving, planning and stress management. In the questionnaires, the users must say to what extent each statement applies to them on a scale of 1 to 7. After completing each questionnaire, Learning Companion gives the users personalized advice on how to improve their learning process and refers them to a video forming part of the “Apprendre à étudier” MOOC. “It’s a genuine teaching tool, because by completing each questionnaire, students become aware of their own learning behavior and of the fact that other techniques exist,” says Hardebolle, a teaching advisor at the Teaching Support Center.\nUseful for teachers as well\nThe second section, which at the moment is only accessible to students taking EPFL courses, monitors their exercises. Teachers wanting to use the app ask for their exercise sessions to be included and select whether or not to allow access to the solutions. For each exercise, students are asked whether or not they successfully completed it, whether they got help, and what difficulties they encountered, such as understanding the class, analyzing the problem and calculation mistakes. “We have listed common difficulties, and users can add their own in another section,” says Tormey. At the end of the questionnaire, students receive personalized advice. And after completing a few exercise sessions, they can see individual charts showing their most frequent difficulties as well as the percentage of exercises passed, failed or not completed. Students can also see their position relative to the class, based on the average of other students’ responses.\nLearning Companion is also useful for teachers. Although they cannot access students’ individual profiles, they can see charts showing the class profile.

{"id": 457, "text": "While some five million people still speak a language that evolved out of Mayan civilization in South America, the written language has suffered a different fate. The secrets of the classical Maya were lost with the destruction of most works during the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Only three codices have been preserved, and they are in museums and institutions in ,  and  These documents contain precious data for the researchers who are seeking to discover the secrets of this pre-Columbian writing, much of which remains obscure (10 to 15% of the symbols are not known). Researchers at  a research institute affiliated with EPFL and with the new , are harnessing the power of computers to help archeologists and epigraphers make significant progress in their work.\nCreative writers\nThe researchers, working closely with the Maya writing specialists, have analyzed thousands of hieroglyph signs, which are symbols that represent a sound, or also a meaning. Maya texts are often written in the form of blocks. A block could contain one or multiple glyphs, representing a sound, a word or even an entire sentence. “Each image tells a story,” said Rui Hu, a researcher working on Social Computing at Idiap. “Sometimes we can guess their meaning with the help of people who still speak this language today, and also by using glossaries.” The task is particularly difficult because the hieroglyphs are difficult to decipher in the historical documents owing to their age and state of deterioration. What’s more, pre-Columbian writers sometimes drew the symbols in different and creative ways, varying by era and location. And then there are those symbols that look like each other yet mean something completely different.\nA real conundrum for archeologists and epigraphers, who still spend a significant amount of time poring over catalogs to identify each symbol. Thanks to the work of the Idiap researchers and the involvement of Maya writing specialists from Bonn University in Germany, high quality representations of the hieroglyphs found in the three known works have now been created and will be catalogued digitally. The researchers will then be able to use this tool to quickly identify a given hieroglyph and its meaning, and to see, for example, what the most common combinations of symbols observed in the same ‘block’ of text are. \"This research is of great interest to mayanists, given the potential of such novel multidisciplinary approaches for overcoming obstacles resulting from applying more traditional methods\", said Carlos Pallán Gayol, researcher at Bonn University.\nOnline database\nThis interdisciplinary project with the contribution of the University of Geneva will eventually lead to an online database that the scientific community will be able to use to research, compare and annotate texts in the quest to expand our knowledge of Mayan writing and iconography. “By combining the work of the Maya experts with IT-based tools, we can make fascinating progress,\" said Rui Hu.

{"id": 461, "text": "Researchers at EPFL have spent the past few months capturing 3D images of a Roman-era chainmail shirt using a computed tomography (CT) scanner. The piece of military armor, which dates back more than 2,000 years, is one of only a handful of similar items ever found in Europe. The twisted, corroded remains of the shirt were buried deep underground and fused with dozens of other objects that were almost impossible to tell apart using conventional investigatory techniques.\nThe EPFL researchers, working with Vaud Canton archeologists, then came up with a full inventory of items held within the chainmail shirt. Using a 3D printer, they reproduced the items while leaving the fragile shirt – reduced by the ravages of time to a hunk of distorted metal – completely intact. The findings will be unveiled in a special exhibition at the Cantonal Museum of Archeology and History from 26 April to 25 August 2019.\nPick apart and reconstruct\n“This research shows the potential applications of CT scanning technology in archeology, where finds are often complex, deformed, distorted or fused,” says Pascal Turberg, who leads the ENAC Interdisciplinary Platform for X-ray micro-tomography (PIXE) at EPFL. “Using 3D imaging, we can pick these objects apart and reconstruct them.” The platform’s scanners can produce images down to a resolution of just 0.5 microns – extremely useful for working out the structure of the tiniest objects.\n“The complex shape of the chainmail shirt made the whole process technically challenging,” adds Turberg. “What’s more, iron has a high X-ray attenuation coefficient and generates unwanted artefacts. Working on the fragment gave us a chance to hone our 3D imaging expertise. What we learned will serve us well in the future, allowing us to scan complex materials containing metallic elements.”\nA staple, two brooches, and a handle pin\nThe findings proved just as exciting for the archeologists involved in the project. “This initiative was a success,” says Lionel Pernet, director of the Cantonal Museum of Archeology and History. “With 2D X-ray images, we could only see 30 or so complete items and fragments contained inside the shirt. The 3D scans revealed more than 160!” The newly discovered objects – all of which will go on display in 3D-printed form as part of the exhibition – include a furniture staple, two \nfibulas\n (Roman brooches with a spring-fastening mechanism), a cutting edge, and a pin for a cooking pot handle.\nBuilding on success\nThe archeologists are already thinking about how CT scanning technology could enhance their research in the future. They’re planning to use the scanner to peer deep inside a remarkable toolkit unearthed at Vufflens-la-Ville, and to count the tree rings inside wooden posts and statues so they can date the pieces more accurately. “Scanning a funerary urn would save us a lot of time,” explains Matthieu Demierre, a lecturer at the University of Lausanne and an archeologist at Archeodunum, a firm that works with the cantonal archeology office. “Rather than working blind, we’d be able to see exactly where the bone fragments and other items are inside.”\nCollections printemps 2019.

The archeological site, which contains 250 separate pits, is estimated to date from around 100 B.C. It’s been puzzling archeologists since it was discovered during quarry expansion work in 2006. It was initially believed to be a sanctuary. But expert opinion shifted in 2011 when the contents of the pits were examined in closer detail. The finds reveal that the site was used for both religious and secular purposes. Moreover, the presence of the chainmail shirt, complete bronze and iron cooking pots, metal containers, and other valuable objects – all buried in a short space of time – makes the site highly unusual for its era. Archeologists also found a large number of human remains, some showing evidence of ritual killings (aligned human and cow skulls) and others pointing to more violent deaths (severed heads and charred bodies). Was the site a refuge for a besieged community? Could it have been a place of worship? Perhaps it was a military camp?

{"id": 465, "text": "For their semester project, Océane Hames and Lucas Ott, two Master’s students in Environmental Engineering at EPFL, chose to focus on the Yverdon-les-Bains wastewater treatment plant. This plant is known as a pioneer in Switzerland because in 2016 it became the country’s first to install a stripping membrane system for nitrogen recovery. These systems work by using a polypropylene membrane to filter the nitrogen from the rest of the wastewater, after the effluent has gone through some initial processing. By stripping out the nitrogen in this way, plants can both reduce their nitrogen emissions into nearby streams and produce a high-quality liquid fertilizer. The fertilizer made at Yverdon-les-Bains has been certified by the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture; some 140 m\n3\n are generated each year and sold to a local farmer who spreads it on his crops, thus completing the nitrogen cycle. \n But Hames and Ott wanted to make the nitrogen recovery process more efficient by increasing the fertilizer’s nitrogen concentration to above 40 g/L, as that would cut the cost of storing and transporting the fluid. Taking inspiration from the osmotic distillation technique commonly used to concentrate fruit juice, the students developed a method specifically for nitrogen that could be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment processes. They conducted lab experiments over several days to bring the nitrogen concentration close to its saturation point. They also measured the flow rate of steam through the membrane so that engineers can later size the equipment needed to implement the technology on a large scale. \nWorking hand in hand with industry\n The students tested their new osmotic distillation method at a pilot unit provided by Membratec, a Sierre-based firm that develops membrane technology for wastewater treatment. The unit consisted of two 25 L wastewater reservoirs, pumps and two metallic cylinders containing a stripping membrane. They ran tests on the closed-loop system using a fluid with the same composition as the fertilizer supplied to the Vaud farmer. \n “Osmotic distillation has the advantage of being able to concentrate fruit juice at room temperature, meaning the juice’s taste and nutritional properties remain intact,” says Hames. Ott adds: “In osmotic distillation systems, a hydrophobic porous membrane lets gas compounds like steam pass through but not liquids. The driving force is generated by a partial vapor-pressure difference between the two fluids separated by the membrane. That’s the same mechanism we used to concentrate the nitrogen in the liquid fertilizer.”\nSupplementing the theory learned in class\n These types of semester projects, called Design Projects, are required of all Master’s level environmental engineering students at EPFL. They are intended to give students first-hand experience with the R&D carried out in industry. “I really liked the trial-and-error aspect of the project and the opportunity to discuss our progress week by week with a Membratec engineer,” says Ott. And according to Hames: “It was nice to take a break from the classroom and spend the day running lab experiments. And it was really motivating to know that there could be a concrete application for the work we were doing.” The students’ project was supervised by Christof Holliger, a full professor at EPFL and head of the School’s Laboratory for Environmental Biotechnology (LBE). \n The students weren’t the only ones to gain from the project. Christophe Bonvin, who oversaw their work at Membratec, viewed it as a win-win experience: “We really enjoyed coaching the students. It’s impressive how much students can contribute when they’re motivated and well-guided, and when the scope of their projects is clearly defined.”", "summary": "Summer series: Two EPFL Master’s in Environmental Engineering students have developed a novel method for recovering nitrogen from wastewater.

The goal is to provide a framework for specific initiatives related to digitalization and innovative teaching methods in EPFL’s core subjects. For instance, one initiative involves leveraging the research being carried out at EPFL’s Center for Learning Science (LEARN) to enhance teaching practices across Vaud. Schoolteachers at all levels will be able to acquire the skills needed for preparing students for the digital age – whether by giving them a basic knowledge of computer science, showing them how to best use digital technology or equipping them to tackle related challenges. Another initiative relates to providing training for high-school teachers ahead of the requirement that, starting in 2022, computer science courses be given in all Swiss high schools; this requirement is set out in a directive issued by the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education.\nNumerous areas of cooperation\nThe agreement provides for cooperation in a variety of areas alongside digital education. These include measures to enhance the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects – such as through  – and to shore up existing mathematics courses.

{"id": 473, "text": "Weeds have started to grow in the Place Nord since EPFL went into lockdown on Friday, 13 March. The air inside the campus buildings smells like it’s been trapped in there for a while. And for seven weeks, coffee cups have been waiting on people’s desks to be washed, and prototypes and pipettes have idled in the labs. Around 1,200 staff members are now authorized to return to campus. While many are eager to get back to work, there’s also – understandably – some apprehension. But there will be no shortage of measures to protect people from the invisible coronavirus.\nThroughout the lockdown, the Security, Prevention and Health Domain (DSPS) team – keeping one eye on the changing cantonal and federal directives – has been working hard to get the campus . The restart plan sets out the measures that have been or will be taken at all levels, down to the very last detail. It also allows for the measures to be adjusted as the public-health situation evolves. “We want people to feel confident about coming back to campus, but we also want to take things step by step so that we can assess whether the measures are the right ones, whether any changes need to be made and, ultimately, whether we can ease the restrictions,” sums up Eric Du Pasquier, who heads up the DSPS team.\nA gradual return to campus\nDuring this , only research teams needing access to lab facilities will be able to come back. They’ve had to draw up shift plans, since only around 35% of each team will be allowed on site at any one time. Starting now, there will be between 1,200 and 1,500 people on campus every day. And if all goes well, that number will increase to around 2,500 at the end of June. However, the School’s 9,000 Bachelor’s and Master’s students are still not allowed back on campus.\nFor those who will be coming back to their labs and desks, the message is clear: “Keep your distance and wash your hands regularly.” To make things easier, the DSPS team spent all of last week putting together welcome kits composed of eight face masks and one small bottle of hand sanitizer for each staff member. They also put up signs on every door to remind people of the public-health measures, provided catering outlets with floor-marking materials, and made sure that all buildings are thoroughly cleaned and all door handles, ramps, rails and Camipro booths disinfected. “That way, we know we’re starting off on the right foot,” says Du Pasquier.\nDrastic hygiene measures\nThe DSPS team isn’t compromising when it comes to staff members’ health. Early on in the lockdown, EPFL donated some 60,000 surgical masks to health care workers. But it has now acquired a further 150,000 and is expecting another 100,000 to be delivered this week – all of them made in China. Around 80 hand sanitizer dispensers have been set up at strategic locations across campus. “As staff members gradually return to campus, we’ll get a better idea of the logistics in terms of cleaning facilities and providing disinfectant, soap, paper, etc.” says Du Pasquier.\nRunning catering points like clockwork\nThe aim is to reassure people by providing facemasks without making them compulsory. But drastic hygiene measures will be needed to safeguard people’s health. These measures have had the biggest impact on the School’s catering points – they’ve had to be totally reorganized, just like airport security was after 9/11. Providing food is an essential task, so some ten catering points will reopen on the Lausanne campus and one at EPFL’s site in Geneva. But lunch breaks won’t be the same as they were before March 2020. Priority will be given to takeout food, there’ll be no buffet service, and choice will be limited. There won’t be many places for people to sit, there’ll be markings on the floor, and payments will be by card or Camipro only. Catering staff will wear gloves and facemasks and be separated from their customers by a Plexiglas screen and a visor. Customers will be asked to keep their distance, to not touch anything, and to follow the one-way system. “We’re going further than the federal guidelines,” says Loic Sauzeau, regional head of Compass Group, which is reopening the Giacometti, Le Corbusier and PUUR catering outlets. “In addition to safeguarding our staff, we want to provide people with impeccable service.”\nCatering points will be open in various buildings in order to limit people’s movement. And to prevent bottlenecks, hot dishes will be served on one side and sandwiches and salads on the other. In the early days, it’ll be a matter of just seeing how things go. “We want to meet our customers’ needs as best we can,” says Sophie Vuetaz, head of operations at Novae, which is reopening the Ornithorynque, Cybercafé and Epicure outlets. “But getting the quantity of food that we produce right will also be a challenge – we don’t yet know how much demand there will be, and we want to keep waste to a minimum.

Following its invention in the 19th century, modern concrete – or Portland cement – quickly found its place in the building industry. This novel material could be used to rapidly build roads, bridges, dams and many other types of civil engineering works. Nowadays, nearly 4.2 billion tons of concrete are produced every year around the world.\nEPFL’s  has been instrumental in the advancement of concrete technologies over the past century. Initially called the Building Materials Laboratory (see the history of the lab below), it was founded in 1918 by Henri Demierre and Professor Marius Lacombe. For its centenary celebration, the lab has offered guided tours, children's workshops, videos and a retrospective exhibition. Karen Scrivener, the lab’s current director, is unequivocal:\n“No other material can compete with concrete.” \nWhat has changed in the study of concrete since 1918?\nIn the early days, the focus was on defining the properties of this burgeoning material and on responding to basic questions, like how much concrete is needed for a building, and what its mechanical properties are. The professors who have headed up the lab since then have each had their preferred research topics, and some of them quickly made a name for themselves internationally.\nHow has this material changed our lives?\nWe used to make buildings out of stone, but that was very expensive and time-consuming and offered little design freedom. Concrete starts out as a powder, which makes it very easy to transport and then fast and straightforward to use. It is also highly versatile – EPFL’s Rolex Learning Center is a good example of what can be done architecturally with concrete.\nWhat is your lab’s current focus?\nThese days our research centers on environmental issues. Concrete is a relatively environmentally friendly material to produce but the manufacturing process nevertheless accounts for nearly 10% of human CO\n2\n emissions owing to the huge – and growing – level of demand.\nWe study all of the fundamental phenomena that characterize concrete in order to produce green concrete and keep CO\n2 \nemissions down. The world needs answers to global warming now, not in 20 years.\nIs there an alternative to concrete? \nNo other material offers so many possibilities. Concrete works best and has become the industry standard. And Switzerland – with the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, ETH Zurich and EPFL – is among the leading countries in concrete research and can have an impact at the international level.\nOur lab teams up with partners in Asia and Latin America, where demand is booming.

{"id": 481, "text": "On 27 July, around 20 architectural, civil engineering and environmental engineering students from EPFL and ETH Zurich will fly to Valparaíso, Chile, where they will spend three weeks helping to construct the Pórtico de los Huéspedes (“Guests’ Portico”), in association with students from Chile’s Escuela de Arquitectura y Diseño de la Pontificia Universidad Católica Valparaíso (e[ad] PUCV). The Portico is located at Ciudad Abierta (“Open City”), some 16 kilometers north of Valparaíso on the Pacific Coast. You can follow the students’ progress on EPFL Out There, the blog covering EPFL research expeditions and projects abroad. \n - \nA supplement to classroom learning \n Before heading to Chile, the students spend the week of 8 July getting ready for their trip at EPFL. The goal of the program is to expose them to rudimentary building methods and an approach to architecture that is focused more on the humanistic aspects. “EPFL began working with Ciudad Abierta six years ago, after we put together an exhibition about this pilot site,” says Patricia Guaita, an architect and scientist at EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE). Since then, she has been taking a small group of EPFL students to the site every summer so they can pitch in with the construction work. The students are selected through an interview process and obtain credits they can use towards their Master’s degree. \n “This ‘summer school’ is intended to supplement what the students learn in class by giving them hands-on experience with concepts related to construction and the use of space,” says Guaita. “The Portico is being built through a cross-disciplinary team project, and we hope that through our program, students will see how its construction is the tangible result of knowledge built up over the years. That will give them a fresh perspective on the construction process.” This year students will be testing out a new method for concrete form work.\n Accommodations at the site will be basic, with little or no internet access. Does that worry the students? “Not at all! It’ll give us a chance to get back in touch with the real world, after spending years behind a computer,” says Annabelle Thuring, a Master’s student in architecture. Pablo Grunig, a first-year architecture student, adds: “I immediately liked the idea of building something on the other side of the planet, in the middle of sand dunes, and being completely immersed in the project.”\nA once-in-a-lifetime experience\n “This program, with its unique living and working conditions, will show the students that construction work must not be limited to technical considerations but should also take into account the human and material experience associated with the site and its occupants,” says Guaita. David Jolly, the e[ad] PUCV professor who supervises the EPFL students every year, agrees. “The timeline for building the Portico is not dictated by school calendars. Students have been building a section of it every year for the past five years. The central role in this project is thus not played by students but by Ciudad Abierta. This workshop offers a unique platform where the students’ work, education and daily life meld. In working on this project, EPFL students don’t just help build a portion of the City, they also build up a part of themselves. What they are constructing today will last, in terms of both the building they construct and the unique experience they gain.” \nAn avant-garde artistic approach \n Ciudad Abierta was created in 1970 by a group of architects, poets, philosophers, sculptors and painters including Chilean architect Alberto Cruz and Argentinian poet Godofredo Iommi. Little known by the general public, the City has always fostered avant-garde thinking in a variety of arts and disciplines.\nThis year, the Open City Research Platform is sponsored by the EPFL Institute of Architecture, the EPFL Architecture Section, the Design Together program and the ETH Board.

This thread-like substance can bind together various substrates, such as woodchips, and the resulting mixture can be molded into things like bricks, panels, packing chips, furniture and a host of other objects. Eight students at ENAC are studying how mycelium – which individuals can grow themselves – could potentially be used to replace plastic.\n“This idea came up when we met with architecture students at our school to develop an original, innovative alternative to existing building materials, which generate a lot of pollution,” says Gaël Packer, an environmental engineering student at ENAC. Inspired by a TED talk, he and his classmates decided to lend their support to this groundbreaking community concerned about the future of the earth. As future architects and construction engineers, they realize that, as a result of resource depletion, some of today’s building materials won’t be around forever, and that existing materials generate a lot of emissions throughout their life cycle, from production to disposal.\nPromising results\nMycelium-based materials offer a promising alternative because not only are they light, cheap and easy to make, but they also provide a way to recycle waste products and can be biodegraded in just three months. Today a number of grow-it-yourself kits are available online; all you need is mycelium, a substrate and a bit of patience (not included in the kit). The first step is to grow the “mushroom roots” in a sterile or pasteurized environment together with the substrate and some flour and water. The resulting mixture is then poured into a mold. Once it has set – which takes about a week – it needs to be baked at a low temperature to stop any further growth and consolidate the object’s shape. The result is a light, low-density, solid, and resistant object – much as if it had been produced using 3D printing.\nRather than use a grow-it-yourself kit, the students made their own version of the mixture using mycelium from local oyster mushrooms and fibers from hemp grown in the Jura region. Then, armed with a healthy dose of scientific skepticism veiled in optimism, the students tested out their mushroom-derived material. “We worked with several EPFL labs to test the material’s key properties: thermal insulation, acoustic absorption, compressive strength, and water- and fire-resistance,” says Packer. They found that its thermal insulation capacity was on par with other insulating materials, that it could easily withstand the weight of a human body, that it floats and is watertight, and that it is fairly fire-resistant. Acoustic absorption tests are still under way.\nA recipe that can be improved\n“Although further testing is needed, the results so far are highly promising and show that the material’s properties are similar to those of expanded polystyrene. We can certainly improve those properties further by adjusting the composition of our mixture, whether in terms of the substrate or the mushroom feed,” says Packer.\nThe success of this project owes in part to ENAC’s Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory (SKIL), an open-space workshop where students can work on class projects and receive technical and practical support as well as assistance from teachers.\nThe Mycelium, Design and Architecture (MD&A) team members are: Kimberley Berney, Adrien Berteaux, Aurélien Brun, Mathias Helfenstein, Thomas Läng, Enrico Margaroli, Leily Moser and Gaël Packer.\nContact:", "summary": "Summer series.

{"id": 487, "text": "A projection system barely larger than a grain of sugar is going to be integrated into many tools of daily life. From augmented reality glasses to mobile phones, from the “head-up display” system for cars to 3D scanners – Lemoptix, which now has 22 employees, hopes to finalize major contracts by the end of the year. An update follows with the designer and CTO of the company, Nicolas Abelé.\n–\tYour company was founded in 2008. At what stage is the development of your tiny projector?\n Nicolas Abelé: In 2008, when we had just developed this technology between the laboratories of microsystems and electronics, the goal was primarily to build a projector into mobile phones. On the one hand, that is one of the most difficult challenges, since it requires from the getgo that the device is small, that its energy use is minimal, and that the cost is extremely reasonable. On the other hand, the market is uneven in this field because the stakeholders focus in successive phases, either on the software (operating system) or on the hardware. In the meantime, three other important markets have emerged for our technology. Currently the most attractive of those is the Head-Up Display for cars. Manufacturers themselves came to us to develop the “next generation,” with the ultimate goal of creating an augmented reality system for the driver. The second market is the three-dimensional scanner for laptops, gaming and security. In terms of data, it is the equivalent of what provides the “Kinect,” but our technology brings the dynamic aspect of scene illumination, which allows the image capture system to be much simpler, more compact and with low power consumption. An interesting application is for 3D printers, because it enables a dimensional image of the object and can be instantly transmitted to the printer without any interruption or loss. More recently, we have confirmed the tremendous advantage of our projection system for augmented reality glasses. For now, the projection surface is small and faint because it requires special treatment of the glass to make it opaque. Our solution makes it possible to project a larger image (immersive) without an opaque surface and with ultra-low power consumption, thereby permitting a longer and more convenient use.\n–\tThese technologies seem promising, but when will we see them on the market? In an article published in 2010, you announced a market launch in 2011. So what is the plan? \nThe heart of the technology was actually built by the Japanese manufacturer Hamamatsu Photonics in 2011 and placed on the market there a year and a half ago, for a variety of systems ranging from laser printing to industrial sensors. We are operating under a system of licensing and negotiations that takes a long time. In all the areas described above, we have been in contact with very large companies for many years. We must go through many contacts within these large companies. We must connect the ideas to the engineer responsible for the integration itself. And each time, we must adapt our concept based on customer needs. But now we have reached very advanced stages in discussions with major players in all the fields of application mentioned above. With the car, for example, the goal is to have our technology integrated into the 2017 models.\n–\tWhat about your technology is innovative? Where will you make your devices, and how will you sell them?\n The technology is based on MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) and operates via a single tiny mirror less than a millimeter in diameter that is made of several hundred copies on a silicon wafer. A projector contains a single mirror which reflects red, blue and green laser rays. The mirror oscillates on two axes of rotation, and the light beam scans at a rate of 20,000 times per second. Each pixel of the image is created by modulating the laser at around 100 million pulses per second, fast enough for the human eye, so that the image is completely homogeneous and stable. All the mirror prototypes are manufactured on campus in clean rooms (CMI), the electronics are designed in our local Innovation Park at EPFL and assembled locally at PCB, the integrated circuits (ASIC) are made in Taiwan, and assembly of the projection head is carried out by us. We have people in Korea, Japan and the United States, in particular, to track and canvass customers.\n–\tWhat is the secret of your quick development?\n Our greatest strength is definitely that we have among our 22 employees excellent specialists in all applicable areas such as optics, microtechnology, electronics, opto-mechanics – the list goes on. We are also effective in the design stage because we can ensure that all these trades, with their highly specific vocabularies, perspectives and expertise, work well together to achieve a common goal. Having all of this expertise internally, as opposed to externally, means that we can quickly find compromises between all the technical specifications, which makes it possible for us to advance quickly. The huge advantage is that we constantly find new ideas for improvement, which leads to innovation and strengthening our patent portfolio. The disadvantage is that, at the “T” moment, we are never fully satisfied with the state of the technical progress, since we always know how the system could be improved. This year we decided to achieve a kind of launch for a first marketable version with reference designs in different city markets. This makes 5 years that we have been optimizing our system, and the time is ripe for discussing its integration into the production lines (supply chain) of major market players. Due to our constant innovation, our rapid execution and its high performance, our technology is often chosen to be included in the advanced phases of development, despite competing heavyweights with large teams who have been working for 15–20 years on the development of very similar technology. We are convinced that 2014 will be the year of Lemoptix!\n–\tHow much investment have you needed so far? Do you feel pressure from your investors, most of whom are business angels?\n We are pretty proud of having managed to get a product that has a big advantage over the competition with an investment of only 5.5 million Swiss francs. Keep in mind that our main competitors had investments from the tens of millions up to, for one of them, half a billion. For a company like ours that is growing rapidly, the pressure is high but manageable, and investors appreciate both our technical and commercial progress.", "summary": "Lemoptix is developing an ultra-compact projector.

{"id": 492, "text": "Getting food from the farm to our plate involves complicated supply chains. Agricultural products are frequently processed in several stages and shipped through one or more countries. No surprise, then, that today’s consumers are looking more closely at what’s really in their food – especially given the numerous scandals that have come to light, such as the one in 2013 where food producers were caught substituting horse meat for beef.\nTo address this problem, scientists at  launched the  initiative to develop a system that would enable consumers to sequence the DNA in processed foods and identify every single ingredient. The initiative will entail adding DNA data to the , an open-source repository of nutritional information on 45,000 bar-coded food products in Switzerland. The Open Food Repo was also created by the Digital Epidemiology Lab.\nRecipes for gene sequencing\nAll organisms – from onions to human beings – are built from DNA. These are the molecules that contain the information necessary for organisms to live and grow. DNA sequencing is the process of determining the sequence of this genetic information so that it can be analyzed and interpreted. However, DNA sequencing is very expensive and requires specialized people and equipment.\nSequencing the DNA in food was something that, until recently, could be done only by university researchers and certain high-tech companies. But modern advancements in sequencing technology have made it both technically and financially feasible for smaller organizations like community laboratories. That’s where the Open Food Repo DNA initiative comes in: since last fall, scientists have been working on a new method that spells out DNA sequencing instructions like the steps in a recipe, employing techniques like high-throughput sequencing and DNA barcoding – which is the process of examining just a small section of an organism’s DNA. Capable of being read like a barcode, these sections are similar enough across all organisms to be easily extracted from an entire DNA chain, yet different enough that they can be used to identify individual plants and animals.\n“The first step is to mix all the food ingredients together thoroughly with a mixer. Then we extract a section of DNA using specific chemical compounds at high temperatures,” says Pietro Cattaneo, Product Development Scientist at SwissDeCode. The extracted DNA section is amplified to make numerous copies and then sequenced by converting the individual molecules into electric signals, which are translated into a DNA code.\nUsing citizen science to get better information about our food \nAs a citizen-science initiative, Open Food Repo DNA aims to allow consumers to one day analyze the food they buy and determine precisely what it contains. A group of consumers tested the system at a workshop held in the Hackuarium community laboratory last Saturday, 4 May. Participants included both scientists and open-science advocates, and they spent the day extracting and amplifying the DNA from food products ranging from paprika-flavored potato chips and tuna sandwiches to falafel and pesto sauce. The food’s DNA sequences will be sent to the participants in the upcoming days.\n“A growing number of products in supermarkets today are processed, and consumers want to know exactly what they’re eating. What’s great about this initiative is that it will empower people to analyze their food themselves,” says Barbara Pfenniger, the head of the food department of the Fédération Romande des Consommateurs (a consumer watchdog group for French-speaking Switzerland), who participated in the workshop. “Open-science projects also have a snowball effect – the more participants they have, the more people get interested in them. And in this case, we are encouraging people to look more critically at the food everyone eats.”\nAt the end of the workshop, participants discussed the system’s advantages and how it could be improved. “We plan to hold more workshops at the Hackuarium in order to test and improve our system, and make it easier to use. Then we will roll out the workshops at other community labs in Switzerland and abroad,” says Talia Salzmann, who is heading up the initiative at the Digital Epidemiology Lab.\nBy making it possible for consumers to perform genetic analyses of the food sold in Switzerland, the project team hopes to foster dialogue on how new technology can be leveraged to help people eat healthier, improve transparency in the food industry, and make a positive contribution to the health of our society as a whole.\nProject external partners\n is a company that develops solutions for authenticity and food safety certification (Open Food Repo DNA protocol development).\n is a community and citizen laboratory that allows everyone to explore new ways to imagine and design research and innovation (the place where the workshop was held).\n is a Swiss charitable foundation supporting, among others, better health through good nutrition.

{"id": 496, "text": "Do young people drink more out on the town or at a friend’s place? In small groups or at large parties? Do they drink more if they stay at a single bar or go bar hopping? And among all these factors, which are the most influential in whether or not they drink? Researchers at Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have set out to answer these questions through a study based on factual information – i.e., smartphone data collected on weekend nights – to characterize the drinking habits of young people. A model they developed from the data can estimate\nthe nights when someone is likely to drink with over 75% accuracy. \nSpecific applications\nThe researchers developed two apps that the study participants installed on their smartphones. Participants used the first to photograph and record all the beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) they drank during a weekend night, along with the type of drink, the volume, the number and where they drank them. The app sent a reminder to participants every hour in case they forgot to enter any drinks. This data indicated whether a participant drank alcohol on a given night, and was used to classify participants as either “with alcohol” or “without alcohol” for each night in the study. \nA model that estimates alcohol consumption\nThe second application activated sensors that continuously collected data on each participant’s location, activity level, apps used, battery level, screen usage and nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi spots. The researchers compiled the data from the two apps and matched up the contextual data with the sensor data, giving them a comprehensive picture for each participant and each night. That showed them under what conditions – alone or in a group, at home or in a bar, at one or several different locations – participants consumed higher amounts of alcohol. Then they developed a machine-learning algorithm to crunch through the data. It can estimate whether an individual drank alcohol on a given night with over 75% accuracy. The researchers were also able to determine which factors were most significant in estimating behavior; these include the activity level, the number of different locations where beverages are drunk, and how many other people are around. Their findings have just been published in .\nIncreasingly rich data\nThe data was collected anonymously from 241 participants between the ages of 16 and 25 over 10 weekends – Friday and Saturday nights from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am – in Lausanne and Zurich. This is the first study that uses rich data collected by smartphones to understand the drinking habits of Swiss youth. What’s more, because it is based on factual information and not perceptions, it marks a novel approach to research on public health and prevention. “Most studies of alcohol consumption by young people are based on questionnaires that participants fill out the following morning, for example. But we know that people typically forget to note down much of what they drink,” says Daniel Gatica-Perez, adjunct professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering and Digital Humanities Institute, and head of Idiap’s Social Computing Group. The same holds true for the situations in which we drink – it can be rather subjective. But for this study, researchers used data collected by sensors: activity level, the extent to which people moved around, the number of other people present, the type of apps they used during the night, and how often they used their smartphone. \nA starting point for future alcohol-consumption research\nThis study shows that smartphone data provided voluntarily in the interest of public health can be used to estimate alcohol consumption on a given night with promising results. That opens the door to investigating related topics, such as drinking at home and the role of the time factor in drinking. However, the researchers stress the importance of including interviews in such studies; for this study, interviews were carried out by a partner scientist at the University of Zurich. “Data don’t tell the whole story,” says Gatica-Perez. “Interviews help us understand the nuances and many factors involved when people go out at night, and validate our findings.”", "summary": "Researchers from Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have carried out a study using smartphone data from young Swiss people to better understand the circumstances in which they are most likely to drink. A computer model developed from the data can estimate, with over 75% accuracy, whether alcohol was consumed on a given weekend night.", "claim": "Researchers from Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have carried out a study using smartphone data from young Swiss people to better understand the circumstances in which they are most likely to drink. A computer model developed from the data can estimate, with over 75% accuracy, whether alcohol was consumed on nights night.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [57, 57], "noise": false}
{"id": 500, "text": "Cable cars are one of the hallmarks of Switzerland, along with funiculars and paddlewheel boats. They adorn the country’s mountaintops like garlands. While cable cars are most often associated with leisure activities in the winter and summer, Fernando Simas has looked at how they could become a common mode of urban transportation. Simas, a researcher at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR), recently defended his thesis on this topic, explaining that urban cable cars could become popular among city residents and provide much more than just a means of getting around. Paradoxically, even though the technology is fairly simple, incorporating cable cars into urban landscapes poses its own set of challenges and would require making some complicated decisions.\nThe first part of Simas’ thesis explores how city residents generally use public transportation, in order to determine how urban cable cars could fit into commuters’ existing habits. He studied two regions in particular: Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, and the Lake Geneva region, in Switzerland. In the Lake Geneva region, Simas compared five different transportation lines: the M2 subway line in Lausanne; city bus #5 in Geneva; the cable car connecting Le Châble and Verbier; the Mont-Salève cable car near Geneva; and the N1 commuter ferry connecting Lausanne and Thonon. In Brazil, he analyzed public transportation lines similar to those selected in Switzerland. To conduct the research, Simas and his team followed around a dozen people on each of the ten lines for two days and evaluated the participants’ experience according to thirteen criteria.\nA more comfortable commute\n“Cable cars seem to be really popular. They are perceived as being more comfortable than city buses and similar to boats in the way they break with the monotony of public transportation,” says Simas. “Cable cars form a kind of cocoon for passengers, as do automobiles. But whereas automobiles create a semi-private space, cable cars create a semi-public space that is physically removed from the confines of the surrounding urban environment. That helps passengers relax and makes their commute more enjoyable.”\nIn comparing the different forms of transportation, Simas found that today’s commuters expect more from transportation systems than merely a way of getting from point A to point B. They also expect a certain level of service, comfort, efficiency and even enjoyment. The LASUR team introduce the concept of commuting-time comfort, which covers all of these aspects. “A public transportation system is essentially a human-machine interaction. In our study of this interaction, we used the notion of continuance: how long can a passenger stay in the same position interacting with the machine? A passenger who is comfortable in a given form of public transportation will be able to travel longer distances, several times a week,” says Simas. And just as mountain cable cars help vacationers better understand the rugged terrain, urban cable cars can give commuters a different perspective on their cities.\nImpact on the neighborhood\nThe second part of Simas’ thesis looked at how effective urban cable cars would be in various urban settings. A handful of Swiss cities, including Sion, Fribourg, Morges, Zurich and Geneva, are considering such plans. The LASUR team, in association with scientists at EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Mobility (LAMU), investigated several of them and found that “urban cable cars can be a catalyst for regional development.” That’s because they create 3D spaces, and the height of the cable-car line affects not only where stations are located but also how they relate to surrounding areas, both nearby and further away. Erecting a cable-car station is a much more intricate affair than building a bus stop. It can have an impact on several facets of a neighborhood, beyond just transportation.\n“Urban cable cars are just one of several transportation options, and city officials should think carefully before making a decision. This option should be considered only if it can bring something to a city that buses and trains can’t,” says Simas. “Many places have had a positive experience with cable cars, and cities in Switzerland could draw on that to try something radical – something that would only work with this particular form of public transportation.”", "summary": "For his thesis at EPFL, Fernando Simas studied how cable cars could be an appealing transportation option for city commuters, and how they could be incorporated into tomorrow’s urban landscapes.", "claim": "For his thesis at EPFL, Fernando Simas studied how cable cars could be an appealing transportation option for city commuters, and how they could be incorporated into today’s urban landscapes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 29], "noise": false}

{"id": 517, "text": "Some 30 high-school students watch a large screen where flashing colors indicate neural connections, while two PhD students hover over an echography device. At this workshop given by the Electrical and Electronic Engineering section, one of the students asks the researchers: “What’s the difference between an engineer and a doctor?” The reply comes from section head Jean-Philippe Thiran: “As engineers, our role is to develop systems that let doctors ‘see’ what’s invisible to the naked eye. But we would never make a diagnosis.”\nThis is just one of the workshops held this year during EPFL Information Days, a three-day event organized every fall by the school’s Study Programs Promotion Service and various sections. The goal of the event is to show high-school students what goes on in research labs, illustrate the sometimes-surprising links among different disciplines and describe the school’s 13 Bachelor’s programs. The event has become increasingly popular – over 3,000 students signed up this year.\nParticipating students can attend a host of talks and presentations and take part in a hands-on workshop, where they spend a full day visiting labs in the section of their choice. Researchers at the labs demonstrate the technology they’re developing as well as potential applications. “The Information Days are really important for our section because students don’t necessarily have a good sense of what electrical engineering is. But when they see exactly what we do, they get really excited. And many of those who attend our workshop end up enrolling in one of our degree programs,” says Thiran.\nFlorence Aubert, a high-school senior in Morges, wanted to become an airline pilot when she was younger. But today she’s considering either micro or electrical engineering. “There are so many things that look interesting,” she says, after discovering the myriad of new devices being developed in this field: connected objects, a watch that analyzes your heartbeat in real time, a giant touch screen and a system of cameras designed to film artists on stage with unparalleled quality.\nSeeing how the science is applied\nYasmina Jemini, a senior at Provence high school in Lausanne, smiles broadly as she watches a demo. She’s always enjoyed figuring out how things work and would like to go into medical robotics, but she hasn’t yet selected a degree program. However, she does know she wants to study at EPFL. “We’re really lucky to have a world-renowned engineering school nearby that’s also affordable,” she says.\nAll the high-school students we spoke with on Thursday were “impressed” by the campus and excited to see what goes on behind the scenes. “The Information Days are essential for introducing our section to high-school students,” says Jérôme Waser, head of the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering section. “On the first day we show them the learning side of our degree programs, and on the second, the more tangible, research-oriented side – which is great to be able to do. And the feedback we’ve gotten has been excellent.” The other sections also value the event and spend a lot of time and energy getting ready.\nThe students especially enjoyed visiting out-of-the-ordinary places like the reverberation chamber and the anechoic chamber, whose walls fully absorb sound waves – making the room so quiet you can hear your eyes blink. “The campus’ facilities are really impressive, and it’s great to be able to see exactly what goes on in research labs,” says Antoine Hirt, a high-school junior in Burier.\nThe students also got to work behind a lab bench, watching chemists make Bakelite (the world’s first plastic), viewing fluorescent cells under a microscope, comparing chemical reactors and learning about recent advancements in computational chemistry, where computers can now simulate 1,000–2,000 heavy atoms. “I’m still deciding between chemistry and physics.

{"id": 523, "text": "Hikers setting out on one of Switzerland's many walking trails often bring back beautiful photos, the occasional cramp and – quite unintentionally – ticks. These tiny acarids, which are present in dense undergrowth and at the edges of forests, are particularly active in hot weather and attach themselves to human and animal hosts passing nearby. Despite their small size, they can transmit potentially serious diseases such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Recent research by the Institute of Microbiology at CHUV has shown that ticks are often carriers of large amounts of chlamydia, a still poorly-understood bacteria that can be passed to humans and cause secondary disease. \nScientists are aware that tick proliferation and activity are influenced by numerous environmental factors, including temperature and humidity. However, data are still lacking on their regional distribution over time in Switzerland, which has been classified as a tick risk area. At EPFL's Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG), Estelle Rochat's thesis project set out to address this lacuna and to identify areas where ticks carry chlamydia. Her extensive mapping work has been published in the prestigious .\nTop collaboration with  and his team at , as well as with , great work by Estelle Rochat  - another  contribution to \n — Stéphane Joost @HOME (@stephanejoost) \nThree data sources\nAfter identifying the environmental conditions that are conducive to the presence of the castor bean tick (\nIxodes ricinus\n), Switzerland's most prevalent tick species, Rochat generated maps of their geographical distribution between 2008 and 2018. She drew on three databases: a 2009 field campaign carried out by the Swiss Army, during which more than 60,000 ticks were collected and analyzed; thousands of entries into a  that allows users to indicate where they observed ticks; and a tick collection project led by Rochat in 2018.\nShe then used machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence) to predict the probability of ticks and bacteria being present based on values taken from a set of environmental data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, etc.) in the vicinity of collection points.\n© LASIG\nThe machine learning program allowed Rochat to estimate the ticks’ locations, and revealed that the surface area of zones propitious for tick propagation grew from 16% of Switzerland’s land mass in 2008 to 25% in 2018. \nStatistically, the model works well. Using the rules of probability, we can tell if a given location is tick-friendly, or if, conversely, ticks are unlikely to be present. Using the distribution model, we then estimated the prevalence of bacteria within those locations. This in turn allowed us to identify sub-zones where areas that are favorable for ticks are also favorable for chlamydia.\nEstelle Rochat\n“A landmark project”\nThe scope, originality and fresh approach of Rochat’s research drew praise from Gilbert Greub, a world-renowned expert in chlamydia and ticks and Director of the CHUV’s Institute of Microbiology. “This is a landmark project, and contains sufficient detail at national level to allow us to draw conclusions. We can clearly see that between 2008 and 2018, there was an increase in high-risk tick exposure areas, which I believe is a reflection of global warming. It shows that ticks have migrated 300–400 meters higher up in subalpine zones.”\nFor Greub, the study is a valuable tool for prevention purposes, as well as for awareness-raising. In addition, it will be useful at the Institute, which is conducting clinical studies on the impact of tick-borne chlamydia on humans.\nRochat’s model is now available in open access and can be used in future research on other tick-borne pathogens. “It’s extremely interesting to see how ecological niches overlap. We used chlamydia in this case because we were working with Gilbert Greub, a global expert, but our approach can also be applied to tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. The algorithms needed to crunch through environmental data are freely available and can be applied to other datasets,” says Stéphane Joost, who supervised Rochat's thesis at LASIG.\nJoost sees an opportunity for the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health to fine-tune its risk maps for ticks – which will be increasingly present in Switzerland as a result of global warming.\nMore ticks? Remain calm.\nAccording to Gilbert Greub, Director of the CHUV’s Institute of Microbiology, the presence of more ticks in certain zones increases the chance of exposure to certain diseases. For the past three years, patient consultations for tick bites, Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis have . Greub reiterates the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health’s recommendations. \"Summer is beautiful here and people enjoy cycling and walking. The most important thing is to get vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis. Secondly, avoid hiking in high-risk areas that are off the beaten track – or if you do, wear long pants that can be tucked into your socks. Also, you should examine yourself carefully in the evening when you come back from a hike, including your back and any hidden areas. There's no need to panic or check every half hour. If you do find a tick however, use a pair of tick tweezers to remove it.\"", "summary": "A comprehensive study by EPFL and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) has enabled researchers to map the geographical distribution of ticks in Switzerland for the first time, as well as to determine whether they are carriers of chlamydia.

Project teams collaborated via a shared communication platform and benefitted from an additional day as well as advice from experts from a range of fields spanning materials science, life science, economics and finance.\nThe three award-winning applications were selected through an online vote. They all have one thing in common – providing practical solutions to pandemic-related problems, whether by reaching out to lonely elderly people, helping parents home-school their children or diagnosing Covid-19 remotely.\nThe first application, called , was already under development before the hackathon began. Through the application’s website, users can send letters to nursing-home residents who may feel isolated from friends and family. The second application, called , is designed for parents who may not have the time or knowledge to help their children with their schoolwork. Quome draws on a team of math students and teachers as well as university professors with experience in online teaching. The website provides a series of exercises with personalized explanations. The third application is , a website and mobile app developed at EPFL’s Embedded Systems Laboratory under the HelpfulETH initiative. Coughvid can give users an initial indication of whether they might have Covid-19 based on the sound of their cough. The system was set up during the hackathon but the developers still need to expand their database to make the program more reliable.\nHackathons are usually geared towards computer programing, but this one showed that the format can be used in a variety of other fields too. Other inventions coming out of LauzHack were a reusable face mask, a system for disinfecting shoe soles, and a model habitat suited specifically to pandemics. The awards – in the form of vouchers – were largely symbolic, but they did give the three project teams a boost in terms of continuing their development work and increasing their visibility.\nThe projects created during LauzHack will be developed further with varying degrees of involvement by EPFL. Some EPFL students will use them as a basis for their semester projects, while others may build prototypes once the campus is open again. Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, took part in the LauzHack both as an expert and a driving force behind the event and was impressed with what he saw. “The participants learned how to use the resources available and turn them into concrete solutions incredibly fast,” says Vandergheynst. “It was clear that bringing together people from several disciplines produced more innovative ideas.” This approach may be repeated in future years – but on campus – to help students come up with semester projects.\nThe LauzHack organizers were also pleased with this event, especially since its fully online format meant they didn’t have to worry about logistics and equipment. “We had time to follow the creative process and even give suggestions based on our expertise,” says Blagovesta Kostova, president of the LauzHack student club, and Tatiana Porté, its communications officer.", "summary": "LauzHack – an online hackathon held by an EPFL student association in early April – proved to be a big hit.

{"id": 538, "text": "A trend that has held for the past 15 years has been confirmed by preliminary figures for 2016: the proportion of women in EPFL’s student body continues to rise. And a symbolic threshold has been crossed this year, as 31% of new first-year Bachelor's students are women. The total number of new first-year students also rose again, with a 6% increase on last year.\nThe schools that attract the largest number of women are architecture and life sciences, and life sciences is the only school at EPFL where women accounted for more than half of incoming students in 2015 (50.3%).\nThe 2016 Bachelor’s degree enrollment figures suggest that this year’s class will be a strong one for women at EPFL. But this is a continuation of a 15-year trend. 20.5% of the study body was composed of women in 2002 versus 27.7% in 2015. The school of life sciences, which began in 2002 at EPFL, accounts for one third of this increase. But women have made strides in other schools as well, including engineering (rising from 12% to 17%), computer and communication sciences (from 11% to 15%) and management (from 21% to 33%).\nSlowly but surely, more women in the technical sciences \n “The technical sciences are less and less a male bastion, and the ongoing improvement shows that the progress we have made is here to stay, even if we would like it to happen more quickly,” said Patrick Aebischer, president of EPFL. “This is clearly the result of a changing society, but also of efforts that we have made in terms of encouraging women to study here and highlighting the careers that women graduates have embarked upon, whether in academia or entrepreneurship.”\nThe size of the overall student body should also increase, since the number of new first-year Bachelor’s students is up 6% compared to 2015. Physics showed the steepest rise (around 50%), followed by math (20%) and life sciences (15%). Of EPFL’s 13 schools, chemistry is the only one to see a significant decline in the number of new first-year students (-30%).

{"id": 540, "text": "Some theories are widely used even though they have never been experimentally validated. One example is the so-called narrow groove theory, or NGT, which explains how air-lubricated bearings work in mechanical systems.\nThe theory was proposed in 1965 but, until recently, it had only been tested partially or indirectly. Researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory for Applied Mechanical Design (LAMD), based at Microcity in Neuchâtel, have now closed a gap that has persisted in the scientific literature for over 50 years. The team has published its findings in the journal \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing\n.\nWhy did it take so long to validate the theory? “At the time, engineers were content to observe that the theory worked,” says Eliott Guenat, a doctoral assistant at EPFL and the paper’s lead author. “But that’s all changed, because the mechanical parts we’re developing today are much more advanced and intricate.”\nJürg Schiffmann and Eliott Guenat © EPFL 2020 \nThe narrow groove theory was , two engineers at New York-based Mechanical Technology, Inc. The theory explains the working of herringbone grooved journal bearings, or HGJBs – a type of air-lubricated bearing that supports rotating parts in mechanical systems. Many different types of bearings exist, but HGJBs hold the most promise for developing ultrahigh-speed rotating machines because the rotor is supported on a cushion of air generated by the rotating shaft. “What makes HGJBs special is that they don’t cause wear and tear because there’s no contact,” explains Jürg Schiffmann, who heads the LAMD. “In my lab, we’re using this design to develop the energy systems of the future.”\nValidating the theory\nTo validate the narrow groove theory, the researchers mounted a rotor supported by several HGJBs on a test rig, setting it spinning at 100,000 rotations per minute. Next, they used a shaker system to vibrate the rotor and watched how it reacted. The observations allowed them to calculate the bearings’ stiffness and damping coefficients, which they compared against the theory’s predictions. They found that NGT tended to marginally overestimate both values.\n“We were able to quantify the extent to which the theory holds,” says Guenat. “Now that we’ve shored up our understanding, we can take the theory and apply it in industry and research in new ways.”\nGuenat plans to conduct more experiments to take further measurements. “Instead of using air-lubricated bearings, we’ll run the experiment again with refrigerant, a gas used in heat pumps,” he explains. “The idea is to confirm that the theory holds not just in air, but also in a medium with markedly different chemical and physical properties.”\nElegant in its simplicity \nNGT is a mathematically elegant theory that would likely never have seen the light of day had engineers only now taken an interest in air-lubricated bearings. “These days, we feed our data into a computer and let the processor do the heavy lifting,” explains Guenat. “But even with modern processing power, arriving at the result would take several minutes. With NGT, we can do the same in just a few seconds.” The fully validated theory could have innovative applications in energy system design.", "summary": "An experiment by EPFL researchers has confirmed a theory that has been used in mechanics for over half a century – despite never having been fully validated.

{"id": 544, "text": "This week, every two hours, a humming noise can be heard at CES in Las Vegas – that’s when the drones come out at the Swiss Pavilion. Some onlookers are intrigued by the noise, while others have come specifically to see the 15-minute demonstrations, which are introduced by Nicolas Bideau, head of Presence Switzerland. The 200m² area around the stand is not large enough to accommodate all the spectators, some of whom stand on their tiptoes in the aisles to catch a glimpse of the action. In each demonstration and subsequent Q&A session, it’s clear that these aircraft – most of which were developed at EPFL – are attracting interest from professionals looking for potential collaborations or investment opportunities.\nFor US specialists, Switzerland – with its “Drone Valley” – is not necessarily a country they associate with aerial technology. However, as Romeo Durscher, the director of Public Safety Integration at multinational drone specialist DJI, says: “The real experts know what’s happening, and they like the positive, professional and visionary approach emerging in Switzerland, in particular around its elite universities.” Some Swiss startups are meeting with success in the US, like Flyability -which comes from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and supported by the NCCR Robotics, as Dronistics and FlyJaket- and Pix4D, two EPFL spin-offs that have forged strong positions in the American market. Flyability’s drones, in their protective frames, can bounce off obstacles and continue on their way, while Pix4D’s mapping and measurement software is widely used by industry professionals.\nIntuitive piloting\nWhile EPFL has spun off around 12 drone-related startups so far, a number of other aerial technologies are currently being honed in its laboratories. If they can be turned into practical solutions, they may one day be turned into business ventures as well – a good example of this is Flyjacket, which came out of EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems. Flyjacket’s Carine Rognon says that “events like CES not only raise our profile but also allow us to bounce our technology off a large number of specialists, so that we can position ourselves more effectively in the market.”\nTimothée Peter and Arthur Gay, who founded the startup MotionPilot before they had even completed their studies, are visiting the stands of potential partners at CES and presenting their joystick, which makes piloting a drone more intuitive. “For the 60 years that drones have existed, the market has been dominated by conventional remote controls,” says DJI’s Durscher, a Swiss native who has been living in the US for 20 years. “The new applications we are seeing, along with the foldable, haptic-feedback joystick that could work with drones, are in keeping with the market trend towards more intuitive ways to fly drones, particularly for rescue missions.”\nDurscher is also enthusiastic about Dronistics, which is developing drones that fly inside a light, foldable cage. They could become the standard solution for traditional, short-distance parcel deliveries, just as email has replaced letters.\nGetting to the starting blocks at the right time\nBy attending CES – with the help of Presence Switzerland and Switzerland Global Enterprise – and taking part in other programs set up by both public- and private-sector organizations, Swiss startups can learn more about the US market and start meeting people. But this second phase needs to happen very quickly: speed is of the essence in the US, even more than in Switzerland.\nAccording to Durscher, however, the race should not start too early in a company’s life cycle: “It’s better to take full advantage of all available financial assistance and build a solid project before going to market. It’s not easy to convince investors, including in Silicon Valley, and it’s best to arrive with a well-developed technology and a clear message.” As soon as a company hits the starting blocks, the race begins. For Christian Simm, who served as CEO of Swissnex San Francisco for a decade and is now CEO of Swissnex Boston, companies shouldn’t be afraid to knock on doors and get back in touch with the contacts they have made. “After a meeting, it’s almost standard practice in the US – and particularly in Silicon Valley – to get a follow-up email before you’ve even made it back to the office,” he says with a smile.\nThe element of surprise\nFinally, the fact that the US does not regard Switzerland as a leading player in drone technology – at least, not yet – can sometimes be an advantage. The element of surprise can make a crucial difference according to Simm, who often hears comments like: “Why didn’t we know that you had this level of technology in Switzerland?” Maybe one day Switzerland will be more famous for its drones than for its chocolate and watches.", "summary": "This week, four EPFL-designed drones are being shown in the Swiss Pavilion at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Though the title of his talk was “Surveillance in the age of AI”, his moving discourse addressed freedom of speech, human rights, and democracy in addition to online privacy.\nA data collection problem\nSnowden began with an excerpt from his memoir, Permanent Record (Metropolitan Books, 2019), describing the explosion of data collection and “surveillance capitalism” that upended the “pioneering spirit” of the early internet, ultimately driving him to come forward. He argued that today, legal instruments like the  (General Data Protection Regulation) are largely toothless, giving examples of how companies like Facebook are circumventing them without penalty.\n\"The problem with the GDPR is in the name: we don’t have a data protection problem, but a data collection problem.

{"id": 547, "text": "Switzerland has become one big metropolis connected by its train lines. The denizens of this metropolis have much in common and often vote the same way. Indeed, despite widespread perceptions, the divide between French- and German-speaking Switzerland has been fading gradually over the past 10 years. At least that is the conclusion that Shin Alexandre Koseki, a PhD student at EPFL, has come to.\nKoseki, a researcher in urban sciences, specialized in mapping the results of Swiss federal votes. His aim? To track evolving patterns in the country’s political cohesion. Working in the ALICE and the Chôros Laboratories, Koseki came up with a way of showing how the Swiss vote depending on where they live. To do this, he collected and compiled the results of all federal votes held over the past 30 years, commune by commune. “The novel thing about his approach is this broad historical spectrum,” said Jacques Lévy, head of the Chôros Laboratory. “The ability to draw on such a huge amount of data meant that new questions could be asked.”\nA growing polarization\nKoseki, who is from Canada, can provide details on the intricacies of Swiss direct democracy over the past 30 years, backed by facts and figures. “In the 1980s, Swiss politics was marked by extensive fragmentation between language regions and cantons,” said Koseki. “The things people cared about varied widely from Geneva to Zurich. In the 1990s, the landscape changed and cities in the German-speaking region began voting alike. The same thing happened in the cities and countryside in French-speaking Switzerland. Since the year 2000, however, local populations in all regions have increasingly voted along the same lines. The divide between French- and German-speaking Switzerland has been losing relevance over the past 10 years.” A growing polarization is now apparent between, on one hand, the major Swiss cities, French-speaking Switzerland, Ticino and part of the Grisons in eastern Switzerland and, on the other hand, the suburbs and countryside in the German-speaking region. And as we will see below, Ticino has become a bit of a wildcard in recent years.\nA new kind of map\nTo illustrate his approach, Koseki pulls out some maps that he developed with the Chôros Laboratory. These maps show the population of the communes and the extent to which they agree on voting issues. From 2003 to 2014, a huge green area stretches from Geneva to St. Gallen (see image 4). This is proof of a burgeoning social and political alignment in Switzerland. “People commute more, there’s more interaction between people, and Bern is not as far away as it used to be,” said Koseki. “People living in the big cities thus share the same interests and even the same values.”\nFrom metropolis to megalopolis \n“We are seeing that the Switzerland of 2016 has become one big metropolis,” said Koseki. “Broadly speaking, the political preferences of city dwellers tend to converge, and from a geographical perspective, Swiss politics is increasingly characterized by consensualism rather than regionalism.” Lévy backs this assertion, but goes even further: “People are now talking about the Lake Geneva metropolis. But looking at the Geneva-St. Gallen corridor, one could even speak of a Swiss megalopolis that refers to a likeminded urban grouping with extensive links between individuals.”\nKoseki based his work on network analysis. Just as you can tell a lot about someone by their friends, this approach allowed the researcher to ascertain political links between different local populations while collecting information on how these links change over time. “Through this approach, we can see, for example, that the people of Zurich have historically been in political agreement with those of Bern, Basel and Winterthur,” said Koseki. “It also reveals who the residents of Zurich disagree with most, which happens to be a commune in Schwyz Canton.”\nEver more divisions\nIn Switzerland, divisions die hard. Koseki reports, for example, that suburbs in the German-speaking region disagree most frequently with the big cities. The same is true for rural communes, whose voting patterns differ even more from those of the cities but are similar to each other’s. Another exception: Ticino. “This is a relatively unpredictable canton that will vote against ‘mass immigration’ yet in favor of social measures, as we saw in the last federal vote,” said Koseki. Says Lévy: “Ticino is different from the other language regions of Switzerland in that it does not have a large cosmopolitan city. There is no sharp contrast in attitudes across the canton, which thus behaves very differently from the other language regions.”\nIs it time to tweak Switzerland’s direct democracy?\nWhat should be done about these results? For Koseki, since Switzerland’s large cities tend to align on federal votes, they could come up with more joint projects and should be able to better defend their interests. “The results show that our understanding of the regional dimension of individual and collective political action is outdated,” he adds.\nKoseki’s research shakes the very foundations of Switzerland’s system of direct democracy. “This type of map challenges the rationale behind the double-majority system, because the actual weighting of major urban centers is not represented in federal votes.” Lévy concurs: “The cities could try to make the most of their similarities and political interests, which are downplayed by the current canton-based system.”", "summary": "Over the past 10 years, the divide between French- and German-speaking Switzerland has played less of a role in politics than the country’s urban-rural divide.

{"id": 548, "text": "The monetary value of students’ prizes varies between 200 and 2500 Swiss francs, but the real value of these awards is without doubt the value-added in the curriculum vitae of the student who is completing his  or even his. They are valuable assets that enable him or her to stand out in a job market that’s becoming more and more competitive. As Etienne Dufey, former student in civil engineering and winner of the Stucky and IM Maggia prize, remarks: “It’s certainly a ‘plus’ for anyone’s CV. And what seems to me to be even more important is the chance to meet with professionals in the field, to whom the student must present his work in order to obtain the prize, as this creates contacts that can be very important in furthering a career.” \nThe prizes are divided into two categories: \n- Two-thirds of them are jury prizes. In these cases, the student must register, write a letter of motivation showing that his chosen diploma subject corresponds to the prize he or she is in competition for, and submit a given number of copies of this work. A supporting letter from his teacher is also a valuable advantage. No other work needs to be provided, apart from that already done by the student for his/her diploma. \n- A third of them are prizes given for marks, related to the results obtained by the student during his/her bachelor, master or foundation course study program. These are automatically awarded.\nThese awards can be funded by EPFL teachers and their family, public institutions, such as the Commune of Ecublens or Chavannes-près-Renens, or companies that reward work related to their activities – . Bombardier Transportation will award prizes for work in Mechanical Engineering whereas the BCV will award prizes for architectural work. Not all domains receive an award at present, for example Life Sciences. It’s important to note that EPFL also gives prizes to reward the best bachelor, master or foundation course study programs. A novelty for 2011: , the Association of EPFL graduates, will present a prize for the best master study program. The award ceremony takes place every year during the Magistrale – Graduation Day – which is held in a marquee with over 3000 parents, professors and guests present, or in the departments of the winner, on the same day.\nSurprisingly, for some years there are no candidates for the prizes. Students don’t always realize the opportunity that these awards represent, and often only take part after their teachers have suggested that they should! In addition, the cost of printing the number of copies requested by the companies can be dissuasive, since it can sometimes amount to more than the award itself. In Civil Engineering, for example, printing the blueprints is often very expensive. Since they are not guaranteed to get the prize, they prefer not to take part. What’s more, the jury doesn’t always manage to decide between the candidates, so sometimes the prize money is shared out between several winners. “I’ve tried to suggest to companies that they could allow students to deliver their work on a CD, but most of them insist on having printed copies”, explains Maureen Coleman, responsible for the students’ awards (prizes) at EPFL Academic Affairs. It also happens that when they have finished their master, the graduates-to-be forget to apply: “Even if the deadline for entering is 19 August 2011 at 12:00 noon, I encourage the students not to wait, and to already give me the necessary documents”, adds Maureen Coleman.\nSo we would like to remind all the EPFL students who wish to take part in a jury award that they can register until 19 August 2011 at 12:00 noon, but the sooner the better, in order to have enough time to complete all the steps, and if necessary get support from their teachers.

{"id": 551, "text": "Last year, EPFL’s Center for Learning Sciences (LEARN) launched an ambitious pilot project. The idea was to teach computer science and computational thinking skills to over 350 generalist elementary teachers – 98% of whom were women – and to inspire them to pass on their new-found knowledge to pupils despite resistance to technology in the classroom. LEARN, which coordinates Vaud Canton’s lifelong digital skills program in conjunction with the Vaud University of Teacher Education (HEP), the Vaud Department of Education, Youth and Culture (DFJC) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL), has recently reviewed the initiative – and the results are in.\nTeachers from  completed 24 hours of training over four days: three at their school and the fourth and final day at EPFL. The course was largely team-taught by two trainers: a teacher familiar with the local educational system and an academically trained scientist.\nAs part of the packed program, the teachers were introduced to concepts including algorithms, coding, educational robotics and computational thinking. “We realized that unplugged activities would work best because most of the teachers had reservations about using screens in class with such young children,” explains LEARN academic director Francesco Mondada. “The program’s success also hinged on how we designed the course. We opted for hands-on, collaborative learning. By listening to what the teachers needed and taking their input on board, we built a flexible program that gave them the confidence to take what they’d learned and apply it in the classroom.”\nPromising uptake\nAn impressive 97% of the teachers who took the course ran some of the activities with their pupils, despite being under no obligation to do so. “We applaud what EPFL and our partners have achieved,” says Cesla Amarelle, Vaud cantonal councillor for education, youth and culture. “Based on the feedback we’ve had from teachers and school administrators, we’re planning to run the course again. We’d even like to fast-track the pilot phase.”\nThe unplugged and robotics activities proved particularly popular with the teachers. Among the favorites was the “sorting machine,” where pupils try their hand at sorting data using a universally known algorithm and consider the implications of processor speed. Another front-runner was the “stupid robot” game, which introduces pupils to algorithms, loops and bugs. One pupil writes a set of instructions for escaping a maze or collecting an object, and another executes them. The teachers also singled out activities involving the Blue-Bot and Thymio robots, which teach children about robotics and coding.\n“Children form ideas about computer science at a young age,” adds Mondada. “That’s why it’s so important to get computing onto the curriculum early on – for pupils and teachers alike. Some of the teachers who completed the course said they’d changed their view of technology. Their opinions are now based on evidence rather than prejudice.” Many of the teachers said they had a more solid understanding of how computers work and felt better equipped to run computer science activities with their pupils. They also enjoyed the fact that the activities got pupils working in groups and said that children found the exercises engaging and easy to grasp. The only downside was that, after the course, many of the teachers were still unsure about the concept of “computational thinking.”\n“We’ll work on that aspect ahead of the next course,” explains Mondada. “Likewise, we need to improve how we track and assess pupils’ learning. We want to make a long-term difference when it comes to digital uptake in the classroom.” The aim is that, by the age of 8, pupils should be able to write and execute simple algorithms, encode and decode data to represent and transmit information, and recognize the key components of a computer. This fall, LEARN will train middle-school teachers at the same ten pilot schools, plus a cohort of elementary teachers from two new schools in a condensed, three-day course.", "summary": "During the 2018–2019 school year, teaching staff from ten pilot schools learned how to teach computer science and computational thinking to pupils aged 4–8 years, with a strong focus on unplugged activities.", "claim": "During the four days, teaching staff from ten pilot schools learned how to teach computer science and computational thinking to pupils aged 4–8 years, with a strong focus on unplugged activities.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 3], "noise": false}

{"id": 559, "text": "What do solar cells, laser surgery and HD TV have in common? The answer is photonics: all three relate in some way to this fast-growing field of research. Photonics, or \"light science,\" goes hand in hand with many new technologies. It underlies any technique for emitting, detecting, modulating, transmitting or amplifying optical signals. Below is a little overview of the topic, which is highlighted in a special review of EPFL's monthly publication Flash.\nLight to replace electronics\n The field of photonics came into its own in the 1960s, with the advent of laser technologies. Optics gradually replaced electronics in many fields, starting with specific areas like telecommunications but expanding its reach over time. Today, practically every scientific discipline relies on optics. \n At EPFL, almost 30 different labs are employing photonics, with the labs divided between the Engineering Faculty (STI) and the School of Basic Sciences (SB). They deal with all kinds of researches, from fundamental studies (i.e quantum photonics) to concrete applications (i.e solar panels). \n The fields concerned include metrology, optical communications, molecular detection and more - in short, photonics is everywhere. It is used for work on all scales and across the entire light spectrum. \"Frankly, there are very few fields that don't involve photonics in some way,\" says Benoît Deveaud-Plédran, head of NCCR Quantum Photonics, \"because anything involving a laser or an optical microscope is based on photonics, to take just two examples.\"\nEPFL among the only Schools to offer an academic training\n Only two Swiss schools offer Masters studies in photonics: one is the University of Applied Sciences in Buchs (St. Gallen Canton), which has a Masters in optics. The other is EPFL, with its \"optics option\" in the Master in microengineering and its photonics PhD. At postgraduate level, the number of photonics doctoral students at EPFL is steadily growing, with 87 PhDs in 2012 as against 7 in 2003. EPFL's Life Sciences Faculty also has a technical platform for bio-imaging and optical imaging (the PTBIOP), which makes a wide range of optical microscopes available to scientists. \nFor more statistics:\nFor more examples of researches in photonics:", "summary": "Photonics, the study of light in the broadest sense of the term, plays a major role at EPFL.\n Almost 30 labs focus on different aspects of photonics, like the design of lasers, construction of high-performance solar cells and development of tomorrow's telecommunications.", "claim": "Photonics, the study of light in the broadest sense of the term, plays a major role at EPFL.\n Almost 30 labs focus on different aspects of photonics, like the design of lasers, construction of high-performance solar cells and development of monthly's telecommunications.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [48, 48], "noise": false}
{"id": 563, "text": "EPFL is regarded as one of the pioneers of the massive open online course (MOOC) model in Europe. The School’s online distance learning capabilities were put to the test when in-person classes were halted on 13 March to contain the spread of COVID-19.\nHaving honed its production and publication capabilities under trying circumstances, EPFL is bringing the benefits of its expertise to Morocco as part of Excellence in Africa, a joint program with Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), a young university located 50km north of Marrakesh. Students at UM6P can now access 41 MOOCs developed at EPFL free of charge, while teaching staff can plan classes, track students’ progress and set assessments based on the course materials. \nMoroccan universities, like their counterparts elsewhere, have been forced to shut their doors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Staff at UM6P, where classroom teaching was suspended on 17 March, called on colleagues from EPFL to help get distance learning up and running as quickly as possible. “EPFL’s MOOC teams, led by Patrick Jermann, executive director of the Center for Digital Education, pulled off a remarkable feat,” said Jérôme Chenal, academic director of the Excellence in Africa program. “The team developed a portal and uploaded 41 MOOCs, while training local staff in Morocco remotely to administer the system. The entire process took just ten days from start to finish, and the platform opened to students on 6 April.” \nUM6P, which allowed Morocco’s Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training to use its state-of-the-art facilities to film a series of educational video clips, plans to open up access to the MOOC platform to students at the country’s other public engineering schools. “We have no doubt that digital education is the future,” said Hicham El Habti, the secretary general of UM6P. “We’re already part of the edX global online learning community. This latest project underscores our resolve to further the cause of education here in Morocco and across Africa.”\n Looking to the future, the platform built by EPFL will host new MOOCs developed at UM6P and, later, at other African universities. In the longer term, UM6P could serve as a central hub, developing and publishing online courses for learners across the continent. “Our Excellence in Africa program has delivered tangible results more quickly than any of us expected,” says Martin Vetterli, president of EPFL. “The new platform will no doubt support the initiative’s other pillars: developing junior African faculty and mentoring 100 PhD students enrolled in African universities.”", "summary": "EPFL and Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) in Morocco have launched a new online learning portal featuring 41 MOOCs developed at EPFL.

{"id": 568, "text": "It is known as an active emergency lane; that is: an emergency lane temporarily open to traffic. Since January 2010, this is the case for a four kilometers stretch between Morges and Ecublens. Its goal is to smooth the traffic flow of, at rush hour, 82’000 daily vehicles traveling on the A1 Lausanne-Geneva highway. Does it really work? Researchers from the Traffic facilities laboratory (LAVOC) at EPFL have assessed the effectiveness and impact of this measure. They have found that it undoubtedly decreases congestion and accidents, but they also believe that some modifications would bring about an optimal result.\nThe most notable effect of this active emergency lane is the intensification of the traffic flow: there has been an increase of approximately 750 vehicles per hour over a total of approximately 6’000 vehicles, despite a lower speed limit of 100 km/h instead of 120 km/h. Regardless of this increase in traffic, \"simulations show that this represents a reduction of one-fifth of CO2 emissions due to smoother traffic and reduced speed,\" said Professor André-Gilles Dumont, head of LAVOC.\nHowever, the effectiveness of this measure often comes down to a matter of minutes. When the flow reaches 35 vehicles per km, an alarm is triggered at a checkpoint at Blécherette. An employee must manually enable the opening of the lane. Still, sometimes it only takes a few minutes for the formation of a traffic jam which then takes some time to be dissolved. \"We seek to integrate other parameters apart from the flow to determine the opening of the system: the vehicle distribution by lane or the speed differences among the lanes. The most important thing is to maintain the flow of traffic as it is very difficult to recover it once a traffic jam is in place,\" said the professor.\nA better signaling \nAs for accident prevention, a more responsive system would also improve the situation. The introduction of the active emergency lane has resulted in an overall decrease of a quarter of the number of accidents that occurred between 2008 and 2013. \"They are often related to lane changes. If we want to reduce them, it is essential for drivers entering the highway to know as soon as possible that the lane is open so that, for example, they stay on it as long as possible\", said André-Gilles Dumont.\nSurveys conducted by researchers two years after the start of the system also showed that the measure was not yet fully adopted by drivers. Nearly 70% of respondents did not hesitate to use it. However a fourth of them felt uncomfortable to cross the white line and the same proportion did not feel safe.\nTo remedy this, scientists recommend a better signaling. \"A kilometer before entering the highway, in this case at Aubonne and at Crissier, it would be necessary to place a sign indicating whether the emergency lane is open or closed,\" said the professor. In addition, the study suggests indicating each lane’s speed limit in the section where the emergency lane is open. Currently, there are only two speed limit signs on gantries that are thus placed between the lanes. Meanwhile, scientists are thinking about a specific sign to allow drivers to pass across the white line with less apprehension.\nOther highway sections under consideration\nConducted since 2011, the study provides new prospects for the future. In collaboration with other two EPFL laboratories, researchers have also carried out a study on driver behavior through the use of drones. When do drivers change lanes? Under what conditions? What paths do they take? The flights to conduct the investigation took place in March 2014. The analysis of this exploratory study is still underway.\nThe assessment of the partial opening of the emergency lane in Morges is particularly relevant as other Swiss highway sections could use a similar system. That will be the case in 2015 in the Bern region between the Berne-Wankdorf and Muri intersections. There are also plans for its development at the entrance of Geneva, between Nyon and the Vengeron intersection as well as between the Cossonay junction and the Villars-Sainte-Croix intersection.\nThe Traffic facilities laboratory (LAVOC) was commissioned by the Fund for road research (Fonds pour la recherche routière) to carry out this study.

He will be putting this know-how into practice for the second consecutive year, in the writing workshop he is giving for students in their 3rd year graduate studies at the (CDH).\nNamed this year as “artist in residence” by the President of the school, he is responsible for initiating interaction between an art form and the institution. As a consequence, he had the idea of broadening the profile of his course, and making it a genuine event for the campus.\n“Over three semesters, we’re going to experience a fusion of the arts and science, but also of different members of the EPFL community”, explains Metin Arditi.\nHis project will be structured in three phases. First of all, he asked three renowned professors to join with him: Olaf Blanke, of the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, Pierre Magistretti, of the Laboratory of Neuroenergetics and Cellular Dynamics, and Majed Chergui, of the Laboratory of Ultrafast Spectroscopy. He asked them to look ten to twenty years into the future, and to imagine what ethical questions and debates on society will result from their work.\n“I appreciate very much Metin Arditi’s initiative”, emphasizes Majed Chergui, “as I believe that it’s important to raise this debate in the world of science, on questions of ethics and philosophy. To question ourselves on the influence and the importance of our findings as scietists, to return to an attitude based on doubt, and put the general interest at the center of our preoccupations – these should be part of our everyday activity”.\nIn a second phase, the reflections of these professors will help in the elaboration of three “roadmaps”, which will be provided to the students as the beginning of the course, in the Spring term. They will be able to choose the problem that interests them the most. On this basis, they will be asked to write a monolog or a dialog. They will be required to look, in their turn, into the future, and to put themselves in the place of a person who is confronted with these important ethical questions, and who must take a decision.\nLastly, to mark all the work and effort, an open evening will be organized at the beginning of the fall semester 2011. To start with, actors who will also be from the EPFL community will play the three best scenes written by the course participants. Then a debate will take place on the theme of new knowledge and the ethical questions they raise, with a panel of guests composed of several science personalities, among whom will be the three professors associated with the project.\nThe course will be held in the spring at a rhythm of two hours every 15 days, on Tuesdays from 13:00 to 15:00.

Throughout the experience, the scientists will post regular updates on EPFL Out There, a blog devoted entirely to EPFL research expeditions: \nVery few hydrometeorological data have been collected on Antarctica, but this expedition will change that. It will indirectly help measure the effects of climate change in this region by examining the behavior of the snowfall that creates icecaps.\nThis project was selected through a competition within EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). But this isn’t ENAC’s first foray to Antarctica. During the 2015 and 2016 Antarctic summers, ENAC researchers installed a weather radar at France’s Dumont d’Urville station on the Antarctic coast. That expedition, documented on EPFL Out There (), gave the team valuable experience in setting up research instruments in Antarctica.\nThen, in 2016, ENAC researchers built a weather station at the Princess Elisabeth research station, located further inland. And in 2017 an expedition was sent to the Syowa research station on an island off the shore of Antarctica; this ongoing project is being carried out in association with Japanese scientists.\nSnowfall microphysics\nThe first EPFL student to head to Davis will be Josué Gehring, who will leave on Sunday, 14 October for two months. His trip will take 18 days: a 28-hour flight to Tasmania followed by a 16-day boat ride. Gehring is a PhD student at the Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (LTE), headed by Alexis Berne, and specializes in using weather radars to research the microphysics of snowfall.\nHis first task will be to install a weather radar at Davis and collect data. The radar will operate throughout the Antarctic summer. Gehring will also set up a rain gauge to measure precipitation volumes and a multi-angle snowflake camera – a device that can take three high-resolution photos of a snowflake at the same time.\nOnce the data are collected, Gehring will compare them with data he collected during a research expedition in the South Korean mountains last winter, not far from the PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games. You can read more about this expedition on EPFL Out There: .\nSnowflake sublimation\nPost-doc Franziska Gerber will arrive at Davis at roughly the same time as Gehring. Gerber is conducting her post-doc research at EPFL’s Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences (CRYOS), headed by Michael Lehning. At Davis, she will install two instruments to analyze snowflake sublimation by polar winds. One will count snowflakes, while the other will measure air turbulence and water evaporation. This information will let her calculate the flow of snowflakes hitting the ground and the flow of sublimated vapor in the air, and determine how much snow is sublimated by the wind versus how much lands on the ground. Her instruments will remain at the station and collect data over an entire year, including during the Antarctic winter.\nThis won’t be Gerber’s first experience in the extreme cold. She was recently in Siberia for a research project carried out jointly by EPFL and the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF).

{"id": 576, "text": "The chance to program and create video games on the Nintendo DS – a dream opportunity for many a student at EPFL! This is now a reality, thanks to Professor David Atienza. Since February, future electrical engineering graduates can follow a course that consists of developing a game called “Tetris” on the well-known portable console, and then to use the knowledge acquired to create other video games.\n At the beginning of the course, the students receive a “kit”, including a Nintendo DS and a graphical interface, together with a compiler and a Nintendo DS simulator. They are also provided with a memory card, on which they can load applications designed especially for them, using a small Nintendo DS cartridge. It’s on this memory card – which can be inserted either in a portable computer or in the mini-console – that they program the video games. Their objective is to develop a system capable of controlling the Nintendo DS hardware, consisting of the various keys and the touch-screen. There is also a creative aspect to the work, as the students also have to design graphics, create animations and come up with some music to accompany the game.\n Although the “mission” seems to be rather recreational, the course has a very specific goal – to bring genuine added-value to the studies of these third-year electrical engineers. “When they begin the course, the students already have a very good individual understanding of how to create various components and electrical devices, like circuits. Now they have to learn how to combine them, in order to develop a system in its entirety”, explains David Atienza. \n“A tangible result”\nThe course has become very popular, and has aroused the passions of many students. Professor Atienza has even agreed to take some students from the School of Computer and Communication Sciences who asked if it would be possible to follow the studies, without being officially enrolled. Although they obtain no credits, they are able to refine their expertise in programming. As a result, the enthusiasm in the classroom is almost palpable.\n “It’s very interesting to create something tangible and to be able to program on a console that everybody knows”, comments Chloé Weber, one of the students sitting on the front row. “That’s exactly why I chose to study electrical engineering – to understand the functioning of devices we use every day.” Chloé’s view is echoed by her fellow student Paul Ferranet, who is studying electronics: “I never did anything like this before. The course enables us to understand systems in their entirety, and to focus on all their elements. Even though we don’t understand everything, and there is a lot of programming, it’s captivating.”\nA competition to elect the best game\nThe complexity of the task to be performed doesn’t, however, prevent the students from being ambitious. “They have lots of ideas. For example, one group would like to develop a car-race game for several players, so we provided them with a Bluetooth card, which will allow them to connect several Nintendo DS consoles together”, enthuses the professor. “Others are planning to develop a planner, or even an interface enabling a connection to Facebook via the console.”\n Encouraged by this profusion of ideas, David Atienza has decided to mark the end of the course in style. In June, he will organize a competition to reward the student who has created the best game. “Nice graphics are not enough, however – the students have to use all the functionalities of the console. The winner will receive a Nintendo DS.”\nReference: Course in micro-programmed embedded systems by Professor David Atienza.", "summary": "Professor David Atienza is offering his third-year electrical engineering students an unusual option – developing video games on the Nintendo DS.

{"id": 578, "text": "The Swiss transport sector has become the country’s leading CO2 emitter, accounting for 41% of total emissions. That proportion is higher than the figures for the European Union (28%) and the United States (34%). Most of these emissions (98%) come from road traffic, with individual vehicle owners responsible for two thirds of them. The large proportion of emissions generated by transport in Switzerland also results from the country’s large number of 4x4 vehicles, which represent around 40% of new vehicle registrations as opposed to an average of 13% in the EU. Strategies for reducing vehicle emissions are a key subject for discussion in both political and economic terms, and road traffic is expected to rise steadily unless tough political decisions are made. \nAt EPFL, researchers specializing in environmental economics looked into this matter at the request of the Swiss Energy Modelling Platform. Using macroeconomic simulation tools, they compared several carbon-tax scenarios between now and 2050. They found that a uniform tax on heating oil, gasoline and diesel fuel would be a cost-effective way to reduce CO2 emissions from 4.5 tons per inhabitant today to 1.5 tons. The proportion of total emissions generated by transport would fall from 41% to 33%. \nA uniform tax\n In practical terms, the CO2 levy, which is currently 25 cents per liter of heating oil, would be applied to gasoline and diesel fuel as well and steadily increased to 1.70 francs by 2050. “By treating fuels equally, you would avoid penalizing one sector relative to another. So if the levy on gasoline and diesel fuel were limited to 1 franc per liter, the tax on heating oil would have to rise to 4 francs. We also took into account the steady decrease in the amount of fuel consumed by car engines, which means that, in the end, the levy has very little impact on drivers’ budgets,” says Philippe Thalmann, head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Environmental and Urban Economics and co-author of the study that has just been published in the \nSwiss Journal of Economics and Statistics\n. \nThe researchers also factored other technological developments into their projections, such as the rise of biofuels and electric cars. Carmakers are under real pressure to change. For example, Volvo has announced that half of all the vehicles it produces will be equipped with an electric engine by 2025. Growth in alternative travel methods, such as public transport, car-sharing and human-powered modes of travel, were also taken into account. \nHowever, Philippe Thalmann stresses that “for such a tax to work, it must encourage people to use a clean alternative in order to avoid the levy. The resulting tax revenue could facilitate this, such as by subsidizing a network of electric charging points, electric car purchases and the public transport system.”", "summary": "Using macroeconomic modeling, EPFL researchers have identified the most effective carbon tax for Switzerland to meet the Paris Agreement targets: a uniform levy on gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil, rising steadily to 1.70 francs per liter by 2050.", "claim": "Using macroeconomic modeling, EPFL researchers have identified the most effective carbon tax for Switzerland to meet the Paris Agreement targets: a uniform levy on gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil, rising steadily to 1.70 francs per liter by today.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [42, 42], "noise": false}

The company specializes in very low-power connectivity, and the money raised will enable it to launch an essential component to make the world’s first USB-C plugs that are compatible with the new USB4 standard that was officially announced in September. Anokion, which focuses on the treatment of autoimmune diseases, raised CHF 40 million. It was founded in 2010 and designs proteins that modulate the harmful inflammatory immune response in order to treat diseases such as multiple sclerosis, celiac and type-1 diabetes. Also among the top three fundraisers last year was Cellestia Biotech, which attracted CHF 20 million from investors. The money will enable it to continue clinical trials involving molecules targeting NOTCH-driven cancers, in which cells have a defect in their signaling pathway. Seven other companies raised more than CHF 10 million each, and another four raised between CHF 5 million and CHF 10 million.\nThis sort of funding is essential for the development of startups that use leading-edge research, which often do not become profitable until several years after they were created. Achieving profitability is often a long and expensive process, involving steps such as patent filings, clinical trials and prototyping. EPFL does not derive immediate financial benefit from its startups, and these companies are rarely bought out, but those that succeed are a real boon for the region. Not only do they create jobs, but they spur the ambitions of future entrepreneurs and attract the attention of other investors.\nFunds raised across a very wide range of fields\nMany innovative products nowadays rely on technologies from multiple disciplines. If one wants to breakdown of startup funding by its primary field of research area, we find that these areas vary from year to year. 2019 was a particularly good year for startups that are based on research in the wide area of engineering , which attracted almost CHF 130 million in investment including CHF 56 million for Kandou Bus, CHF 18.1 million for satellite antenna specialist Swissto12 and CHF 16.5 million for Bestmile. A combined CHF 40 million was raised by nine other young engineering firms. Biotech was next, with more than CHF 82 million raised, mostly by Anokion and Cellestia Biotech. IT and communications ranked third, with CHF 40 million raised by only three spin-offs: Cyberhaven, L2F and Artmyn.\nMedtech-biotech is still the main sector among EPFL spin-offs founded in 2019, followed closely by engineering. There is also an increasing number of spin-offs offering sustainable products and services.\n23 spin-offs were created at EPFL in 2019\nEPFL startups – figures and initiatives\nSince 2000, 293 spin-offs have been created at EPFL. Of those, 116 are currently located at EPFL Innovation Park, while 31 startups are being developed in the La Forge co-working space. To foster entrepreneurship among students, EPFL is continuing its Innogrant program, which helps them create their own companies. Eleven new Innogrants were awarded in 2019, making a total of 145 since the program began in 2005. Since 2017, the XGrant program, which encourages and supports startup plans developed by EPFL Bachelor’s and Master’s students, has developed a solid pipeline of projects. It awarded 13 grants in 2019, making a total of 30 since it was created. In late 2018, two programs were set up to fund initiatives that have a positive social or environmental impact: YGrants, for Bachelor’s and Master’s students, and PlayGrants, for EPFL researchers. In 2019, six YGrants and five PlayGrants were awarded.\nIn terms of events, EPFL’s first Investor Day took place in November 2019. It featured 78 startups and was attended by more than 200 investors from Switzerland and around the world. Looking ahead, Marc Gruber, Vice President of Innovation at EPFL, indicates that the school will launch several new initiatives in 2020 that intend to further strengthen the entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem.", "summary": "2019 was the second-best year ever in terms of fundraising by EPFL startups, which attracted CHF 285.8 million in new investment.

It gathers specialists to learn and discuss a range of topics from the far out (the search for extra terrestrial intelligence) to urgent policy issues (nuclear waste management).\nNeuro-Science Without Borders\nWithin this year's theme Science Without Borders, EPFL professors Olaf Blanke, José Millán and Miguel Nicolelis will be presenting their work in the neurosciences – research that fits well with this year’s topic. For there is no border more fundamental than the one between man and the external world, but the limit between what is the self and what is separate from our body can be manipulated, extended, and explored when traditional scientific disciplines work together in seemingly unlikely combinations such as neuroscience and robotics, and psychology and computer science.

In fact, that’s the whole point: recreating a cellular microenvironment \nin vitro\n to study physiological functions or test the efficacy of particular molecules. For her Master’s project, 24-year-old bioengineering student Yara Proust spent several months immersed in this new and fascinating world.\n“I was interested in regenerative medicine,” she explains. “My initial plan was to go abroad. I sent off several unsolicited applications but got nowhere.” After turning to EPFL’s student support office, IS-Academia, for help, she secured three offers: one in Paris, one in Eindhoven, and one from a Bern-based startup. “I decided on Alveolix almost immediately. We exchanged a few emails and they invited me for a 90-minute interview. As soon as I walked through the door, it just felt right.”\nA smooth transition to working life\nProust has no regrets about her decision. Officially, Master’s projects should last between four and six months. But Proust spent a full nine months – September to May – at Alveolix, combining a paid internship with her Master’s project and postgraduate research. “The great thing about working at a startup is that it’s a happy medium between school and a job at a big firm. It eases the transition to working life.”\nProust spent all of her time doing research. She used the company’s ground-breaking solution to test how cell cultures react when exposed to air and respiratory movement. She also carried out other experiments, examining aspects such as toxicity and viability when the cells respond to different substances or are handled in a particular way. The firm’s lung-on-chip technology is designed primarily to assess the efficacy of certain drugs without the need for animal testing. In the longer term, patients’ own cells could be used to develop custom treatments.\n“It was an amazing learning experience,” says Proust. “I got the chance to do a lot of biology work. My studies are much more engineering-focused, so it was good to have that practice. I learned a lot about life as a researcher outside the lab too – analyzing data, attending conferences and weekly progress update meetings, and simply talking to my colleagues.” As well as enjoying her time at Alveolix, Proust worked hard. Her efforts paid off when she scooped up second prize for her poster and oral presentation at the 2019 ISAM Congress.\nA great place to work\nProust was lucky enough to work under a dedicated and attentive supervisor at the firm. But she relished the human side of the experience as well. “It’s a young, cosmopolitan team involved in an exciting new field,” says Proust. “It was a great place to work.” She also enjoyed her time in a new city. “I loved living in Bern!” she says enthusiastically. “It’s a compact city – everything’s on your doorstep and there’s lots to see and do. The people are really friendly, too.” Proust fully embraced life in Bern, living with Swiss-German housemates and taking a two-month intensive language course. “I’d definitely study Swiss German if I ever went back there,” she adds. Proust will graduate on 5 October, so she needs to figure out her next move quickly.

{"id": 604, "text": "EPFL startups raised a total of CHF 217 million in 2018 – not far from the record of CHF 260 million set in 2016, a year marked by MindMaze’s CHF 100 million intake. These figures are up sharply from just eight years ago, when EPFL startups raised some CHF 50 million. “This rapid growth testifies to the entrepreneurial spirit that is very much alive on our campus, as well as the ambition and drive of EPFL-bred entrepreneurs,” says Hervé Lebret, Head of EPFL’s Start-ups Unit. Today, technology developed at EPFL labs is being readily transferred to industry and eventually on to consumers. The upshot is a growing number of successful EPFL spin-offs. Much of this is due to the various forms of assistance available to fledgling businesses at EPFL, through initiatives first rolled out some 25 years ago.\nTen \ncompanies each raised over CHF 8 million \nThe ten largest fundraising rounds carried out this year by EPFL spin-offs – companies established to market technology developed at an EPFL lab or by an EPFL researcher – exceeded CHF 8 million. Nexthink alone raised CHF 85 million to support its development of artificial intelligence-based software to enhance employees’ digital experience. That makes it one of the top three unlisted EPFL startups in terms of attracting fresh capital.\nThe next three biggest fundraising rounds this year were carried out by Cellestia Biotech, Abionic, and Kandou Bus. Cellestia Biotech announced this week that it has raised 20 million. This spin-off is developing molecules to treat certain types of cancer linked to genetic lesions which activate a cellular signaling pathway called Notch. Abionic, founded in 2010 to market technology developed at EPFL’s microengineering clean room, brought in CHF 20 million. The proceeds will be used to validate and launch its microfluid-based diagnostic tests for sepsis and allergies. Kandou Bus raised CHF 15 million for the second time, and will use the funds to step up the production and roll-out of its high-speed chip-to-chip links that enhance the efficiency of electronic devices. Six other EPFL startups raised CHF 8–10 million among which: Pristem, Bestmile, Akselos, Inpher.io and Amazentis.\nThe investors behind the CHF 217 million come from Switzerland, elsewhere in Europe (Index Ventures, Partech, Airbus, Shell and Innogy) and the US (Bessemer, Walden and JPMorgan). This international scope “shows that our entrepreneurs are starting to be known worldwide for their energy and professional approach,” says Lebret. But behind this fundraising success lies years of hard work – along with a hefty dose of entrepreneurial talent – to transform the founders’ ingenious ideas into groundbreaking technology. Raising capital to finance the various stages of business creation is no mean feat.\nInnogrant recipients have attracted a total of CHF 325 million\nTo help its researchers get their businesses off the ground, EPFL has built up an entire innovation ecosystem over the past 15 years. This ecosystem includes state-of-the-art facilities at Le Garage, La Forge and Campus Biotech Geneva, for example, as well as close collaborations with the labs and a variety of grants such as Innogrants, XGrants and YGrants. A record 25 spin-offs were created on the EPFL campus in 2018.\nOver 80 EPFL spin-offs – or some 40% of the total – launched over the past ten years received an Innogrant, which is a grant awarded to PhD students and professors to enable them to hire an employee. Innogrant recipients have raised a total of CHF 325 million in capital, and nine of them have been bought out by a multinational.\nXGrants help students launch their startups\nFinancial support is also available to EPFL students eager to launch their businesses before they have their degree in hand.

{"id": 609, "text": "In contrast to acquired immunity and its targeted, but slow, production of antibodies against specific pathogens, innate immunity reacts immediately: by means of special sensors the cell is able to check whether any DNA or RNA is in the wrong place. As this can be a sign of viral infection, the cell triggers an overall antiviral immune response. The medical researcher Andrea Ablasser has been investigating how such innate immune responses are controlled, and in doing so, has come upon a promising new therapeutic approach. On behalf of the Latsis Foundation, the Swiss National Science Foundation has awarded her the National Latsis Prize 2018 in recognition of her pioneering work. \nAblasser's research focuses on the so-called cGAS/STING signal pathway, which was only discovered ten years ago. This signal pathway, which is activated if DNA is present outside the cell nucleus, mainly boosts the production of inflammation signals, which in turn activate various immune cells that fight viruses. The signal pathway also plays a role in the immune response to tumour cells. Having already done research in this field as an undergraduate and later as a doctoral student, Ablasser was able to characterise an important transmitter substance in this chain of signals while working as a postdoc at the University of Bonn. \"It was during this period that I decided to devote myself entirely to basic research instead of doing clinical work, which would have been the obvious choice as I had studied medicine,\" says Ablasser. \nUnderstanding autoimmune diseases \nSince accepting the professorship at EPFL, Ablasser has mainly been investigating what happens when the cGAS/STING signal pathway is falsely activated, causing health problems. This always happens when the body's own DNA escapes from the nucleus of the cell due to stress, illness or cell ageing, and the DNA sensor mistakenly reacts. \"The clinical importance of this field has been one of the reasons for its rapid development,\" says Ablasser. She has devised experiments to find out how such an error by the cGAS/STING signal pathway can cause illnesses such as chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. \nHer ideas for new experiments often come from chance observations: \"If an experiment isn't going as you expected, it is often worth taking a closer look. You never know what you will find. But you also need to have a good team - one that can think on its feet.\"\nStart-up develops new active substance \nThe discovery that the cGAS signal pathway, if overactive, can cause chronic inflammation and other diseases prompted Ablasser to screen for a substance that inhibits this process. \"Such screenings are considered risky because they involve a lot of work, and there is no guarantee of getting useful results.\" But in this case she was lucky. Out of 60,000 molecules, she was able to filter out one small agent that very specifically inhibits a component of the cGAS/STING pathway. The therapeutic potential of this inhibitor now has to be tested in various disease models, and Ablasser recently co-founded a start-up company to do precisely that. \nIn her own work she wishes to focus more on basic research again. She is currently particularly interested in the link between cell ageing and innate immunity: \"My aim is to gain a better understanding of age-related diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis or the loss of blood-building stem cells.\" Because - as her research until now clearly shows - a fundamental understanding of cellular processes marks an important step in the development of successful new treatments. \nShort biography \n Andrea Ablasser was born in Bad Friedrichshall in 1983. She finished her studies in human medicine at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich in 2008 and obtained a doctorate in clinical pharmacology at the same university in 2010. She continued her work on innate immunity at the Institute of clinical chemistry and pharmacology of the University of Bonn. In 2014, she was appointed as a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL. She has already received a number of prizes for her research work, most recently the 2018 Eppendorf Award for Young European Investigators. \n But work doesn't really feel like work to Ablasser. She considers it a privilege to be able to do research in a place like Lausanne. She lives in a small village not far from the town with her fiancé, the physics professor and Latsis laureate 2014, Tobias Kippenberg. In her free time, she goes running or heads off for the mountains on her road bike. \nNational Latsis Prize \n The National Latsis Prize has been awarded annually since 1983 by the SNSF on behalf of the International Latsis Foundation, a Geneva-based non-profit organisation that was founded in 1975. The Prize is awarded to researchers in Switzerland who are under 40 years of age. Endowed with prize money of CHF 100,000, it is one of the highest scientific honours in Switzerland. Furthermore, four Latsis University Prizes worth CHF 20,000 each are awarded by the universities of Geneva and St. Gallen as well as by ETH Zurich and EPF Lausanne. \n The 35th prize ceremony will be held on 10 January 2019 at the Rathaus in Bern.

{"id": 611, "text": "Over the course of four and a half years, the ground surrounding the In Salah gas-fired power plant in the Algerian desert rose by sixteen millimeters. This rise was triggered by the injection of the carbon dioxide emissions captured at the plant into a deep aquifer, 1800 meters underground. The heaving of the bedrock at In Salah was benign, but injecting excessive amounts of gas into the subsurface could potentially fracture the impermeable rock layers keeping the gas in place. Researchers at EPFL have developed a computer model that simulates the geological impact of injecting CO\n2\n underground and assess how much gas a reservoir can safely accommodate. They  their results in the \nInternational Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control.\nUnderground CO\n2\n sequestration is already being used at several sites around the world to keep the greenjouse gas out of the atmosphere. The Paris agreement, which seeks to limit the extent of anthropogenic climate change, will likely accelerate the adoption of this technology, which according to  published in 2010 could be feasible in parts of Switzerland as well. The complex and highly variable geology of potential sequestration sites around the world call for the development of tools to determine under what conditions their impermeability can be assured. \nThe injection phase is most critical, says Li Chao, a researcher at EPFL’s Chair “Gaz Naturel”-Petrosvibri and co-author of the study with Prof. Lyesse Laloui. “When CO\n2\n is injected into a deep aquifer, sometimes thousands of meters underground, it is much cooler than the surrounding rock and compressed to the point that it occupies 500 times less volume than it would in the atmosphere. Because of its temperature, its pressure, and the volume it occupies, it interacts with the surrounding rock ” he explains. This can deform the rock, causing geological instabilities, and in the worst case, fracture the cap-rock that seals the aquifer, allowing the gas to escape to the surface.\nChao says he can use his simulation to determine the pressure up to which CO\n2\n can safely be injected in a given geological setting. To test it, he and his co-author attempted to replicate the observed heaving in In Salah, caused by four and a half years of CO\n2\n sequestration. While the cold gas contracts the host rock surrounding the injection site, its high pressure increases the size of the pores in the rocks. By coupling thermal, hydraulic, and geomechanical processes in one simulation, Chao and Laloui were able to determine how these competing forces conspire to shape the reservoir and the rock layers above and around it.\n“Our simulation results came very close to matching the satellite observations,” says Chao. In the future, he hopes to further develop his model, which can be applied to other types of CO\n2\n sequestration sites, from abandoned oil or gas fields, to saline aquifers, to simulate for the formation of fractures in the bedrock.\nReference:\n Chao Li, Lyesse Laloui, , International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control Volume 51, August 2016, Pages 394–408", "summary": "Sequestering carbon dioxide underground is likely to play a key role in meeting reduction targets set at the IPCC conference in Paris last year.

Yet it is an essential tool for diagnosing such things as car-accident injuries and infectious diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia – the latter of which accounts for 20% of infant mortality. Developing countries in particular are unable to afford the high purchase and maintenance costs of X-ray equipment. What’s more, this equipment is ill-suited for operating environments marked by high temperatures and humidity levels and frequent power outages.\nGlobalDiagnostiX aims to overcome these obstacles. The project was launched in 2012 as part of the EssentialTech program at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, and brings together a large number of European and African universities and university hospitals. The result of their joint effort was unveiled on Monday in Yverdon-les-Bains, in Vaud Canton, before a small group of guests that included Federal Councillor Johann N.

It was designed to stand up to demanding climate conditions without compromising on the quality of the X-ray images, and it offers a simple and intuitive interface.\nThe project engineers were guided by two principles – simplicity and robustness – to ensure the system could be maintained by relatively unskilled workers.

{"id": 617, "text": "In order to plan their work, farmers always keep an eye on weather forecasts. In a few years, will they be as hooked on economic forecasts? Fabian Brix, a student enrolled in the Master’s degree program in information technology, thinks that this is exactly what will happen.

This students association simulates the functioning of international organizations to prepare its members for international negotiations. When asked to choose a project for the course on Big Data (using computers to process massive quantities of data), he immediately thought of this problem and convinced his working group to focus on the issue. “Professor Christoph Koch encourages his students to establish their own research topic,” recalls Fabian Brix.\n“The aim was to use geolocalized tweets to monitor price fluctuations for agricultural goods, explains Fabian Brix.

This system allows them to monitor tweets and detect those containing information concerning food prices.\nAll in all, the exercise proved very instructive but not overly useful. “Twitter provides access to only 1% of all tweets.

These technologies will enable large-scale collaboration and data sharing, reconstruction of the brain at different biological scales, federated analysis of clinical data to map diseases of the brain and the development of brain-inspired computing systems. Through the HBP’s ICT Platforms, scientists, clinicians and engineers will be able to perform diverse experiments and share knowledge with a common goal of unlocking the complex structure of the brain. With an unprecedented crossdisciplinary scope, the Human Brain Project seeks to integrate neuroscience, medicine and computing, unify brain research and benefit the global scientific community. The development and use of ICT over the HBP’s 10-year lifetime are to pave the way for the project’s ultimate goal – a simulation on the scale of the human brain.\nKey Dates\nJuly 2010: The European Commission published a call for proposals.

{"id": 622, "text": "Are those your hands you see on that panoramic screen? Maybe, maybe not. The Immersive Lab provides a unique interactive experience that combines images and sounds and brings visitors face to face with their self-consciousness.\nThe Immersive Lab, which was developed by Daniel Bisig and Jan Schacher, two researchers at the Institute for Computer Music and Sound Technology (ICST) at the Zurich University of the Arts, explores the potential offered by interactive and immersive media. The Lab was initially a platform for artistic creation and experimentation. Then in 2019, the artists expanded the lab’s scope by joining forces with researchers at EPFL and the University of Geneva as part of a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Agora project aimed at fostering dialogue between researchers and the broader society.\nConveying a subjective feeling\nResearchers from EPFL's Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience run by Olaf Blanke have created an installation called \nMultiple Bodies, Super Egos and Virtual Identities\n. This work is like a magic mirror, enabling visitors to experience the unusual sensations provoked by bodily illusions. “When we’re looking in the mirror, our reflection moves with us. That's how our brain maps out our self-representation,” says Blanke, who holds the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience. But time and size are distorted in this multi-user installation, which only complicates our perception of ourselves. “When I move one way, what appears to be my reflection moves another and with a time lag. It’s really unsettling,” adds Blanke.\nThis work draws on the research being conducted within Blanke’s lab, where researchers are developing neuro-scientific models of self-consciousness to gain insight into the brain mechanisms underlying bodily representation and perception. “We can’t convey all the aspects of our research in a text or image. You have to actually experience it to fully grasp what it’s about,” says Bruno Herbelin, one of the researchers in the lab. “The aim is to give visitors a strange perception of themselves for just a few seconds.”\nA constructive dialogue\nThe Immersive Lab takes a cross-disciplinary approach that not only draws on several scientific fields but incorporates art as well. This helps the general public understand these complex concepts in a more tangible way.\nFor Bisig, this provides greater insight into the cognitive processes involved in understanding artwork and how those processes can be exploited to get someone to behave in a certain way. “This type of know-how is not standard fare in the art world, where the focus is more on personal experience,” says Bisig. He thinks researchers get something out of the Lab as well: “Our work is not based on any strict rules, so there's more space for unconventional ideas that can go beyond the science and provide researchers with new ways of thinking.”\nSo it’s mutually beneficial. And it’s not the first time that Olaf Blanke and his colleagues have welcomed artists into their lab. The artwork reflects not just the medical applications of their research but the ethical and societal implications as well, which can help to open up the dialogue with the public.\n“What makes it really interesting is that the installation is a real combination of art and science,” says Bisig enthusiastically. “Neither side had to give up their ideas!”\nExperimenting with the possible\nThe Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience has been a pioneer in using digital media, such as virtual reality, to develop new diagnostic tools and therapies for patients with cognitive, psychiatric or physical disorders. “Our observations usually involve people who are well aware that they’re taking part in a scientific experiment,” says Herbelin. “In a freer context like the Immersive Lab, we might be able to observe more spontaneous behavior that better reflects the real world.” An art installation could therefore play the same role as an open laboratory and make it possible to study a more heterogeneous group of people.\nNew technologies, like immersive shows, offer an opportunity to further explore scientific communication. For Anne-Gaëlle Lardeau, who runs ArtLab, “The idea behind a lot of museum installations is no longer to deliver a specific message but rather to create emotion, encouraging visitors to want to learn more.”\nThe exhibition, which is free of charge, will run from 25 February to 1 March 2020. It can be viewed freely or through a guided tour.\nThe works on display are: \nConnect\n (by Simon Schaerlaeken and Donald Glowinski), \nMultiple Bodies, Super Egos & Virtual Selves\n (by Simon Schaerlaeken, Bruno Herbelin, Oliver Kannape, Jan Schacher and Daniel Bisig), \nCoexistence\n (by Nadine Cocina and Romana Sprenger), \nSeen\n (by Célia Bétourné and Louis Cortes), and \nLes Mains Négatives \n(by Anne Dubos and Jan Schacher).\n On 27 February, members of the project team and experts in media arts, cognitive science and museum studies will take part in a panel discussion on the advantages and challenges of using digital technology for artistic, research and outreach purposes.

The company plans to use the money, secured from Swisscanto Invest, Swisscom Ventures and CNB, to scale up the production and marketing of its components, some of which went into orbit several months ago.\nMetal-coated 3D-printed components\nData-transfer needs, driven by TVs, telephones, surveillance, GPS and the internet, are growing non-stop. This requires ever more satellite bandwidth, and thus increasingly high wave frequencies – the microwave threshold was crossed several years ago. Yet the higher the frequency the more difficult it is to control, and this is where the quality and shape of antennas play a crucial role. SWISSto12 uses a patented process to manufacture metal-plated 3D-printed components. Behind their brightly colored veneer lies a complex maze of tiny conduits, each custom-built for a specific application. The firm’s antennas are ten times lighter than their all-metal equivalents – a significant difference in an industry where every gram saved translates into lower cost.\n“We may be a new player on the scene, but we’ve already attracted the attention of major names in the satellite and aerospace industries,” says CEO Emile de Rijk, whose PhD thesis led to the spin-off. “Our partners include Airbus Defense and Space, Thales Alenia Space, Cobham Advanced Electronic Solutions and the European Space Agency.” SWISSto12’s technology could also change the way miniature satellites and constellations, two fast-growing market segments, and the antennas fitted to airplane fuselages are designed and manufactured.\nExpanding operations in the US and Israel \n“This investment will allow us to take our business to the next level,” adds de Rijk. As SWISSto12 expands its new premises in the US and Israel, it intends to begin production of complete antennas – waveguide and transmitter combined.

{"id": 626, "text": "The current record for a bicycle travelling across flat road is 133.78 km/h, set in 2012 by a Dutch team at the World Human Powered Speed Challenge, which takes place every year in the Nevada desert. But this September, a team from IUT Annecy aims to beat that record. The team used artificial-intelligence-based software developed by Neural Concept, an EPFL startup, to boost the performance of its bike. In just a few minutes, Neural Concept’s technology can calculate the optimal shape of a bike to make it as aerodynamic as possible. It can also be used for aerodynamics calculations in a number of other applications. The company is presenting its software in Stockholm today at the International Conference on Machine Learning.\nFrom the outside, the IUT Annecy team’s recumbent bike looks more like a tiny racecar than a human-powered bicycle. It was custom-made to fit closely to the cyclist’s body. During the Challenge, he will have to ride down a 200-meter stretch of straight, flat road as fast as possible, after a run-up of 8 km. The design objective clearly isn’t cyclist comfort, but making the most out of every inch of the vehicle.\nComing up with faster, more detailed and more effective designs\nExisting aerodynamic design methods require an enormous amount of computing power. Traditionally bicycle engineers think up different forms and then test them using computer simulation. But here, for the first time, engineers employed optimization software – rather than their own intuition – to define the recumbent bike fairing. The IUT Annecy team used Neural Concept’s software, specifying the bike’s maximum length and width and the space needed for the drivetrain and wheels. The program then sorted through all kinds of shapes, quickly comparing them in order to come up with the best one. For instance, the program helped the engineers determine the best location for the vehicle’s maximum width.\nTo develop the technology behind the software, researchers at EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory trained a convolutional neural network to calculate the aerodynamic properties of various forms represented by generic polygon meshes, which are collections of points used to generate 3D shapes. This type of artificial intelligence works by running through several layers, categorizing information from the simplest to the most complex. In the initial layers, the program identifies a shape’s contours; then it assigns the contours to an object and determines what category the object belongs to based on the expected outcome.\nEngineers can use the software to carry out detailed analyses of different designs more rapidly and with better accuracy. “Our program results in designs that are sometimes 5–20% more aerodynamic than conventional methods. But even more importantly, it can be used in certain situations that conventional methods can’t,” says Pierre Baqué, CEO of Neural Concept. Another benefit is that the software can compare designs without human bias. “The shapes used in training the program can be very different from the standard shapes for a given object. That gives it a great deal of flexibility,” adds Baqué.\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge is a competition involving bicycles designed by teams of university students. This year it will take place on 10–15 September, and many other teams will also be gunning for the record. The Challenge will be a real-world test for both the IUT Annecy team and Neural Concept’s machine-learning technology. The software has myriad other potential applications too, such as for designing drones, wind turbines and aircraft. Other industry professionals clearly see its potential – Baqué has been invited to speak at the world’s biggest machine learning conference today in Stockholm.

{"id": 640, "text": "The mission was supposed to last three months to one year, but now, four years later, Swisscube is still orbiting the Earth. This small Cubesat-type satellite, measuring just 10cm by 10cm and entirely designed in Switzerland, was launched on September 23, 2009. After more than 22,000 trips around the planet, all its functions are still operational. Only one of its six solar sensors has been irreversibly damaged.\nThe satellite’s mission was to photograph “air glow,” a photoluminescence phenomenon that occurs in the upper atmosphere and is caused by the interaction between solar radiation and oxygen molecules. In four years, some 250 images were produced. Even though these data are not precise enough to be studied scientifically, the Swiss space community still considers Swisscube a success.\n“Its goal was above all educational,” says Muriel Richard, an engineer at the Swiss Space Center and Swisscube project manager. “It allowed nearly 200 students from EPFL and the Universities of Applied Science to learn about space technology. And today, it’s still valuable for current students as an extraordinary experimentation platform, with which we can, for example, check movements and altitude or test ground-based algorithms.”\nPut to the test\nThe fact that it’s lasted this long proves that the satellite is robust. It confirms the wisdom of certain technological choices that were made; at the time they seemed audacious, but now, in hindsight, they have proven innovative and full of lessons that can be drawn upon for the construction of future spacecraft. For example, it was decided that instead of components that were certified space-quality, standard electronic components would be used; they were thus much less expensive, such as mobile phone batteries bundled into a thermally controlled, waterproof housing. An innovative system of copper mountings was developed that both secured the solar cells to the external walls, ensuring stowage during the violent shakings of launch.\n“The first week is decisive,” explains Richard. “If the satellite gets through it without a hitch, it’s because it was truly well built, and there’s a high likelihood that it will operate for years to come.” Once the satellite reaches space, the electronics on board are seriously put to the test. To start with, vibrations experienced during the launch will reveal even the slightest error in soldering. The materials also undergo temperature variations that can range from -50 to 70 degrees Celsius. Solar radiation and the flow of solar particles can also easily damage systems that are insufficiently protected. And then there’s always the chance of collision with the ever-increasing amount of space debris orbiting the Earth.\nSet your calendar for 2018\nIn fact, Swisscube has narrowly avoided impact several times. As soon as it was launched, it was quickly caught up in the train of debris created by the February 2009 collision between the commercial satellite Iridium-33 the Russian satellite Cosmos-2251. More recently, on September 11, 2013, US Air Force alerted the Swiss Space Center that its Cubesat passed less than 75 meters away from one of the 15,000 pieces of space debris more than 10cm in diameter that have been identified and are monitored from the ground by the U.S.. But it appears that Swisscube’s time has not yet come. Barring an unforeseen event, Swisscube’s demise has been programmed for 2018.

Launched on the morning of 23 September 2009, its mission was to photograph the airglow, a luminous phenomenon in the upper atmosphere. A few hours later, there was disappointment all round. The satellite was rotating too fast to take the photos. Muriel Noca, responsible for the project, explains that this was probably the result of a problem occurring either when the satellite was being ejected or when the antennas unfolded.\n Scientists and students were faced with a dilemma. They would have to wait quite a long time for the rotation of the satellite to slow down by itself. However, SwissCube was designed to last for only about four months. There was no guarantee that it could stand up to solar radiation and extreme variations in temperature – the deliverable of this students’ project was built using standard electronic components available in shops, and was not designed for such use.\n November 2010. After over a year of suspense, the rotation of SwissCube had decreased. However, bearing out the team’s concerns, some functions had deteriorated. At the Space Center, the idea of relaunching the computer system came to mind, in the hope that it might remedy the faults. “The problem is that, for security reasons, satellites don’t have a re-set function, unlike our computers.” adds Muriel Noca.\nEarth and airglow from the Swisscube © EPFL Space Center\n A former student of the SwissCube team, working at the Space Center, found the solution to the problem. Florian George was the only one to be aware of a command enabling the idle operation of the radiocommunications system. Thus, he managed to drain the satellite’s batteries. Temporarily deprived of energy, the system re-started as expected. The team was relieved when it became clear that all the functions had been re-established.\n Beginning of 2011. Arthur Overlack, a student at the University of Delft in the Netherlands, also made an essential contribution. Informed of SwissCube’s initial setbacks, he developed an IT strategy that would finalize its stabilization. Thanks to his work, the team managed to perfect this aspect of the satellite, by acting on the current of its three electromagnets, aligned with the Earth’s magnetic field. It then became possible to take photos.\n The first pictures eventually reached the team. At low resolution, they clearly show the airglow – this luminescent phenomenon, which results from the formation of O2 oxygen molecules, following their separation by solar radiation. These images will provide precious information to the scientists. However, the greatest success of the program remains first and foremost its educational dimension.

Silvia Müller, who teaches biology and chemistry at the Abbaye de St-Maurice high school, worked as an assistant in a biology review course at EPFL. “I wanted to understand why some of my students were failing at EPFL. I realized the problem went beyond possible gaps in their knowledge,” she said. “EPFL is a wake-up call for students who are used to being coddled, and who never had to take good notes or study hard.” Drawing on this experience, she came up with a way to help her students prepare, including an ‘EPFL-style lesson’. “This exercise led to a very useful discussion on what was going to be expected of them,” she added. \nLearning the scientific method\n Patrick Poscio teaches physics at Creusets high school in Sion. He used his time at EPFL to work on students’ methodological gaps, together with Jean-Marie Fürbringer, an instructor in EPFL's physics section. “We developed an analytical grid that students can use to apply the scientific method to every problem,” said Poscio. The problem is clear: students are not suffering from holes in their learning but rather shortcomings in their methodology. These observations will be useful for the two teachers, both in the high school and at EPFL. “This collaborative approach is very helpful in understanding the difficulties our students face, and I hope this training program grows and expands,” said Fürbringer. \n Bernhard Britsch, who teaches computer science and economics at Brig high school, worked in the EPFL lab that is developing the Thymio educational robots. “I was able to make a concrete connection with high-school teaching and come up with possible learning scenarios,” he said. Waldemar Feller, a teacher at Wohlen high school in Aargau, worked as an assistant in a physics course at EPFL. “I teach physics and math, and this experience showed me which parts of my courses needed to be emphasized, such as vectors.

His pioneering technological innovations are as relevant as ever and will help shape the computers of tomorrow,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nLeblebici’s appointment is the culmination of years of close involvement with Sabancı University. He helped get the school off the ground in 1998 and has since followed its expansion, albeit from a distance. It now has close to 5,000 students and a campus twice as big as EPFL’s – with enough facilities to house the entire student body. Sabancı is patterned after US universities, placing a heavy emphasis on post-graduate education and research.\nMost of Sabancı’s students currently come from Turkey, but the university hopes to attract more and more from abroad – it has a growing appeal for students from the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “We also want to bring in more students from India, who are very interested in advanced, high-level degree programs,” says Leblebici.\nSabancı University is funded by the foundation of the same name. The fact that the university is fully private is a potential advantage over public-sector institutions. “That gives us greater freedom, for both the orientation of our research programs and our growth strategy,” says Leblebici, who sees his new function as “a genuine mission, one that is highly stimulating.”\nLeblebici will gradually take on his new responsibilities over the course of 2019 and make sure that ongoing projects of the LSM can be continued without interruption.", "summary": "Yusuf Leblebici, the head of EPFL’s Microelectronic Systems Laboratory, has been tapped to become the next president of Turkey’s Sabancı University.

{"id": 657, "text": "At 6 a.m. on Saturday mornings, in the quiet of the day, Testerman likes to arise and work on mathematics problems. “You need a calm setting to do math, because you have to be very focused.” Being a good mathematician, this professor, who teaches at EPFL’s School of Basic Sciences, is disciplined even though she can occasionally digress. “In class, I’ll sometimes go off-topic, because I can’t resist a good story.”\nThis is not surprising for someone who wanted to study literature, art history and theater, before her engineer father convinced her to switch to math. “He told me, ‘An education is expensive, you need to learn something that you can do later on,’ and so I completed a Bachelor’s degree in math and theater.” A double major like this was possible in Virginia, where she grew up – after all, mathematics is a sort of art form. “Sometimes I tell my students, ‘Look at this theorem, isn't it beautiful? It deserves a round of applause.’”\nTesterman, who studies the theory of algebraic groups, has always had a passion for math; she loves exploring its intricacies and sharing her knowledge with others. Although she claims that her teaching method – which involves just a blackboard and a piece of chalk – is “very traditional,” her engagement with her students is outstanding. This sense of involvement, along with the fact that she created a MOOC in linear algebra in 2015 and the quality of her teaching in general, have earned her this year’s Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.\nTo do mathematics\n“You can teach a course like a book, but that was never my style. Books don’t tell you how to arrive at an idea. The real value of a course is the sharing of intuition.” Since 2004, Testerman has taught linear and Lie algebras to EPFL Bachelor’s and Master’s students, with the same level of enthusiasm that she has for helping students understand. Her experience and drive made her the ideal person to design a MOOC version of the linear algebra course she teaches to future first-year engineers. But the online course, which consists of some 100 videos, each 10-15 minutes long, covers even more ground. Available on the edX learning platform, it has already been taken by tens of thousands of students from around the world. At EPFL, other professors also use it for their courses, including Simone Deparis who teaches linear algebra using a flipped classroom format. “Developing the course was painstaking and time-consuming,” says Testerman, “but I had the support of a highly skilled team.”\nSometimes I tell my students, ‘Look at this theorem, isn't it beautiful? It deserves a round of applause.\nDonna Testerman\nProfessor Testerman is not easy-going – her classes are complex and fast-paced. But she’s determined to provide her students with everything they need to pass the course. That’s why she holds office hours where students can drop in and ask questions. “During a one-on-one meeting, I can provide examples that are tailored to their problems and identify areas where I need to improve my teaching.”\nTesterman’s goal is to have students solve problems using their own individual approach. For this reason, she gives her first-year students assignments accompanied by detailed solutions, but in later years she provides little or no assistance. \"To understand mathematics, you have to do it; students have to follow their own line of reasoning.\"\nTesterman, who earned a PhD from the University of Oregon at the age of 25, knows what it means to “wrestle with problems.” Physics was a big challenge for her during her studies, and her research now requires that she ask herself \"a lot of questions.” “I understand what students are going through, and I think that doing research alongside teaching is valuable. Personally, if I don’t do it, I find I get bored.”\nA tremendous challenge\nAfter leaving the US to join her husband in Switzerland, Testerman was offered a position at the University of Warwick in England. “We lived in Geneva and had an au pair for our two children, then aged two and four. I would leave Tuesday morning at 5am and return Friday evening. I estimated that, factoring in time between semesters, I would be able to spend two-thirds of my time at home. I did it for two years, but it was not a long-term solution.”\nShe stepped down from her position at the University of Warwick, and then spent five years teaching at HES-SO Valais-Wallis before the opportunity arose to join the University of Lausanne and EPFL when the School of Basic Sciences was being set up. “Returning to research after five years was a tremendous challenge.” This Alpine enthusiast, who enjoys a guided mountain run once a year, took up the challenge with gusto. And although research means a great deal to her, training students and looking after their well-being is of equal importance. “It’s essential to create an environment where students interact. I try to remember their first names, even in the large courses, and I ask them for their birthdays. If it coincides with a class day, I give them chocolate and we all sing Happy Birthday.” A short break and a sweet treat, and then it’s back to tackling new math problems.", "summary": "Donna Testerman, a professor at EPFL’s Institute of Mathematics, is this year’s recipient of the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.

{"id": 659, "text": "Sometimes a simple nudge is all we need to find our true calling. For Agrawal, the nudge came from a college professor. “I was in the first year of my Bachelor’s degree at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, and during an introductory course in chemical engineering, my professor said ‘There’s nothing in this world that cannot be solved scientifically by chemical engineering. No matter the medium – be it air, water, electronics or even space –if you understand the principles of this branch, you can be involved in an infinite number of things and solve all kinds of problems’.” That prospect was enough to spark Agrawal’s love affair with chemical engineering.\nHowever, his earlier decision to embark on a career in engineering came as no surprise. “I’ve always enjoyed tinkering and exploring how things work. As a child, I used to take my toys apart and repair them afterwards – to my parents’ great misfortune. I remember, for example, spending a lot of time fiddling with electrical wires. A bit like some of the activities that are offered at the EPFL Scientastic Festival,” he says. Given that his father is a mechanical engineer and his brother and cousin are engineering students, Agrawal is simply continuing a family tradition.\nChemistry in the kitchen\nAfter graduation, Agrawal worked for three years as an R&D engineer at Procter & Gamble in Japan, including in shampoo design. That’s also when he started cooking. “I didn’t speak Japanese at the time and, being a vegetarian, I couldn’t find food that suited me. So I had to start cooking for myself.” What started out as an essential chore quickly turned into a hobby.\nAgrawal found that combining ingredients and adjusting cooking times and temperatures was similar to what he does in the lab. “I struggled a lot to make my pizza recipe better, especially because I kept using healthier flour, which makes it challenging to develop a good pizza dough. The goal is to make big air bubbles in the dough so you get a well-blown crust. I thought about it and tried different things,” he says. He’s now perfected his pizza recipe, but the real satisfaction came from the process of research and continuous improvement. “I’m now trying to make my own bread, but I must admit I still have a lot of room for improvement,” he adds.\nCO\n2\n capture\nAt his laboratory in Sion, Agrawal is working on a completely different type of R&D: developing molecular separation systems for industrial product streams. When chemicals are manufactured in a plant, the resulting product stream is rarely pure. It usually contains a mixture of compounds that are similar because they come from the same reagents. And a lot of energy is needed to separate those compounds – some 40% to 80% of the total energy used in the process. Agrawal’s membranes will make the separation step easier by filtering individual molecules according to their shape and size.\nHis team is currently working on a membrane specifically for CO\n2\n capture. They have developed a lab-scale model that will soon be tested on an industrial scale. “We’ve received funding from industry and from the Valais government to work on this project. At a time of climate change and carbon emission reduction targets, I’m proud to be able to participate in solving such an important problem for society,” says Agrawal. “It motivates me enormously.”\nBio\n 1984: Born in Lohardaga, Jharkhand, India\n 2005: Obtained a Bachelor’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay\n 2005–2008: Worked as an R&D engineer at Procter & Gamble, Kobe, Japan\n 2013: Earned a PhD from the University of Minnesota\n 2014: Performed postdoc research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\n 2016: Appointed an tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL", "summary": "Summer series: science as a vocation. Kumar Varoon Agrawal, a tenure-track assistant professor who holds the Gaznat Chair for Advanced Separations at EPFL Valais-Wallis, is developing advanced membranes for the molecular separation of industrial product streams, mainly for CO\n2\n capture.", "claim": "three years series: science as a vocation. Kumar Varoon Agrawal, a tenure-track assistant professor who holds the Gaznat Chair for Advanced Separations at EPFL Valais-Wallis, is developing advanced membranes for the molecular separation of industrial product streams, mainly for CO\n2\n capture.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 1], "noise": false}

{"id": 666, "text": "Many countries – including Switzerland – are developing an energy strategy to meet various objectives such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels, cutting CO\n2 \nemissions and promoting the energy transition. That means governments have to make important decisions about which power sources to prioritize in the future and what technologies to invest in, in order to strike the right balance between keeping public spending under control and promoting clean energy. \nThese strategic decisions are generally based on forecasts of natural gas prices, solar power costs, electricity demand and hundreds of other parameters. Today, energy planners enter these forecasts into computer models that then identify the “best” strategies. But because these forecasts stretch out some 20–50 years, they are often wrong – meaning the models’ output is often wrong, too. And this can lead to bad policy decisions.\nGas-fired power plants shut down before ever being put into service\n“For example, the Netherlands have invested heavily in gas-fired power plants, based on the assumption that the price of natural gas would stay low,” says Stefano Moret, a Postdoctoral Researcher at EPFL’s School of Engineering () and author of the study. “However, their forecasts were mistaken, and many power plants were shut down before ever being put into service.” \nA new model \nto consider uncertainty\nThe EPFL scientists developed a new approach that accounts for uncertainty in energy-strategy decisions. More specifically, they came up with a model that uses a range of values for each input data rather than a set figure. “Instead of saying that the price of natural gas will be 3 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next few years, for example, we can enter a range of between 1.5 and 5 cents, depending on how the market evolves. That means our model can incorporate variations in prices, cost and demand,” says Moret. The team’s research indicates that once you factor in such uncertainty, energy strategies that rely heavily on renewable energy are not necessarily more expensive than those dependent on fossil fuels. Their findings have just been published in the .\nMany mistake in past projections\nThe scientists’ model, called Energyscope, is “a mathematical representation of an energy system with over 100 different input parameters,” says Moret. “The problem with the models that governments currently use is that they are extremely complicated and can’t work with ranges.” What’s more, many of those models are not available as open-source applications and therefore have limited reach. \nThe scientists found many mistakes in past projections, with calculated values off by as much as 200–300% from actual values. One such example is forecasts of natural gas prices in the United States. \nThe ranges that the scientists programmed into their model – for each of the hundreds of parameters – are based on historical data and expert opinions. For instance, to determine the range of future interest rates, they used data and projections from central banks and spoke with Economics professors. \nA joint research\nTheir research was carried out in the framework of the Joint Activity Scenarios & Modeling (JA-S&M) project for the Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCER), which brings together eight universities to make energy modeling recommendations to the Swiss Federal Council. The model that the Swiss government currently uses was developed in the private sector and is not open source.

All these factors make it ideal for city use, yet its interior remains a bit rudimentary. More specifically, Twikes could use a better onboard electronics system and improvements to the pedaling mechanism. Adrien Hoffet, now an EPFL graduate, went about improving the Twike for his Master’s project.\nEmbedded electronics for easier driving\nFor the Twike – “twin” and “bike” – to be taken seriously as an alternative form of urban transport, it needed a navigation system. So the electrical engineering student integrated a Raspberry Pi mini-computer. This compact device, connected to the serial bus that transmits signals and data, collects and displays useful information for drivers. Various parameters – such as speed, pedaling power and battery life – appear on the screen. It can also store data for statistical purposes or analysis. This system was implemented on the current version of the vehicle – the Twike 3 – but it’s actually designed to exploit even more data on the new Twike that should come out in the next year or two.\nPedaling fast, not hard \nAnother significant problem with the Twike is that its drivetrain is similar to that of a bicycle (gear and chain), which complicates the vehicle’s mechanics and maintenance and makes it noisy. “Since Twikes have only five speeds, you end up having to pedal too fast at higher speeds,” Hoffet said. FINE Mobile therefore asked Hoffet to develop a lightweight, silent pedaling system that would give riders more leeway in the effort they expend. In response, Hoffet added a motor and an electronic feature run by the vehicle’s Raspberry Pi computer. The added electronics measure battery performance and pedaling speed. By monitoring these data, the computer can reduce pedal resistance. Some final adjustments still need to be made to the system before it’s completely finalized.\nTwiking from Germany to Switzerland\nThe eco-friendly Twike was invented in Switzerland in the 1990s but is now manufactured by FINE Mobile in Rosenthal, in the heart of Germany. That’s where Hoffet spent six months working on his project. “I first realized how handy Twikes can be when I was at EPFL and saw a researcher come to campus in one,” Hoffet said. And when his internship at another company fell through, he applied to work at FINE Mobile. The timing turned out to be perfect, since the company was in the middle of developing a new model.

{"id": 684, "text": "Flies exposed to a stress signal when in a group adopt a more effective response than isolated insects, found researchers at UNIL and EPFL. These typically solitary dipterans interact to generate a coherent collective response. “Interaction within the group increases their sensitivity to the environment, which facilitates decision making,” says Pavan Ramdya, lead author of a paper published today in Nature.\nTo explore this behavior, the researchers began by quantifying the presence of CO2 avoidance strategies. This gas, odorless to humans, represents a danger signal to the flies. A drosophila flying alone makes little effort to avoid the aversive odor. In a group, a significant proportion of flies leave the area within a few seconds.\nEven deprived of their sense of smell, flies in a community with unmodified peers continue to go quickly to the good, clean air. Since the genome of drosophila is fully sequenced, a database comprising genetically modified flies is also available. It is therefore possible for scientists to select for certain characteristics, such as lack of olfactory genes.\nBy observing the flies, the researchers found that this group behavior was preceded by numerous close contacts between the insects. Specifically, it is through small touches on the legs that the avoidance behavior is strengthened. This contact serves as genuine communication in code as it also indicates the direction to follow. A nudge on the right leg from a peer, and the fly goes left. With a touch on the left, it heads right.\nSo does a fly-leader need authority to indicate the route to follow? Not at all. A cascade of identical contacts is enough. It is a bit like billiard balls: the impulse is given in a specific direction. The insects that have been affected, in turn, “warn” others, and so on.\nIt remained to discover the neural circuitry involved in this collective behavior. Previous data from the study, financially supported by the SNSF (Swiss National Science Foundation), the European Research Council (ERC)and the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP), suggested the critical role of receptors on limbs. Using various methods, including desensitizing different parts of a limb, the researchers were able to identify the applicable gene and locate the precise area of contact.\nA small group of neurons located at the end of a limb that are sensitive to mechanical deformation emerged as the sine qua non for this social behavior. Flies that had this area desensitized through genetic modification behaved as isolated individuals.\n“While the neural circuits controlling interactions between two individuals in courtship or combat are increasingly understood, we don’t know much about what orchestrates behavior at the group level,” says Pavan Ramdya. “The identification of sensory pathways that govern collective response in drosophila could elucidate the dynamics of other animal groups such as schools of fish, migratory birds and even human crowds,” he adds.", "summary": "Fruit flies respond more effectively to danger when in a group.

{"id": 685, "text": "The pilot program, aimed at promoting a tenure-track system in Croatia, was officially launched in May 2018. It was set up by EPFL, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education, the Croatian Ministry of Regional Development and the Croatian Science Foundation (CSF). The aim is to boost the career prospects of Croatia’s most promising researchers.\nTo limit brain drain, the program is based on a tenure-track system, which EPFL has successfully been using since 2000. “Young researchers are awarded assistant-professor status and have a budget of around CHF 1.1 million, a team, equipment and administrative support, so that they can conduct their research independently,” explains Olivier Küttel, Head of International Affairs at EPFL, who has been working on the project since 2013. “After five years, if all goes well, they are guaranteed a permanent position.”\nOngoing collaboration\nSeveral EPFL professors are taking part in the project as mentors, such as Paolo Ricci, head of the theory group at EPFL’s . Their role is to offer strategic and administrative advice to young researchers, while gaining insight into their research topics.\nRicci himself benefited from EPFL’s tenure-track system. “It may be the best thing that’s ever happened to me during my scientific career. I had an excellent mentor, and taking part in this program was the least I could do to give something back after the great support I received,” he says.\nHe made his first trip to the University of Zagreb last week to meet his mentee, Kosuke Nomura, along with his team. “Croatia is growing fast in scientific terms. I’ve seen the enthusiasm of these young researchers and their desire to contribute to Croatia’s development.”\nTamara Nikšić (mentor, University of Zagreb), Kosuke Nomura \n(assistant professor, University of Zagreb)\n, Paolo Ricci (mentor, EPFL) © Kosuke Nomura (edited)\nHelping young researchers\nNomura is one of the three talented researchers selected for this project. Originally from Japan, he has close links with Croatia, having held a post-doctoral position at the University of Zagreb from 2015 to 2018. “The research environment was very stimulating, and I really wanted to carry on my work here. I heard about the program and decided to give it a go,” he explains.\nWhen Nomura learned that his application had been successful, he had just moved back to Japan and was a few weeks into a permanent job at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. There were several factors behind his decision to accept this new challenge: “In Zagreb, I could be independent and form my own working group. That wasn’t possible in Japan. Plus, I love Croatia!”\nNomura packed his bags and moved back to the Croatian capital in May 2019 to start his research project in the field of theoretical nuclear physics, specifically “”. By combining mathematical modelling and advanced scientific computing, his ultimate aim is to develop a universal theoretical framework for describing the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei.\n“Exotic Nuclear Structure and Dynamics” project team: \nMarko Imbrisak (PhD student), Tamara \nNikšić\n (mentor, University of Zagreb), Kosuke Nomura (assistant professor, University of Zagreb), Paolo Ricci (mentor, EPFL), Konstantinos Karakatsanis (Postdoc, University of Zagreb) © Kosuke Nomura\nBigger ambitions\n“This initiative offers key benefits for researchers, such as being able to conduct research independently and being provided with resources and mentoring, but it also has the potential to change the Croatian system which, very often, is overly complicated and limits career opportunities,” adds Küttel. “The project is a template that should be applied Europe-wide. It could be used as a reference for decisions made as part of the Horizon Europe program.”\nFor Nomura, the project offers much more than a permanent position: “It’s very rewarding. In addition to being able to focus on my research, I’m developing my career through teaching.” Longer term, Nomura hopes to form a group of experts and make Europe more influential in the field of theoretical nuclear physics.", "summary": "For several years now, EPFL has been working closely with the Croatian authorities to give young researchers the opportunity to lead research programs in Croatia.

{"id": 687, "text": "Claude Nicollier, an EPFL professor since 2004, will always be known as Switzerland’s first man in space. He took part in four US space shuttle missions in the 1990s; the first aboard the space shuttle \nAtlantis\n on an eight-day mission some 300 km above Earth. To mark the 25\nth\n anniversary of that flight, which took place from July 31 to August 8, 1992, SwissApollo is holding a commemorative event at EPFL’s SwissTech Convention Center on 3 November. We met with Nicollier – a modest man with a warm smile – to get a first-hand account of his amazing story.\n- Can you tell us how your first space mission came about?\n\"\nAn astronaut’s first space mission is like all important firsts in life: unforgettable. My first mission was the culmination of 14 years of training, starting the day when the European Space Agency selected me for the team. The \nChallenger\n disaster in 1986 delayed my flight for six years. Delays were also caused by the fact that I was the only non-American taking the full Space Shuttle Mission Specialist training – NASA had told me that I would take part only in mis­sions where the payload contained a substantial amount of ESA equipment. That was true for the \nAtlantis\n, which carried an Italian tethered satellite system and the EURECA satellite [European Retrievable Carrier, now on display at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Luzern].\n- What were the days leading up to the mission like?\nWe were flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida three days before take-off, on one of the T-38 Mission Support Aircraft that NASA used to carry astronauts. Around two weeks earlier, at the same site, we did what NASA called a “TCDT” – terminal count-down demonstration test – a kind of trial run where we go through every step of the take-off procedure except starting the engines. NASA simulators had given us a good idea of what take-off would be like. But on the day of take-off, when we experienced it for real and the entire shuttle started shaking, it was an extraordinary feeling.\n- What did it feel like?\nThere was a lot of shaking and vibration. The space shuttle weighs 2,000 metric tons, so you need 3,000 metric tons of power just to get it off the ground. It feels like you’re in a machine of a very, very large mass. Out of the seven astronauts on the mission, just two of us were rookies: Franco Malerba, Italy’s first astronaut, and me. We reached orbit in just eight and a half minutes. We felt anxious, of course – because our mission was dangerous, no doubt about it – but also like we were doing something completely crazy, with such a display of force and fuel. We felt as if we were at the very start of a big adventure. And we knew we had our work cut out for us; deploying the EURECA from the payload was a fairly routine operation, but we were a lot less certain about how the tethered satellite system deployment would go.\nPicture taken by the astronauts to express their concerns about the deployment of the tethered satellite system.\n- \nAnd what did zero gravity feel like?\nLike we were floating. It was disconcerting at first, especially when we shut off the main engines. When you go from 1 G to 0 G, it feels like there’s a force lifting you up. I was always afraid of banging my head on the ceiling! Plus we were wearing heavy orange space suits that restricted our movement. We also felt nauseous, like we were seasick. But we had to learn to live under those conditions. It was hard to sleep the first night. The next day we felt better, but the zero gravity still bothered us. It took me a full 48 hours to get over it. At the same time, it was all fantastic – the sky was filled with stars at night, and during the day we could see the Earth rapidly passing by.\n- But you got the job done, despite the physical discomfort...\nI had an important role to play in the EURECA deployment: operating the robotic arm that sent out the satellite. Once it was deployed, we had to fly in formation with the satellite for a few hours until ground control activated a propulsion system that lifted the satellite to a higher orbit. Then we moved to the next step, deploying the tethered satellite system. And there we ran into all kinds of problems. I would say that out of my four missions, that was the part that went the least well. The satellite was connected to the shuttle by a 20-km long cable. We were afraid the cable would slacken, and that’s exactly what happened, after only 200 meters had been released.\n- What was the problem?\nThe cable dispenser jammed. Since the cable was elastic, the satellite came back towards us. The cable had lost all tension at that point. Given the gravity gradient, the satellite was going to drift upwards. We had to make sure the satellite was properly oriented for when the cable would eventually tighten so that the satellite wouldn’t start spinning. We controlled the cable’s attitude using an alphanumeric keypad, which was like trying to drive a truck by pressing buttons on a keyboard! Not easy! We were really sweating! In the end we were able to stabilize the satellite and bring it back to the shuttle.\nIn this video, the astronauts describe the mission. \n- Can you share any other highlights from the mission?\nThere was the televised conversation with Adolf Ogi, then a Swiss Federal Councilor, during which he made his famous comment: \nFreude herrscht\n! Which means, maybe, joy? That powerful expression became a principle, almost an ideology, both for me and for him. An extremely positive message.\n- What has changed with these types of missions today?\nMainly that procedures aren’t written on paper anymore! And that space missions get much more media coverage these days. We saw that recently with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who posted frequently on social networks during his mission on the International Space Station. Our missions took place almost in secret. Not that they were easier – sometimes they were even harder because we were doing things nobody had ever done before. Today, a lot of the work astronauts do at the International Space Station has already been mapped out. The spirit of our space shuttle missions was different – we were headed into the great unknown! Our missions were shorter and always involved extremely complicated, and pretty crazy, tasks. Another difference is that we could talk with our families for just 20 minutes a week. But today, thanks to digital phones, astronauts can stay in regular contact with their loved ones.\nThe show \nClaude Nicollier - Un Suisse dans l’espace\n will take place at the SwissTech Convention Center at 8pm on Friday, 3 November and will be attended by Nicollier and key people from his life including Derib, a cartoonist and childhood friend, astronauts Charlie Duke and Jean-François Clervoy, and astrophysicist Michel Mayor. \nInformation and tickets at \nExpress bio\nBorn in Vevey on 2 September 1944.\n1966: Became a Swiss Air Force pilot flying Hawker Hunter aircraft.\n1970: Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Lausanne.\n1970–1973: Worked as a graduate scientist at the University of Lausanne’s Institute of Astronomy and the Geneva Observatory.\n1976: Obtained a fellowship at the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Space Science Department.\n1978: Selected by the ESA to become a member of the first group of European astronauts.\n1980: Joined NASA, while remaining with the ESA, for astronaut training as a Mission Specialist.\n1992: Carried out the first of his four space shuttle missions, aboard the \nAtlantis\n (from July 31 to August 8).

{"id": 691, "text": "EPFL start-ups have so far raised a total of CHF 397 million this year, and the number is still rising. That's 50% more than in 2014, when the figure reached CHF 242 million. Spin-offs – companies founded as a result of technology developed in an EPFL lab or created by a campus researcher – saw the largest increase in funding. They raised CHF 261 million this year, compared with CHF 107 million in 2014 and CHF 66 million last year. Funds raised by other companies located in EPFL’s Innovation Park totaled CHF 76 million (CHF 57 million in 2014), and AC Immune began trading on Nasdaq, adding a further CHF 60 million.\nMindmaze, which specializes in rehabilitation through virtual reality, raised CHF 100 million, the largest single amount ever achieved by an unlisted company on campus. AC Immune and NEXThink complete the top three. AC Immune, which has developed an Alzheimer vaccine, raised CHF 42.7 million and began trading on Nasdaq (CHF 60 million). NEXThink, a spin-off specialized in company software management, raised CHF 38 million. Seven other start-ups, including G-Therapeutics, Typesafe and Aleva, completed funding rounds for more than CHF 10 million each this year.\nMore than CHF 100 million a year since 2010\nSixteen smaller companies raised the remaining CHF 37 million, conducting either their first or second funding round. This is a clear sign of the solid health of EPFL's business ecosystem. Among the 15 or so spin-offs created each year, several manage to quickly find investors in order to make their first hires, fine-tune a prototype or start production.\n“While total funds didn't surpass CHF 50 million before 2010, they have regularly exceeded CHF 100 million ever since,” commented Hervé Lebret, head of the Innogrant fund, which helps EPFL companies to get off the ground. “But who knows whether 2017 will be as flush as 2016.” The CHF 397 million brought in during this record year is equal to more than a third of all of the capital raised by companies on campus since the Science Park was created in 1993.\nInnovation Park has been expanded, collaborations with laboratories have been made easier, and there is now more assistance available to start-ups, both in terms of financing and coaching. All these factors have helped to create an environment on campus that is conducive to the development of start-ups over the years. No official ranking exists of places that are of interest to investors, but several indicators put the campus and the wider region in a solid position. A study by Atomico, an international technology investment firm headquartered in London, entitled “The State of European Tech”, mentioned Lausanne four times, in relation to: EPFL, quality of life, Faceshift (a spin-off bought by Apple) and Mindmaze.\nThe sharp rise in venture capital across Europe over the last three years seems to have benefited EPFL-related companies. Half of funded start-ups found some funding in Switzerland, a quarter in Europe and the rest went further afield, to the USA and Asia.\nThe magnet effect of a major international player\nNo sector seems to be particularly sought after or spurned by investors looking at EPFL. Thanks to the CHF 100 million invested in Mindmaze, biotechs topped the list with CHF 121.05 million, followed by IT (CHF 62.4 million) and medtech (CHF 49.7 million). This is unsurprising, as these are the sectors with the highest number of start-ups. “EPFL’s wide diversification will serve it well in the future,” according to Lebret.\nBut what’s preventing the region from competing even more closely with major cities in terms of start-up creation? “We need a major international company that would generate a magnet effect,” says Lebret. “A place that would bring in top engineers and scientists who then decide to stay in the region and maybe turn around a few years later and create a start-up. These new arrivals attract investors to the region and help reduce the risk of start-ups going offshore when they increase their capital.” So far, no funded spin-off has left the region for good, although some of them have also set up offices outside the country.", "summary": "Start-ups linked to EPFL raised almost CHF 400 million this year – that’s over 50% more than in 2014, the last record year.

{"id": 692, "text": "Geologists have found evidence of a vast hollow chamber at the heart of the Matterhorn. Using triple-woven spectroscopic probes, they discovered and then re-created in three dimensions the enormous hollow chamber in the deep interior of the mountain. They measured the superficial rocky external layer, which has an average depth of 15 meters, and mapped with precision several superficial fracture lines. The mountain is dangerously unstable, they say. But they add that surrounding populations have nothing to worry about, because due to its world-famous pyramidal shape, the Matterhorn will simply collapse in upon itself without generating dangerous rockslides along its flanks. The discovery was recently published in the journal Nature Apocalypses.\n “The issue is not if it will collapse, but when. It could happen in a thousand years, or it could happen next week,” warns study author Jean-Manu Torthézy. “The population has, in principle, nothing to worry about. But they could get a rude shock some morning when they wake up!” Because instead of the glorious and iconic symbol of the Swiss Alps on the horizon, the inhabitants of Zermatt would wake up to a smooth mountain pasture above the village. “According to our computer models of the Matterhorn, it should fall from its current height of 4,478 meters to a rounded dome of only 2,120 meters.” \n All mountains eventually disappear, the geologist reminds us. But normally this occurs over millions of years as part of a slow process of erosion. “In the very unusual case of the Matterhorn, it will be a little quicker and certainly a lot louder!”\n Local herders were the first to raise the alarm that something was amiss. The crevices that open into the mountain’s inner chamber are deadly traps for the animals grazing the alpine pastures. “Goatherds are familiar with them and have been passing down their location for generations, but lately new fissures have appeared and others that were barely wide enough for a ballpoint pen are now large enough to swallow a cow,” says Torthézy. \n The Federal Office of Hiking Tourism (FOTP) has already begun preparing for post-Matterhorn reality. In discussion with the country’s primary postcard producers, they are trying to find the best viewpoint for promoting the international image of the Valais ski resort, says FOTP director Stefan Müller.

{"id": 695, "text": "This Monday December 3rd was a big day for Astrocast. At 7:34pm Swiss time, the first satellite produced by this EPFL start-up took off from California on board a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The launch, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County, went smoothly. The rocket was carrying almost 70 satellites, which were gradually put into a sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 575km in the hours following take-off.\nAstrocast’s satellite is in the CubeSats category, which is a type of nanosatellite defined by a standard cubic shape measuring 10cm on each side. It consists of three units and is approximately the size of a shoebox. This satellite is for demonstration purposes, and a second one of the same type will be launched from India in January.\nThey represent the first in a long line of Astrocast satellites: they will be used to test the system that Astrocast plans to market, which will involve a further 80 satellites in orbit by 2022. This Internet-of-Things (IoT) system will connect millions of objects all over the Earth’s surface. It will enable Astrocast clients to monitor infrastructure and facilities remotely and at a much lower cost than existing methods.\nFor example, it will allow a company developing water purification machines, intended particularly for remote African villages, to maintain them much more efficiently. The machines will have a communication module inside them that will send water consumption and status data several times per day.\nThe SwissCube story continues\nTo set up the system, two sets of ten satellites are scheduled for launch in October 2019 and early 2020. They will make up the first part of Astrocast’s constellation, which will cover the Earth’s entire surface.

{"id": 696, "text": "For the 21 teams selected to compete, the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition is more than just a time trial down a track in a vacuum tube. After making the initial cut, the teams have to overcome countless hurdles – including 140 qualifying rounds – in their quest to qualify for the final race, which will be held this coming Sunday at 8pm (Swiss time). Friday morning, EPFL’s pod \nBella Lui\n landed a spot in the top three, finishing neck and neck with ETH Zurich and last year’s winner, Munich.\nThe EPFL students got a confidence boost yesterday after putting their pod through its paces in SpaceX’s airless tube for the first time this year. The large white tube is nearly two meters in diameter and sits on the edge of Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles, perched on concrete blocks and separated from a four-lane road by a line of traffic barricades. To enter the Loop, the pods are mounted on a platform at one end of the 1.6 km-long tunnel and then placed on aluminum rails. “The tests we ran yesterday were to check the brake system and ensure the autonomous driving system performed to spec,” says Mario Paolone, the team’s main advisor.\nLong list of procedures\nAt the end of the tests – which consisted of three trial runs, each faster than the previous one – the team members couldn’t contain their joy. \nBella Lui \nreached a top speed of 158 km/h at a distance of 188 m into the Loop. The distance recorded by the pod as it traveled through the Loop differed from the measured distance by just one meter – this is a negligible discrepancy at this scale, and it proves that the team meets the required criteria. The team’s accomplishment took place under the approving gaze of monitors from SpaceX and The Boring Company, both owned by Elon Musk. During testing in Lausanne, EPFL’s pod reached a maximum speed of 75 km/h at 45 m on the team’s 120 m on-campus track.\nThe trial runs may have lasted only a few tense seconds each – onlookers held their breath before breaking into applause – but were preceded by nearly two hours of careful preparation under a baking sun. Every move, from plugging in the batteries to filling the compressed air brakes and moving the pod onto the loading platform, was carried out according to a set of operating procedures worthy of the Moon landing. At the SpaceX headquarters, flight procedures are standard fare and safety is taken very seriously. What’s more, many of the qualifying rounds had to do with the teams’ operating procedures, and EPFL got a leg up on this from its experience last year. “Strict procedures are also essential given the potential for human error,” says André Hodder, one of the EPFLoop team’s advisors.\nA strong entry despite some unforeseen events\nThe 25 students on the EPFL team have not had a good night’s sleep since they got to LA. Once their pod arrived in boxes, they had to assemble it, test it and deal with the inevitable snafus. For example, they had to lay their hands on a specific type of nut required by the organizers; an electric cable was inadvertently severed; and one of the chargers stopped functioning. Once all the mechanical parts, electronic equipment, outer shell, batteries and brakes were assembled and working and the pod was stable and its propulsion system operational, the team had to focus on the control system – including the autonomous communications among all the subsystems. When you’re targeting speeds of over 500 km/h, there’s no room for error. At this point, the machine picks up where humans leave off.\nOn Saturday, the organizers will decide which teams can participate in the race through the vacuum tube. Given the time required to run the various procedures – plus another 45 minutes to remove the air from the Loop – only three or four teams will get the nod. Last year, three teams qualified for the race: EPFL, Delft and Munich. This year, those three teams and ETH Zurich are at the top of the list. But what comes next is anyone’s guess.", "summary": "The finals of the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition will take place this Sunday.

{"id": 699, "text": "Switzerland is a country with many bridges. The highways are no exception to this rule – they are built very straight, and straddle over hills and valleys, easily coping with the difficult topography. All year long, the structures undergo variations in temperature and all kinds of weather changes. They are therefore fitted at each end with concrete and steel joints enabling the structure to flex. The weak point of these elements, positioned on the abutment between the ground and the bridge, is due to the fact that they are continuously in contact with air, water and de-icing salts. After 25 to 30 years, wear and tear take their toll, steel corrodes, and the characteristics of the land may change and prevent the joint from performing correctly. “The cost of maintenance of a roadway joint is estimated at about 100,000 Swiss francs, so imagine what it costs to repair 28 joints, as the canton of Vaud recently found out. On top of that you have to add all the disruptions to traffic,” explains Professor André-Gilles Dumont, who heads the Laboratory of Traffic Facilities (LAVOC).\nSemi-integral bridges\nTo avoid these inconveniences, short- and medium-length bridges are now built without expansion joints. The bridge is extended with a transition slab which is buried under the embankment and absorbs the distortions. According to the Federal Roads Office, this technique only applies to structures with a length of 60 meters maximum. The Structural Concrete Laboratory (IBéton) has initiated an innovative research program. “We demonstrate that it’s possible to do away with expansion joints for bridges over several hundred meters long”, explains Professor Aurélio Muttoni. “If you double the length of the bridge, you double the amplitude of the movements caused by expansion or contraction. The challenge is to be able to eliminate expansion joints on future big bridges and modify those of existing bridges – and there are many of these in Switzerland.” \nOn open-air laboratory \nThe LAVOC is currently organizing a life-size experiment. The scientists have built a replica on a 1:1 scale of an integral bridge abutment. For their part, the Geodetic Engineering Laboratories (TOPO) are focusing on ground distortion. Lastly, the Ibéton laboratory has designed the transition slab which will be installed in a ditch. Hydraulic cylinders will simulate the movement of the bridge by pulling or pushing the transition slab. The asphalt blacktop will be the same as that used on Swiss highways. \n To simulate the effect of the movement of vehicles, the engineers will deploy a 22-ton steamroller. They will thus be able to assess the compression of the embankment. Lastly, the scientists will check the settling of the profile and capture the distorted surface in 3D. Bertrand Merminod is experimenting with two technologies: the first one – proven – uses piles planted in the ground. The second, more recent, uses laser scanning. “This latter process is commonly used in mines to estimate the volume which needs to be excavated. With more than one point per square centimeter, it gives a high definition representation of the surface .” At the end of the year, the scientists will know if it is possible to design a large bridge without using expansion joints.", "summary": "Expansion joints are a nightmare in the maintenance of highway bridges.

{"id": 707, "text": "Scientific discoveries can wow an audience – if they are explained with passion and panache. And that’s exactly what happened last night at the finals of EPFL’s My Thesis in 180 Seconds competition, held at the Rolex Forum. All of the auditorium’s 600 seats were filled as people watched in earnest while the 14 finalists discussed their research on topics ranging from medical imaging and the inner workings of watches to nuclear energy.\nCharlet’s work on developing flexible yet resistant hydrogels paves the way to a next generation of artificial ligaments, which can help people recover faster from skiing accidents, for example. A student at EPFL’s Soft Materials Laboratory, he is testing different types of polymers to come up with the perfect recipe. His presentation took home first place. Second place went to PhD student Radmila Faizova, who is studying uranium. She managed to turn her research on a daunting subject into an interesting exposé on how to clean up uranium 6 which is dangerous for health issues into another form which is safe. And third place went to PhD student Josué Ghering, whose research on snowflakes has taken him to all four corners of the globe – from Switzerland and South Korea all the way to Antarctica.

The public speaking classes he took probably helped him prepare. While all 14 students who presented last night made giving their 3-minute talk look easy, they actually put in hours and hours of work. “The secret to looking natural and conveying your passion is practice, practice, practice,” says Étienne Duval, a freelance journalist who has trained several EPFL PhD students on public speaking, including 11 of this year’s 14 finalists.\nThe special audience award went to PhD student Valentine Magnin, who also won the audience’s second selection . “Your mechanical watch may seem to be running on time, but it’s actually falling behind by a few seconds every day,” said Magnin as she launched into her presentation.

{"id": 709, "text": "EPFL and the University of Lausanne form an integral part of the Lausanne-Morges urban area, attracting thousands to the campus every day by public transport, by car, on two wheels and even on foot. During term time, no less than 150000 kilometers are travelled by train and 83000 kilometers by car every day for EPFL. The annual mobility survey (Rumba) provides EPFL and the University of Lausanne with a vast repository of data concerning transport users. The urban and regional planning community (CEAT) has analyzed these results to give a new spatial representation of the campus commuting patterns. The maps help to determine the provenance of students and employees, the distances traveled and the modes of transport used, as well as how status, age and gender influence mobility-related behavior.\nBoth universities have experienced almost unbroken growth in their student populations. This trend has proved particularly strong in the last few years. Between 2005 and 2010, the University of Lausanne’s headcount increased from 10800 to 12200 (13%), while the EPFL headcount rose from 8700 to 10500 (20%). In 2010, 56% of the respondents indicated that they used public transport, while 21% chose a form of soft mobility (6% on foot, 15% by bike) to reach one of the two sites. Seventy percent of the population using these sites lives in the Lausanne agglomeration during the week. An increase in the use of public transport and soft mobility (pedestrians and cyclists) and a reduction in individual motorized transport have also been recorded. This development is observed for all users, irrespective of their status, age or place of residence. Although car use is in decline, it is still largely responsible for the 30 tons of carbon dioxide emitted for EPFL alone: 88% of the CO² burden comes from exhaust.\nAs the authors indicate, “the two universities’ mobility policy is a success. In a period of strong growth, across all the modes of transport, public transport is on the rise. All the measures taken have enabled the flow of commuters to be contained and managed, in particular using a set of fine measurements”. These measurements include the successful introduction of a quarter-hour time-lag in the start time of courses between the University of Lausanne and EPFL to eliminate the maximum peaks. Similarly, the 4.5% increase in the number of cycle journeys from 2007 to 2010 has been maintained, which is due in particular to the construction of thousands of secure parking spaces, the launch of the first self-service cycle system in Switzerland, the establishment of a cycle station on each campus for repairs and to cycle campaigns such as “Bike to work” and “Mobility weeks”.\nAlthough the elasticity of the existing transport system has so far enabled the strong growth of the campus to be absorbed by many adjustments, it is also observed that a threshold is being reached. Mobility policy questions are therefore a key issue for the universities, the cantonal and regional transport and mobility services and the Lausanne public transport system.\n- ILLUSTRATIONS -", "summary": "No less than 25000 people travel between the University of Lausanne and EPFL in the week, making the two campuses the canton’s second largest city in the daytime.

It actually has more the feeling of a manifesto: to transcend the high-tech aspect of new materials and explore their potential in our daily lives. Two renowned design schools, ENSCI in Paris and ECAL (Ecole Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne) in Renens, have responded to this challenge. “Hidden Carbon” presents the seven best projects where carbon takes other forms: for example; blown glass, light and sound.\nBecause of their exceptional ratio of rigidity to weight, carbon-fiber composite materials have become a reference in sport – even a high-tech icon.

{"id": 715, "text": "A single image changed the direction of Correia’s career. The tenure track assistant professor remembers it as if it were yesterday. After finishing high school, Correia wasn’t sure what he wanted to do, but as the son of two financial accounters, he was sure he didn’t want to go into finance. “I wanted to help people and become a doctor, but my grades weren’t good enough. So I settled for chemistry,” he says. He studied the subject for three years without much enthusiasm, until the day a professor showed him a 3D image of a protein. That aroused his curiosity and made him want to learn more. “The structure was so beautiful, so perfect, to this day how these structures are formed remains a mystery. When I saw that image, I knew exactly what I wanted to study – and I haven’t looked back. After my wife and daughters, it’s the only thing I really care about,” he adds with a laugh.\nClaiming to have been “a bad student”, Correia never imagined he’d go into academia and develop a passion for teaching. He joined EPFL only four years ago yet in 2019 was named best teacher in the life sciences and technology section. “When I taught my first class I was terrified, nervous. I lacked the pedagogical know-how. I could see by the students’ expressions that they were frustrated. Giving a lesson can be extremely stressful for a professor. So I tried to improve – I listened carefully to their feedback and drew inspiration from other EPFL professors I worked with,” says Correia. Today he co-teaches two Bachelor’s classes and one Master’s class, all related to his research field of biochemistry. Students learn about the chemical compounds that form the building blocks of life, with a particular focus on proteins and biomedical research.\nAt his lab at EPFL, Correia – who holds a PhD in computational biology – and his research team uses computational methods to develop and test artificial proteins for applications in immunotherapy, vaccinations and biosensors. They recently developed .\nLearning together \nCorreia encourages his students to adopt the perspective of a researcher from the very beginning of their studies. “I try not to be a professor that simply talks at his students. Instead, I try to foster dialogue and create a climate where we all learn together. Because the teaching process works much better when information is shared both ways and in-between students, something I was taught by the previous SV teaching section director John Mckinney” he says.\nFostering dialogue means asking frequent questions and delving into detail when needed – all with a touch of humor so the students feel at ease. “I ask for volunteers to answer questions, but if nobody raises his hand, then I’ll call someone. But the atmosphere is really relaxed. I think it’s important to discuss things because knowing something and teaching it are two very different things. As soon as you try to teach something, you realize there are some facts you don’t know as well as you thought,” says Correia. He also tries to get students to visualize the concepts so that they learn them better and can then associate them in different ways. “I want my students to understand the mechanisms at work, not just memorize them. That’s why I don’t ask multiple-choice questions in my exams but open questions and let the students use documentation if they wish.”\nCorreia may not have become a doctor but he still achieved his goal of helping people. Besides the fact that his research is medical-related, he is training the next generation of scientists. “I didn’t realize it until someone pointed it out, but it’s true that as professors we give tomorrow’s active players in society, a solid foundation and sharp analytical and critical skills. That will help them make sound decisions and contribute to improve the world we live in. And that’s what really matters, right? Although sometimes I worry that the academic ‘bubble’ my colleagues and I live in, affects how we see the world,” he says.\nCorreia has never regretted his career choice. “EPFL is a fantastic place with excellent facilities. I lived in the US for a long time, and even though here in Switzerland we have less of a ‘go and do it’ mentality, if you really want to do something, you can find the resources, it boils down to your willingness to go forward. And in Switzerland we have a better work-life balance,” he says. A father of two girls aged four and seven, Correia feels he can be there more often for his family. Only one thing bothers him, the issue of gender equality. “I see how hard things can be for women, that’s I try to be very attentive to gender equality issues even in my classes, as a lot of the equality problems start in class rooms ” he says.", "summary": "Bruno Correia, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Protein Design and Immunoengineering, has been named the best teacher in the life sciences and technology section for 2019 – just four years after giving his first-ever class.", "claim": "Bruno Correia, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Protein Design and Immunoengineering, has been named the best teacher in the life sciences and technology section for three years – just four years after giving his first-ever class.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 30], "noise": false}

The new guide launched today in the form of an application provides valuable information while adjusting to the desires of the user. Rather than keeping one’s nose stuck in the screen, visitors can fully enjoy the scenery. A tourist is alerted by an audible signal when approaching a potentially interesting site.\nLaunched today by the Vaud Office of Tourism, this mobile guide developed by the start-up EDSI-Tech lists a range of 500 points of interest that gradually will be expanded. The most renowned sites such as the Cathedral and the Chillon Castle are presented alongside less frequented places such as The Bolo Museum of Computers, Echallens House of Wheat and Bread or a beautiful view. The application then signals with a beep or tone for those wishing to explore the region. It takes into account the opening hours and the seasonal nature of certain events but does not include commercial advertising.\nHowever, the real innovation introduced by MyCity, the applications launched by the company, to the world of tourism is the development of algorithms to produce personalized recommendations, which was done in collaboration with the Media Laboratory of EPFL. To do this, the system learns not only the information provided at registration such as preferences, age or country of origin, but also the choices made by the user. “Imagine a person visits the Chillon Castle and the one in Morges. MyCity will definitely suggest the one in Grandson,” explains Philippe Bonvin, one of the two founders. The company is developing multiple opportunities to learn these preferences, such as the time spent by the user at a given location. Routes may also be offered according to interest. This multilingual mobile application is available offline and for the latest versions of iOS and Android.\nTourism offices are particularly looking forward to coupling the application with the collection of statistics. Thus far, outside of organized tours, it has been difficult to know how often a site is visited. The anonymous data indicates trends that will enable industry professionals to improve their offerings. Points of interest can be changed and statistics modulated using software supplied with the application. It is also possible to customize requests by crossing several criteria to obtain specific information on the average age of visitors, where they’re from and what other sites they have visited.\nThe young company based at the EPFL Innovation Park hopes to greatly expand its system to other Swiss and French tourism offices.

{"id": 737, "text": "An elegant invention, developed by a group of ten EPFL students, will take flight next March on a rocket launched in Sweden. The product of more than a year’s work, it was accepted by the European Space Agency (ESA) after a lengthy selection process.\nThe project offers a new method to calculate the orientation of a satellite with respect to the Earth. This is a very important function, because whether the goal is telecommunications or taking pictures, satellites need to be pointed precisely towards Earth to work optimally.\nThe tool – called the Gravity Gradient Earth Sensor - measures the gradient of gravitational forces, in other words, the rate at which gravity decreases as you go further away from the center of the Earth. Very thin, precise sensors developed in EPFL’s Microsystems for Space Technologies Lab in Neuchâtel can capture changes as small as a tenth of a nanometer, the order of magnitude of a single atom.\nF\ni\nnding the Earth\nThe problem is simple: as was experienced by SwissCube, a satellite launched into orbit can end up tumbling around in all directions. How can it position itself? The solution is instinctive: find the Earth, and orient itself accordingly!\n“Up to now, optical sensors were used to find Earth using infrared emissions,” explains Hervé Meyer, a scientist in EPFL’s Space Center. “But that’s a very sensitive technique, which must be installed on the exterior of the satellite. It’s thus very exposed and very fragile. The tool we’re developing is protected, inside the satellite.”\n It’s impossible to test the precision of the new tool under terrestrial conditions, because the effects of gravity are too strong. It can only be tested in microgravity conditions, where the forces of the gravity field still exist, but are much weaker. To attain these conditions, the tool can be placed on a rocket launched into a parabolic flight trajectory.

{"id": 741, "text": "Organoids are fast-becoming one of the most cutting-edge tools of modern life sciences. The idea is to use stem cells to build miniature tissues and organs that accurately resemble and behave like their real counterparts.\nOne can immediately appreciate the value of organoids for both research and medicine: from basic biological research to drug development and testing, organoids could complement animal testing by providing healthy or diseased human tissues, expediting the lengthy journey from lab to clinical trial. Beyond that, there is already the whisper of organoid technology perhaps being used for replacing damaged tissues or even organs in the future: take stems cells from the patient and grow them into a new liver, heart, kidney, or lung.\nSo far, established methods of making organoids come with considerable drawbacks: stem cells develop uncontrollably into circular and closed tissues that have a short lifespan, as well as non-physiological size and shape, all of which result in overall anatomical and/or physiological inconsistency with real-life organs.\nNow, scientists  at EPFL's  have found a way to “guide” stem cells to form an intestinal organoid that looks and functions just like a real tissue. Published in \nNature\n, the method exploits the ability of stem cells to grow and organize themselves along a tube-shaped scaffold that mimics the surface of the native tissue, placed inside a microfluidic chip (a chip with little channels in which small amounts of fluids can be precisely manipulated).\nThe EPFL researchers used a laser to sculpt this gut-shaped scaffold within a hydrogel, a soft mix of crosslinked proteins found in the gut’s extracellular matrix supporting the cells in the native tissue. Aside from being the substrate on which the stem cells could grow, the hydrogel thus also provides the form or “geometry” that would build the final intestinal tissue.\nOnce seeded in the gut-like scaffold, within hours, the stem cells spread across the scaffold, forming a continuous layer of cells with its characteristic crypt structures and villus-like domains. Then came the surprise: the scientists found that, the stem cells just “knew” how to arrange themselves in order to form a functional tiny gut.\n“It looks like the geometry of the hydrogel scaffold, with its crypt-shaped cavities, directly influences the behavior of the stem cells so that they are maintained in the cavities and differentiate in the areas outside, just like in the native tissue,” says Lütolf. The stem cells didn't just adopt to the shape of the scaffold, they produced all the key differentiated cell types found in the real gut, with some rare and specialized cell types normally not found in organoids.\nIntestinal tissues are known for the highest cell turnover rates in the body, resulting in a massive amount of shed dead cells accumulating in the lumen of the classical organoids that grow as closed spheres and require weekly breaking down into small fragments to maintain them in culture. “The introduction of a microfluidic system allowed us to efficiently perfuse these mini-guts and establish a long-lived homeostatic organoid system in which cell birth and death are balanced,” says Mike Nikolaev, the first author of the paper.\nThe researchers demonstrate that these miniature intestines share many functional features with their in vivo counterparts. For example, they can regenerate after massive tissue damage and they can be used to model inflammatory processes or host-microbe interactions in a way not previously possible with any other tissue model grown in the laboratory.\nIn addition, this approach is broadly applicable for the growth of miniature tissues from stem cells derived from other organs such as the lung, liver or pancreas, and from biopsies of human patients. “Our work shows that tissue engineering can be used to control organoid development and build next-gen organoids with high physiological relevance, opening up exciting perspectives for disease modelling, drug discovery, diagnostics and regenerative medicine,” says Lütolf.\nOther contributors\nHubrecht Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands\nUniversity of Lausanne", "summary": "Bioengineers at EPFL have created miniature intestines in a dish that match up anatomically and functionally to the real thing better than any other lab-grown tissue models.

{"id": 746, "text": "Inventions like sensors for self-driving cars that can monitor passengers’ health, a geolocation system that can help smooth out passenger traffic on public transportation, and a smartphone feature for virtually painting the light ambience of a room involve pulling together data from several research fields in an inventive way. The ever increasing amount of information in the world, spread across many different industries and markets, makes this an increasingly difficult task. To make it possible for inventors to sense the inventive signal in this ever increasing amount of noise, AI researchers and software developers at Iprova – the innovation creation firm that came up with the aforementioned inventions – have developed an artificial intelligence platform that includes sophisticated semantic analysis algorithms. Ana Manasovska helped create this program as part of her Master’s degree in computer science at EPFL, in association with the school’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She now works for the company, which is based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, to further develop the software that makes it easier for engineers to invent faster and more disruptively..\nMillions of publications sifted\nMillions of research, industry news and other articles are published around the world every year. One part of Iprova’s artificial intelligence platform works by performing a semantic analysis of the terms in published articles. Manasovska’s thesis on summarization methods contributed to this by testing various phrase recognition methods, which she did by representing individual phrases as vectors. If two phrases have a close virtual spatial location, then their meanings are probably similar. This technique can be used to generate better summaries by measuring phrases’ semantic similarity.\nWhat Manasovska found when comparing the different methods is that the more complicated architectures weren’t necessarily better suited to this task. “Even with a simple architecture, we got excellent results in identifying phrases with similar meanings,” she says. “We also learned that the best way to generate the kinds of summaries that Iprova needs is to approach them from an inventor’s perspective. Most conventional summary-generation methods don’t do that, which is why we wanted to develop our own,” she adds.\nToday Manasovska is working on further improving the semantic recognition and recommendation platform. She works closely with inventors, aiming to find out what kind of data they need and how they plan to use it. She has developed programs allowing engineers to create inventions using input data that they wouldn’t have been able to easily get otherwise. An example of this is the linking of information from inventively relevant, but otherwise disparate, research fields that open up entirely new invention opportunities. “What I really like about my work is that it lets me stay on top of the latest developments in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) – two fields that are advancing rapidly. I have the opportunity to use the latest technology and the power of data to help people spot relevant new findings more efficiently,” she says.\n“Traditional inventors were scientists or engineers with a deep understanding of a specific technical field. This only gave the inventor access to a limited amount of research insight. Even collaborative inventing through teamwork only provides insight into a handful of additional fields, since it’s just a team of specialists. With such approaches to invention, researchers can only dig deeper into specific areas rather than offering genuine innovation by taking the field in a different direction.\nIprova does this on a massive scale – in real-time – by using data from across the spectrum of human knowledge to make connections between ideas from different fields of study.”says Julian Nolan, CEO of Iprova.

{"id": 758, "text": "The new research, by scientists based at the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) and at the CRYOS Laboratory at the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Switzerland, shows that the Alps could lose as much as 70% of snow cover by the end of the century. However, if humans manage to keep global warming below 2°C, the snow-cover reduction would be limited to 30% by 2100.\nIn addition to the changes in snow cover, the new research reveals the Alpine winter season – the period when natural snow is deep enough for winter sports – is set to become shorter. The team say that, as temperatures rise, the ski season could start half a month to a month later than it does at present. Moreover, if we don’t cut emissions, enough snow for winter sports can only be guaranteed above 2500 m by the end of the century.\n“The Alpine snow cover will recede anyway, but our future emissions control by how much,” explains lead-author Christoph Marty, a research scientist at SLF.\nHigher greenhouse gas emissions will bring higher temperatures to the Alps. But scientists were less sure about how global warming would affect snowfall in the region. “The majority of the climate models used project slightly increasing winter precipitation towards the end of the century. However, since temperatures are clearly increasing simultaneously we may experience increasing rainfall and not snow fall,” Marty explains. “We hope our results convincingly show that even increasing winter precipitation cannot compensate for the effect of the strongly increasing temperatures.”\nBy simulating future snow cover in the Alps for various temperature and snowfall projections, the team was able to make more robust projections of how Alpine snow will change in the future, and how sensitive this change will be to different global-warming scenarios. Co-author Sebastian Schlögl, also from SLF, explains: “We used meteorological data and many different climate-change scenarios to model the future snow cover in two Alpine catchments with ALPINE3D.” ALPINE3D is an open-source computer model designed to simulate how snow is distributed in mountainous regions.\nThe team’s projections show that the layer of snow covering the Alps will get less deep “for all elevations, time periods and emission scenarios,” they write in their The Cryosphere paper. “The most affected elevation zone for climate change is located below 1200 m, where the simulations show almost no continuous snow cover towards the end of the century.” About a quarter of the ski resorts in the Alps are located fully below this altitude, according to the .\nSki resorts at higher altitude could also see drastic reductions in snow depth. If global warming isn’t limited to 2°C, snow depth could decrease by about 40% at the end of the century even for elevations above 3000m. The Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany, has an altitude of 2962m. The two highest ski resorts in the Alps, the French Aiguille du Midi in Chamonix, Mount Blanc and the Swiss-Italian Matterhorn ski paradise, have maximum elevations of about 3900m and minimum heights of around 1000m and 1500m, respectively.\nThe decreasing snow depth and a shorter snow season will impact tourism in the Alps. “Since many Alpine villages are heavily dependent on winter tourism, the economy and society of regions with such tourism centres will suffer,” says Schlögl. In the long term, the increased rainfall in winter, the smaller snow cover and disappearing Alpine glaciers will alter how much water flows into Alpine creeks and rivers and how the water volume changes over time. “This will not only impact the ecology, but also the management of water for irrigation, power production or shipping,” he adds.\nDespite these impacts, the new research highlights how much we could save in the Alps by mitigating climate change. “The fact that we lose 30% of the Alpine snow cover with the 2°C global warming scenario is sad, but at the same time encouraging compared to the 70% loss when we go on with business as usual,” concludes Marty.", "summary": "After long-awaited snowfall in January, parts of the Alps are now covered with fresh powder and happy skiers.

{"id": 762, "text": "The place that cars occupy in Swiss people’s hearts has evolved considerably in recent years. Their conflicting views in this regard may even anticipate a shift from a car-centered society to a service-oriented society. Swiss people could well be ready to move past cars, which would entail leaving behind a means of transport that has long been synonymous with modernity. What’s more, this shift may even be economically viable. These are the main conclusions of a major research project entitled \"PostCarWorld\". The detailed results of this study will be presented at a symposium to be held on 3 October at EPFL and attended by Olivier Français, a former EPFL student who is now a member of the Swiss Council of States representing Vaud.\nCan you imagine getting around in a world without cars? That was the initial question put to a thousand Swiss people, including experts in urban planning and mobility, as well as members of the general public. They were asked to imagine their life in a society that had opted to live without cars, not for environmental reasons or due to a fuel shortage but simply out of choice. The idea for this study had been brewing for several years within the research institutes of EPFL's School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering before finally seeing the light of day. Jacques Lévy, a geographer and head of EPFL’s Chôros Laboratory, directed the study, which was conducted over a four-year period. A cross-disciplinary approach was adopted in order to enhance the study’s scope. The PostCarWorld research project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation's Sinergia program, which supports pioneering, cross-disciplinary research projects. Geographers, architects, urban planners, economists, transport and mobility engineers, political experts and sociologists from EPFL, ETH Zurich and the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) all worked together, giving rise to several theses and scientific publications and numerous cross- and multi-disciplinary collaborations.\nShedding light on the current situation\nWhat did they find? \"The advantage of this type of prospective study is that it sheds light on the current situation. In asking Swiss people to imagine a car-free future, we were really aiming to find out more about what's happening right now and about people's complex relationship with cars,\" explains Lévy. This relationship has been complicated by the rapidly shifting and highly contradictory status of cars in Switzerland. While most Swiss people are prepared to consider alternatives to buying a car, they are slow to change, and people still enjoy driving. As leasing, car sharing, carpooling, public transport and telecommuting gain ground, people no longer need to own their own car to have that sense of freedom. \"We’re shifting from an object-centered world, in which cars are an extension of our private property, a myth, a dream, to a service-oriented world, which is based on a whole new approach to mobility,\" explains Lévy.\nAnother change that they observed was a renewed focus on public spaces within cities. The era of the automobile transformed our cities and landscapes for almost a century. The terrain was divided between cars and pedestrians – and until recently, cars were given priority. \"There was a consensus among the urban planners we interviewed: they all want to rethink our streets and place more importance on shared spaces. Cars will have to adapt to this multimodal world in which pedestrians are reclaiming their rights and public spaces are no longer taken over by cars.\"\nTheir final observation was that cars are responsible for the urban sprawl around us that, once it reaches a certain size, hinders a city’s growth. Here’s why: \"The outer suburbs don't have the same access to services as city centers do. But when those outer areas are developed, they make city centers less attractive. In Switzerland, we've seen how, paradoxically, railways are responsible for some of this urban sprawl, as they clear the roads rather than replacing them. We met many families that used both the train and the car to get into town. So cars are not just an environmental problem – they are a problem when it comes to urban planning and living together as well,\" explains Lévy.\nAs part of the study, researchers looked into whether a car-free Switzerland was economically viable. The answer is surprisingly positive, provided, of course, that part of the budget allocated to roads is transferred to the development of public transport and new infrastructure. \"Based on our geographic models, which incorporate various criteria, we concluded that it wouldn't be technically difficult to develop a car-free society, but the current infrastructure would have to be adapted.\"\nFast moving walkways, telecommuting and anthropology \nAs part of the study, EPFL's TRANSP-OR Laboratory came up with the idea of building fast moving walkways that allow people to get around town quickly without a car. This invention has already caught the eye of the European Commission. Also at EPFL, a study was conducted into the mobility of those living in the Lake Geneva region. It showed that building strategic public transport links could influence the means of transport chosen by people over the long term. The disruptive influence of driverless cars was also analyzed. According to the researchers, these cars will play a unique role in how we get around since they are not designed to replace human-driven cars. At ETH Zurich, researchers looked into how people's timetables could be reorganized in a car-free society, especially by making greater use of telecommunications and telecommunicating. At USI, a difference was observed between German-speaking Switzerland and the French- and Italian-speaking parts of the country, with private cars slightly more popular in the latter regions.\nKindling an in-depth debate\nFor the PostCarWorld researchers, a car-free world is much more likely now than it was 20 years ago. While the individual interviews revealed that Swiss people are contradictory in their approach to mobility, they also showed that people were increasingly aware of the issue and open-minded, and that their expectations were evolving. According to Lévy, \"The balance is shifting. People living in downtown areas are aware that the cars polluting the air around them and creating noise come from outside the town, and that the fine particles they produce are deadly. Certain public policies have changed, but the Swiss Constitution sends a mixed signal: it sets sustainable development as an objective but also stipulates that people must be free to choose their means of transport. But does this right to mobility conflict with other rights, such as the right to health?\"\nAccording to the researchers, these contradictions are a product of the paradoxes of our time – and a sign that we are transitioning to a post-car society. \"That picture-perfect image still used in car ads of a lone driver surrounded by the Grand Canyon resonates less these days: we spend more time stuck in traffic jams and our cars are equipped with such things as cameras and drowsiness and speed detectors. Drivers are expected to have the same reflexes as a machine and be able to absorb a lot of information at the same time. That's far removed from the pleasure of driving fast and conquering open spaces.\"\nHonorary lecture and exhibition\nAfter the findings of the PostCarWorld project are presented, Jacques Lévy, who has headed the Chôros Laboratory since 2004, will give an honorary lecture on the theme of \"living together\". He will look back on 13 years of research and look to the future by proposing new research opportunities in the areas of mobility, urban design, urban planning, globalization, political geography, spatial justice, digital space, and mapping – all topics that he hopes to address by putting in place a cross-disciplinary research network.\nThe day will end with the opening of an exhibition to showcase the work of the Chôros Laboratory, which has strived to bridge the gap between human sciences and exact sciences for over a decade. This work is illustrated through maps, which are used as both a vector of communication and a research tool, reflecting just how useful maps are at all stages of knowledge production. Lévy has also mapped out electoral results in Switzerland and France, shedding light on the reflexivity of citizens and ensuring that the public debate did not overlook the question of space.

{"id": 763, "text": "For those that doubt that 200 students can work towards a common goal, under pressure and with limited resources, this year’s architecture freshmen have shown that it can be done. The proof is an impressive three-dimensional pavilion, roughly 10 meters across in each direction, made up of approximately 2000 wooden beams. Within the structure, twelve architectural installations invite visitors to experience a variety of sensations as they climb narrow staircases and collapsible ladders from one installation to the next. The structure, located to the east of the Rolex Learning Center, will open several times this summer, to be admired from afar and from within.\nThe structure’s \nraison d’être\n is as a teaching platform for first-year architecture students. Working in twelve design studios, the students first teamed up in pairs to propose projects for rooms that could be integrated into the latticework of the underlying protostructure. The one hundred proposals to emerge were then whittled down to a dozen, one per design studio. These were then further refined and combined into a coherent whole. \nEach module used the same raw material, wooden beams, to manipulate space, creating wildly different atmospheres across the cuboid pavilion. “We initially imagined that the challenges would involve integrating the twelve individual modules into a coherent constellation,” says Agathe Mignon, who coordinated the project at ENAC’s ALICE lab. “While that was far from obvious, we found that the challenge was actually one of efficient collaboration.”\nThe spaces in the pavilion include a theatre that can be viewed from outside the structure, from a balcony within it, and even from a zenithal viewpoint one floor further up. A series of stairs and ladders take visitors to the lung – a module on the second floor that channels air from its windows through a corridor draped with white fabric – and from there, up to a vertiginous lookout directs the view towards the eastern end of Lake Geneva and the mountains beyond.\nTo carry out the project, ALICE teamed up with external engineer Rémy Meylan and several sponsors from the industry. For the students it was a unique, and in many ways eye opening, experience. “It is very rare for students to work on a full-scale prototype so early on into their curriculum and interact with a civil engineer to ensure that their designs are structurally sound,” says Mignon. But with so much to learn, she says, they were always ready to go the extra mile. “I was constantly impressed by the energy they were willing to put into making this project work,” she says. \nGuided visits:\n from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm\nMonday, June 13\n Friday, June 24\n Saturday, July 9\n Saturday, July 16", "summary": "The pavilion combines the outcome of twelve first-year architecture design studios into a single three-dimensional exploration of space.", "claim": "The pavilion combines the outcome of twelve Saturday architecture design studios into a single three-dimensional exploration of space.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [7, 7], "noise": false}

{"id": 771, "text": "One of the aims of Switzerland’s 2050 Energy Strategy is to increase hydroelectric production. The Swiss government therefore also needs to predict the environment in which these power plants will operate so that the underlying technology can keep pace with changing needs and future conditions. “In Switzerland, the glaciers and snow are melting more and more quickly. This affects the quality of the water, with a sharp rise in the content of sediments,” says François Avellan, who heads the LMH and is one of the study’s authors. “The sediments are very aggressive and erode the turbines.” This undermines the plants' efficiency, leaves cavities in the equipment and leads to an increase in vibrations – and in the frequency and cost of repairs. To top things off, the turbines’ useful life is reduced. Under the umbrella of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity () and with the support of the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), EPFL has teamed up with General Electric Renewable Energy in an effort to better understand and predict the process of sediment erosion. The aim is to lengthen the hydropower plants' life span through improved turbines and more effective operating strategies.\nTiny particles with an outsized impact\nOne of the challenges facing researchers in the field of hydropower is that they cannot run experiments directly on power plants because of the impact and cost of a plant’s outage. They must therefore limit their investigations to simulations and reduced-scale physical model tests. In response to this challenge, the LMH has come up with a novel multiscale computer model that predicts sediment erosion in turbines with much greater accuracy than other approaches. The results have been published in the scientific journal . “Sediment erosion, like many other problems in nature, is a multiscale phenomenon. It means that behavior observed at the macroscopic level is the result of a series of interactions at the microscopic level,” says Sebastián Leguizamón, an EPFL doctoral student and lead author of the study. “The sediments are extremely small and move very fast, and their impact lasts less than a microsecond. On the other hand, the erosion process we see is gradual, taking place over the course of many operating hours and affecting all the turbine.”\nA multiscale solution\nThe researchers therefore opted for a multiscale solution and modeled the two processes involved in erosion separately. At the microscopic level, they focused on the extremely brief impact of the minuscule sediments that strike the turbines, taking into account parameters such as the angle, speed, size, shape – and even composition – of the slurry. At the macroscopic level, they looked at how the sediments are transported by water flow, as this affects the flux, distribution and density of sediments reaching the walls of the turbine flow passages. The results were then combined in order to develop erosion predictions. “It’s not possible to study the entire process of erosion as a whole. The sediments are so small and the period of time over which the process takes place so long that replicating the process would take hundreds of years of calculations and require a computer that doesn’t exist yet,” says Leguizamón. “But the problem becomes manageable when you decouple the different phases.”\nAdapting to the future\nWith conclusive results in hand, the LMH has now moved on to the next phase, which consists in characterizing the materials used in the turbines. Following this step, the researchers will be able to apply the new model to existing hydroelectric facilities. The stakes are global when it comes to retrofitting turbines in response to climate change, as hydropower accounts for 17% of the world’s electricity production. Turbines offer little leeway and have to operate in a wide range of environments – including monsoon regions and anything from tropical to alpine climates. If turbines are to last, changes will have to be made to both their underlying design and how they are operated. “While I was evaluating a hydro plant in the Himalayas, my contacts there told me that if a turbine made it through more than one monsoon season, that was a success!” says Avellan.\nThis study is part of CTI project No. 17568.1 PFEN-IW GPUSpheros. It was conducted in conjunction with General Electric Renewable Energy under the umbrella of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity (SCCER-SoE).\n “A multiscale model for sediment impact erosion simulation using the finite volume particle method,” Sebastián Leguizamón, Ebrahim Jahanbakhsh, Audrey Maertens, Siamak Alimirzazadeh and François Avellan.", "summary": "Of all the electricity produced in Switzerland, 56% comes from hydropower.

{"id": 774, "text": "Are window blinds about to become a thing of the past? They just might, thanks to a ground-breaking window glazing system developed by a team at EPFL's Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB). The innovation’s quality and potential have also now been recognized by the European Patent Office, which has granted it patent protection.\n“This patent shows that our approach is original and that our system is unique and merits patent protection,” says Andreas Schüler, a research associate at the LESO-PB. “It’s also reassuring for industry, in the event manufacturers want to use this discovery in the future.” Schüler designed the system together with PhD student Jing Gong and André Kostro, a researcher currently based in Basel.\nLaser-cut micro-mirrors\nSchüler’s team fitted their windows with a layer of micro-mirrors whose thickness ranges from 0.15 to 0.2 millimeters. This allows the windows to make better use of natural light in the room and reduce both heating and cooling costs in the building. In the summer, the micro-mirrors reflect light back outward, which eliminates direct sunlight and overheating. In the winter, the micro-mirrors redirect light into the building to improve the occupants’ visual comfort.\nA high-precision laser is used to cut the micro-mirrors, which are then embedded in a polymer film that is placed between the layers of double-glazed windows. “The challenge was ensuring that the windows remained transparent despite the layer of micro-mirrors,” says Schüler. These windows are meant for building facades that are highly exposed to the sun. The design process took into account the need to keep costs down and enable large-scale production.\nImproved visual comfort \nThis smart-glazing system offers other advantages as well. Preliminary hypotheses developed by the LESO-PB suggest that the system could reduce the thermal load (both heating and cooling) by 10%-20% compared to traditional window glazing. It can improve visual comfort as well by distributing light evenly throughout the room and eliminating sharp contrasts and glare. It also brings in a higher amount of light: up to 150% more light reaches the back of the room and up to three times as much hits the ceiling. Finally, the system was designed to last longer than traditional slatted venetian blinds.\nAutonomous system\nThese windows may one day make blinds obsolete. “When blinds are installed externally, they get dirty very quickly,” says Schüler. “And for some architects, they spoil the look of glass-sided buildings. Yet the disadvantage of installing blinds inside is that they store up heat in the summer. And in both cases, there is a high risk of mechanical damage and wear and tear.” Blinds are associated with another problem too, according to Schüler: no one really knows how to use them most effectively, especially in the case of buildings with a high number of windows. “Our glazing system is based on natural light and geometry, so it works all by itself,” says the researcher.\nBut will people get used to this new system? The answer will come from the NEST in Dübendorf (Zurich Canton), a futuristic house where the LESO-PB’s innovation will soon be put to the test.\nThis project was developed with the support of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE). \nReference:", "summary": "A window-glazing system developed by an EPFL team uses micro-mirrors to improve the lighting and visual comfort inside buildings and could also make window blinds obsolete one day.

{"id": 779, "text": "Anders Meibom is a man who appreciates chance – which might sound a bit contradictory in the sciences, in which precision is usually prized. “When you are carrying out research with a specific goal in mind, you often end up discovering something much more interesting,” he says. “This is why in life I avoid planning. I don’t like writing proposals, either: I always have the feeling that I'm making a plan I probably won’t end up following anyway,” he chuckles. And yet, his non-plans often come together with the help of his “A” team.\nWhen he was young, Meibom says, he was a “nerd.” The former member of the Danish national under-18 football team only went to university “because I was really interested in math and physics.” He was, however, a lucky nerd. Fortune first struck when he met a professor who talked him into studying meteorites and doing a PhD. It struck again in 1997, bringing him to the University of Hawaii, one of the world’s key centers for meteorites and cosmochemistry research. “I started out studying space rocks,” he says, not for a second suspecting he would later investigate what occurs in our oceans. In 2000, he accepted a position as a research associate in the Department of Geological & Environmental Sciences at Stanford.\nSHRIMP, corals and Swiss cheese\nThe Stanford campus is home to a large ion microscope, known incongruously as SHRIMP (Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe). Meibom’s professor left shortly after his arrival, which left him free to pursue his own research. Once Meibom had mastered SHRIMP, it became his favorite tool. One day, he stumbled across a paper that described how its authors had used an ion microprobe, similar to SHRIMP, to analyze trace elements in coral skeletons in order to reconstruct historic ocean temperatures. “Some corals grow their skeletons layer upon layer, a bit like tree rings, one centimeter per year. So drilling into one is like drilling back in time. But the paper’s measurements of trace element compositions were so high, I doubted that the authors knew how to operate an ion microprobe. I thought their data must be incorrect,” Meibom recalls.\n“The only other possibility was that there was something fishy with the trace element ‘proxies’ that were supposed to reflect the ocean temperatures. But when I measured a piece of coral with SHRIMP I found the same ratios and variations. I was flabbergasted.” From that moment on, Meibom took up the challenge of understanding how coral skeletons form. Fifteen years later, we now know that skeleton formation is a highly controlled biological process in which water temperature plays only an indirect role. “I wrote papers that basically called for an end to drilling holes in corals. In some well-known dive spots the corals look like Swiss cheese because every researcher wants their own piece,” he laughs.\nMoving from Stanford University to head up the NanoSIMS laboratory at Paris's National Museum of Natural History in 2005, Meibom expanded his research from coral skeletons to coral organisms as a whole, thanks to an ERC grant. It was there that he began to work with colleagues in Israel, which logically led him, in 2019, to the Red Sea. Now a professor at EPFL, he is also equipped with a NanoSIMS instrument. “We were conducting experiments to understand the role of symbiosis and photosynthesis in corals and wanted to trace metabolites inside coral tissue. The NanoSIMS microprobe has a spatial resolution so precise that we could see how nutrients and metabolites enter tissue and move around. We then began to stress the corals to simulate the effects of global warming and to better understand coral metabolism under thermal stress, which today is tragically killing off corals on a massive scale,” Meibom explains.\nThen the team – again, purely by chance – discovered that Red Sea corals have a huge resistance to abnormally high water temperatures. “We stressed them up to +5°C and they remained healthy. Had we done the same thing to Great Barrier Reef corals, they would have all died,” he says. “This was an incredible discovery – the corals in the northern Red Sea will probably be the ‘last reef standing’ at the end of the century. They will be able to resist global warming, so we must do all we can to protect them from being destroyed by local environmental stresses, such as pollution. Through the creation of the Transnational Red Sea Centre, and with strong support from the Swiss Foreign Ministry, we are now working hard to unite countries bordering the Red Sea in this effort.”\nThe project is far from completion, yet the discovery has made a splash worldwide. “I’ve always been drawn to cool scientific projects that have a ‘wow’ factor,” Meibom admits.\nMeibom’s kingdom of boredom\nThis accomplished sportsman swims, bikes, and practices yoga on a regular basis. “I feel uncomfortable when I don’t move.” And yet, he also confesses to something quite paradoxical: while he needs to be constantly in motion, he forces himself into a state of boredom to remain creative. It's hard to imagine him doing nothing. “During the weekend, I often go to the harbor in Pully; I sit there and stare at the mountains for a couple of hours. I don’t touch my phone. It’s beautiful and peaceful, but after a while it’s quite boring. And when one gets bored, one naturally starts thinking about things, often in a completely new way. Two hours of boredom can actually be much more efficient than a full week at work under pressure or meeting deadlines,” swears Meibom.\nAnd it works: the idea of the SKIL – the Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory – came about this way. At the time, he had the feeling that he should be teaching his classes differently, but he couldn’t put his finger on why. Then it struck him that the students were hungry for hands-on projects. Together with Professor Marilyne Andersen, the former dean of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), he built SKIL, a well-equipped workshop for hands-on projects supported by top-flight lab managers. “SKIL obviously doesn't replace teaching, but at EPFL, when we witness how efficiently students learn by doing, we believe it could play a bigger role in the curriculum. This happens when they have a strong voice in defining their own projects: working hands-on, planning, making decisions as they go, with ongoing professional support. It is an amazing process. The students take ownership of their ideas and projects, while we accompany them closely at every stage. In the process, we also learn a lot from them, I can assure you!” he asserts.\nDoes he ever stop thinking about work? “I think about it 24/7, which is a bit of a problem. I do a lot of sports, partly to take a step back. Yet it often happens that I come up with the solution to an analytical problem, or some data issue, while I’m swimming in the middle of the lake – again because after 45 minutes swimming gets pretty dull.” Eureka! Meibom even crunches numbers in the kitchen. “I love to bake bread and cook. Cooking is a bit like an experiment: it’s sometimes challenging, it’s a problem you have to solve, and you get the results immediately. I see recipes as loose guidelines, that’s why it’s fun. I don’t do exactly what they say and I still get away with it – most of the time,” he laughs. “Baking cakes is subtler, it’s more like chemistry: you have to be very precise otherwise it won’t work. But I always bake too much, so I give my neighbors and colleagues bread from time to time. Nobody’s left the neighborhood yet.” Given the success of his sourdough and fancy breads, one doubts that his recipes are left to chance.\nBio \n1969\n: Born in Denmark\n1997\n: Postdoctoral work at the Hawaii Institute for Geophysics and Planetology\n2000\n: Research associate in the Department of Geological & Environmental Sciences, Stanford University\n2005\n: Director of the NanoSIMS Laboratory at the National Museum of Natural History, Paris\n2012\n: Full professor at EPFL\n2018\n: Helps create SKIL\n2019\n: Studies Red Sea corals", "summary": "Summer series: A calling for research.

{"id": 790, "text": "The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which has over 200 members in 70 countries, has broken a number of important stories, particularly ones that expose medical fraud and tax evasion. One of its most famous investigations was the Panama Papers, a trove of millions of documents that revealed the existence of several hundred thousand shell companies whose owners included cultural figures, politicians, businesspeople and sports personalities. To complete an investigation of this size is only possible through international cooperation between journalists. When sharing such sensitive files, however, a leak can jeopardize not only the story’s publication, but also the safety of the journalists and sources involved. At the ICIJ’s behest, EPFL’s Security and Privacy Engineering (SPRING) Lab recently developed Datashare Network, a fully anonymous, decentralized system for searching and exchanging information. A paper about it will be presented during the Usenix Security Symposium, a worldwide reference for specialists, which will be held online from 12 to 14 August.\nAnonymity at every stage\nAnonymity is the backbone of the system. Users can search and exchange information without revealing their identity, or the content of their queries, either to colleagues or to the ICIJ. The Consortium ensures that the system is running properly but remains unaware of any information exchange. It issues virtual secure tokens that journalists can attach to their messages and documents to prove to others that they are Consortium members. A centralized file management system would be too conspicuous a target for hackers; since the ICIJ does not have servers in various jurisdictions, documents are typically stored on its members’ servers or computers. Users provide only the elements that enable others to link to their investigation.\nUsers searching for information enter keywords in the search engine. If the search produces hits, they can then contact colleagues – whose identity remains protected – who are in possession of potentially relevant documents. Search queries are sent encrypted to all users, if there is a macth the querier gets an alert and can decide whether they wish to enter in contact and share information. “Given the fact that users work in different time zones, some with only a few hours of internet access per day, it was critical that searches and responses could take place asynchronously,” notes Carmela Troncoso, who runs the SPRING Lab at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC). Another messaging system, also secure and anonymous, is subsequently used for two-way exchanges.\nTwo completely new secure applications\n“This system, which addresses real-world needs, has enabled SPRING to tackle some interesting challenges,” notes Troncoso. The research team drew on existing authentication mechanisms and anonymous communication primitives, which they then optimized. They also developed two completely new secure building blocks that are described in the paper being published today in connection with the Usenix Security Symposium – an asynchronous search engine and a messaging system. A new protocol, known as “multi-set private set intersection” (MS-PSI), ensures the security of the search engine, allowing users to easily search a large number of databases without increasing the risk of leaks. The messaging system relies on a large number of single-use virtual mailboxes and is based on the well-known “pigeonhole” system, which chooses one option at random, in this case one of the mailboxes. Currently, the system does not allow users to exchange documents. “At this stage in the process, journalists are using other secure messaging systems,” Troncoso says.\nWorking with the Consortium has allowed SPRING to frame new requirements that are rarely examined in the scientific literature. Datashare can be scaled to thousands of users and millions of documents while encrypting all communications. “The hurdles we encountered during the development process, however, have paved the way to a new area of research with significant potential for other fields,” Troncoso concludes.", "summary": "An EPFL laboratory has developed Datashare Network, a decentralized search engine paired with a secure messaging system that allows investigative journalists to exchange information securely and anonymously.

This promising scenario has been made possible by the innovations accomplished by EPFL’s Institute of Microengineering in Neuchatel. The team of prof. Christophe Ballif, director of the Photovoltaics Laboratory (PVlab), presented their work at the European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition that just took place in Frankfurt.\nThe PVlab specializes in thin film solar cells and has been interested for several years in \"hybrid\" technologies, better known as heterojunction technologies, designed to enhance solar captors’ performance. \"We apply an infinitesimal layer – one hundredth of a micron – of amorphous silicon on both sides of a crystalline silicon wafer,\" explains Christophe Ballif. This “sandwich” conception contributes to increase the sensors’ effectiveness.\nFor this assembly to be efficient, the interface between the two types of silicon requires to be optimized. Antoine Descoeudres managed to achieve this feat together with Stephaan DeWolf and their colleagues. They chose the commonest – and therefore cheapest – crystalline cell (called \"p-doped silicon\"), took care of its preparation and improved the process of application of amorphous silicon. They obtained a 21.4% conversion efficiency, which had never been achieved before with such type of substrates: nowadays, the best quality monocrystalline cells only attain an energy conversion efficiency of 18-19% at best. In addition, the measured open-circuit voltage was 726 mV, which constitutes a first-time accomplishment as well. Last but not least, they broke the 22% efficiency barrier on a less common substrate.\nClose to the market\n These results, validated by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in Germany, will soon be published by the IEEE Journals of photovoltaics.\n To bring these innovations to a stage of industrialization may only take a few years. This research was partly financed as a commission for Roth & Rau Switzerland, whose parent company, Meyer Burger, has already started the commercialization of machines built for assembling this type of heterojunction sensors. \"Within three to five years, we expect to reach a production cost of 100 francs per square meter of sensors, estimates Stefaan DeWolf.

{"id": 803, "text": "What else besides water do we lose as glaciers vanish? That’s the question a team of scientists led by EPFL will set out to answer on an unprecedented expedition set to last at least four years. They will travel to the world’s largest mountain glacier systems, collecting microorganisms from hundreds of glacier-fed streams and analyzing their genomes. Through a combination of environmental sciences, life sciences and geology, they hope to learn how these microbiomes have adapted over the millennia to the extreme conditions they are exposed to.\nThrough this project, which officially starts on 1 August 2018, the international team of scientists will explore the “third pole” through glacial streams in Alaska, the Himalayas, the Andes, Greenland, Scandinavia, Pamir, Kamchatka, Caucasus, New Zealand and the European Alps. It’s the inaugural research program for the Alpine and Polar Environment Research Center (Alpole) in Sion and is being made possible thanks to funding from the NOMIS Foundation, which exclusively supports insight-driven scientific endeavors.\nSamples from biofilms\nThe scientists will collect samples from biofilms, which are thin, viscous films of microbes that form on sediment surfaces in glacier-fed streams. They will then use deep sequencing on the microbial DNA to unravel the structure and biological processes of the biofilms’ microbiomes. The sequencing data will be used for two purposes. First, to look back in time, since it may contain ancient biosignatures that could help the scientists to unravel the microbes’ strategies for adapting to their surroundings over time. And second, to get a glimpse into the future, since it will help the scientists to better understand how biofilms are being affected by the melting of glaciers and, consequently, the role that biofilms play in ecosystem functioning and the biogeochemistry of Alpine glacier-fed streams.\nFor the future generations\n“Glaciers and their streams have often been abundant on Earth. But today they are vanishing as a result of climate change. Glaciologists predict that 50% of the small glaciers in Switzerland will disappear within the next 25 years. The same holds true for their glacier-fed streams – and the ecosystems those streams support. We owe it to future generations to better understand the microbial life in these vanishing ecosystems,” says Tom Battin, the project’s research director and head of EPFL’s Stream Biofilm and Ecosystem Research Laboratory. “We can achieve that only with the support of foundations like NOMIS, and only by taking a cross-disciplinary approach bringing together experts from ecology, biogeochemistry, molecular biology and glaciology.”\nInterdisciplinary and novel\n“I am pleased that EPFL is at the center of an initiative to document the microbial life found inside glaciers through this study on glacial runoff,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli. “This research has global importance and is a natural fit for the new Center for Changing Alpine and Polar Environments at EPFL Valais Wallis.” This enthusiasm is shared by Markus Reinhard, Managing Director at NOMIS: “We are delighted to support this exciting research project, which reflects NOMIS’ vision of encouraging interdisciplinary, novel research that has the potential to provide transformational insights about our world.”\nThe first expedition will begin in February 2019. It will be led by Mike Styllas, a geologist and Himalayas specialist, with the help of two mountain experts from Canada and Italy. The genome research will be carried out in association with Professor Paul Wilmes and his team at the University of Luxembourg. Michael Zemp, a research associate at the University of Zurich, will provide his expertise in glaciology. The scientists will start training this summer in the Swiss Alps.\nA unique global DNA repository in EPFL Valais Wallis\nEven before the first expedition gets underway, Battin is already looking ahead to his next challenge. He would like to archive DNA from glacier-fed-stream microbes in a repository that would be housed at the EPFL Valais Wallis campus. This archive would give tomorrow’s researchers a “map” of the microbiomes as they stand today. It won’t be long before advancements in molecular biology, and especially genetic sequencing, lead to new discoveries in microbiome processes and bring new perspectives on the use of bioprospecting in the field of biotechnology. Battin’s DNA archive would also include samples from any research institution wishing to contribute, thereby creating a unique global repository of genetic information on the life in vanishing ecosystems and extreme environments.\nFor the media\n EPFL will coordinate an excursion to the Rhône glacier with the research team on 13 September.

The scientists hope to find out how and where in the brain this balance system is represented, the so-called vestibular cortex, by systematically and mechanically provoking vestibular sensations while recording brain activity.\n “In contrast to conceptual notions of self-consciousness, a new, data-driven theory based on the neurobiology of body representation during a variety of experiments is emerging,” asserts Blanke.\nA neurobiological model of the self\n Previous work in Blanke’s lab suggests that many different senses, but especially the vestibular system gives the brain a crucial reference to represent the self and its location in space. How is the self related to the balance system? And what happens when the visual input and spatial input don’t match up, as in the familiar case of two parallel, stationary trains and the feeling of forward movement of the self when the adjacent train begins to roll in the opposite direction. In the complete darkness of the rotating chair chamber, the subject experiences the movement of her body thanks to her vestibular system, although no visual input is there to back it up.

{"id": 817, "text": "With the power-conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells plateauing around 25%, perovskites are now ideally placed to become the market’s next generation of photovoltaics. In particular, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites offer manufacturing versatility that can potentially translate into much higher efficiency: studies have already shown photovoltaic performances above 20% across different solar cell architectures built with simple and low-cost processes.\nThe main challenge for the perovskite field is not so much efficiency but stability. Unlike silicon cells, perovskites are soft crystalline materials and prone to problems due to decomposition over time. In a commercial context, this puts perovskites on a higher price tag than conventional silicon cells.\nThere have therefore been many efforts in synthesizing perovskite materials that can maintain high efficiency over time. This is done by introducing different cations (positively charged ions) into the crystal structure of the perovskite. Although success has been reported by mixing inorganic cations like cesium or rubidium into the perovskite composition, these solutions tend to be difficult and expensive to implement.\nMeanwhile, no organic – and easier to synthesize – cations that can improve both efficiency and stability have been found so far. Now, , with colleagues at the University of Cordoba, has discovered that they can improve perovskite stability by introducing the large organic cation guanidinium (CH\n6\nN\n3\n+\n) into methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, which are among the most promising alternatives in the group today.\nThe scientists show that the guanidinium cation inserts into the crystal structure of the perovskite and enhances the material’s overall thermal and environmental stability, overcoming what is known in the field as the “Goldschmidt tolerance factor limit.” This is an indicator of the stability of a perovskite crystal, which describes how compatible a particular ion is to it. An ideal Goldschmidt tolerance factor should be below or equal to 1; guanidinium’s is just 1.03.\nStability test of the novel MA\n(1-x)\nGua\nx\nPbI\n3\n perovskite material under continuous light illumination compared with the state-of-the-art MAPbI\n3\n. A schematic of the device architecture and the simulated crystalline structure is also provided (credit: M.K. Nazeeruddin/EPFL)\nThe study found that the addition of guanidinium significantly improved the material stability of the perovskite while delivering an average power conversion efficiency over 19% (19.2 ± 0.4%) and stabilizing this performance for 1000 hours under continuous light illumination, which is a standard laboratory test for measuring the efficiency of photovoltaic materials. The scientists estimate that this corresponds to 1333 days (or 3.7 years) of real-world usage – this is based on standard criteria used in the field.\nProfessor Nazeeruddin explains: “Taking a standard acceleration factor of 2 for each ten degrees increase in temperature, an acceleration factor of 8 is estimated for 55 °C as opposed to 25 °C degrees. Hence the 1000 hours at 55°C equivalent would be 8000 hours. Our cells were subjected at 60°C, therefore the numbers could be even higher. Assuming the equivalent of 6 hours full sunlight/day, or 250Wm-2 average irradiance (equivalent to North Africa) the total number of days are 1333, equals to 44.4 months and 3.7 years stability. However, for the standard solar cell accreditation a series of stress tests including temperature cycling and damp heat are also required.”\n“This is a fundamental step within the perovskite field,” says Nazeeruddin. “It offers a new paradigm in perovskite design as further explorations beyond the tolerance factor limit could prevail for cationic blends while preserving a 3D structure with improved stability through increased number of H-bonds within the inorganic framework – a problem that we are now close to solving.”\nContributors\nUniversidad de Córdoba\nAbengoa Research\nHumboldt Universitat zu Berlin\nHelmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie\nFunding \nEuropean Commission Horizon 2020 (SOLEDLIGHT)\nSwiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)\nToyota Motor Europe Technical Center\nMarie Skłodowska Curie fellowship (Horizon 2020 Grant agreement)\nSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness\nEuropean Cooperation in Science & Technology (COST)\nDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)\nReference\nAlexander D.

These “Swiss Flight” experiences represent a real-life training, and must answer some essential questions:\n•\tHow will Solar Impulse succeed in fitting in with the normal traffic levels of an international airport? During its scheduled world tour planned for 2012, the plane will have to land at several airports.\n •\tHow will the teams manage the logistics on the ground? An exceptional aircraft needs exceptional attention, being both light and huge, with a 64-meter wing span.\nBecause of a small technical problem (a defective alternator in the motor), Solar Impulse had to quickly return to Payerne after landing at Cointrin airport. The part was changed, and the solar plane was able to take off on Wednesday morning for Zurich airport, where it stopped over before going back into the hangar, thus ending the series of summer tests.

{"id": 830, "text": "A discovery made at EPFL could play an important role in electronics, allowing us to make transistors that are smaller and more energy efficient. Research carried out in the Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES) has revealed that molybdenite, or MoS2, is a very effective semiconductor. This mineral, which is abundant in nature, is often used as an element in steel alloys or as an additive in lubricants. But it had not yet been extensively studied for use in electronics.\n100,000 times less energy\n“It’s a two-dimensional material, very thin and easy to use in nanotechnology. It has real potential in the fabrication of very small transistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells,” says EPFL Professor Andras Kis, whose LANES colleagues M. Radisavljevic, Prof. Radenovic et M. Brivio worked with him on the study. He compares its advantages with two other materials: silicon, currently the primary component used in electronic and computer chips, and graphene, whose discovery in 2004 earned University of Manchester physicists André Geim and Konstantin Novoselov the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nOne of molybdenite’s advantages is that it is less voluminous that silicon, which is a three-dimensional material. “In a 0.65-nanometer-thick sheet of MoS2, the electrons can move around as easily as in a 2-nanometer-thick sheet of silicon,” explains Kis. “But it’s not currently possible to fabricate a sheet of silicon as thin as a monolayer sheet of MoS2.” Another advantage of molybdenite is that it can be used to make transistors that consume 100,000 times less energy in standby state than traditional silicon transistors. A semi-conductor with a “gap” must be used to turn a transistor on and off, and molybdenite’s 1.8 electron-volt gap is ideal for this purpose.\nBetter than graphene\nIn solid-state physics, band theory is a way of representing the energy of electrons in a given material. In semi-conductors, electron-free spaces exist between these bands, the so-called “band gaps.” If the gap is not too small or too large, certain electrons can hop across the gap. It thus offers a greater level of control over the electrical behavior of the material, which can be turned on and off easily.\nThe existence of this gap in molybdenite also gives it an advantage over graphene. Considered today by many scientists as the electronics material of the future, the “semi-metal” graphene doesn’t have a gap, and it is very difficult to artificially reproduce one in the material.", "summary": "Smaller and more energy-efficient electronic chips could be made using molybdenite.

The environment adapts to the user’s hand movements, which are visible. Emotions and sensations felt in the moment actually prompt new virtual elements. Imagined movements are performed by the avatar, as if it were directly connected to the user’s brain. The joystick is officially obsolete.\nMindMaze, an EPFL spin-off developed around a device for the rehabilitation of stroke victims, has used its expertise to launch this new system. Still in the prototype stage, the device goes a step further in advancing gamers’ immersive experience. A combination of cameras and depth sensors placed in the front of the glasses detect the user’s hands, making it possible for the player to interact in an immediate way in the virtual environment. Without employing any game developers, the start-up has so far developed a few simple examples that enable one to playfully test the innovations. One of them makes flames dance on a player’s fingertips. When the player relaxes sufficiently, the fire turns to ice.\nThe second innovation is a cap that uses brain activity detection technology to “read” a player’s mind. It captures waves of certain areas of the brain to detect movement, emotions or even a state of stress or relaxation. “From the moment that there is an identifiable and repeated pattern in the brain, it is possible to match a control system,” says Tej Tadi, the company’s CEO. An avatar can therefore grab a cup or open a door through the thoughts of the gamer. One example of this ability to read thoughts is a game that moves spheres based on one’s alternating states of relaxation and stress.\nMindMaze, which has just concluded a round of financing that raised 8.5 million francs, made an impressive debut in late February at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The company’s goal now is to release software for the development of games adapted to their system.

Security systems developed to protect the communication privacy between the seller and the buyer are the prime targets for hackers of all kinds, hence making it necessary for encryption algorithms to be regularly strengthened. In universities, research in hacking aim mostly at testing their robustness.\nMost of them rely on \"discrete logarithm problems\" – very complex mathematical operations – to secure data transmissions. \"There are several variants, based for example on prime numbers or other mathematical formulas, explains Arjen Lenstra, director of the Laboratory for Cryptologic Algorithms (LACAL) at EPFL . \"Their complexity is such that they are deemed as impossible to solve.\" Due to their effectiveness, the industry, especially banks, makes use of them for encoding their transactions. \"The danger lies in the fact that these systems are based on principles that we do not fully understand, states Arjen Lenstra. If someone were to find out how to solve them all, the entire system would collapse.\"\nIn fact, a little over a year ago, cracks began to appear. Robert Granger, then at University College Dublin but who has since joined LACAL, showed that surprisingly the problem's first phase can be solved very easily. Antoine Joux, a French Scientist, independently had similar insights, and together with a French team then showed how to make the second and final phase `very nearly' easy. Then, many other cryptographers stepped in.\nHowever, these methods only managed to overcome a very particular type of discrete logarithm. Nothing suggested that they could crack the industrial variants. \n Therefore, an EPFL team, together with Jens Zumbragel from TU Dresden, focused on a \"family\" of algorithms presented as candidates for the next generation of encryption keys, which made use of \"supersingular curves. “We proved that it would only take two hours for EPFL computers to solve a problem of this kind.

{"id": 838, "text": "In developing countries, many hospitals have become cemeteries of medical equipment. Several radiology systems, often sent by international aid, may never be used due to the climatic conditions and the instability of electricity networks. In a matter of weeks, they become useless. Besides, the lack of qualified personnel or spare parts rapidly dispels any hope to make them work. Yet, the lack of access to radiology in many developing countries is a serious public health problem, whether for TB screening or the care of road traffic injuries.\nGlobalDiagnostiX is the first medical radiography device specifically designed for developing countries. Its total cost of ownership, including purchase and maintenance over 10 years, is 10 times cheaper than the existing equipment. A fully functional prototype was unveiled in Lausanne on 9 March 2015. It was designed under the leadership of EPFL’s the Cooperation & Development Center.\nThe Center’s EssentialTech team is in charge of the project and manages its various stakeholders. Indeed, four EPFL laboratories, ten research groups from the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO; fields of health, engineering and design), the Paul Scherrer Institute, CHUV, the EssentialMed foundation and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute worked in close collaboration with the University Hospital of Yaounde (Cameroon), the University Research Center on Energy for Health Care in Cameroon, and other local stakeholders.\nReliable and cheap mechanics\n The device is specifically designed to resist harsh tropical climate and the consequences of high temperatures, humidity and dust. It includes an examination stand which was designed to avoid any electrical controls. It can move up, down, and turn depending on the body part to be X-rayed. It is only composed of mechanical, solid and stainless constituents. A subtle and robust mechanism facilitates its handling while preventing errors that could lead to shocks or bad radiographies.\nKeeping costs as low as possible: a composite image sensor\nThe radiographic image sensor has been completely redesigned to withstand shocks as well as the temperature and humidity. Very cheap, it is based on an array of twelve CMOS sensors whose images are assembled by the machine’s software. These sensors are commercially available and their cost is moderate; thus they can be easily replaced.\nResisting the unstable electrical network: power supply facing the worst conditions\nThe latest development is probably the most important: resistance to often inadequate or undersized electrical networks. Indeed, to operate an X-ray emitter, a power supply whose tension is able to briefly reach 150’000 volts is required! The power module will provide this voltage without overloading the hospitals’ network, whose total consumption in developing countries is often lower than a single X-ray machine’s. It also implements an innovative energy storage system, allowing the entire system to operate for several hours even without an external energy supply.\nAnd the research continues. First objective: raising funds – just under 2 million francs – for testing the first prototype’s reliability and improving its design, aiming at the creation of a second version by next year.\nEntrepreneurial approach, costs divided by 10\nDesigned to specifically meet the needs of hospitals in developing countries, GlobalDiagnostiX must leave the lab and get on the ground. A social business model has been created for this purpose. It will aim to make radiography not only accessible in developing countries but also in a self-sustainable and scalable way. The company’s business model, as well as its industrialization and deployment strategies, were developed with many stakeholders, such as potential customers and partners, in Switzerland and Africa.\nThe project has received the support of Pascal Hundt, head of the Assistance division at the International Committee of the Red Cross. He underlines the enthusiasm of Jeffrey Sachs, economist and Ban Ki-moon ‘s consultant at the UN, for whom “X-ray diagnostic imaging is an essential tool in primary healthcare for diagnosing conditions such as trauma or tuberculosis that represent a great burden in developing countries.

While other vacationers were spending a quiet holiday at the beach, they roamed Ho Chi Minh City and its suburbs visiting... hospitals.\nDuring eight weeks the students conducted their work, subsidized by Ingénieurs du Monde and falling within the framework of the EssentialTech program at the Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV) at EPFL. It builds on the  partnership and focuses on the development of water purification kits specifically tailored to the context of hospitals in emerging and developing countries.\nNot always welcome\n The three Life Sciences and Bioengineering students went to Vietnam to conduct a preliminary - yet crucial - step in this important project. They had to make an assessment of the access to drinking water in hospitals at the capital and its surrounding areas, as well as to estimate their needs. \"We quickly realized that the subject raised rather sensitive points, stated Maxence Dellacherie. The quality control of hospitals’ water is governed by recent legislation and it was not always easy for us to get the required authorization to conduct our analysis ...\"\nIndeed, after visiting the hospitals that did open their doors to our students, they got to the conclusion that, in general, water does not meet the health standards they had chosen to test. \"Patients buy their own bottles of drinking water outside,\" explained Sandra Gribi. Obviously, when it comes to weakened and vulnerable people, access to drinking water is much more important.\nFinding the right people\n Despite several months of preparation with the support of Felippe de Alencastro - from EPFL’s Central Environmental Laboratory - and after making preliminary contacts with Ho Chi Minh City’s University of Technology, the students still had to face some contingencies. \"Identifying the right people to support us during the process and while carrying out the analysis was not an easy task, said Gaëlle Minder. In addition, we did not expect to meet such administrative barriers. I hope that the contacts we made will remain useful in the project’s subsequent phases.\" The three travelers also agree on the necessity of thorough groundwork in addition to simply establishing a contact. “We would have saved a lot of time if some steps had begun before our arrival,\" said Sandra.\nHowever, the students were able to rely on the unwavering commitment of their Vietnamese colleagues. \"I was impressed and touched by their dedication and kindness,\" continued Gaëlle. Bacteriological analyses of the collected samples were carried out in laboratories with equipment described by Maxence as \"surprisingly varied and numerous.\" However, there were significant constraints due to the ambient temperature - over 30 Celsius degrees - and to the lack of air-conditioned spaces, which hindered the conservation of some products as well as the maintenance of the equipment in sterile conditions.\nBack to reality\n \"After spending four years in the Swiss academic environment, adjusting to the reality of the field was not easy, especially within the context of a culture at odds with ours,\" said Gaelle - before adding how the change of scenery has proved rewarding. Vietnamese hospitality undoubtedly accounts for many of their positive memories of the time spent doing the internship. For Sandra it was the impromptu performance of a song in an evening, and for Maxence it was the tasting of a dish of \"mini -chicken\" that later proved to have been made of... rat meat.\nTowards a large-scale project\n The important work carried out by Gaëlle, Sandra and Maxence has laid the groundwork for the realization of the project. The road is still long, and all three would be happy to share their experience with the next candidates for an internship in Vietnam. \"This first step allows us to move forward,\" said Klaus Schönenberger, head of the EssentialTech program at CODEV and originator of the internship. Based on the evidence gathered on site, he was indeed able to obtain, with the assistance of the Dragon Bleu Foundation, the subsidy for a job position to conduct the project’s next phases. \"The issue of access to drinking water in hospital is not unique to Vietnam: it also happens in Africa, he said.

The use of heat pumps to leverage this source of energy is already well established. The piles are connected to thermal exchangers encased in concrete tubes, through which flows a coolant. The hydraulic circuit is connected to a reversible heat-pump system. Thus, the foundations fulfil the role of heat source in cold periods, and a source of cold in warm periods.\nThis technology also enables seasonal storage of energy produced by solar panels in the sub-soil. \n“In the Congress Center, we will benefit from an analytical laboratory that will include all the elements necessary for heating and measurement. The five structures, equipped with optical fibers and pressure cells, will help us to understand and subsequently to explain the exact functioning of a group of energy-transmitting piles, and this will provide us with essential information on their behavior and their impact within the available volume under the foundations, which is about 200m3.”\n Professor Laloui is also working with The Cambridge-MIT Institute and the University of Beijing on a much more ambitious project: that of an urban area the size of EPFL, built entirely on energy-efficient foundations. \n\"In this case, we will have to look into the hydrogeological consequences of such constructions on the global stability of the region.

{"id": 850, "text": "From now on, live cells will keep no more secrets. Scientists will be able to see first-hand how they function, including how their organelles interact and react to stimuli. Nanolive, an EPFL spin-off founded in 2013, has just developed a groundbreaking microscope that lets researchers watch living cells directly, continuously, and without harming them. That paves the way to important discoveries about biological processes that until now have been insufficiently understood because of the lack of a reliable way to observe them. The company’s new system comes together with a proprietary software for converting the images in 3D and making them easier to interpret, such as by displaying specific organelles in color.\nCells can be observed for hours, days or even weeks \nWith this next-generation microscope, called CX-A, scientists can watch living cell populations and zoom in all the way down to individual organelles with a resolution of <200 nm. Samples are prepared by placing the cells on a special 96 well plate. Scientists can rapidly set up their experiments by simply specifying how often they want images to be taken; the device then runs on its own. Data can be collected this way for as long as needed, with thousands of images taken over a period of several days or weeks. As a result, they can obtain unprecedented insights into how biological processes work, how organelles interact, and how mitochondria form intricate networks, for example.\nThe technology was initially developed by Nanolive’s CEO Yann Cotte while he was a PhD student at EPFL. It works like an MRI machine that generates images of cells from all angles using their refractive index and then compiles 3D images with the help of an advanced software. A rotating laser illuminates the sample at a 45° angle to produce a hologram, providing a unique look into cells under natural conditions. The method is non-invasive, manipulation-free, and interference-free, and the rotational scanning allows for 3D reconstruction with excellent resolution.\nTraditional microscopes require the addition of stains or markers to cells, in order to add contrast and visualize them. Unfortunately, these compounds damage cells and cause them to die prematurely, shortening the length of time during which measurements can be taken. Nanolive’s technology requires no stains. “With our microscope, scientists can run experiments under a range of conditions and obtain high-quality images without adding fluorescent markers,” says Mathieu Frechin, head of quantitative biology at Nanolive. “The images generated using refractive index and the possibility to combine them with fluorescent signals enable scientists to follow over time dynamic and delicate cell processes – such as the membrane potential – of living subcellular structures like mitochondria. The signals reveal subtle variations in structure and activity that occur in response to drugs or genetic mutations.\nNanolive prefers not to disclose information about its revenue or fundraising, but it’s clear the company is doing well – it will hire 15 new people this year alone.

{"id": 851, "text": "EPFL has created a unique ecosystem of services, research labs and entrepreneurial programs in the field of education. And today it is adding another string to its bow with LEARN, a new center that will pool the efforts of the different stakeholders involved in educational research and in developing new teaching tools. “To keep pace with the remarkable advancements in digital technology, we need to update both what we teach and how we teach,” says Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education. “LEARN’s primary goal will therefore be to conduct translational research in educational science. That is, to try out new teaching methods, demonstrate their impact and turn them into new teaching practices for our campus and, where desirable, for the educational system as a whole.”\nLEARN will aim to stimulate research and create new synergies in education – a field that has ramifications for our entire society. The center will be headed by Francesco Mondada, a professor at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory and the engineer behind the Thymio teaching robot. LEARN members include the Swiss EdTech Collider, a group of around 70 high-tech startups and the Center for Digital Education, which recently unveiled the Learning Companion application that helps students “learn how to learn.”\nLEARN members operate at all levels of education, from primary school through university. Thymio is a classic example of their work; this robot lets children try out programming and learn the basics of robotics. Over 40,000 Thymio robots have already been sold, mainly to schools. “Adding computational thinking to school curricula doesn’t mean pushing children to think like computers. On the contrary – it means showing children what computers can’t do so that they can have a more complete understanding of the technology,” says Mondada. LEARN will also aim to help teachers adapt to changes in their profession. In addition to leading the new center, Mondada will coordinate teacher training programs to prepare them for the introduction of a new subject called “computer science and digital projects” for young elementary school kids (4-7 years old) in Vaud Canton.\n“Our goal isn’t to make teaching more digital – that’s happening by itself. Rather, we hope to develop ways for using digital technology to make teaching more effective, more varied and more inclusive,” says Professor Pierre Dillenbourg, a LEARN co-founder and head of the Swiss EdTech Collider and of EPFL’s Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction (CHILI) lab. CHILI has just developed a new test, called Tegami, for making granular diagnoses of dysgraphia in children so that they can receive personalized treatment for learning how to write. “We’re also working on systems for professional training. For instance, we developed an augmented reality application for carpenter apprentices,” says Dillenbourg, who is also a former elementary school teacher.\nIn addition, LEARN will help expand EPFL’s online course offering through MOOCs – where EPFL is the leading school in Europe – as well as through the EPFL Extension School, which provides courses on digital technology for the general public (with no prerequisites).", "summary": "EPFL inaugurate this Wednesday, October 10 the LEARN Center for Learning Sciences.

{"id": 852, "text": "EPFL ArtLab inaugurates the world's first cognitive symbiosis experiment, open to the public on October 27th, in the form of an art-science exhibit called \nMental Work\n, and it’s literally thought-provoking.\nFrom a technical standpoint, thought is at the core of the \nMental Work\n exhibit. Visitors have the opportunity to experience what it’s like to control machines using thought alone via brain-machine interfaces, and it requires a fair share of concentration. Plus, anonymized brainwave data will be made available to the scientific community to improve cognitive interfaces.\nMental Work \nalso questions the relationship between human and machine, and how this relationship will evolve with technological advances. It juxtaposes the industrial revolution against the possibly imminent cognitive revolution in which human ­and machine are in symbiosis.\n“We would like to generate a societal debate,” says José Millán, EPFL neuroengineer and co-founder of the project. “This cognitive revolution, which is about to come, may have different shapes. Which is the shape that people would like to see? Which is the place of brain-machine interfaces, if any, in the future cognitive society that we are moving towards?”\n © 2017 EPFL / Mental Work / Adrien Barakat\nEPFL technology deciphers brainwave activity for Mental Work\nAt EPFL, Millán develops , essentially robotic systems that perform a subject’s intention. These systems require technology that detects and decodes the electrical activity of the brain in order to decipher the intended task.\nApplications range from assisting the physically challenged with intact cognitive ability, to improving our daily interactions with machines, or simply preventing one’s cognitive abilities from declining prematurely.\n © 2017 EPFL / Hillary Sanctuary\nThis deciphering of a subject’s intention based on the brain’s electrical activity is possible due to the organized firing of neurons in the brain. The way the  is far from being understood, but the electrical activity can be measured, non-invasively, by placing electrodes on the head. Specific thoughts provoke different patterns of electrical activity, but the signal is noisy. Millán develops algorithms that sift through the noise to detect these patterns, and he has provided this technology to the \nMental Work\n exhibit.\n“\nMental Work\n is an art exhibit where we will be running a large-scale experiment on brain-machine interfaces, meaning that people will be able to control machines by modulating their brainwaves,” continues Millán. “All the [anonymized] data that we will acquire will be made available to the brain-machine-interface scientific community, in order to advance the field through the analysis of brainwave data.”\nA state-of-the-art helmet, fully equipped with electrodes, is provided to visitors at \nMental Work\n. The visitor must imagine either closing both hands – without actually closing them – or simply relaxing both hands. An estimated 15 minutes of training is required in order for the EPFL algorithms to detect the two patterns, closed hands or relaxed hands. These thoughts can then be used as commands to operate a machine via a computer.\nThe Mental Work Factory\nThe machines at \nMental Work\n look like a science-fiction rendition of historical train wheels, equipped with apparent gears and moving parts, all of which are chromed to reflective perfection. The machines were imagined by American artist, experimental philosopher and co-founder of \nMental Work\n, Jonathon Keats, and realized by dedicated EPFL technicians of the ATMX workshop, in collaboration with industrial partners in the Lausanne region.\n“The industrial revolution was a dangerous period in history, literally dangerous for the laborer who might lose a hand while not paying attention,” explains Keats. “Now we are in the cognitive revolution and the stakes are potentially higher. Today, that won’t happen because you are not in touch with the machine in any physical way. Instead, you may lose your mind.”\nThis contrast between the industrial and cognitive revolutions gave rise to the \nMental Work\n exhibit, a “factory” where the visitor is a “worker” providing labor in the form of thought.\n“At the \nMental Work\n Factory, we are asking workers to come and engage in machines using only their brain-power,” says \nMental Work\n co-founder and chief business officer Michael Mitchell. “In the industrial revolution, man’s hands were replaced by machines. Now we have the real risk that man’s brain will be replaced by smarter and smarter machines. We want to bring man and his brainpower back to the center of the technology, and that’s why we are using brain-computer interfaces.”\n © 2017 EPFL / Mental Work / Adrien Barakat\nMental Work, a Swiss experience\n“ArtLab’s primary mission is to be a laboratory for exhibition experiments,” says EPFL Artlab’s Head of Content, Luc Meier. In this sense, \nMental Work\n is truly an art-science experiment. It was developed and built at EPFL in collaboration with José Millán, Jonathon Keats and Michael Mitchell as well as the Lausanne-based Paperboy agency. The exhibit uses EPFL brain-machine technology and aesthetically stunning machines built with the help of EPFL’s fabrication workshops and engineers.\nMeier continues, “ The project was made possible thanks to a collaboration with the School of Engineering’s Technical Workshop Platform, in particular its Atelier de l’Institut des matériaux ATMX, as well as a close local network of interaction designers and coders.

{"id": 862, "text": "It is impossible to envision an energy autonomous house without considering the related question of personal mobility. This is not just for the sake of consistency: it's the challenge posed by the Solar Decathlon. In this inter-university competition, teams will design, build and operate a fully autonomous, solar-powered house. The Swiss Team, which includes EPFL, was selected alongside 13 others and is now preparing to present its design in Denver (USA) in 2017. Charles Jeanbart, a Master’s student in civil engineering, is working on the question of mobility, simulating solutions that are both electric and shared and that use fewer vehicles.\nWhat is unique about the Swiss project is that it’s not simply a theoretical exercise. Following the competition in Denver, the house is designed to be brought back to Fribourg and set up there, possibly in the Beaumont neighborhood. It will be connected to existing buildings and readily accessible to the public, with the aim of helping acquaint people with new forms of energy, consumption and mobility. Jeanbart chose the Beaumont neighborhood as the basis for his analysis of how existing vehicles could navigate the energy transition.\nHe began by estimating the number of vehicles in the neighborhood: around 1,670 for 4,000 residents. He then envisioned a scenario of electric or hybrid vehicles needing to be recharged frequently. Jeanbart, who is part of EPFL’s Transport and Mobility Laboratory, factors into his analysis the frequency and length of trips, when they take place during the day and on which day of the week, and he excludes longer trips. For his simulation, he chose two scenarios, one in which the cars can be charged wherever they are parked and the other in which they can only be charged at home with a home charger.\nA step towards smart grids\n“The goal is to determine the electricity demand at certain periods during the day,” said Jeanbart. “The first scenario shows that the peak charging curve corresponds – with a slight gap – to traffic peaks. This is mostly during the day, from 8am to 5pm. In the second scenario, which is more realistic, the peak is at the end of the day and in the evening.\" Not ideal for recharging cars with solar energy.\nJeanbart's work presents a simplified overview of the recharging needs of electric cars in the neighborhood of one city. “The model should be improved, taking the assumptions even further,\" said Jeanbart. “What I have in mind is to build this into a smart grid – an intelligent system that comprises energy production, storage and consumption – in order to make consumption and production more efficient.”\nThis exercise is particularly relevant in the context of the Solar Decathlon, which dovetails nicely with the thrifty, parsimonious vision of the 2000-watt society. Under this vision, individuals use no more than 48 kWh per day, or 2,000 watts in constant power, which is equal to the global average in 1990. The Swiss average is currently around 5,500 watts. “To achieve this, switching to electric cars and reducing the number of cars through car-pooling won’t be enough. We will also have to scale back our mobility needs by developing the local network,” said Jeanbart.", "summary": "Summer series on student projects (5) – Charles Jeanbart's semester project brings the question of mobility into the Solar Decathlon, an inter-university competition to design an autonomous solar house.", "claim": "8am to 5 series on student projects (5) – Charles Jeanbart's semester project brings the question of mobility into the Solar Decathlon, an inter-university competition to design an autonomous solar house.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 3], "noise": false}
{"id": 867, "text": "Is there a middle road between producing new materials and recycling them? You bet – reusing them! Researchers at the smart living lab in Fribourg came up with a slightly off-the-wall project based on the idea that the stuff we throw away could be the makings of sustainable construction. Guided by this concept, the researchers collected hundreds of old skis, whose mechanical properties proved ideal for building a collapsible pavilion.\n\"In the construction industry, talk about sustainable building usually revolves around insulation, energy efficiency, materials, recycling and biodegradation,” says Corentin Fivet, who heads EPFL’s Structural Xploration Laboratory (SXL). “But recycling is expensive and biodegradation is not always a feasible option. Another way to avoid producing new materials and use less energy is to repurpose materials as they are.\"\nWe need more research on the topic before ensuring its feasibility. But it could, for example, be paired with other existing building methods. Two examples are prefabrication and nomad architecture which uses support structures that can be repeatedly assembled and disassembled. “In our lab, we’re focusing on the support structures used for buildings because conventional structures – between their foundations and roofs – account for most of the eventual waste.”\nElastic gridshell\nAfter some trial and error with various materials – fishing rods came up short in terms of their mechanical properties and supply – they settled on skis. Like many other types of sports equipment, skis are technological wonders. Fivet says: “Skis typically bring together extensive technical refinements and, even if they’ve outlived their original purpose, should be reused.”\nOne aspect of the project was to determine the structural potential of skis for their new purpose. They had to be flexible in one direction and rigid in the other. They also had to be able to withstand applied loads and perform consistently over time.\n“We tested all types of skis – downhill, slalom, cross-country and freeride – and placed them at strategic points of the pavilion depending on their properties,” says Sofia Colabella, another researcher on the project. “Skis, which are made from high-tech materials, turned out to be almost better than wood, which is more commonly used in this type of structure.”\nColabella specializes in elastic gridshells, which are as flexible as metallic netting but become as stiff as a shell when fastened in place. The trick lies in arranging the individual components in two directions, so that they become a very flexible grid of rectangles. The grid is first built flat on the ground, and then the edges of the grid are pulled in. Because the individual modules are flexible, the center of the grid consequently arches upward. Once the structure has obtained its final shape, it is held in place by attaching other components diagonally in certain spots. This makes it stable and stiff. This structure can be used to cover a large area with small components, and it doesn’t require complicated tools or a formwork.\nHeaded for Lyon this summer\nThe researchers’ nomad pavilion is made out of 210 skis and held in place by 300 bolts – less than a hundred of which are needed for the reassembly. This project was selected for the \nBiennale Architecture Lyon\n, where it will be on display starting this June. The researchers hope to be able to set up their pavilion in different, popular areas of the city over the course of the event.\n“Our goal isn’t to make buildings out of skis. It’s to show that we can use uncontrolled and uncontrollable materials with a sufficient level of confidence in the structure’s safety and performance. It’s an exercise, a manifesto, that shows there are some interesting things to be done in this relatively unexplored field,” says Fivet.\nCorentin Fivet (project investigator), Sofia Colabella (gridshell designer and worksite manager), Bernardino D'Amico (engineering consultant), Claude-Alain Jacot (construction), Jan Brütting (construction), Valeria Didonna (construction), Endrit Hoxha (Life-cycle analysis)", "summary": "Could recovered materials play a key role in tomorrow’s civil engineering?

{"id": 878, "text": "Leprosy is a chronic infection of the skin, peripheral nerves, eyes and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, affecting over a quarter million people worldwide. Its symptoms can be gruesome and devastating, as the bacteria reduce sensitivity in the body, resulting in skin lesions, nerve damage and disabilities. Until recently, leprosy was attributed to a single bacterium,\n Mycobacterium leprae\n; we now suspect that its close relative, \nMycobacterium lepromatosis\n, might cause a rare but severe form of leprosy. EPFL scientists have analyzed for the first time the complete genome of \nM. lepromatosis\n, and compared it to that of the major leprosy-causing bacterium. Published in \nPNAS\n, the study reveals the origin and evolutionary history of both bacteria, and offers new insights into their biology, global distribution, and possibly treatment.\nAlong with its mutilating symptoms, leprosy also carries a stigma, turning patients into social outcasts. Although we have been able to push back the disease with antibiotics, leprosy remains endemic in many developing countries today.\nLeprosy can manifest itself in various forms, all thought to be caused by the bacterium \nM. leprae\n. But in 2008, a study showed considerable evidence that another species of bacterium, \nM. lepromatosis\n, causes a distinct and aggressive form of the disease called “diffuse lepromatous leprosy”, found in Mexico and the Caribbean.\nStudying the genome of \nM. lepromatosis\n The lab of Stewart Cole at EPFL’s Global Health Institute carried out a genome-wide investigation on \nM. lepromatosis\n. This complex and computer-heavy technique looks at the bacterium’s entire DNA, locating its genes along the sequence. Because \nM. lepromatosis\n cannot be grown in the lab and animal models for this version of leprosy do not exist yet, the scientists used an infected skin sample from a patient in Mexico to obtain the bacterium’s genetic material.\nAfter extracting the DNA from the entire sample, the researchers had to separate the bacterial DNA from the patient’s. To do this, they used two genetic techniques: one that increased the bacterium’s DNA and another that decreased the human DNA. With the bacterium’s DNA isolated, the researchers were able to sequence it and read it. Once they had the complete sequence of the bacterium’s genome, they were able to compare it with the known genome of \nM. leprae\n, the bacterium responsible for the majority of leprosy cases.\nThe study found that the two species of bacteria are very closely related. The comparative genomics analysis could “backtrack” the history of their genes, and showed that the two bacteria have diverged 13.9 million years ago from a common ancestor with a similar genome structure, and possibly a similar lifestyle. That ancestor suffered a process known as “gene decay”, where over a long period of time and multiple generations, a large number of genes mutated, became non-functional, and eventually disappeared. The study showed that the two new species continued to lose genes but from different regions of their genomes, indicating that during their evolution they occupied different biological roles and mechanisms to ensure survival.\nCole’s team also conducted a study on over two hundred skin samples from leprosy patients in Asia, Africa, and the Americas to determine the geographic distribution of \nM. lepromatosis\n. The results showed that the bacterium is relatively scarce, and seems to be restricted to patients in Mexico. In contrast, the major leprosy-causing bacterium \nM. leprae\n is widespread across the world.\nThe study also discovered that \nM. lepromatosis\n has retained the genes needed to infect cells of the nervous system called Schwann cells. These produce protective sheaths that wrap around the axons of peripheral neurons. Although Schwann cell infection is a hallmark of \nM. leprae\n leprosy, the presence of related genes in M. lepromatosis means that this bacterium could also be attacking these cells. This will become clearer in future investigations, facilitated in part by the resources generated by this work.\nThis genome-wide comparative study offers new and deeper insights into the biology of \nM. lepromatosis\n.

{"id": 880, "text": "The mission of E2SWITCH will be to develop an ultra-low power electronic system based on Tunnel FET (TFET) heterostructures built on silicon substrates and exploiting a phenomenon of quantum mechanics for operating at voltages up to five times lower than those of the current standard mobile phone circuit. This is a real challenge, especially in light of the explosive growth in independent functions expected for portable devices of the future. The EPFL is coordinating this new European research project, which involves not only six universities and research institutes, but also the companies IBM, CCS and SCIPROM. The project has been funded for up to 4.3 million euros over 42 months.\n\"Our objective is to make the next generation of transistors, which can still operate at voltages below 0.3 Volts and even as low as 0.1V,\" explained Adrian Ionescu, an EPFL professor and the coordinator of E2SWITCH. At this time, the scaling of the threshold voltage impacts not only the autonomy and energy consumption of electronic appliances, but also their compatibility with new technologies for rechargeable batteries and integrated energy harvesters.\nMobile devices of the type 'smart-hub' (e.g. smart phone or smart watch) will of course be the first components to take advantage of such optimized electronics, which minimize thermal dissipation. But the issue goes beyond this. \"Between 125 and 150 degrees, digital circuits begin to lose their functionality. However, our new technology will not only consume less energy, but will be more stable over a wider temperature range, opening the possibility for more robust applications in the automotive and aerospace fields,\" says the researcher.\n\"Cambridge CMOS sensors (CCS) realises the need for ultra-low power, low voltage sensors solution for future wearable, smartphone and automotive applications. Our core technology is based on CMOS process, and working on E2SWITCH project will promote a natural transition to beyond CMOS technology, where this project will enable us to design ultra-low voltage gas sensing platform devices, and experiment with basic building blocks using TFET solutions to demonstrate low voltage sensor signal conditioning circuits for either gas or temperature sensing applications.\" says Foysol Chowdhury, Director of R & D Projects at Cambridge CMOS Sensors Ltd.\nAnother area that will benefit from this new technology are future computing systems also for cloud and big data applications - huge banks of servers, which represent a growing proportion of global electricity costs - which in the long run could benefit greatly from more energy-efficient technologies. This is one of the key points that motivated IBM to join the consortium.\n“Power dissipation is a fundamental challenge for nanoelectronic circuits. Within E2SWITCH we aim to significantly reduce the power consumption of electronics by researching TFETs based on III-V heterostructure nanowires with wrap-around gate and directly integrated on standard silicon substrates.” says Dr. Heike Riel, IBM Fellow, IBM Research - Zurich.\nOn the academic side, E2SWITCH brings together EPFL, the Universities of Udine and Bologna (Italy), IMEC (Belgium), Forschungszentrum Jülich (Germany), Lund University (Sweden) and ETH Zurich (Switzerland). E2SWITCH is funded under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development of the European Union.

During these four days, 2,300 high school students, mostly from western Switzerland, came to get a clearer picture of courses offered at EPFL.\nWhile the first day focused on fields of study, the second gave the opportunity to young people to immerse themselves in the heart of chosen departments. Two days, indeed, were not too much to make this important decision. According to Maya Fruehauf, who was responsible for organizing this open house for the Department for the Promotion of Education: “The goal is to attract new students who have consciously chosen and who will then begin their studies with strong motivation.”\nThe number of students attending the sessions generally reflects the proportion entering these sections in the first year: architecture and life sciences are the most popular. The number of visitors during these days has been relatively stable for the past three years, consistently exceeding 2,000 visitors, and with a significant percentage of girls (35%).\nOne of the highlights of the day, apparently much appreciated by students, remains the reception in the Rolex Learning Center. The information stands for each department, now gathered in the hall of the SG building, give the chance to create bridges to facilitate discussions between the visitors and students or scientists. EPFL students lead guided tours of small groups to discover the campus.\nThe second day allows the more motivated, which comprise more than 80% of the participants, to become immersed in the atmosphere of a class session, to attend workshops, and meets specialists. Experimenting, seeing the laboratories, asking questions about the material being taught – the second day is all about giving these potential students a “hands on” experience.\n“Statistics of previous years show that half of new students feel that this campus visit determined their choice,” says Maya Fruehauf.

{"id": 882, "text": "Shipping vaccines in an unbroken temperature-controlled supply chain (a “cold chain”) all the way to recipients is a major logistical and financial challenge in remote areas and developing countries. According to Doctors Without Borders, the need to keep vaccines within a temperature range of 2-8°C is one of the main factors behind low immunization-coverage rates.\nResearchers at EPFL’s Supramolecular Nanomaterials and Interfaces Laboratory (SUNMIL), in collaboration with scientists in Milan, Turin, Leiden, and Oregon, have come up with three simple and inexpensive vaccine additives to get around this obstacle. Using minute quantities of nanoparticles, or FDA-approved polymer (polyethylene glycol), or higher amounts of sucrose, they were able to stabilize vaccines at room temperature for several weeks or, in some cases, months. Their approach, which was successfully tested on a vaccine for rodents, is published in \nNature Communications\n.\nNanoparticles, polymers and sugar\n The study addressed viral-vector vaccines, the most common type of vaccine, which normally only last for a few days at room temperature. At that point, the viral components of the vaccines lose their structural integrity. “These components fluctuate by their very nature,” says Stellacci, head of SUNMIL - Constellium Chair. “They are combined in a stable form, and the low temperature maintains that balance. But the thermally induced fluctuations eventually lead to a loss of integrity of the viral vector.” The scientists’ approach, which consists of stabilizing the vaccines against such fluctuations through simple biocompatible additives, has delivered excellent results.\nIn their first approach, osmotic pressure is applied on the inactivated viruses (the main component of the vaccine) using a cloud of negatively charged nanoparticles. The virus is already subject to an outward osmotic pressure due to its genetic material (RNA or DNA), which has a high negative charge and is held inside the virus. The nanoparticles form a cloud of negatively charged objects that cannot enter the virus, thus generating counter-osmotic pressure that keeps the virus intact. “With this method, infectivity for a virus reached a half-life of 20 days,” says Stellacci.\nThe second approach consists in stiffening the virus’s capsid, which envelops the inactivated virus, by adding polymers. This additive mainly stabilizes the virus by slowing its oscillations by changing the stiffness of the capsid. As a result, the vaccine remained fully intact for 20 days with an estimated half-life of ~70 days.\nFinally, adding sucrose, a common sugar, to the vaccine makes the environment more viscous and slows down fluctuations. “It’s a little like adding honey, where all motion is slowed down,” says Stellacci. With this third approach, 85% of the vaccine's properties were intact after 70 days.\nTests on the Chikungunya virus\n Using these results, the researchers applied their methods to a vaccine that is currently in development. They were able to stabilize a vaccine against Chikungunya, a tropical virus, for 10 days, and then successfully inoculated mice with it. “The next step will be to run more extensive tests on specific vaccines, possibly combining the three different approaches.”\nCheaper access\n This study could really impact the effort to increase immunization coverage. Currently, in areas where electricity and refrigeration are limited, vaccines are moved from one refrigerated space to the next and then delivered to recipients in coolers. This complicated process accounts for nearly 80% of the cost of vaccination programs. And that, up until now, has been a significant impediment.\nSource:\n M. Pelliccia, P. Andreozzi, J. Paulose, M.

{"id": 883, "text": "After nearly two years of work, “Project Matterhorn,” designed by the thirty students from the EPFL Rocket Team, is ready to compete at the 2018 Spaceport America Cup, which will be held from 19 to 23 June in the New Mexico desert. This competition, which pits teams from universities around the globe against each other, is still not very well known on this side of the Atlantic. This year, only two European teams will take part, one from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) and one from EPFL. Last year, students from these two schools and the School of Business and Engineering Vaud (HEIG-VD) competed together as one team and came in eighth out of the 116 teams taking part.\nFor the competition, teams have to design, build and launch a rocket that can reach a set altitude as accurately as possible. Teams are also evaluated on the ingenuity of their design and the relevance of their payload – a requirement for every rocket. “We’re entered in the 10k commercial category – the one in which the most teams are competing – with an off-the-shelf engine,” says François Martin-Monier, head of sponsoring and advertising for the EPFL Rocket Team.\nA high-tech design\nThe rocket is 2.70 meters long and weighs over 20 kilos. It has a diameter of just 120 mm, so it’s very compact – which meant the students had to overcome a number of engineering challenges just to fit in all the components needed to make the rocket work. The rocket will be launched using solid propellants for four seconds, and the remainder of the flight will be ballistic. “We chose an engine that will take the rocket up to about 500 meters above the target altitude,” says Martin-Monier, who is studying mechanical engineering. “The onboard computer will then deploy the airbrakes to correct the trajectory in order to get as close to an altitude of 3,000 meters as possible. We’ll have to adapt to the conditions on the day, particularly the temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind.”\nFor the payload, the EPFL students chose to integrate a muon detector into their rocket. Equipped with its own recovery system, the device was designed to detect enough muons to calculate the speed at which the probe descends. The rocket’s parachute system is also unique: “Most teams use two parachutes, one to slow the rocket’s initial descent and a second one that is released just before the rocket reaches the ground to stop it cold,” explains Martin-Monier. “We’ve brought all that together in one parachute. At an altitude of 250 meters, a rope system will expand the parachute’s surface area.”\nMore than 70 hours of sewing went into making the different versions of the parachute.©Jonathan Burkhard\nAssistance from the experts\nSince the project began in October 2016, experts from various parts of EPFL have helped the team, including the physics and mechanical engineering departments, the Space Engineering Center (e-Space) and the Swiss Space Center. “Their support has been very useful – they’ve lent us lab equipment, helped us check our calculations and given us constructive feedback on our ideas,” says Martin-Monier. There were even some Bachelor’s and Master’s semester projects relating to the rocket. More than one hundred credits have been awarded because of the project.\nAnd what about 2019?

Then, as if by magic, darker spots begin to form in the small, spinning container until, barely half a minute later, the finished product takes shape. This groundbreaking 3D-printing method, developed by researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Applied Photonics Devices (LAPD), can be used to make tiny objects with unprecedented precision and resolution – all in record time. The team has published its findings in the journal Nature Communications, and a spin-off, Readily3D, has been set up to develop and market the system.\nThe technology could have innovative applications in a wide range of fields, but its advantages over existing methods – the ability to print solid parts of different textures – make it ideally suited for medicine and biology. The process could be used, for instance, to make soft objects such as tissue, organs, hearing aids and mouthguards.\n“Conventional 3D printing techniques, known as additive manufacturing, build parts layer by layer,” explains Damien Loterie, the CEO of Readily3D. “The problem is that soft objects made that way quickly fall apart.” What’s more, the process can be used to make delicate cell-laden scaffolds in which cells can develop in a pressure-free 3D environment. The researchers teamed up with a surgeon to test 3D-printed arteries made using the technique. “The trial results were extremely encouraging,” says Loterie.\nHardened by light\nThe new technique draws on the principles of tomography, a method used mainly in medical imaging to build a model of an object based on surface scans.\nThe printer works by sending a laser through the translucent gel – either a biological gel or liquid plastic, as required. “It’s all about the light,” explains Paul Delrot, Readily3D’s CTO. “The laser hardens the liquid through a process of polymerization. Depending on what we’re building, we use algorithms to calculate exactly where we need to aim the beams, from what angles, and at what dose.”\nThe system is currently capable of making two-centimeter structures with a precision of 80 micrometers, about the same as the diameter of a strand of hair. But as the team develops new devices, they should be able to build much bigger objects, potentially up to 15 centimeters. “The process could also be used to quickly build small silicone or acrylic parts that don’t need finishing after printing,” says Christophe Moser, who heads the LAPD.

{"id": 907, "text": "For three weeks now, some 40 Swiss students have been in Colorado for the Solar Decathlon, an international competition organized every two years by the US Department of Energy. Universities from around the globe compete against each other to design and build a functional and innovative solar-powered house. It's a decathlon, so there are ten categories to compete in: architecture, market potential, engineering, communications, innovation, water, health and comfort, appliances, home life, and finally, energy. The team that earns the most points wins the competition. The first results will start coming in on 12 October, and the winner will be announced two days later.\nThe Swiss project, called NeighborHub, is a neighborhood house built by students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design, and the University of Fribourg. There are now just a few days left before this three-year-long adventure comes to an end, and the tension, fatigue and excitement building among the students near Denver Airport, where the competition is being held, is palpable.\n\"Who put away the bar for closing the facades? Can someone give the mechanical room a wipedown? Where are those gold flat-head screws? We need Benoît’s arms…and his raincoat! Has anyone seen my green shoes? Pizza party at 1pm @site or @hotel. Muddy day... AGAIN!\" Reading through the Swiss team's WhatsApp group messages shows just how difficult their mission is: they have to organize the on-site teams day and night, manage the ups and downs of extreme weather conditions, sort out meals, and buy urgent supplies on the other side of town. And those are just a few of their many tasks.\nThe competition's tight construction schedule leaves little room for error. So everything has to work like Swiss clockwork, even though the young students are not used to the vast open spaces of Colorado. In the event of a crisis, however, there are six experienced supervisors on hand, some of whom have been helping out since the start of the project and who have already been involved in other pioneering initiatives, such as the Alinghi sailing team and the Solar Impulse plane.\nRainy and cold\n Over the nine days the team had to build NeighborHub, they were on site every morning at 7 o’clock sharp. This Swiss punctuality, which drew the attention of the organizers, meant the team managed to finish building their house on time. Their Swiss precision was also on display when they assembled their solar house. Other teams arrived on site with a house in two or three parts. NeighborHub, however, crossed the Atlantic in a dozen containers, and the students had to rebuild this complex puzzle piece by piece, despite the heavy rain and biting cold. For the students, who on some days arrived back at their hotel rooms exhausted and covered from head to foot in mud, the construction phase was almost certainly one of the greatest challenges of this entire experience.\nOriginal and radical\n Once they finished building their house, the students got to check out the other ten projects. The engineering students, most of whom are from EPFL, went from house to house inspecting their competitors' mechanical rooms with curiosity, while the architecture students were more interested in aspects such as space, light and ambiance. By viewing the other projects, the Swiss Solar Decathletes realized just how original and radical their project is. Their ten competitors all put solar panels on the roof, while the Swiss team integrated photovoltaic and thermal solar panels into NeighborHub’s structure by installing them on the facade. This unique approach cannot go unnoticed: day and night, these shiny panels make NeighborHub stand out from the other houses. What's more, the Swiss project is an educational neighborhood center designed to provide information and advice on the environment – it is not an individual home, which is what the other teams opted for.\nAlready a victory\n And what do people think about NeighborHub? \"We weren't sure whether the American public would like our project, but the people who visited the house during the construction phase and the public viewings were really curious about and interested in our concept. We're very proud that NeighborHub has gotten such positive feedback,\" says Samuel Cotture, the Swiss team’s leader and recent EPFL graduate in mechanical engineering. Nobody dares speculate about who will win, because all the projects are unique (see box). But Cotture is unconcerned: \"Just being here in Denver and presenting the house we've been dreaming of for all these years to the Americans is a victory in itself.\" Simply taking part in Solar Decathlon was no mean feat: out of the 16 candidates, only 11 teams were able to get the backing and sponsors needed to make their project work.\nGuided tours\n A number of hurdles still await the Swiss team before the competition is over: they have to make sure the hot water and the household appliances are working to show that the house is functional, and they have to organize a games evening and drive the electrical car that goes with the house 45km every day. So the Swiss team’s WhatsApp group won’t be going quiet anytime soon.\nAs their final task, the students have to conduct guided tours for the general public every day up until the end of the competition on 15 October. People can also visit the exhibitions that have been organized on the theme of solar-powered houses. Through Solar Decathlon, the US Department of Energy seeks to demonstrate the potential of solar energy to its citizens and raise their awareness of sustainable living. NeighborHub has been a dream come true for around 250 Swiss students, who have in some way been involved in the adventure over the last three years. But will it be enough to win over the jury? We'll find out in just a few days.\nTen adversaries\n Survival, Sinatra, React, Rise, Enable, Silo, Beach, Selficient, Crete House, Our House. These are the names of the ten very different projects competing against NeighborHub. While some have focused on hurricane or earthquake resistance, others seek to demonstrate how to manage water during a drought. Their target users vary as well. Some offer a modular space suitable for a young couple, while others are designed as homes for retirees in Colorado or a family looking for a cheap place to live in a downtown area. The Swiss team is up against nine US projects and a Dutch one.", "summary": "The Swiss students who went to Denver to compete in this year’s Solar Decathlon are living out their dream.

{"id": 909, "text": "Have you ever gone ahead and eaten that piece of chocolate, despite yourself?\nDo you inadvertently make decisions because you are hungry or cold? In other words, does the brain’s processing of internal bodily signals interfere with your ability to act freely?\nThis line of thinking is at the heart of research that questions our ability to act on thoughts of free will. We already know that inner body signals, like the heartbeat, affect our mental states, can be used to reduce the perception of pain and are of fundamental importance for .\nThanks to a new discovery, it turns out that these inner body signals do indeed affect acts of volition.\nScientists at EPFL in Switzerland have shown that you are more likely to initiate a voluntary decision as you exhale. Published in today’s issue of Nature Communications, these findings propose a new angle on an almost 60-year-old neuroscientific debate about free will and the involvement of the human brain.\n“We show that voluntary action is indeed linked to your body’s inner state, especially with breathing and expiration but not with some other bodily signals, such as the heartbeat,” explains Olaf Blanke, EPFL’s Foundation Bertarelli Chair in Cognitive Neuroprosthetics and senior author.\nAt the center of these results is the readiness potential (RP), a signal of brain activity observed in the human cortex that appears not only before voluntary muscle movement, but also before one becomes aware of the intention to move. The RP is the signature of voluntary action since it consistently appears in brain activity measurements right before acts of free will (like being aware that one wants to reach for the chocolate).\nInterpretations of the RP have been debated for decades. Some interpret the RP to show that free will is an illusion, since the RP precedes the conscious experience of free will. It seems to show that the brain commits to a decision (chocolate) before we are even consciously aware of having made that decision. [See box The readiness potential and interpretations.] \nThe readiness potential and interpretations\nPhilosophers, psychologists, and more recently neuroscientists have long debated our ability to act freely. The meaning of the readiness potential (RP) has been questioned ever since its discovery by neuroscientists Hans Helmut Kornhuber and Lüder Deecke in 1965, and later regarding its relation to free will in neuroscientist Benjamin Libet’s experiments. \nThe entire brain consists of approximately 100 billion neurons, and each individual neuron transmits electrical signals as the brain works. Electrodes placed on the head can measure the collective electrical activity of the brain’s neurons, seen as wavy lines called an electroencephalogram (EEG).\nIn 1965, neuroscientists Hans Helmut Kornhuber and Lüder Deecke conducted a seminal experiment to test voluntary action and discovered a recurring pattern of brain activity. They placed EEG electrodes on top of the subject’s head, and asked the subject to press a button at will. Kornhuber and Deecke discovered that the EEG consistently exhibited a rising slope of wavy lines, the readiness potential, 1 second or more before voluntary movement.\nIn the early 1980s, neuroscientist Benjamin Libet further tested the relationship between the RP and conscious awareness or intention of voluntary action. His highly influential results showed that approximately 200ms before his subjects pressed the button, they were aware of an urge or the intention to act, something Libet referred to as the W time, and yet the RP consistently preceded W time.\nLibet suggested that these findings showed that even before we make a conscious decision of voluntary action, the brain was already unconsciously activated and involved in planning the action.\nSome have interpreted the relation between the RP and W time as an indication that human free will might be an illusion. The RP is viewed as the brain committing to a decision (to press the button) before the subject is even aware of having made that decision. If commitment to a decision is being made before we are even aware of it, then what mechanism is making the decision for us?\nFor the neuroscientist who considers consciousness to arise from brain activity (versus brain activity arising from consciousness), Libet’s results may not surprising, since the conscious experience of free will is viewed as an emergent phenomenon of brain activity.\nYet, Libet’s results are in conflict with the notion of free will and voluntary action in philosophy of the mind, in folk psychology, in culture, and in legal matters.\nMore recently, it was suggested that the RP could be an artefact of measurement, potentially putting free will back into our command. But if we take on the view that our conscious decisions arise from a cascade of firing neurons, then the origin of the RP may actually provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to voluntary action and free will. The way the brain’s neurons work together to come to a decision is still poorly understood. [See  unveiled by higher dimensional algebraic topology.] Our conscious experience of free will, our ability to make decisions freely, may then be intricately wired to the rest of our body. [See box Acts of free will and inner states of the body]\nThe EPFL results suggest that the origin of the RP is linked to breathing, providing a new perspective on experiences of free will: the regular cycle of breathing is part of the mechanism that leads to conscious decision-making and acts of free will. Moreover, we are more likely to initiate voluntary movements as we exhale. (Did you reach for that piece of chocolate during an exhale?)\nActs of free will and inner states of the body\nThe prevailing view in neuroscience is that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon of the brain. Firing of the brain’s neurons leads to consciousness and the feeling of free will or voluntary action. By belonging to the physical universe, the brain’s electrical activity within the constraints of anatomy, is subject to the laws of physics. In this sense, brain signals encoding the body, lungs and heart might naturally affect the brain’s cognitive states too and therefore influence acts of free will.\nTo test whether the RP depends on the body’s inner state and the brain’s representation thereof, Blanke and colleagues asked 52 subjects to press a button at will at Campus Biotech in Geneva. EEGs monitored brain activity, a belt around the chest measured breathing activity and cardiac activity was recorded. \nThe scientists found that the RP and voluntary action (pressing the button) is linked to the body’s inner state – the regular breathing cycle – but not to the heartbeat. Participants initiated voluntary movements more frequently during an exhale than an inhale and were completely unaware of this breathing-action coupling. The RP was also modulated depending on the breathing cycle.\nEPFL scientist and first author of the study Hyeong-Dong Park explains, “The RP no longer corresponds only to cortical activity ‘unconsciously preparing’ voluntary action. The RP, at least partly, reflects respiration-related cortical processing that is coupled to voluntary action. More generally, it further suggests that higher-level motor control, such as voluntary action, is shaped or affected by the involuntary and cyclic motor act of our internal body organs, in particular the lungs. Still the precise neural activity that controls breathing remains to be mapped.”\nThese findings suggest that the breathing pattern may be used to predict ‘when’ people begin voluntary action. Your breathing patterns could also be used to predict consumer behavior, like when you click on that button. Medical devices that use brain-computer interfaces could be tuned and improved according to breathing. The breathing-action coupling could be used in research and diagnostic tools for patients with deficits in voluntary action control, like obsessive compulsive disorders, Parkinson disease, and Tourette syndromes. Blanke and Hyeong-Dong Park, first author of this research, have filed a patent based on these findings.\nFree will hijacked by interoceptive signals?\nMore generally, the EPFL findings suggest that acts of free will are affected by signals from other systems of the body. Succumbing to that urge to eat chocolate may depend more on your body’s internal signals than you may realize!\nBlanke elaborates, “That voluntary action, an internally or self-generated action, is coupled with an interoceptive signal, breathing, may be just one example of how acts of free will are hostage to a host of inner body states and the brain’s processing of these internal signals. Interestingly, such signals have also been shown to be of relevance for self-consciousness.”\nYou may be tempted to blame acts of chocolate binging on interoceptive electrical signals hijacking your free will. The gut-mind connection is an active field of research and interoceptive messages sent to the brain certainly impact food cravings. For now, this latest EPFL research only improves predictions of when you will indulge in that craving, and not what you actually crave.", "summary": "Is free will just an illusion?

{"id": 917, "text": "40,000,000,000,000,000 neutrinos pass through the human body every second. They are so small that they almost never interact with the matter around us. And yet, being able to detect them would give us extremely valuable information about the universe and the objects it is made of. Consequently, the international scientific community decided to build IceCube, the Antarctica observatory with the goal of improving the observation of neutrinos.\nEPFL’s Laboratory for High Energy Physics (LPHE), and in particular astroparticle physicists, took part in this fascinating adventure, with the construction work being completed on December 18, 2010. Located at the pole of the earth, this innovative detector is dedicated to the study of the fundamental properties of particles, whose origin describes the most spectacular phenomena of the universe, such as supernovae or gamma-ray bursts.\n“In the last five years, during the short austral summer season, 86 bore holes of a depth of 2500m were drilled and equipped with 5000 optical detection modules. These modules are the “eyes” of the IceCube detector, which observes one cubic kilometer of ice near the geographic South Pole”, explains Mathieu Ribordy, professor at the LPHE.\nIceCube uses the Cerenkov effect, the equivalent of the supersonic bang for light. The latter moves at a speed of about 300,000 km/s in space, but slower in material media. As a result, along the trajectory of charged particles, which travel faster than light in the material media, a luminous bluish flash is emitted. This flash is visible by detectors within a one-hundred meter range in the very pure ice of the South Pole. This is how we are able to materialize the passage of a charged particle after interaction with a neutrino. The ice in the depths of Antarctica presents the advantage of being transparent and exceptionally clean, as well as having low radioactivity, which enables us to avoid certain types of interference during observation. It is therefore the ideal candidate for a neutrino observatory.\n“Even if the number of neutrinos which reach the earth is prodigious, those which interact with the ice and cause a Cerenkov effect are rare. In order to put all the odds in our favor, we have built a huge detector measuring one cubic kilometer; that is one billion tons of ice. And in spite of this gigantic size, we still only observe 300 flashes a day. Yet it’s a record!”, adds Mathieu Ribordy.\nWith a detector as sensitive as IceCube, scientists at last hope to observe neutrinos from sources located beyond the sun, and thus better understand the universe surrounding us. It will be mainly a question of determining the nature of dark matter and to at last understand the origin of cosmic rays.\nLink:", "summary": "Ten years will have been required to set up the world’s largest neutrino observatory.

{"id": 919, "text": "Stand up. Take a few steps. Change direction. Climb some steps. Navigate around an object on the ground. Sit back down. Most people take these everyday movements for granted, but for people with paraplegia, they’re simply impossible. All that may change now thanks to an exoskeleton called TWIICE. This is a walking assist device that was developed entirely at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory (LSRO). It will be used at the 2016 Cybathlon – the first competition for disabled athletes who use various assistive technologies – which will take place on 8 October in Zurich. EPFL’s team, called PolyWalk EPFL, will square off against eight other teams in the Powered Exoskeleton category. Silke Pan, a handcycle athlete, will pilot the device.\nOne of TWIICE's main advantages is that it’s light. Because the device weighs only 14 kilos – it consists mainly of composite materials – it easily becomes one with the user. The hip and knee joints are flexed and extended by two electric motors per leg, and the exoskeleton's charge lasts for three hours. The device can bear the entire weight of the user, who nevertheless needs crutches to maintain balance and a steady gait. There are buttons in the handles to actuate steps and set the pace: fast walk, slow walk, climb steps, stop, etc.\n“Our goal is to make the vertical world accessible to handicapped people,” said Mohamed Bouri, a group leader at the LSRO and the project supervisor. “In several years, it will undoubtedly be common to see people in exoskeletons standing up and walking around outside or in stores.”\nAn expert at the controls\nThe device is not yet ready for daily use by the general public. But after a year and a half of work, the researchers have come up with a prototype that is both safe and operational enough for testing and for use in a competition. “At this point, the pilot needs a lot of strength, stability and concentration to handle it, since each step is controlled manually,” said Jemina Fasola, a PhD student in bioengineering.\nThat’s why the team called in an expert, Silke Pan, to pilot their device at the Cybathlon. Pan is a former acrobat who was left paraplegic following a trapeze accident. She’s not averse to taking up physical challenges – she’s now a handcycle athlete with several victories under her belt. She trained several times per week starting this past summer, familiarizing herself with the device and getting more adept at piloting it. She also helped improve the user experience through the position of the control buttons and appropriate gait cycle times.\nAdapting to all body types\nIn the future, the researchers will work on making the exoskeleton even lighter, more ergonomic and easier to control. It will have built-in walking programs so that users won’t have to control every step and so that the motions will become more fluid and natural. “We came up with a very flexible production method,” said Tristan Vouga, a PhD student in microengineering and the person behind the concept. “It makes it easy to produce exoskeletons that can fit different body types and work with different handicaps.”", "summary": "Thanks to an exoskeleton developed at EPFL, people with paraplegia can stand up, walk and even climb steps.

{"id": 924, "text": "A dual-propeller propulsion system gives Flybotix’s drone unmatched flight time and very low noise levels. An initial prototype was unveiled in the summer of 2019. The finished product is fitted with a custom-designed ultra-flat motor developed in partnership with Maxon, a major company located in EPFL’s Innovation Park. The new drone is being presented today, online, at Xponential, the world's largest trade show for unmanned and autonomous systems. Flybotix is planning a market launch in early 2021.\nTwenty minutes’ flying time and flat motors\nCurrently, drones that are small enough to maneuver in tight spaces like ducts can stay airborne only for about ten minutes. To save energy and extend flight time, Flybotix’s drone has been fitted with a propulsion system that is similar to the one used on helicopters, which have unparalleled aerodynamic performance. Because the bulky mechanical stabilization system is replaced with algorithms, the flight time is twice as long.\nEngineers had to redesign the motor’s shape in order to superimpose the twin propellers and free up space for payloads. EPFL's Innovation Park is home to more than 200 start-ups as well as many branches of large companies, putting them in close proximity to EPFL’s fast-paced and flourishing innovation community. A partnership with one of the large companies, Maxon, whose parent company is based in Obwalden, produced the customized motor. “The stationary portion of the gear system has been inverted. This enabled us to flatten it, leaving more space between the propellers,” says Olivier Chappuis, head of miLab, Maxon’s innovation lab at EPFL. Combining Maxon's expertise in motors with Flybotix’s creative energy led to the rapid development of the advanced propulsion system. “We get a great deal out of working with start-ups. They need new systems developed in record time, which spurs us to innovate more quickly. And our findings can be used in other applications too,” says Chappuis.\nLike a turtle flipped on its back\nThe new drone includes a number of other innovations, such as a patented cage system that allows it to navigate through obstacles and right itself when upside down. This system – inspired by turtles – triggers a pendulum movement; the inverted drone rocks back and forth for a few seconds until the swinging movement returns it to an upright position.\nDespite the pandemic, 2020 was a productive year for Flybotix. The firm raised CHF 1.5 million in investments, enabling it to expand its headcount from four to ten people. Its drone is now ready for commercial production and will be assembled in Switzerland. One of the first applications will be monitoring hazardous sites or inaccessible locations. Other start-ups in the region are also developing drones with similar applications and characteristics. “We are aware of them, they represent a model of success for Swiss startups,\" says Samir Bouabdallah, CEO of Flybotix.

Four EPFL spin-offs made it into the top ten: Bestmile, Lunaphore, Flyability and Gamaya. This marks the eighth year of the Awards, which are organized by startup.ch in order to highlight the country’s most promising young tech companies. The winners receive no monetary reward but get a considerable boost to their reputation and visibility.\nA platform for managing fleets of self-driving cars \nBestmile (#7 last year) developed a platform that lets transportation operators manage autonomous vehicles alongside conventional ones, while ensuring pedestrian safety. Its cloud-based platform uses a series of smart algorithms that allow users to manage car fleets, optimize vehicle use, provide fixed-route and on-demand services, and even monitor power consumption.\nThe company was established in 2014, and this year raised €10 million in funding that will be used to roll out its platform in dense urban areas in Japan, Dubai and Singapore. Bestmile was also named one of the 2018 Technology Pioneers at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nFaster and more reliable tumor diagnoses \nLunaphore, also founded in 2014, provides a microfluidic system that enables fast, reliable diagnoses of tumor cells. The company hopes to drastically increase the number of biomarker tests that can be carried out for each type of tumor. In August it completed a CHF 5.3 million fundraising round, on the heels of a CHF 6 million round in 2017; the proceeds will be used to help launch its first product on the market.\nTwo other EPFL spin-offs were in the top ten: Gamaya and Flyability. The former makes a hyperspectral camera that can be used with a drone and special software to detect the condition of farmers’ crops and suggest targeted treatments. The latter has developed a drone with a unique lightweight cage around it that lets it bounce off obstacles rather than avoiding them. That means Flyability’s drones can explore areas that are dangerous or impossible for humans to reach. Both startups have carried out several successful fundraising rounds.\nMore women in the C-Suite \nAs mentioned in the official press release, this year more women appear in the winning startups’ management teams. In fact, every one of the top three startups – including Bestmile and Lunaphore – was co-founded by a woman.\nThe winning startups – which must be less than five years old – were chosen by a panel of 100 investors and startup experts. Each panel member drew up a list of his or her ten favorite firms based on their market potential, and gave ten points to the top firm on the list, nine points to the second firm on the list, and so on. The points assigned by all the panel members were added up to come up with the final ranking.

The trip will consist of several flights, day and night. Two pilots, Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg will be alternating at the controls. They are expected to fly over Burma and the Great Wall of China, before crossing the Pacific Ocean, the United States and the Atlantic Ocean. A dozen stages have been planned, including Varanasi in India, Nanjing in China, Hawaii and Phoenix in the Americas. The last phase will take place in Southern Europe and North Africa before returning to the starting point at around the end of July or the beginning of August 2015.\nSolar Impulse, designed to fly for five days and five nights in a row without a single drop of fuel, brings together the most innovative technologies in energy and materials. EPFL was the project’s scientific advisor and has been involved in its development from the outset in 2003. All in all, around twenty EPFL laboratories and centers have been involved in diverse areas of the project such as virtual representation, solar power, embedded electronics or man-machine relationship.\n For instance, EPFL provided its support for the selection of some composite materials or sandwich structures aiming to lighten the weight of the aircraft’s general structure. It also performed load tests on prototype elements of the wing structures to allow the Solar Impulse engineers check their resistance.\nReal conditions\nEPFL experts also lent their hand in several aspects relating to photovoltaics, such as the selection of protective films covering the solar panels. They also tested solar cells under real conditions to analyze the effect of clouds on their efficiency. As for the plane’s engine, the researchers created a multi-physical model to optimize its energy systems and developed and tested a prototype.\nAnother team of researchers was in charge of measuring with electrodes the two pilots’ brain activity for a virtual 72 hours flight. These data, coupled to the observation of the eyes movement and the relaxation of the chin muscles, allow analyzing the degree of their attention.

Miniaturized and multiplied, processors are now hidden in most of the objects we encounter in everyday life.

While examining this wall, going from one clue to the next, the visitor not only witnesses the evolution of the machines, but also the more and more symbiotic relationships that human beings have with them. “We wanted to present more than a mere technological exhibition”, adds Yves Bolognini. “Computing has become so important in our societies that it seems necessary to step back a little and take stock, to understand how we got here and to imagine how it will continue to evolve.”\nAccess to the museum is free when the building  is open – Mondays to Fridays, except holidays.

{"id": 950, "text": "The Vautrin-Lud Prize will be given to Jacques Lévy at a ceremony on Saturday, 6 October, as part of the International Geography Festival to be held in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, France, on 5–7 October 2018. This prize, established in 1991, is known colloquially as the Nobel Prize for geography due to its strict selection criteria and its jury modeled after the Swedish awards.\n“I’m delighted to receive this prize. But along with me, it’s the dozens of other people I worked with over the years who are also being recognized. Our collaboration enabled me to carry out the most important work of my career,” says Lévy, whose main research areas include political spaces, cities, globalization, cartography and spatial justice.\nBorn in Paris in 1952, Lévy contracted hepatitis at the age of 8 and was forced to spend long days in bed. He came across an atlas and, flipping through the pages, found himself transported to another world. Each map took him on an imaginary journey far from the boredom and confines of his bedroom. Looking back, he now believes that’s when the seeds of his calling as a geographer were planted.\nEspacesTemps \nmagazine\nLévy began studying at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Cachan, France, in the early 1970s. He obtained a state-certified geography degree in 1974, and in 1975 founded a magazine called \nEspacesTemps\n (now \nEspacesTemps.net\n) with a group of classmates, including fellow geographer Christian Grataloup. “We wanted to break down the barriers between the social sciences, philosophy, geography and history,” says Lévy. He was also teaching geography at the time to high-school classes in the tough Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis. This experience sparked an interest in teaching methods and the societal issues related to knowledge, and made him aware of the need in his field for a clear technical vocabulary.\nFrom 1984 to 1993, Lévy worked as a researcher at CNRS, where he completed his state-certified PhD. He served as a professor at the University of Reims from 1993 to 2004 and as a senior lecturer and then professor at France’s prestigious Sciences Po university from 1989 to 2007. He was appointed full professor of urban planning and geography at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2004, where he set up the Chôros Laboratory. EPFL awarded him the title of Professor Emeritus in 2017; that same year, he founded the Chôros association along with several colleagues, including some his former PhD students.\nReading Kant for others\nChôros is an independent research consortium of some 30 scientists mainly from Switzerland, France and Italy. It was set up as a “rhizome” – or an open, horizontal network – to promote civically minded science, as stated in its manifesto. The idea is to further the efforts of EPFL’s Chôros Laboratory, which was closed in 2017. “We want to bring a theoretical perspective to modern challenges like migration and justice. The goal is to give citizens and policymakers tools for framing their analyses so that they can feel freer in their decision-making. A city councilman doesn’t necessarily have time to read Kant, for example. But we do; we read Kant and other philosophers and can explain how their theories and ideas could be useful,” says Lévy. Today he teaches urban planning and political geography at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne. While he was in Lausanne, Lévy managed the \nL’Espace en société\n book collection at Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes (PPUR). In 2017, he was nominated for the Grand Prix de l’Urbanisme, an urban planning award given by the French ministry of the environment.\nThe many facets of Lévy’s work cannot be summarized easily. However, a look back at his most often-cited publications (published alone or with coauthors) points to a handful of key themes.\nHis first few years of research were focused on developing a clear, common vocabulary for geography in French, which he then used to structure his future work. “French-speaking geographers had given up trying to develop concepts and to agree on a simple definition for what is a ‘place,’ for example. So I wanted to establish a clear definition for each term, like in mathematics,” says Lévy. His meticulous work led to the publication in 2003 of \nDictionnaire de la geography et de l’espace des sociétés \n(Belin), written with fellow geographer Michel Lussault. A new, expanded version of the dictionary was released in 2013.\nGeography and societal issues\nPrior to that, Lévy published \nLe monde: espaces et systèmes\n (Les Presses de Sciences Po) in 1991, which has become a classic in his field. This book contains an initial discussion of globalization and what it means for our notions of space, linking geography to the social sciences. Another book, \nL'espace légitime. Sur la dimension géographique de la fonction politique\n (Les Presses de Sciences Po), came out in 1994 and stressed the importance of tying geography to broader societal issues, looking more specifically at cities and at maps of French electoral districts.\nWith the publication of \nLe tournant géographique. Penser l'espace pour lire le monde \n(Belin) in 1999, he introduced a new conception of geography that calls on geographers to address factors such as cities, urban planning, political movements and the world we live in. In 2005, Lévy’s interests turned to how digital technology can be used to enhance geographical research. In \nA Cartographic Turn\n (EPFL Press), published in 2016, he encourages geographers to leverage the latest developments in computer science – especially data processing – and advocates a new kind of map: cartograms. Cartograms show the real weight of cities around the world and illustrate just how interconnected our globalized society really is.\nNew software, new maps\nLévy even developed an open-source software program for generating cartograms, called ScapeToad, in 2008, through a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. “Globalization has made conventional 2D maps of our planet – where the space is dominated by the Earth’s vast oceans – irrelevant. Today, social networks and other virtual systems linking people together have defined new communities, much more so than countries’ borders. For instance, if Facebook generated a map of the world, it would depict our planet based solely on social relationships,” says Lévy.\nHis most recent book, \nThéorie de la justice spatiale \n(Odile Jacob), came out on 3 October of this year. Written in association with Jean-Nicolas Fauchille and Ana Póvoas – two of his former EPFL PhD students and today members of Chôros – the book opens up a new field of research at the crossroads of geography and justice. It aims to deconstruct preconceived notions about abandoned suburban areas, the redistribution of public wealth and the role of “bobos” – yuppie-hipsters – in societal diversity. With \nThéorie de la justice spatiale,\n Lévy once again brings geography into contemporary society, which he analyses through the prism of several disciplines with his primary field as the backdrop.\nArt and science\nHis latest realm of experimentation sits at the intersection of art and science. In 2009 and 2010 he led a research project at EPFL titled “Cosmographies: Sources et ressources pour la cartographie contemporaine,” which entailed linking up historical maps with those created by modern artists over the past 20 years. He posted two films on the internet portraying his research at EPFL: the first, \nUrbanité/s, \nin 2013 (); and the second, \nThinking Places\n, in 2015 (). \nThinking Places\n is a series of nine videos in which nine different researchers from his lab explore a city from a fresh perspective. “Modern artists inspire us geographers. For over a decade these artists have been exploring the concept of personal space, especially in their own movements. I want to enhance their work with a scientific approach and apply problem-solving techniques to the new issues they are bringing up,” says Lévy. He already plans to work with a choreographer to examine the languages of modern dance.\nTestimonials\n“Geography has established itself as the urban science by combining three approaches: first, a theory of social space that goes beyond the empirical definition that the discipline assigned long ago to its objects and instead undertakes a methodical study of spatial expression in social relationships; second, greater dialogue, not just with history, our old companion, but with all the other social sciences, from sociology and economics to political science and anthropology; and third, a commitment inscribed in cities’ policies and achieved through research on urban planning and urban development. Jacques Lévy was the pioneer behind this shift and one of the central figures of its realization.”\nPhilippe Descola, Collège de France, Paris, France\n“I’ve known Jacques Lévy for a long time, both professionally and as an individual. His extensive knowledge of modern and classical culture and the many languages he speaks have allowed him to grasp the societal diversity in today’s world. His research on cities and globalization are well-known here in Italy, where he is viewed as one of the most innovative and visionary geographers. The mapping experiments he carried out at EPFL’s Chôros lab are revolutionizing the role of maps in understanding mobility and societal dynamics. He is also a sensitive, caring, intelligent person. He can read into someone and, in a joking, light-hearted way, play on that to create a deep sense of empathy. I think winning the Vautrin-Lud Prize is an appropriate, well-deserved reward for the researcher and the individual who has understood our world and those who live in it.”\nEmanuela Casti, Geography Professor, Università degli Studi di Bergamo, Italy \n“It is a pleasure to learn that the Vautrin-Lud Prize for this year has been awarded to Jacques Lévy. I have known of Jacques and his original research and writing in urban and political geography for many years. He is a worthy recipient of this honor not least because of his dazzlingly innovative cartographic work and his role in encouraging new ideas about place and the production of knowledge. I have enjoyed working with Jacques on a number of occasions, so I can also attest to his skeptical wisdom tempered by wit and humanity. I can think of few other contemporary geographers who have had the impact on my own work that I would attribute to Jacques.”\nJohn Agnew, Professor of Geography and Italian, University of California, Los Angeles, USA\n“‘The world doesn’t have enemies, it has problems.’ I can’t even remember how many talks and lectures I’ve ended with this quote from Jacques – while showing Martians on the screen. This aphorism reflects his views on the emergence of a global society as well as an ongoing dialogue with all social sciences. Back in the 1970s, we debated these trends with a youthful rage, running up against old epistemological tenets for geography as well as other disciplines. That’s what prompted us to create \nEspacesTemps\n. One regret I don’t have in my career is not having always continued learning by holding things up against Jacques’s thoughts – written, spoken and debated. Thanks, Jacques.”\nChristian Grataloup, Geographer, Professor Emeritus, Université Paris Diderot, France\n“What has Jacques done for the field of geography? Provided proof that space – on every level, from our bodies to our world as a whole – is political and is a factor in power relations. What has Jacques done for the social sciences? Provided proof that you cannot understand modern societies without taking into account their spatial aspects – unfortunately, a common misconception. And what has Jacques done for geographers? Provided proof that a theoretical, conceptual debate, even if it’s heated, is essential for rejuvenating knowledge and opening up closed mindsets.”\nMichel Lussault, Geographer, Professor of Urban Studies, Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France\n“Jacques Lévy has left an important mark on our school. He fundamentally reshaped the relationship between geography and the social sciences – and more specifically between geography and architecture – by continually rethinking the notion of space, which is an essential concept for both disciplines. The need to always refer to the concept of a place rather than a space provided fertile ground for discussions with architects, in terms of teaching as well as research. ‘Think Space’ was even the name of one of his PhD seminar series that I was lucky enough to attend; each time I discovered a completely novel topic. Jacques’s main takeaway can be summarized in what he wrote in his important book, \nLe tournant géographique\n: ‘The spirit of a place – what makes a given space both similar to and different from another one – is not a dream or a die-hard spirituality, it exists. So you should learn to see it, tame it and reflect on it.’”\nLuca Ortelli, Architect, Full Professor and Head of the Construction and Conservation Laboratory (LCC), EPFL, Switzerland", "summary": "Jacques Lévy has been awarded the 2018 Vautrin-Lud Prize, a geography award modeled on the Nobel Prize.

The date 21 December, 2012 – which according to some punctuated the end of the last cycle “planned” by the Mayan calendar – led finally to… 22 December 2012. And to end of year festivities, which incidentally we hope will be joyous!\nTwo days before this doomsday, \nwas host to an astronomist from the Observatory of Geneva, Sylvia Ekström, and an honorary professor of French literature from the University of Lausanne, Jean Kaempfer. During EPFL’s science-café, they both evoked possible meanings of “the end of the world” from the point of view of their domain of competence.\nSo, at a scale that amounts to billions of years, there is reason to believe that our poor planet Earth will end its career as life’s crucible, either under the assault of the Sun turned blowtorch as it becomes a giant star and therefore gobbles up the Earth, or by the exhaustion of fuel in fusion at the heart of our planet, or perhaps due to some disastrous collision with a celestial body.

{"id": 960, "text": "Why are you celebrating this anniversary?\n We realized that the first university sports program began in 1941. That’s why we are celebrating this anniversary. So it’s to recognize this fact, but it’s also an opportunity to let people know about the sports center’s ‘new’ team, which has been in place a little under three years. We also wanted to increase our visibility, because I think we have a real role to play as a real service for both EPFL and the University of Lausanne. Our 75th anniversary will help us project a positive image of university sports, under the slogan Living sports.\nWhat events are planned for this anniversary year?\n We already have two big events, volleyball night and dance night. My colleagues Reto Ineichen and Jean-Sébastien Scharl are going to ‘customize’ these events. For volleyball night, for example, we will use white balls and, for the first part of the tournament, we’ll use the rules from 40 years ago – a flashback to the 1970s, when the first gym was built. There will also be an official, invitation-only evening, on 23 September. Two new events are also being organized to promote competitive sports and student health. The competitive event will be a 24-hour relay race (the Run24Dorigny, see box), while the health event will be one or two days on campus during which the university community will be able to test their physical condition at a number of different stands. One of the big problems, of course, stems from all the sitting we do. The health event will be paired with a Sports UNIL-EPFL app (starting on 29 February) that provides users with a custom fitness program based on short exercises.\nYour philosophy of university sports?\n We have to think about the physical activities we engage in and steer clear of certain problems associated with competitive sports. We encourage people to systematically pay attention to what they’re doing, why they’re doing it and how. It’s important for people to be aware of these things, even when it comes to performance sports, and to always think through their actions including the health and well-being aspects. We mustn’t simply charge forward, unthinking, taking supplements to boost our performance.\nThe most popular sports these days?\n Physical fitness activities and low-impact workouts. We see that our participants already think about their health when doing sports. Sports aren’t as hardcore as they were 15 years ago, no more ‘no pain no gain’. We also see a higher proportion of women in these sports, while men prefer team sports.

{"id": 965, "text": "Information and communication technologies are going from revolution to revolution. From the importance of social networks in people’s everyday lives, which was inconceivable just ten years ago, to the transformation of our methods of production and consumption, more and more people – both young and old – and objects are now interconnected at all times and in all places. This digital revolution is fundamentally transforming our economy and society. What are the digital applications of the future and how will things stand ten years from now? Two organisations primarily concerned with such issues have today announced the signature of a strategic partnership.\nFrom connected people to connected homes\nThe agreements signed between the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Swisscom, Switzerland’s original telecommunications provider, cover the two key areas of interconnected people and homes. They will enable the study of a wide range of areas of application that are opening up thanks to digitalisation – new user interfaces, professional and household robotics, intelligent towns and buildings, biological sensors and artificial intelligence.\nToday, the networks are primarily used for communication tools. In the future, they will be the cornerstone of a system permanently connecting billions of networked objects and people. They will provide new functions that will redefine home life, mobility services and medical devices, among other things. “The digital revolution is on its way. To maintain their competitiveness and innovative capability, Switzerland and its companies have to be pioneers in this revolution and Swisscom a key player. In EPFL, in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, we’re seekingleading-edge expertise and multidisciplinary innovation that will enable us to further strengthen our position through our commitment,” explained Urs Schaeppi, CEO of Swisscom.\n“Dozens of our laboratories are working on the increased connectivity of people and objects and infrastructure, including data protection issues,” added Patrick Aebischer, President of EPFL. The arrival of Swisscom on our campus will inspire creativity among our students and researchers by providing them with access to the immediate requirements of a leading company with a large customer base.”\nA three-pillar partnership\nSwisscom and EPFL will cooperate closely within three key areas. Their partnership entails the setup of a call-for-proposals fund financed by the operator, worth a million Swiss francs a year for a seven-year period, for applied research projects focusing on its customers needs . The projects, which could involve software or infrastructure solutions as well as objects for the public, will focus on a multidisciplinary approach and cooperation between various laboratories and research facilities. Swisscom will also establish a permanent presence on campus starting in 2016 through its “Digital Lab”. This 428 m2 site in the EPFL Innovation Park will be providing a unique environment to implement and develop pilot projects by pursuing an “open innovation” strategy. Finally, Swisscom is committed to lending fresh impetus to the campus ecosystem by organising events related to the challenges of digitalisation, supporting the ecosystem of start-ups and, more generally, by stimulating exchanges between the operator’s staff and students and researchers. The projects implemented as part of the partnership will be developed on the Lausanne campus as well as on other EPFL sites in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, especially in Fribourg in relation with the project Smart Living Lab.\nThe agreement signed on Wednesday, 16 December 2015, allows the two major players to combine their efforts in a field offering enormous potential for innovation, on both a large and small scale.

Conceived in 2016, the team’s lightweight boat shone this year, taking first place in both speed and energy efficiency. It was a great reward for the students, who made the risky choice of a fast but unstable bifoiler. The EPFL team was also on the podium for the long-distance race, where they took second place, and for the heavyweight boat category, where they placed third.\nA dozen European teams from six countries participated this year in the event organized in Yverdon by the three French-language universities: EPFL, the Haute école d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Fribourg (HeiaFR), and the Haute école d'ingénierie et de gestion du canton de Vaud (Heig-VD). Using the same engine and batteries, the teams had to design the most energy-efficient boat.\nOn Sunday, the final race in the lightweight boat category was a close call between Heig-VD and EPFL. Five runs were necessary for EPFL to win 3-2. In the heavyweight boat category, the final separated the long Archimedean boats of the two impressive Croatian teams. The Croatian Academy of Engineering also distinguished itself in terms of efficiency, surpassing HeiaFR and Heig-VD with its heavyweight boat.\nExpress fine-tuning\nFor the long-distance race, in which contestants aim to cover the longest distance with a limited amount of energy, EPFL students went it all out. \"Half an hour before the competition, we modified our surface-effect boat – the heavyweight one,\" explains Sébastien Jaffaux, president of the HydroContest EPFL Team. “We took away its fan and the skirts that form an air cushion. It thus become a catamaran. We turned the engine over again, from propulsive to tractive mode. Finally, we added a foil.\" The choice was clearly a good one: like the Heig-VD team, the EPFL students completed 18 laps. However, HES crossed the finishing line first.\nOn the strength of their success, Lausanne students are already thinking about 2020.

{"id": 976, "text": "EPFL scientists have discovered how to control the limbs of a completely paralyzed rat in real time to help it walk again. Their results are published today in Science Translational Medicine.\nBuilding on earlier work in rats, this new breakthrough is part of a more general therapy that could one day be implemented in rehabilitation programs for people with spinal cord injury, currently being developed in a European project called NEUWalk. Clinical trials could start as early as next summer using the new Gait Platform, built with the support of the Valais canton and the SUVA, and now assembled at the CHUV (Lausanne University Hospital).\nHow it works\nThe human body needs electricity to function. The electrical output of the human brain, for instance, is about 30 watts. When the circuitry of the nervous system is damaged, the transmission of electrical signals is impaired, often leading to devastating neurological disorders like paralysis.\nElectrical stimulation of the nervous system is known to help relieve these neurological disorders at many levels. Deep brain stimulation is used to treat tremors related to Parkinson’s disease, for example. Electrical signals can be engineered to stimulate nerves to restore a sense of touch in the missing limb of amputees. And electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can restore movement control in spinal cord injury.\nBut can electrical signals be engineered to help a paraplegic walk naturally? The answer is yes, for rats at least.\n“We have complete control of the rat’s hind legs,” says EPFL neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine. “The rat has no voluntary control of its limbs, but the severed spinal cord can be reactivated and stimulated to perform natural walking. We can control in real-time how the rat moves forward and how high it lifts its legs.”\nThe scientists studied rats whose spinal cords were completely severed in the middle-back, so signals from the brain were unable to reach the lower spinal cord. That’s where flexible electrodes were surgically implanted. Sending electric current through the electrodes stimulated the spinal cord.\nThey realized that there was a direct relationship between how high the rat lifted its limbs and the frequency of the electrical stimulation. Based on this and careful monitoring of the rat’s walking patterns – its gait – the researchers specially designed the electrical stimulation to adapt the rat’s stride in anticipation of upcoming obstacles, like barriers or stairs.\n“Simple scientific discoveries about how the nervous system works can be exploited to develop more effective neuroprosthetic technologies,” says co-author and neuroengineer Silvestro Micera. “We believe that this technology could one day significantly improve the quality of life of people confronted with neurological disorders.\"\n Taking this idea a step further, Courtine and Micera together with colleagues from EPFL’s Center for Neuroprosthetics are also exploring the possibility of decoding signals directly from the brain about leg movement and using this information to stimulate the spinal cord.\nTowards clinical trials using the Gait Platform at the CHUV\nThe electrical stimulation reported in this study will be tested in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury in a clinical study that may start as early as next summer, using a new Gait Platform that brings together innovative monitoring and rehabilitation technology.\nDesigned by Courtine’s team, the Gait Platform consists of custom-made equipment like a treadmill and an overground support system, as well as 14 infrared cameras that detect reflective markers on the patient’s body and two video cameras, all of which generate extensive amounts of information about leg and body movement. This information can be fully synchronized for complete monitoring and fine-tuning of the equipment in order to achieve intelligent assistance and adaptive electrical spinal cord stimulation of the patient.\nThe Gait Platform is housed in a 100 square meter room provided by the CHUV. The hospital already has a rehabilitation center dedicated to translational research, notably for orthopedic and neurological pathologies.\n“The Gait Platform is not a rehabilitation center,” says Courtine. “It is a research laboratory where we will be able to study and develop new therapies using very specialized technology in close collaboration with medical experts here at the CHUV, like physiotherapists and doctors.”", "summary": "A completely paralyzed rat can be made to walk over obstacles and up stairs by electrically stimulating the severed part of the spinal cord.

For the first time, an EPFL team took up the challenge set each year by the CanSat competition, which has become one of the largest university events for space-related topics since it was started in the 1990s. In June, five EPFL students* went to Texas for the competition final, where they put the device they had been working on all year to the test. How did they fare?\n\"We got the Tenderfoot Award, which goes to the best newcomer,\" said Luca Barloggio, a student in materials science. \"We finished 20th out of 40 teams, as we didn't have time to transmit all the data collected during the flight. But the wing design of our device was good, the telemetry worked well, and the container opened as planned.\"\nNo more than 500 grams\nIt all started in a class given by Olivier de Weck, an Aeronautics and Astronautics Professor at MIT in Boston. The class is part of EPFL's Minor in Spatial Technology, which the five students took together. One of their exercises was to work under the strict CanSat conditions. After the experiment, they all decided to give the real thing a go and applied for the competition.\nAmong the many requirements for the CanSat category selected by the EPFL team: the system must not weigh more than 500 grams; the materials used should not be at any risk of catching fire; the flight duration must be as close to two minutes as possible; and the cost cannot exceed 1,000 dollars. Released at an altitude of 600 meters, the vehicle has to sample the air pressure and temperature, take images and transmit the data to a ground station in real time.\nA semester of work for two minutes of flight\nSupported by experts from the Swiss Space Center and EPFL's Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, the five students worked tirelessly on their project. \"It seemed doable in theory, but when you actually have to develop the system, you realize what space science really is,\" said Sorina Lupu, a student in microengineering.\nTo design the CanSat, the group took inspiration from a tropical grain \"that glides to the ground when it falls from the tree,\" said Barloggio. \"The project taught us a lot.

As a result, we barely slept 3 hours per night! Each team was committed to optimizing its boat while at the same time offering advice and help to the other teams,” said Félix Cazalis, the leader of EPFL’s Hydrocontest Team. \n The local team competed in the second Hydrocontest, near the Vidy pyramids, from Wednesday to Sunday alongside 15 other student teams from around the world. Miniature boats – battery-powered and remote-controlled – squared off in the competition. The EPFL team won first place in the Mass Transport category. The object of that category, in which the boats have to move 200 kilograms of ballast, is to simulate cargo transport. “Our SWASH boat – which used a submerged torpedo equipped with a float on the surface to transport its payload – stood out for its maneuverability and stability. We finished in 1’14, while the organizers estimated the best time possible at 1’15 for the heavyweight category. And I’m sure we could trim another 15 seconds off our time,” said Cazalis. This victory is the payoff after a year’s worth of work for the eight Bachelor’s students and the five Master’s students involved plus the last-minute reinforcements. Once they've recovered from this event, they will debrief and plan improvements for the next one. \nHow should students be supervised in the future?\n The Hydrocontest is a healthy competition in itself, but EPFL also uses it – along with other interdisciplinary projects – as a proving ground for models of student supervision. Pascal Vuilliomenet (VPIV-VPAA) and Winnaretta Zina Singer (TrACE) initiated and set-up the collaborative structure between laboratories initially involved in this competition. For this edition, students were coached by the LAMD laboratory of Prof. Jürg Schiffmann, mentor of the EPFL team. Pascal Vuilliomenet put it this way: “We push interdisciplinary projects so that students can work on concrete cases that allow them to develop their soft skills too. This means they have to deal with real-world issues like technical problems, planning, project and team management, risk management, and so on. We are currently testing various models through several projects, including Hydrocontest and the Robotics Contest. The ultimate goal is to determine the best type of student supervision. Do students need close oversight by senior staff, or should they have a lot of independence?” \n This is about more than just models of supervision, of course, since the objective is to eventually put students in the most effective learning environment. An example of this is the Discovery Learning Laboratories: they allow students to do practical work in different disciplines, and they offer space to develop prototypes. “In the end, the idea is to prepare the students as well as possible for the increasing complexity of the challenges they will face in their professional career. This complexity underscores the need to break down barriers between disciplines,” said Vuilliomenet.", "summary": "The EPFL team won the Mass Transport category of this year’s competition.

{"id": 983, "text": "Fabien Sorin may only have been at EPFL for four years, but he’s already made his mark. Soon after joining the Materials Science and Engineering Section, the assistant professor took over teaching an introductory course for Bachelor’s students in the School of Engineering. The class is quite large – some 300 students – which made it a real challenge for the first-year professor. Professor Sorin has poured his heart into the course, and it shows: his students obtain excellent results and give Sorin very high marks. In recognition, Sorin has been awarded the 2017 Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching at EPFL.\nHow does Professor Sorin engage his students? Through a well planned curriculum that combines demonstrations, scientific concepts and experiments. “Teaching these concepts to just one student would be easy, but getting certain points across to a lecture hall full of 300 students through experiments is much more challenging,” says Sorin. “Over the past few years I came up with a three-pronged approach so that I could teach the theoretical and practical sides together.” Sorin begins his classes with often spectacular demonstrations, not hesitating to break dishes, for example, in order to reveal the properties of a given material. Or he shows videos that he made in his laboratory. Having captured the entire class’s attention, he then introduces the theoretical elements of that day’s lesson. He ends the class with experiments.\n“Mixing things up is the best way to hold their attention,” says Professor Sorin. “After doing an experiment, maybe I'll tell a funny story or bring in a historical perspective, and then I’ll explain the underlying concepts on the board. That helps keep them focused.” While he is strict – “silence in class is mandatory” – he believes that connecting with the students and sharing his passion are essential to sparking their interest and winning their respect. Sorin attributes the success of his course to Professor Rappaz, who mentored him early on. He also cites his student assistants, to whom he presents the material ahead of time in a sort of practice run that prepares them for the students’ questions.\nThanks to the effort Professor Sorin puts in, his students rate the class highly despite the fact it’s so hard. And it has even gotten harder as a result of Sorin’s approach of combining theory and practice. “What I find so rewarding is not only that the students like the class, but that the second-year professors have seen the students’ level of understanding increase noticeably since I changed my way of teaching,” says Sorin.", "summary": "Fabien Sorin, an assistant professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Section, has been awarded the 2017 Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.

This ranking, which has been run by startup.ch since 2011, serves as a startup radar – spotting cutting-edge Swiss tech businesses that are just getting off the ground. Two EPFL startups, L.E.S.S. and Flyability, made the podium, while four others also finished in the top ten. A total of 27 companies from French-speaking Switzerland – most of them linked to EPFL – were included in this ranking.\nOptical fibers for the auto industry\nThe top finisher was Zurich-based Ava, which developed bracelets that show a woman the most fertile days in her menstrual cycle. L.E.S.S. came in second place, after topping the charts in the previous two years. This EPFL startup makes nano active fiber lighting that can be used as an alternative to LEDs. This technology, developed by the company’s founders Yann Tissot and Simon Rivier, delivers bright and uniform lighting. Their optical fibers are already being marketed for industrial purposes and for use in microscopes and are about to enter mass production for the automotive industry. L.E.S.S.’s system reduces the amount of energy consumed by headlights by around 30%, yet it weighs half as much as today’s standard products. The company, which recently moved to Renens, is expected to announce an agreement with a major carmaker very soon. It plans to hire 30 people early next year and is preparing for a new round of financing.\nElios, the drone that inspects dangerous places\nFlyability – third in the ranking – makes Elios, a drone encased in a small round cage that protects it from obstacles. The company’s founders, Adrien Briod and Patrick Thévoz, equipped Elios with a high-definition video camera. This means their drone, which can navigate very tight spaces, can be used to inspect and explore places that are too remote or forbidding for humans. This EPFL spin-off was set up in 2014 and quickly grew in size, going from a workforce of just a few employees to nearly 60 today. It expects to triple its revenues this year.\nMany other well-known EPFL startups can be found in the ranking as well.

{"id": 989, "text": "Controlling and modulating the flow of light is essential in today’s telecommunications-based society. Professor Tobias Kippenberg and his team in EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements have discovered a novel way to couple light and vibrations. Using this discovery, they built a device in which a beam of light traveling through an optical microresonator could be controlled by a second, stronger light beam. The device thus acts like an optical transistor, in which one light beam influences the intensity of another.\nTheir optical microresonator has two characteristics: first, it traps light in a tiny glass structure, guiding the beam into a circular pattern. Second, the structure vibrates, like a wine glass, at well-defined frequencies. Because the structure is so tiny (a fraction of the diameter of a human hair), these frequencies are 10,000 times higher than a wineglass vibration. When light is injected into the device, the photons exert a force called radiation pressure, which is greatly enhanced by the resonator. The increasing pressure deforms the cavity, coupling the light to the mechanical vibrations. If two light beams are used, the interaction of the two lasers with the mechanical vibrations results in a kind of optical “switch”: the strong “control” laser can turn on or off a weaker “probe” laser just as in a electronic transistor.\n“We have known for more than two years that this effect was theoretically possible,” explains Max-Planck Institute scientist Albert Schliesser, but pinning it down proved difficult. “Once we knew where to look, it was right there,” recalls EPFL PhD student Stefan Weis, one of the lead authors of the paper. Senior EPFL scientist Samuel Deléglise notes that “the agreement between theory and experiment is really striking.”\nApplications of this novel effect, baptised “OMIT” (optomechanically-induced transparency), could provide entirely new functionality to photonics. Radiation-to-vibration conversions are already widely used; in mobile phones, for example, a receiver converts electromagnetic radiation to mechanical vibration, enabling the signal to be filtered efficiently. But it has been impossible to do this kind of conversion with light. With an OMIT-based device, an optical light field could for the first time be converted into a mechanical vibration. This could open up a huge range of possibilities in telecommunications. For example, novel optical buffers could be designed that could store optical information for up to several seconds.\nOn a more fundamental level, researchers around the world have been trying to find ways to control optomechanical systems at the quantum level: the switchable coupling demonstrated by the EPFL-Max Planck team could help the community clear this hurdle, by serving as an important interface in hybrid quantum systems.", "summary": "In an article appearing on November 11th in the journal Science, researchers at EPFL and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics announce the discovery of a method for coupling photons and mechanical vibrations that could have numerous applications in telecommunications and quantum information technologies.", "claim": "In an article appearing on today in the journal Science, researchers at EPFL and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics announce the discovery of a method for coupling photons and mechanical vibrations that could have numerous applications in telecommunications and quantum information technologies.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 5], "noise": false}

After the BlueGene/L, installed in 2005, then the BlueGene/P, which entered service in 2009, the latest addition to the range of IBM supercomputers, the BlueGene/Q, assumed its place at EPFL last November. After undergoing a series of tests, it has been operational since January 28, and has been made available to researchers from EPFL and the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL) through the consortium CADMOS (Center for Advanced Modeling Science), the Geneva center for high performance computing shared by these three institutions.\nWith this new tool, research on complex systems, such as the brain, the climate, or the Earth’s surface, can soar to new heights. Medical research can also benefit by improving treatments for certain illnesses such as cerebral aneurisms.\nWith 1024 computation nodes, the BlueGene/Q has a calculation power of 172.7 teraflops, which means it can do 172,000 billion operations per second. That is four times more than the functioning capacity of BlueGene/P thus far. It is also much smaller, given that it fits in a single cabinet, whereas its predecessor required four. Twenty-five BlueGene/Q are already operational around the world. However, the one from Lake Geneva has a mass storage management system (2.2 petabytes) that is unique in the world today.\nDespite its great power, the BlueGene/Q requires very little energy. Water-cooled, it consumes only 82.2 kilowatts of electricity, the energy equivalent of a mere one-hundred household coffeemakers working continuously. This excellent energy efficiency places it in tenth position in the list of the world’s greenest supercomputers.\nFrom the brain and medical research to the Rhône\nAs the issues scientists face become increasingly complex, their resolution requires ever higher computational power. Twenty teams can leverage the capabilities of BlueGene/Q to make great headway with their research.\nAmong potential supercomputer users are the EPFL plasma physics research center at EPFL. Also, geophycisists of UNIL are trying to simulate the physics involved in plate tectonics. Furthermore, computer scientists of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) are modeling the Rhône River between Geneva and Verbois in an effort to better understand how sediments are deposited. But potential users also include climatologists, astrophysicists, or even experts in biology and computational chemistry who need powerful computers to process large amounts data. Let us not forget the mathematicians who build simulation models of the heart and arteries to predict diseases of the circulatory system.\nBiomedical research, too, could benefit greatly from this supercomputer. This includes notable research by oncologists at UNIL, as well as by researchers at UNIGE who simulate the process of thrombosis in cerebral aneurisms. Their goal is not only to understand biomechanical phenomena at work, but also to help doctors propose the most appropriate treatment for each patient.\nThe acquisition of BlueGene/Q furthermore enables the CADMOS consortium to consolidate its expertise in the field of this family of IBM supercomputers and for scientists of the Lake Geneva region to expand their acquired competencies in scientific calculation. Thereby they will be ready for the next big step, “exa-scale,” which will complete about one billion billion operations per second.

{"id": 993, "text": "Dozens of balloon-borne radiosondes are released into the atmosphere every day. They measure temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and wind direction at different altitudes before eventually falling back to earth. In most cases, this high-tech equipment is never recovered. But a group of five EPFL students,* studying either environmental sciences or physics, could change all that. For their Bachelor’s project, they developed a system that can help guide the radiosonde’s trajectory as it falls to earth so that it can be found and reused. Through a single test flight from the roof of a campus building, they proved the feasibility of their concept.\nRadiosondes are carried aloft by giant helium-filled weather balloons that expand as they rise through the air – in some cases to an altitude of 30 kilometers – until they eventually pop. A small parachute attached to the onboard equipment automatically opens once the maximum altitude has been reached, preventing the radiosondes from causing damage when they touch down.\nThe students’ focused their attention on the parachute release. “Our system controls the exposed surface area of the parachute, directing the radiosonde towards air currents that will guide it to an accessible landing spot,” says Hugo Cruz, a student in Environmental Sciences and Engineering. His classmate Lorenzo Donadio adds: “The main thing is to make sure the radiosonde doesn’t end up on the side of a mountain, at the bottom of a lake or in some no man's land.”\nTheir parachute system is fully automated and run by computer code that the students wrote themselves. It is triggered as soon as the radiosonde starts to fall: a small motor lets out the parachute cords and reels them back in to control the speed of descent. The radiosonde can thus be navigated to an air current that will take it in the desired direction. The system uses up-to-date weather data along with GPS coordinates that are refreshed every 30 seconds relative to a reference point. A tracking device is used to pinpoint where the radiosonde lands.\nAs light as possible\nThe students’ invention, while practical and clever, faced some hurdles. For starters, their parachute system had to be able to withstand all sorts of weather, including extremely high winds. It also had to be as light as possible so that the radiosonde could be easily redirected while freefalling. This seriously limited the instruments and materials that they could use. “We also had to master a number of concepts that we had never studied before, especially in computer science and physics,” says Julie Reznicek, an environmental engineering student.\nThey did a single trial run of their system this past spring, flying their weather balloon to an altitude of around 10,000 meters above Lake Geneva as planned. The equipment was then recovered in a field in Epalinges, just north of Lausanne. While the mechanism used to release and retract the cords worked well, the students noted that the microcontroller lacked the power it needed to record all the data. Some of the students will continue to refine the device this summer, and a second test flight with a larger balloon and more reliable equipment is planned for September. There’s no doubt that these students have set their sights high.\n* Julie Reznicek, Hugo Cruz, Lorenzo Donadio,\nSimon Léo Albers and Guillem Rivas Castellá.", "summary": "Summer series.

The group, divided into ten teams, launched their rockets at noon on Friday, 5 June from the fields at the UNIL-EPFL sports centre. The rockets were judged on three criteria: cost, altitude and flight time.\nAll the rockets reached an altitude of 100 to 123 meters, whether following a straight or slightly sinusoidal path. The only mishap came when three rockets lost their parachute, which was meant to ensure a soft landing. The winning rocket reached an altitude of 115 meters and stayed aloft for over 33 seconds.\n“The competition is a fun way to generate interest in space technologies and show that this field is more accessible than one might think,” said Simon Dandavino, a scientist at eSpace and the event organiser.

All the teams came from EPFL apart from a team of four high school students with a passion for technology. “Unfortunately there were no girls!” said Dandavino. “They’re still pretty underrepresented in this field.”\nSolid display of skills\nThe event gave the teams an opportunity to put their heads together on a fun project. But in the end it was a real engineering competition requiring solid math skills and a keen practical sense.\nThe participants were guided throughout the whole process by the experience of the event’s Technical Director, Nickolay Mullin. At the start of the competition, they had one hour to prepare and submit their rocket design. Each team had an equal amount of RocketCoins, or credits, allowing them to purchase the materials needed for their rocket. Before the materials could be selected, however, the teams had to carry out rapid but very precise calculations to assess the impact that various shapes of nose cones and ailerons would have on the stability, trajectory and height of the flight and to estimate how the choice of cardboard or polystyrene foam, for example, would affect the outcome. The teams also had to take a number of factors into account – such as weight, tube length and engine power – in order to pinpoint the centre of mass, which had to be above the centre of thrust.\n“The students became familiar with some core concepts of aerodynamics, which also apply to the design of large rockets,” said Dandavino.

That’s why a handful of students has been meeting up almost every day during their summer vacation at either the lakeside headquarters of the Compagnie Générale de Navigation (CGN) – the Lake Geneva ferryboat operator – or the EPFL-UNIL sailing center, to thoroughly test their two prototypes. The  will be held from 2 to 9 September in Saint-Tropez, France.

The three teams will showcase their boats for the public on 11 August, from 10am to 7pm, at the Parc des Rives du Lac on the  lakefront.\nThe competition is devoted to nautical and maritime energy efficiency, and more than 30 teams will take part this year. Each team will compete with two miniature remote-controlled boats powered by batteries provided by the event organizer.

They believe that their light bifoiler, which was launched in 2016, could win. “We minimized drag by using only two foils, which means our boat can outpace the others. The flip side of the coin is that our boat is more unstable – it’s sort of like flying a drone without a stabilizer,” says Kevin Delizée, a Master’s student in mechanical engineering and vice president of the  association. The trick is to really fine-tune the boat and then pilot it expertly.\nThe EPFL students are also entering a promising new ‘heavy’ boat into the mass transport category, which they have dominated twice in years past. A cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft, their new boat has two sources of propulsion: Archimedes’ buoyancy force acting on the two hulls, and a fan-generated air cushion contained between the hulls by fore and aft skirts.\nValuable partners\nThe upcoming competition will cap off a year of endless hours of work for Delizée, who conceived and designed the new boat as part of two semester projects. “What drives me? It’s just been a lot of fun!” He and close to a dozen other students got out of bed every morning at the crack of dawn for five weeks in order to build the boat in a workshop in Ecublens provided by Décision SA, one of the team’s main partners.\nThe project taught the students many things. In addition to the mechanical and technical know-how they picked up, they experienced some real-world challenges first-hand: project and team management for starters, and then fundraising and the quest for partners. This year, Hydrocontest EPFL Team embarked on a partnership with CGN, which gave them access to a large expanse of open water in the port used by their belle-époque-era ferryboats. “For CGN, this link-up with EPFL is a great opportunity to build bridges in areas that are important to our company and will support our development. We have put in place a solid and forward-looking partnership that will pay off for the students, the school and CGN in terms of energy efficiency, technology intelligence, innovation and hands-on experience,” says Irwin Gafner, CGN’s Technical Director. One small yet memorable result of this partnership: the sight of the EPFL students’ little remote-controlled boat being tested in the shadow of the century-old fleet.\nContact\n:", "summary": "Summer series - Students' projects (6/9).

The students will be supervised by specialists from their respective schools.\nDrawing on the universities’ expertise, the delegation will examine over 4,000 athletes aged 15 to 18 who are scheduled to take part in this third edition of the Summer YOG. The examinations will include full evaluations of the athletes’ musculoskeletal systems and posture. The results will be used to give athletes personalized advice for improving their physical performance and preventing injury. All this data will be managed using a special digital platform being provided by an EPFL start-up.\nAccording to Stéphane Maeder, head of the Sports and Health Centre (CSS) at University Sports Lausanne, this will be an excellent learning experience for the students. “They will have an opportunity to examine high-level athletes competing internationally and see first-hand what goes on behind the scenes at this type of major sporting event. We are also working closely with INSEP, France’s national sports institute, to develop and implement our initiative.”\nThe local universities are helping in other ways, too.

{"id": 1014, "text": "This isn’t the fourth dimension, but almost. Akselos, a company based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, developed a platform that combines 1D and 3D elements to detect weak points in major metal structures like buildings, cranes and oil platforms with unprecedented speed and accuracy.\nA few days faster\n“To give an example, it took 8 minutes and 20 seconds for our software to solve 100 load combinations on a shiploader model that has over 5 million degrees of freedom, versus more than 3 days with the conventional method,” said Thomas Leurent, the CEO of Akselos. This new and highly anticipated technology couples the speed of 1D beam elements and the need for 3D simulation. 3D representations are slow and tedious but absolutely necessary for reliably analyzing stress points like joints.\nMore accurate simulations\nAkselos’ platform will be a real boon for engineers. When it comes to analyzing enormous structures like a mining machine made of 14,000 tons of steel – twice the weight of the Eiffel Tower – going from the 1D workflow to the 3D workflow is really undesirable. So rather than carrying out a time-consuming 3D simulation of entire structures, the engineers who design them use a global 1D model along with 3D sub-models.\nBut decoupling the models undermines the reliability of the overall result. In order to accurately predict how a structure will perform, engineers need to understand the global and detailed behavior of the model since some problems stem from the fact that these are assembled structures. “Decoupling is a very optimistic view on engineering,” said Leurent. “Moving to a completely integrated workflow, engineers would gain time, but more importantly, their models would be less error-prone.”\nSuper-fast calculations \nAkselos' innovation is based on research coming out of MIT that was then developed in conjunction with EPFL labs. It speeds up some of the calculations that are needed for 3D simulations. They are now almost as fast to solve as beam elements.\n“Mathematicians have been working on this method since the year 2000, and it was recently marketed by Akselos for industrial applications,” said Marco Picasso, whose lab worked on the software program within the scope of two CTI (Commission for Technology and Innovation) projects. The software breaks down a complex geometry into simpler elements for which the calculations have been done in advance. The elements are then put back together in record time.

{"id": 1016, "text": "Those who attended the Paleo Festival last year remember: mud, mud everywhere. Torrential rains before and during the festival turned the parking areas into a mud pit, making them unusable. The organizers had to activate the \"Rain Plan,\" closing off the parking areas and asking festival-goers to leave their cars at home and find other means of transport. Did the rain spoil the party? Not at all, according to a survey by EPFL sociologists. Those surveyed reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their experience reaching the site (89%) and leaving it (85%). These figures are just slightly lower than those from two years ago (90% and 87%). But the reason for this decrease may have more to do with Stromae than the weather…oh, the joys of bottlenecks!\nThe mud forced festival-goers to get organized. The number of people getting behind the wheel showed a particularly steep drop. While a good third of attendees drove their car in 2012, just over one in five did so in 2014. Both years, around 20% hitched a ride with another driver.\nThere was also a shift to public forms of transport: in 2014, 36% of those surveyed made use of them exclusively, versus 29% in 2012. “But forgoing the car didn’t only ramp up the use of public transport,” said Emmanuel Ravalet, a researcher at the Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR) and one of the authors of the study. “More festival-goers also used a combination of cars and public transport.” Altogether one out of ten people changed their method of transport due to the Rain Plan.\nIn 2012 Paleo Festival first commissioned LaSUR to carry out a survey, coordinated by the EPFL Transportation Center, on access to the site of the Festival. Called on by the festival organizers to assess the impact of the Rain Plan, LaSUR then used the results of the 2012 and 2014 surveys, which were based on a representative sampling of some 500 people.\nFaithful fans riding together\n Festival-goers responded to the miserable weather with an unexpected degree of last-minute organizational skills. Seven out of ten people who changed their travel plans did so on the day they attended, as the parking restrictions were only announced the previous evening. The researcher chalks this flexibility up to two factors: most festival-goers come from the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva, and the Paleo Festival Nyon has a very faithful following – only 13% of respondents were going for the first time. In other words, Paleo fans know each other and get organized when they have to.\n“This means that there is some scope for people to change their means of transport,” said Ravalet. “However, the shift is more towards formal and especially informal car-pooling than towards public transport.” Among the negatives, nearly 30% of dissatisfied respondents noted that the public transports were too full, while just under 10% mentioned parking problems.\nStromae effect\n The Rain Plan did not dampen the spirits of festival-goers, who reserved their ire for what took place on Wednesday, 23 July. Or rather the wee hours of the 24th, when the show put on by Belgian musician Stromae came to an end. The 40,000 people who stayed to hear the final chords did not all make it out without a hitch. 20% of them spent at least one hour – and in some cases more than two – trying to exit the parking area, while on the other days this figure rarely went above 30 minutes. Bottlenecks ruined the end of the evening for 26% of drivers. Much more so than packed public transport, which left only 6% of users dissatisfied.", "summary": "In 2014, poor weather forced organizers to close parking areas that were too muddy.

{"id": 1019, "text": "This four-day workshop was organized by EPFL’s International Risk Governance Center (). We spoke with Marie-Valentine Florin, the Center’s executive director, about IRGC’s role at EPFL.\nHow can synthetic biology be used improperly or maliciously?\nSynthetic biologists are able to construct new biological systems and functions with applications in energy, health care and farming. Yet these same technologies can also be hijacked to create potentially dangerous pathogens for which there is no known treatment.\nSo as researchers, we need to ask ourselves what we can do to advance science and technology for the common good while at the same time managing the risks of “dual-use” research, or research that can be turned against people or the environment.\nThe EPFL workshop, which was funded by NATO’s Science for Peace and Security Programme, gave scientists, national and international regulators, security agencies and businesses a chance to pool their expertise in order to clarify the causes and potential consequences of these risks and refine existing response strategies.\nThe working groups formed during the workshop will now turn their discussions into a report and a book discussing the various problems, current and potential future solutions, existing obstacles and recommendations. The workshop participants explored both the failure of well-intentioned researchers to take necessary precautions and the impact of their negligence, as well as the danger that knowledge or material will be used for malevolent purposes.\nWhat is ?\nIRGC was created by EPFL in 2017 to serve as a forum for cross-disciplinary dialogue on complex, uncertain and ambiguous risks – which are often a counterpart to opportunities. Our goal is to give policymakers the information they need to make decisions based on solid scientific and technological foundations.\nMost technologies are aimed at reducing existing risks – think climate change, diseases and natural disasters – and this is something that should be promoted by public policies. It is also essential to create positive incentives through targeted research programs, financial support, and standards that reward performance gains. But new dangers can always arise, and this is where IRGC comes in. Our recommendations are meant to highlight key risks and challenges and help identify possible strategies to deal with them.\nWe have a dual mission. First, we seek to develop widely applicable risk governance concepts and instruments. Risk governance refers to the processes, standards, regulations and structures that come into play when risk-related decisions have to be made. This includes assessing, managing and communicating about risks with the involvement of the various stakeholders. We then issue recommendations, mainly for public policymakers, about how to manage the risks posed by some emerging technologies.\nWhy does EPFL need IRGC?\nAll major universities around the world have an institute or center that studies the link between technology and public policy. The concept of risk is central because it is what justifies public intervention. Yet the risk governance approach that we take encompasses more than simple risk management. For a university like EPFL, it means creating the conditions necessary for new technologies to be adopted. For example, we commonly recommend that new technological applications must not only improve existing performance in some way, but they must also be economically viable and generally responsible, i.e. socially acceptable and environmentally respectful.\nOur role at EPFL is to answer researchers’ questions about such topics. We can also be more proactive in certain areas, such as insisting on the importance of taking cultural differences into account when assessing risk acceptability – in genome editing, for example – and raising awareness of the role and place of ethics in researchers’ work.\nWhat is IRGC currently working on?\nOur work is focused on two of EPFL’s areas of expertise: digitalization and life sciences. In digitalization, this year we are working on deepfakes, which is when text, audio or video content is falsified in order to mislead or manipulate people. We’re looking at what steps can be taken to ensure machine learning is used to improve diagnostics, predictions and decisions without being applied to actually producing deepfakes as well. In the life sciences, we have set up a program to help decision-makers achieve the social, regulatory and economic conditions needed to promote fairness in the burgeoning field of precision medicine.

As this celebratory year comes to an end, we look back at some of the highlights – all captured for posterity in a permanent online album at .\nB for Book\n. To mark this special year, EPFL commissioned three renowned photographers – Catherine Leutenegger, Bogdan Konopka and Olivier Christinat – to explore the campus from multiple perspectives. The resulting , which captures science, buildings and people in their full glory, is like a special gift: one that the photographers gave to EPFL, that EPFL gave to itself and to the public, and that people can give to each other.\nC for Campus Lectures\n. EPFL invited no fewer than 13 prestigious speakers – including five Nobel laureates – to give public speeches on campus. The series included captivating presentations from best-selling author Yuval Noah Harari and 2018 Fields Medal-winning mathematician Alessio Figalli.\nE for Education\n. For its 50th anniversary year, EPFL shone a spotlight on its three missions, the first of which – alphabetically – is education. On 17 May, the School held an  for over 300 teachers, guidance counselors and other education practitioners. The event was an opportunity to take a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, how to teach science and manage the transition from high school to college. The key takeaway from the day came in a speech by Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University, who said: “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing.”\nI for Innovation\n. The School’s second mission, again in alphabetical order, is innovation – a theme that also had its own dedicated event with an  in late November. That’s when EPFL invited industry leaders and successful entrepreneurs to talk about their research partnerships and joint ventures with EPFL and how such initiatives help foster innovative thinking. The very next day, the School also held its very first , where attendees had an opportunity to learn about many of EPFL’s startups – from budding enterprises to late-stage companies.\nN for New Logo\n. After a long wait, and some trepidation, EPFL’s new logo finally arrived. And we’re happy to report that it’s been embraced with open arms. That much is clear from the many snapshots of the logo standing proud on the new Place Maurice Cosandey, often with a smiling crowd beside it – and in some cases on top of it!\nO for Open Science\n... Open science is set to be one of the biggest battles in science in the coming decade. And EPFL is deeply involved, giving open and reproducible research the attention it deserves. On 18 October, the School held an , inviting world-class researchers and science policymakers to share their thoughts on some pressing questions at this time of crucial change.\n...\nand for \n. EPFL flung open its doors to the public on 14 and 15 September. The event was a resounding success, helped no doubt by the bright sunshine, as close to 40,000 people came along to take a peek behind the scenes. Some 1,500 staff and students pitched in, organizing around 300 public events. Highlights included the Scientastic science fair, Drone Days, and activities led by star names such as Fred Courant, Physics Girl and Aleksi Briclot.\nR for Research\n. EPFL’s third and final mission, alphabetically speaking, is research. Again, the theme got the attention it rightly deserved for the School’s jubilee year with the  – events covering different themes and spread across our five campuses in Sion, Neuchâtel, Geneva, Fribourg and Lausanne. Between 10 and 14 September, key figures from the worlds of academia, politics and industry spoke about how research can contribute to society and discussed collaborative initiatives with and between campuses.\nW for Women\n.

{"id": 1035, "text": "It’s often difficult to completely eliminate a bacterial infection with antibiotics; part of the population usually manages to survive. We’ve known about this phenomenon for quite some time, dating back nearly to the discovery of penicillin. For more than 50 years, scientists have believed that the resistant bacteria were individuals that had stopped growing and dividing.\nUp to now, in fact, it hasn’t been possible to track the growth of cells before and after their exposure to antibiotics, which makes any analysis of the phenomenon quite imprecise. “Using microfluidics, we can now observe every bacterium individually, instead of having to count a population,” says John McKinney, director of EPFL’s Microbiology and Microsystems Laboratory (LMIC).\nActive survivors\n This new tool has revealed quite a few surprises. “We thought that surviving bacteria made up a fixed population that stopped dividing, but instead we found that some of them continued to divide and others died. The persistent population is thus very dynamic, and the cells that constitute it are constantly changing – even though the total number of cells remains the same. Because they’re dividing, the bacteria can mutate and thus develop resistance in the presence of the antibiotic,” explains LMIC scientist Neeraj Dhar.\nThis point is extremely important. “We were able to eliminate a purely genetic explanation of the phenomenon,” continues Dhar. In other words, “a population of genetically identical bacteria consists of individuals with widely varying behavior. Some of them can adapt to stressors that they have not previously encountered, thanks to the selection of persistent individuals. This could lead to a revision of the entire theory of adaptation,” says McKinney.\nIntermittent efficiency\n The EPFL scientists were particularly interested in a relative of the tuberculosis bacterium. Their observations enabled them to formally challenge the argument that persistent bacteria are those that have stopped growing and dividing. “We were able to reveal the role of an enzyme whose presence is necessary in order for the antibiotic to work, and show that the bacilli produced this enzyme in a pulsatile and random manner,” explains Dhar. “Our measurements showed that bacterial death correlated more closely with the expression of this enzyme than with their growth factor.” The research is being published this week in .\nThese conclusions could mark the beginning of a new theory of bacterial resistance, or perhaps even introduce a new view of how such resistance evolves. Further research is being done using other microorganisms, such as tuberculosis and E. coli bacteria. The persistence of some cancer cells to treatment could also be studied in a different manner. “It’s a new approach for trying to figure out why some infections are so difficult to eliminate. The techniques we’ve developed for this study are now also being used to develop new antibiotics, in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies,” says McKinney, adding that “it is the microengineering expertise at EPFL that has enabled us to create these innovative tools and open up new avenues for investigation.”", "summary": "EPFL scientists used microfluidics to observe the behavior of individual tuberculosis-like bacteria in the presence of antibiotics.

{"id": 1036, "text": "One day we may be able to cross Europe in a pod travelling 1,000 kilometers per hour through a vacuum tube. In the meantime, a team of EPFL students has a more immediate challenge: they must develop a prototype pod within the next three months that will compete in the Hyperloop Pod Competition in July. The EPFLoop team has the support of the school’s Senior Management and is being supervised by Professor Mario Paolone at the Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory, with Swissmetro project coordinator Marcel Jufer serving in an advisory role. The team members introduced themselves at an event at the Rolex Forum on Thursday night. “We may be outsiders, but we can bring in a fresh perspective,” says Denis Tudor, the EPFLoop team manager.\nThe Hyperloop Pod Competition was launched in 2015 by billionaire Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX. He wants to create a new mode of transport whereby pods zip through vacuum tubes at speeds of up to 1,000 km/h. And he set up this competition – open primarily to university students – through SpaceX in order to test the technical feasibility of various aspects of his concept. The 2018 edition challenges students to come up with a design that can travel through a 1.5 km-long tube as fast as possible without crashing upon arrival.\nWho can do better than 323 km/h across 1.5 km?\nOut of the 5,000 teams that submitted proposals, just 20 were selected. “All of the selected teams have already competed once, except EPFL,” says Tudor. The winning pod last year, by TU Munich, reached a speed of 323 km/h. “I’m sure we can do better,” says Tudor, who took part in the competition twice with another team during a stint in Silicon Valley.\nThe EPFL team’s design is being kept under wraps – all we know is that it impressed the competition’s selection committee. The team comprises around 50 students in mechanical engineering, electric propulsion, computer simulation, avionics, electrical engineering, aerodynamics, design and other disciplines. “Now we need to build the prototype as quickly as possible. We are under enormous pressure, and the hardest part is that we don’t have full control over all the elements,” adds Tudor, himself a PhD student in electrical engineering.\nThe competition will be held on a test ramp near the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, on 22 July 2018. \nFollow on:", "summary": "A team of EPFL students is one of 20 selected to take part in the Hyperloop Pod Competition this summer.

Three cargo bikes – a greener alternative to cars and much more practical than hand trolleys – are now available on campus. It's a free, self-service system: users book and unlock the bikes via a smartphone app.\n“The advantages of cargo bikes are widely known. They're more environmentally friendly, more flexible, easier on the wallet and practical for users,” says Luca Fontana, head of mobility for EPFL's Sustainable Campus initiative. “We’re leading the way in Switzerland since we’re the first ones to offer free of charge cargo bikes sharing, thanks to our partnership with Danish startup Donkey Republic. The locks are controlled via an app and a Bluetooth connection, so there’s no need to pick up a key.”\nThe three electric cargo bikes each have their own station: on Avenue Piccard, in the Esplanade underground car park and opposite building BC. After use, the bikes must be returned to their station and plugged in to recharge. The battery can run for 30 to 40 kilometers, and the bike can reach a maximum speed of 25kmph. All users have to do is register on the Donkey Republic platform. They can then check availability, find the nearest bike and book it for up to 48 hours.\nThe bikes are designed to carry a payload of up to 100 kilos. “This two-wheeled model is very easy to handle, although it takes a couple of minutes to get used to riding it,” explains Fontana. “And the little motor really helps when carrying heavy loads.” The bikes come equipped with a Trakyv anti-theft chip and can even be used off campus if need be.\nThe aim of this Sustainable Campus initiative is to meet the regular demand from associations, students and staff who have to lug equipment across campus every day.

{"id": 1044, "text": "Drones are being used for a growing number of purposes. Their designs are ever more efficient, and techniques for flying them are being further refined all the time. But drones still have the same weak point: their battery. This is particularly true of propeller drones, which are popular for information-gathering purposes in dangerous or hard-to-reach regions. These drones can fly for only around 15 minutes at a time because their engines quickly burn through their batteries. One way of addressing this limitation – without weighing the drones down – would be to recharge them while aloft using a power beaming system: an energy-rich laser beam that is guided by a tracking system and shines directly on photovoltaic cells on the drones’ exterior.\nSeveral labs around the world, including in the US, have been working on this idea in recent years. LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off based at Innovation Park, has now demonstrated the feasibility of using a high-power laser for this purpose. What’s more, LakeDiamond’s laser emits a wavelength that cannot damage human skin or eyes – the issue of safety is paramount, since the system is meant for use with civilian drones. LakeDiamond’s technology is built around diamonds that are grown in the company’s lab and subsequently etched at the atomic level.\nWorld record for power\nDespite appearances, standard laser beams are not as straight as they seem: as they travel, they expand ever so slightly, leading to a loss in density as they go. But LakeDiamond’s system produces a laser beam with a wavelength of 1.5 µm that, in addition to being safe, can travel much farther without losing strength. “Systems developed by other companies and labs, often for military applications, employ lasers that are more powerful and thus more dangerous for humans,\" says Pascal Gallo, CEO of LakeDiamond. His company took the opposite tack: their technology transforms the rays emitted by a simple low-power diode into a high-quality laser beam. Their beam has a larger diameter, and its rays remain parallel over a longer distance – in this case up to several hundred meters.\nIn LakeDiamond’s laser, the light produced by a diode is directed at a booster composed of reflective material, an optical component and a small metal plate to absorb the heat. The breakthrough lies not with this set-up, which already exists, but with the fact that the emitted beam is only a few dozen watts strong. The secret is using a small square lab-grown diamond as the optical component, as this delivers unparalleled performance. LakeDiamond's system holds the world record for continuous operation using a wavelength in the middle of the infrared range – it delivers more than 30 watts in its base configuration. “That’s equivalent to around 10,000 laser pointers,” adds Gallo.\nThe lab-grown diamonds’ key properties include high transparency and thermal conductivity. Achieving those things – and mastering the nano-etching process – took the researchers over ten years of development. LakeDiamond grows its diamonds through a process of chemical vapor deposition, an approach that ensures their purity and reproducibility. The surfaces of the resulting tiny square diamonds are then sculpted at the nano level using expertise developed in Niels Quack's lab at EPFL (\n). Thanks to their inherent properties and etched shapes, the diamonds are able to transfer heat to a small metal plate that dissipates it, while at the same time reflecting light in such a way as to create a laser beam.\n“To achieve greater power – say to recharge a larger drone – these lasers could easily be operated in series,” says Nicolas Malpiece, who is in charge of power beaming at LakeDiamond. The company’s remote recharging system works in the lab but will require further development and refinement before it’s ready for field use. What would happen if a drone flies behind an obstacle and is cut off from its laser energy source? Several approaches to this problem are currently being explored. A small back-up battery could take over temporarily, or, for information-gathering missions over rough terrain for example, the drone could simply return to within range of the laser in order to top up its battery.\nThis energy transmission system is also interesting for other areas of application. It can for example be used for charging and transmitting data to satellites. The development of the system is included in a support program of the Swiss Space Office, which began on 1 November and runs for two years.", "summary": "A small lab-grown diamond measuring a few millimeters per side could one day enable civilian drones to be recharged in mid-flight through a laser.

{"id": 1052, "text": "Are renewable energies coupled with energy efficiency too expensive? Regardless of whether the Swiss people choose a future based largely on fossil fuels, nuclear power or a combination of renewable energy sources, the cost of our future energy system is not likely to vary much. At least that’s what , the energy calculator developed by EPFL, has determined.\nBetween now and 2050, the Swiss energy system is going to undergo fundamental changes in view of the decision of the Federal Council and Parliament to forgo nuclear power and their commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Switzerland’s future energy system will have to fulfill these objectives. The Energy Center and the IPESE lab have developed a calculator to assess various alternatives for this energy transition. It can be used to compare their impact in terms of CO2 emissions, energy independence, the balance of energy payments, and costs. This last indicator includes the cost of importing energy-related agents (petroleum products, electricity, uranium, etc.) and infrastructure costs (power grids, production units, etc.).\nIt turns out that an energy system based largely on fossil fuels, nuclear power or a combination of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency will all cost about the same. The differences are less than 10% (see first graph), which is within the estimates’ margin of uncertainty. “This result is not really surprising,” according to François Vuille, director of development at the Energy Center. “This is mainly because renewable energy (especially photovoltaic solar power) and energy-efficiency solutions (electric vehicles, for example) will be increasingly competitive. The cost of these technologies will continue to decline, while the cost of conventional solutions are likely to increase, in part because of the high cost of new nuclear technologies and the long-term rise in the price of finite resources (petroleum, gas, etc.).”\nIf the scenario of renewable energy combined with energy efficiency is eventually selected, it would certainly lead to a rise in investments. But that rise would be offset by a decrease in the amount paid to import fuels (graph 1). If the nuclear scenario is chosen, replacing our nuclear power plants with new, safer, more efficient and more expensive ones would lead to a significantly higher production cost than today, even if the amount of the increase is difficult to estimate.\nThe total bill will go up but remain flat per capita \n It should also be noted that, given the volatility of market prices, the costs associated with scenarios that depend on non-renewable resources are the least predictable. On the other hand, solar and wind energy are free resources and their operating costs are very low and largely predictable. That said, the extent to which the cost of renewable-energy equipment will decline by 2050, especially for photovoltaic and deep geothermal technologies, is difficult to quantify today.\nEnergyscope.ch, the online calculator, also shows that the future energy system, whichever one is chosen, will cost between 24 and 26 billion francs per year (excluding taxes), versus 22 billion francs today. This increase is related mainly to the growing population, which should rise from around 8 million today to some 9 million in 2050. Looking at per-capita figures, however, the annual cost will be about the same as today: between 2,700 and 2,900 francs in 2050 versus 2,700 francs today. This figure includes the cost of energy (gas, oil, electricity, etc.), equipment (heat pumps, etc.) and infrastructure (grids, power plants, etc.).\nAll the other indicators vary\n While the economic parameter is relatively unaffected by the selected scenario, the same is not true for the other indicators: in the future scenarios, all the other indicators vary significantly depending on the energy choices. The selected system will have a major impact in terms of CO2 emissions, the environmental footprint, supply security and the balance of energy payments. The CO2 impact, for example, could vary by nearly 70% between a highly renewable scenario and a scenario based largely on fossil fuels (see second graph). The level of energy independence varies to the same degree, while end consumption and the environmental impact of our waste vary by around 30% among the different scenarios.", "summary": "Whether Switzerland opts for fossil fuels, renewable energy or nuclear power, the cost will be about the same in 2050.

{"id": 1057, "text": "Why do people say that if the doctorates are doing well, the entire institution is doing well?\nJacques Giovanola - \nOur doctoral students are brilliant. They are the inspiration for EPFL. They are the vectors for innovation. It is they who will become the professors and scientists of tomorrow and who will in turn provide a framework for undergraduates and doctoral students. Alternatively, it is they who will initiate the renewal of our businesses to enable them to meet the ever-changing challenges. Without our doctoral students, EPFL would not be where it is now.\nWhat is the appeal of the Doctoral School?\nJacques Giovanola - \nThe doctorate has evolved over the last twenty years. Before that, a doctoral student was a research assistant who was doing his thesis. Today, the doctoral student is a professional in training and it’s important to prepare him or her for the challenges that lie ahead. 60% of our doctoral students will follow a career in the private or public sector, in major companies, start-ups or SMEs, and it’s important that these 60% are also prepared for an environment that is quite different from the academic world. Furthermore, research is increasingly being done in teams and breakthroughs are the result of interdisciplinary collaboration. EPFL adapted to this development by setting up its . Since 2003, every student who wishes to produce a thesis must enroll on one of our.\nWhat do the doctoral programs bring to a doctoral student?\nJacques Giovanola - \nThey are designed to act as a support for the doctoral students. One of our aims is to promote interdisciplinary work. It’s no longer possible to do your thesis all alone in a corner. Communication with others is essential in order to share ideas and acquire the knowledge necessary to complete your research. Doctoral programs will give students the opportunity to establish networks between the various disciplines. Interdisciplinary courses and seminars are organized. The photonics program, for example, brings together representatives from the disciplines of Basic Sciences (SB) and Engineering (STI). However, there is still much to do in this area of scientific emulation.\nDoes the selection of the candidates operate across this program?\nJacques Giovanola -\n Yes. Candidates have to support their proposed thesis, which enables them to confirm the validity of their subject and to make good where necessary. Our role is to work closely with the doctoral students. We accompany them throughout their thesis in the form of sponsorship that enables them to refer to contact persons whom they can approach. Our campus counts over 120 different nationalities, with no less than 1900 doctoral students working under the supervision of 350 thesis directors. Suffice it to say that this cultural melting pot demands certain adaptations, in view of the very different backgrounds from which the candidates come. Our objective is to ensure the quality of the education so that our doctoral students can produce the best work possible, in the best conditions that can be.\nHow do you see your role as Dean of the Doctoral School?\nJacques Giovanola - \nMy role is manifold, but one of the tasks that I take very seriously is to help the doctoral students to find a job commensurate with their training once they have qualified. We start preparing for this in the first year of the doctorate. The thesis director must ask the student what his or her career plans are. It is imperative that the student has career plans in place, which he or she will refine throughout the preparation of the thesis. This is why the Doctoral School also provides training to help doctoral students to position themselves on the job market. They must learn essential skills that will enable them to put a value on their research and to make prospective employers see what they can bring to their business – in other words, what their added value is. I can think of nothing more disappointing than to see young PhDs signing on the dole.\nDoes the Doctoral School have any links with industry?\nJacques Giovanola - \nWe have a committee that works with industry to lead discussions on what industry expects from our doctoral students, and how they might meet these expectations whilst making best use of their scientific knowledge. Major companies and startups regularly hire our PhDs. Yet we still have work to do in order to change attitudes at the SME level. I would very much like to see our collaboration with  put on a firm basis. We are preparing to put in place a framework of conditions so that our doctoral students can do their thesis in collaboration with businesses based in Innovation Square, either directly at the company’s premises in Innovation Square or on campus. This will create a first-rate opportunity for our doctoral students. It also illustrates the vital links that EPFL is developing with industry in order to circulate knowledge.\n____________________________________________\nEvolution of the doctorate at EPFL\n The Doctoral School was established in 2003 and became obligatory for all EPFL doctoral students in 2006.

During total eclipses of the sun, it’s possible to see the stars in the sky, and the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington used this event to measure their exact position in the heavens. In doing so, he realized that their light is deviated by the mass of the sun. Einstein was right!”\n Today, satellites can emulate solar eclipses by positioning small masks in the optical paths of their telescopes. This technique enables the continued observation of the sun’s outline, and helps us to understand how its corona functions. Scientifically, there won’t be much to learn from the eclipse of January 4, but the event is still worth following.\n Link:", "summary": "This Tuesday, January 4, the sun has an important rendez-vous with the moon!

{"id": 1063, "text": "The project to build the Romande Energie-EPFL solar park was announced in 2009, and construction took place in phases. When it comes fully online today, the solar park will generate 2.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, which is equivalent to the annual consumption of 610 households. Phased construction meant that the project’s technical solutions kept pace with advances in the state of the art and the market. A technological showpiece, this solar park is proof of the maturity of solar energy and its enormous potential.\nPromoting renewable energies through an innovative partnership\nThe partnership between Romande Energie and EPFL goes beyond simple electricity generation. The construction of the solar park is coupled with a strategic partnership focussed on encouraging innovation.\n In fact, 15% of the investment is devoted to projects at several EPFL laboratories working on solar energy and to related applications. EPFL is engaged in several cutting-edge research projects in this area. Evidence of them can be seen, for example, in the Grätzel panels lining the western side of the SwissTech Convention Center and in the coloured panels gracing the southern facade of the ELL building – two projects supported by Romande Energie. In addition, a \"Romande Energie Solar Lab” will open this summer, allowing researchers to evaluate the performance of solar panel prototypes from their labs in the real-world environment.\nMarking the end of construction and the start of 25 years of power generation\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by officials from both Romande Energie and EPFL, along with Jacqueline de Quattro, state councilor in charge of the Department of Planning and the Environment, and Roger Nordmann, national councilor and president of the association Swissolar.\n “Today we are celebrating the launch of a solar park that, during its lifespan of at least 25 years, is expected to generate nearly 60 million kilowatt-hours of electricity,” said Pierre-Alain Urech, CEO of Romande Energie. André Schneider, Vice-President for Resources and Infrastructure at EPFL, said: “Through this project, EPFL is not only breaking new ground but is also showing the real potential for solar energy production in our country.

{"id": 1064, "text": "One thing is certain: one day our cars will drive themselves. But how will we make the transition from a handful of autonomous and connected cars today to a true smart system offering enhanced safety, comfort and seamless and robust operation, in just 15 years’ time? Researchers who worked on the European AutoNet2030 project believe it can be achieved by combining driving assistance technologies and inter-vehicle communications. They have recently shown that it is possible for vehicles with or without drivers to operate in high-speed, multi-lane traffic autonomously under real-life conditions. This is a key step in the ongoing shift towards autonomous driving. EPFL’s contribution to this project came in the form of a cooperative maneuvering control algorithm.\nThanks to a communication protocol based on Wi-Fi, vehicles can now share information among each other. This, combined with an array of driving-assistance devices – GPS, lasers, video cameras and other sensors – gives vehicles the ability to drive completely on their own. That said, it will be another 15 years before most vehicles are equipped with these devices, heralding a true driverless future.\nCooperation and autonomy\nIn the next few years, how will these cutting-edge vehicles rolling off the assembly lines fit into the traffic system alongside legacy vehicles? One option under study is to have automated vehicles travel in convoys. For example, a manually-driven truck could lead a platoon of autonomous tractor trailers moving at a constant speed and at an equal distance from each other. This approach has been successfully tested over hundreds of kilometers in Australia. The only problem is that this type of convoy behaves as a discrete block which, above a given number of vehicles, becomes increasingly difficult to manage.\nThe AutoNet2030 researchers came up with another solution: a cooperative and distributed system. Out goes the leader, as each connected vehicle communicates directly with other vehicles in the immediate vicinity. They then adjust their speed and position independently of each other. The convoy has no trouble driving on one or more lanes on a highway or reconfiguring when another vehicle joins the group. Each vehicle also benefits from its neighbors' ‘eyes’, effectively enjoying 360 degree perception. What's more, there’s no upper limit to the size of the convoy in theory, since each member positions itself independently.\nSimple units, complex behavior\nConvoys are managed using control software based on an algorithm developed by EPFL’s Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (DISAL). “We have been working on this type of distributed control algorithm for around ten years. Simply put, the idea is to find a way for agents that are not particularly clever – robots or cars – to work together and achieve complex group behavior,” said Alcherio Martinoli, the head of DISAL. In mathematical terms, this means that the algorithm uses information that it receives from the agents’ sensors to guide the convoy’s movements in real time. The convoy automatically and constantly reorganizes when, for example, another vehicle joins or leaves it, it changes lanes, or it adapts to target speeds. The DISAL researchers began by managing robots on simulators before moving on to real miniature robots and then to cars on simulators. Finally, as part of the AutoNet2030 project, they managed to get to real vehicles on the road.\nThe final demonstration took place at the end of October 2016 in Sweden, on the AstaZero test track. Three vehicles were used: an automated truck and car and – a key aspect of the project – a networked though manually-driven car. The researchers equipped the non-automated car with GPS and laser sensors and a human-machine interface allowing the driver to follow instructions on joining the convoy.\nInitial demonstration\n“It may not seem so impressive with only three cars, but for the first time we were able to validate what we had achieved in the simulation. And the number of vehicles in the convoy has no impact on the complexity of the control mechanism,” said Martinoli. What’s next? “This is a proof of concept,” said Guillaume Jornod, the EPFL scientist who ran the trials. “We are hoping that, with a rise in demand, carmakers will come up with ever cheaper solutions for converting legacy vehicles, that they will coordinate their efforts with the community working on the Internet of things, and that we will be able to deploy and improve this multi-lane convoy system for heterogeneous vehicles.”\nIn addition to EPFL, the AutoNet2030 project involved: Institute of Communications and Computer Systems (Greece, coordinator), Broadbit (Hungary), Baselabs (Germany), Centro Ricerche Fiat (Italy), ARMINES – Mines ParisTech – INRIA (France), Scania (Sweden), Hitachi Europe and the Technische Universitaet Dresden (Germany). \nThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 610542.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed an algorithm for automated vehicles to operate in traffic alongside manually-driven vehicles.

Their system can be placed directly on a person’s skin or integrated into a bracelet. It analyzes specific biomarkers contained in sweat to give valuable insight into the wearer’s health. It can determine the sodium and potassium concentrations in the person’s sweat, for example, and measure their body temperature and pH. The data thus collected can be sent directly to a smartphone. The system was presented at the 63\nrd\n International Electron Devices Meeting in San Francisco – a flagship industry event bringing together key figures from all over the world involved in the business or academic side of micro- and nanotechnology.\nCollecting, encapsulating and analyzing sweat – all on a single chip\nThe system uses capillary action to “pump” miniscule amounts of sweat into the heart of the chip, where it is analyzed. The chip contains four silicon sensors that are only around 20 nanometers thick, making them extremely sensitive. Each sensor is coated with a different material so that they can each detect different biomarkers. “Our platform is truly modular. By depositing different biochemical layers on each of the miniature sensors, we can measure a host of variables ranging from electrolytes and metabolites to tiny molecules and proteins. That gives users personalized real-time data,” says Esmeralda Megally, CEO of Xsensio.\nExtreme miniaturization\nThe system includes two fluidic layers that sit between the chip and the user’s skin. These layers “pump” up sweat from the skin and carry it to the sensors. And because this pump relies entirely on capillary action, it runs continuously and without electricity. “Ours is the only device out there that includes such a system on a chip,” says Ionescu. “Even today’s most advanced devices use sensors that are 10,000 times bigger than ours, and need a larger volume of sweat to be able to effectively analyze biomarkers.” Such extreme miniaturization was made possible thanks to sensor technology developed at the Nanolab – the same technology that’s used in computer microprocessors. Xsensio, which is coming up with the marketing strategy for the system, contributed two innovations: the nanofluid interface with users’ skin and the thin biochemical layers that enable the sensors to detect specific biomarkers. Now the project team is working on incorporating the system into a bracelet or other wearable device so that it can be launched on the market.\nDetecting diseases and getting a snapshot of users’ health\nThe data that the system collects can give important insight into both a user’s health and wellness.

{"id": 1071, "text": "Leprosy is an infectious disease with gruesome symptoms. It damages the skin, peripheral nerves, the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Despite being curable with multidrug therapy, leprosy still persists in many developing countries, with more than 200,000 new cases every year and increasing drug-resistant strains of the leprosy bacterium, \nMycobacterium leprae,\n emerging.\nTo fight leprosy, scientists need to better understand the biology of \nM. leprae\n, and specifically how it interacts with its host and resists antibiotics. However, studying the bacterium is difficult, as it cannot be grown in a lab.\nNow, an international team of scientists led by  Institute have isolated, sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 154 strains of \nM. leprae \nfrom around the world. The study found several genes that are associated with resistance to antibiotics, including new genes that might point to previously unknown mechanisms of drug resistance.\n“This is an important finding,” says Stewart Cole. “The way clofazimine, one of the main leprosy drugs, works is completely unknown but now we have a new lead to investigate thanks to this analysis of multidrug-resistant \nM. leprae\n.”\nIsolating \nM. leprae\n DNA was a challenging task, as the amount of bacteria in skin biopsies is generally low and varies greatly between patients. And after extracting the DNA, the researchers had to separate the bacterial DNA from the patient’s. They did this with two techniques, one that increased the bacterium’s DNA and one that decreased the patient’s DNA. Once the bacterium’s DNA was isolated, the researchers were able to sequence it and compare it with that from other samples.\nThe scientists also found eight strains of \nM. leprae\n whose genomes harbored an incredibly large number of random mutations, accumulated over a period of a few years or perhaps decades. These eight strains are all resistant to multi-drug therapy, and were the only ones in the study in which a gene that is responsible for DNA repair is disrupted.\n“It’s a fascinating survival strategy against antibiotics,” explains Andrej Benjak, the study’s leading author. “Disrupting DNA repair will result in a storm of random mutations, increasing the chance that the right gene mutates at the right spot and lead to drug resistance. But random mutations can be deadly, so it’s like a desperate, genetic Russian roulette for the bacterium.”\nThe researchers also discovered that leprosy itself might have originated in the Far East. Several bacterial strains from East Asia belonged to the ancestral lineages of the leprosy bacilli. “People naturally assume that old human diseases originated in Africa, but for leprosy, the evidence points to Eurasia,” says Charlotte Avanzi, one of the study’s authors from Cole’s lab.\nNarrowing down the location of the origin will facilitate the reconstruction of the spread of the disease. “We need more samples from Central Asia and the Middle East, but these are hard to get due to current geopolitical issues,” says Avanzi. “For Europe, where leprosy is eradicated, we have to rely on ancient human remains. But it’s possible — we have developed the tools, and now we are ready to sequence even more samples.”\nContributors\nArmauer Hansen Research Institute (Ethiopia)\nOswaldo Cruz Foundation (Brazil)\nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan)\nAUEN Polyclinic (Japan)\nUniversidade Federal do Pará (Brazil)\nUniversity of São Paulo (Brazil)\nFederal University of Pará (Brazil)\nFederal University of Goiás (Brazil)\nNational Leprosy Elimination Programme (Yemen)\nLudwig Maximilian University of Munich (Germany)\nUniversidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (Mexico)\nProgramme National Lèpre de Guinée (Guinea)\nUniversity of Abomey-Calavi (Benin)\nCentre National d’Appui à la Lutte Contre la Maladie, (Mali)\nMinistry of Public Health (Niger)\nUniversity of Brasília (Brazil)\nTropical Institute of Medicine (Belgium)\nLauro Souza Lima Institute (Brazil)\nColorado State University (USA)\nFunding\nFondation Raoul Follereau\nSwiss National Science Foundation (FNS)\nSwiss Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV)\nHeiser Program of the New York Community Trust for Research in Leprosy\nReference\nAndrej Benjak, Charlotte Avanzi, Pushpendra Singh, Chloé Loiseau, Selfu Girma, Philippe Busso, Amanda N.

But the role that mountain streams play in global carbon fluxes has not yet been evaluated; until now scientists have focused mainly on streams and rivers in low-altitude tropical and boreal regions. \nÅsa Horgby, a PhD student at EPFL’s Stream Biofilm and Ecosystem Research Laboratory (SBER), along with a team of international scientists has performed the first large-scale study of the CO\n2 \nemissions of mountain streams and their role in global carbon fluxes. They found that these streams have a higher average CO\n2\n emission rate per square meter than streams at lower altitudes, due in part to the additional turbulence caused as water flows down mountain slopes. So even though these streams make up just 5% of the global surface area of the fluvial networks, they likely account for 10% to 30% of CO\n2\n emissions from these networks. The scientists’ findings were published today in \nNature Communications\n.\nDeveloping a new model \n The research team drew on a study , which found that gas exchange velocities across the air-water interface in mountain streams occurs 100 times faster than previously thought. Starting from mountain streams in the Canton of Valais, EPFL researchers were able to improve a calculation method that until then had been the standard. \nIn their new study, the scientists collected big environmental data from the streams draining the world’s main mountain ranges, specifically focusing on their hydrologic and geomorphologic properties as well as on the soil organic carbon content within the catchments. Then they used these big data to develop a model to estimate the natural CO2 emissions from more than 1.8 million mountain streams worldwide.\nFinding out where the CO\n2\n comes from\n “We have known for a number of years that freshwater ecosystems emit roughly the same amount of CO\n2\n that oceans absorb, but we had never before done rigorous studies on the role of the countless mountain streams for the global CO\n2\n fluxes. Until now they were aqua incognita,” says Tom Battin, the head of SBER and the paper’s corresponding author. “But our latest findings now open up exciting new research avenues, such as to better understand where all that CO\n2\n comes from and how we can more accurately account for the world’s alpine regions in our assessments of the global carbon cycle.”\nThe scientists’ findings seem to indicate that the CO\n2\n comes from geological sources, given that carbonate rock dominates geology in numerous regions around the world. These rocks were formed from “skeletal” components of marine microorganisms that lived millions of years ago when Earth was largely covered by oceans. \nA step forward \n Although these findings mark an important step forward, numerous uncertainties remain. According to Battin, additional measurements in mountain streams around the world are required to better constrain uncertainties. Furthermore, long-term monitoring of carbon fluxes in mountain streams is critical to understand how climate change affects their biogeochemistry. “We are just starting to discover the role of mountain streams for the global carbon cycle,” says Battin. “These are exciting times for environmental sciences”.", "summary": "For the first time, an EPFL-led team of scientists has measured the total amount of CO\n2\n emissions from mountain streams worldwide.

The aim? To ensure that our roads are as safe as possible and that the freedom that comes with personal mobility remains at the heart of society.\nNissan is undertaking this pioneering work in collaboration with the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland (EPFL). Far reaching research on Brain Machine Interface (BMI) systems by scientists at EPFL already allows disabled users to manoeuvre their wheelchairs by thought transference alone. The next stage is to adapt the BMI processes to the car – and driver – of the future.\nProfessor José del R. Millán, leading the project, said: “The idea is to blend driver and vehicle intelligence together in such a way that eliminates conflicts between them, leading to a safer motoring environment.”\nAlthough thought control – via brain-machine interface – is well established in the scientific world, the levels of concentration needed are exceptionally high. The Nissan/EPFL collaboration is developing systems that go to the next stage using statistical analysis to predict a diver’s intentions and to evaluate a driver’s cognitive state relevant to the driving environment.\nUsing brain activity measurement, eye movement patterns and by scanning the environment around the car in conjunction with the car’s own sensors, it should be possible to predict what the driver plans to do – be it a turn, an overtake, a lane change – and then assist with the manoeuvre in complete safety, thus improving the driving experience.\nFor the programme, the scientists at EPFL were joined by a researcher from Nissan this summer.

{"id": 1077, "text": "The circadian clock is an internal, biological “metronome” that dictates our 24-hour activity pattern. Biologically speaking, the circadian clock determines the synthesizing “rhythm” for a whole range of proteins that are involved in a multitude of biological processes that shift while we sleep or wake.\nIn the cell, DNA is tightly wound around proteins in a complex called chromatin. This 3D structure compacts the DNA, prevents DNA damage and, critically, regulates gene expression. DNA folding allows the regions of DNA that initiates transcription, called promoters, to recruit distal (far away from promoters) DNA regions, called enhancers, to regulate gene expression.\nGeneticists have been interested in this “promoter-enhancer looping” process and how it allows genes to be turned on in the right tissue and under the right conditions. However, very little is known about how the circadian clock regulates this critical part of gene expression to organize the day-night rhythm of protein expression, and if the formation of this looping changes over the day.\nThe  has now discovered the link between promoter-enhancer looping and the circadian clock. To do this, the researchers used circular chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq) on mouse liver and kidney tissue. The technique analyzes the spatial organization of chromatin in a cell and detects all the genomic regions that interact with a particular region of interest.\nThe study found that promoter-enhancer interactions oscillate along the 24-hour cycle in the chromatin of healthy mice, as opposed to mice without a functioning circadian clock. The researchers then inactivated a distal DNA enhancer element that contains instructions to transcribe Cryptochrome 1, which is a gene that produces a protein involved in maintaining the circadian rhythm itself. This small modification, far from the promoter of Cryptochrome 1, proved to be enough to disrupt the rhythmic chromatin looping in tissues, reduce the daily frequency of the gene’s transcription, and even shorten the circadian period of locomotion in mice.\nThis is the first evidence that a mutation in a non-coding region of the genome is able to influence the period of circadian locomotor activity. The findings show that oscillatory promoter-enhancer looping, controlled by the circadian clock, is one of the regulatory layers behind circadian transcription and overall 24-hour cyclic behavior in animals.\n“Most interestingly, we found a similar dynamic, or circadian, looping when we studied a gene called Glycogen synthase 2,” says Felix Naef. “The gene is essential for the storage of carbohydrates in the liver and the regulation of blood-glucose homeostasis, and our findings show that circadian looping is essential for broader physiological functions in the liver.”\nThe group’s next steps will be to study whether the dynamic rearrangements of chromatin might be a much more general phenomenon in mouse tissues, controlling other physiological functions. They will also be evaluating its involvement in clock-related diseases.", "summary": "EPFL biologists and geneticists have uncovered how the circadian clock orchestrates the 24-hour cycle of gene expression by regulating the structure of chromatin, the tightly wound DNA-protein complex of the cell.

Lithium technology is currently leading the way, but there are also hydrogen cars, which the major carmakers are betting on and Japan has allocated millions to developing. In this spirit, on Saturday 10th of September, EPFL inaugurates its prototype fueling station in Martigny, in the presence of Marc-Henry Favre, President of Martigny, Philippe Gillet, EPFL Vice-President as well as representatives from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE).\n200 years after Valais-based inventor Isaac de Rivaz came up with plans for hydrogen-powered carriages, this fueling station seeks to tap into the same energy vector. It is equipped with two fuel dispensers for charging battery-powered electric cars and for filling the tank of hydrogen cars. The station is packed with sensors and will provide the engineers with the data they need to measure, understand and improve all the steps involved in producing, compressing, storing and distributing the fuel in order to optimize the energy balance.\nClean energy\n “Valais is an ideal testing ground,” says Hubert Girault, who heads the Laboratory of Physical and Analytical Electrochemistry (LEPA). “This canton produces electricity using renewable energies like solar, wind and hydroelectric, and thanks to our decision to transform this electricity through electrolysis, we produce hydrogen without any CO\n2\n emissions.”\nHydrogen is commonly produced from natural gas, in a process that releases carbon dioxide. But that’s not how it works in Martigny. To keep the fueling station’s dispensers operating, the laboratory installed a megabattery capable of holding 400 kWh. It is connected to the power grid and, in addition to storing energy, it can also produce hydrogen thanks to a system developed specifically in Martigny.\nThe purpose of this facility is to see what fueling stations could be like once the car population shifts away from fossil energies. “We could, for example, set up a fleet of taxis or specially equip ambulance services, because you can fill up on hydrogen in 3 minutes versus 30 minutes for the battery-based technology,” says Girault. The hydrogen car is an electric car that works with a fuel cell and a small backup battery under its hood.\nTwo test cars will ply the roads in Valais in order to collect field data and consume some of the hydrogen. One of them will be used by Sinergy, the local utility company, in its day-to-day repair service, and the other will be used by EPFL.\nThis experimental fueling station is a collaborative effort of EPFL, the \nCentre de Recherches Energétiques et Municipales\n (CREM), Sinergy and the city of Martigny.

Laura Symul circumvented this difficulty by taking advantage of all the tools she has collected over the course of her studies. “I’m naturally curious, so I have floated between different departments and laboratories.” As such, she put together an animated film that was conceived, designed, and created just before the public defense of her doctoral thesis.\nThe young researcher initially earned a bachelor’s degree in physics before turning to electronics, robotics and IT and before joining the field of applied mathematics. That is how she discovered bioinformatics and decided to do her PhD in the EPFL Laboratory of Computational Biology. “Modeling entails putting an equation to a phenomenon. It’s an interesting challenge. My master’s work was quite abstract. However, the thesis has allowed me to work on actual data issued by biologists.”\nFor her thesis the doctoral student was required, in particular, to model the regulation of a gene in the liver after its transcription into messenger RNA. The complexity of the study is the reason why the PhD candidate decided on using a short animated film to explain her public defense to family and friends who are completely foreign to the world of science. “I think this is a good way to think about one’s work and what is important.”\nGiven her education, the researcher could combine her academic background in data visualization and illustration – two means of explaining science. “Visual communication interests me enormously. I produced many illustrations alongside my thesis, collaborating regularly with scientific journals.” Laura Symul is very interested by the emergence of data journalism in the United States and by scientific communication in particular.

{"id": 1104, "text": "It is the largest 3D map of the Universe produced to date. It is the fruit of a twenty-year collaboration of several hundred scientists from around thirty different institutions around the world, all united within the “Sloan Digital Sky Survey” (SDSS), with data collected from an optical telescope dedicated to the project located in New Mexico, in the United States.\nReleased today in the form of more than twenty scientific publications, this latest mapping of the night sky is an unprecedented and ambitious astronomical survey from 2014 until 2020. Resulting from the analysis of several millions of galaxies and quasars, this latest survey builds upon existing data as early as 1998 to fill certain gaps in cosmological history and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the expansion of the Universe.\nEPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) is directly involved in this important project. This latest cosmological survey of the SDSS, called “The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey” (eBOSS), includes more than 100 astrophysicists, of which several are researchers from EPFL. Jean-Paul Kneib, who heads EPFL’s Astrophysics Laboratory (LASTRO), initiated the eBOSS survey and was its principal investigator (PI) for several years.\n“In 2012, I launched the eBOSS project with the idea of ​​producing the most complete 3D map of the Universe throughout the lifetime of the Universe, implementing for the first time celestial objects that indicate the distribution of matter in the distant Universe, galaxies that actively form stars and quasars,” reports Jean-Paul Kneib. “It is a great pleasure to see the culmination of this work today. \"\n Thanks to the extensive theoretical models describing the Universe after the Big Bang, as well as observation of the Cosmic Microwave Backgound Radiation (CMBR), the infant Universe is relatively well known. Scientists have also explored its expansion history over the most recent few billion years from Supernovae distance measurements and galaxy maps, including those from previous phases of the SDSS. “We know both the ancient history of the Universe and its recent expansion history fairly well, but there’s a troublesome gap in the middle 11 billion years,” says cosmologist Kyle Dawson of the University of Utah, who leads the team announcing today’s results. “Thanks to five years of continuous observations, we have worked to fill in that gap, and we are using that information to provide some of the most substantial advances in cosmology in the last decade.”\n“Taken together, detailed analyses of the eBOSS map and the earlier SDSS experiments, we have now provided the most accurate expansion history measurements over the widest-ever range of cosmic time,” says Will Percival of the University of Waterloo, eBOSS’s Survey Scientist. “These studies allow us to connect all these measurements into a complete story of the expansion of the Universe.”\n The finalized map shows filaments of matter and voids that more precisely define the structure of the Universe since its beginnings, when it was only 380,000 years old. From there, the researchers measured the recurring patterns in the distribution of galaxies, thus identifying several key cosmological parameters, including the density of hypothetical dark matter and energy in the Universe, with a high degree of precision.\nTo carry out this survey, the teams involved in the eBOSS project looked at different galactic tracers that reveal the mass distribution in the Universe. For the part of the map relating to the Universe six billion years ago, researchers observed the oldest and reddest galaxies. For more distant eras, they concentrated on the youngest galaxies, the blue ones. To go back further, that is to say up to eleven billion years, they used quasars, galaxies whose super-massive black hole is extremely luminous.\nSlower expansion?\nThis map reveals the history of the Universe, and in particular, that the expansion of the Universe began to accelerate at some point and has since continued to do so. This seems to be due to the presence of dark energy, an invisible element that fits naturally into Einstein's general theory of relativity but whose origin is not yet understood.\nWhen eBOSS observations are compared with studies of the Universe’s early days, discrepancies appear in estimates of the Universe’s expansion rate. The currently accepted expansion rate, called the \"Hubble constant\", is 10% slower than the value calculated from the distances between the galaxies closest to us. It is unlikely that this 10% difference is random due to the high precision and wide variety of data in the eBOSS database.\nTo date, there is no commonly accepted explanation for these disagreements between the different estimations of the speed of expansion, but the fact that a still unknown form of matter or energy from the early Universe could have left traces in our history is an interesting possibility.", "summary": "An international consortium of scientists has analyzed, as part of a vast program of cosmological surveys, several million galaxies and quasars, thus retracing a more continuous history of the Universe and offering a better understanding of the mechanisms of its expansion.

A remarkable step was achieved this week by the team led by Dr. Fanny Meillaud and Dr. Matthieu Despeisse with a new world record efficiency of 10.7% for a single-junction microcrystalline silicon solar cell, independently confirmed at Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE CalLab PV Cells), Freiburg, Germany.\n“Deep understanding has been gained these last years in material quality, efficient light-trapping and cell design, which in combination with careful process optimization led to this remarkable world-record efficiency” says Simon Hänni, PhD student at IMT Neuchâtel. Importantly, the employed processes can be up-scaled to the module level. While standard wafer-based crystalline silicon PV technology implements absorber layers with a thickness of about 180 micrometers for module conversion efficiency of 15 to 20%, 10.7% efficiency was reached here with only 1.8 micrometers of silicon material, i.e. 100 times less material than for conventional technologies, and with cell fabrication temperature never exceeding 200°C. Thin-film silicon technology indeed offers the advantages of saving up on raw material and offering low energy payback time, thus allowing module production prices as low as 35 €/m2, reaching the price level of standard roof tiles.\nThe reported progress is of paramount importance for increasing further TF-Si PV devices efficiency and potential, as at least one microcrystalline silicon junction is systematically used in combination with an amorphous silicon junction to form multiple junction devices for a broader use of the solar spectrum. The reported record efficiency clearly indicates that the potential of TF-Si multi-junction devices can be extended to > 13.5% conversion efficiency with a minimum usage of abundant and non-toxic raw material at low costs (TF-Si PV modules implementing in their simplest form two glasses and few microns of zinc and of silicon for an easy recycling).\nWork leading to this result was supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE), the EU-FP7 program, the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI).", "summary": "EPFL’s Institute of Microengineering has reached a remarkable 10.7% efficiency single-junction microcrystalline silicon solar cell, clearly surpassing the previous world record of 10.1% held by the Japanese company Kaneka Corporation since 1998.

{"id": 1120, "text": "Just seven years ago, the presidents of 14 technological universities in both the northern and southern hemispheres gathered at EPFL to launch the Network of Excellence in Engineering Sciences of the French-speaking Community (RESCIF). As EPFL had been behind the initiative and would serve as host, it made sense for it to initially take the chair and fulfill the Network’s administrative functions.\nA new chapter in the Network’s history began today. Back on EPFL’s Lausanne campus yesterday evening, the current presidents of the original group of universities, as well as representatives of two schools that have since joined the Network, handed the RESCIF chairmanship over to Koffi N’Guessan, Director General of the Institut National Polytechnique Félix Houphouët-Boigny (INP-HB) in Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire.\n“It was great to be involved in setting up so many RESCIF projects, especially the various joint labs that we’ve created and the MOOCs program for Africa,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli. “I’m delighted to see that such a prestigious institution from the southern hemisphere will be at the helm, and I wish the Network every success. It will of course continue to have our unfailing support.”\nLet’s take a look back at RESCIF’s early years with \nYuri Changkakoti\n, the Network’s Secretary General until today. \nHow did RESCIF manage to go from a mere statement of intent to an effective network with so many successes under its belt in just a few years?\nThe initiative first came to be at the Francophonie Summit held in Montreux in 2010. Micheline Calmy-Rey and Patrick Aebischer immediately got behind the project. The Network’s founding act was signed soon afterwards. What’s truly remarkable is the trust that we were able to build among the partners from the outset. This was no doubt helped by the fact that we were all aware how important a real north-south partnership was for the modernization of our partner institutions.\nWhat has actually been achieved? \nOne of the driving forces behind RESCIF was the MOOCs designed specifically for Africa, which went hand in hand with EPFL’s commitment to invest in this new form of higher education. And the program came at just the right time – there was a lot of demand from our partners in Africa, where the number of young people is growing and there is a real need to train experts.\nHas the Network been a boon for research as well?\nYes, very much so. We’ve set up four joint labs. EPFL is directly involved in all of them to some extent. While two are still getting on their feet, two others – CURES, in Cameroon, and CARE, in Vietnam – have already published numerous scientific articles. Dozens of researchers have visited these labs for projects and training and as part of exchanges. And that’s only the beginning of what the network has achieved. Things were relatively slow to get off the ground, but we are now notching up a growing number of concrete results.\nIs there anything about how RESCIF is run that could have been or should now be done differently? \nIt’s a bit of a pipe dream, but I think the network lacks some central funding. That would make it easier to organize more regular meetings of experts in our priority areas, which are water, energy, health care, nutrition, urban planning and entrepreneurship. These types of scientific gatherings would help to increase the number of projects and deliver even more results.\nWhat’s next? \nWe’re going to continue with the MOOCs, by both creating joint MOOCs and helping our partners to build their own capacities. And an entrepreneurship program is also in the works. Our partners are really keen on making computational thinking a key field. EPFL will be ‘testing’ this concept starting in September. And our partner universities are likely to follow our lead, either through MOOCs or classroom learning.\nAre you nervous about handing things over?\nNot at all, I’m actually delighted that INP-HB is taking the reins. It was important that the network wasn’t just an EPFL ‘thing’ and that the chairmanship alternated between the north and the south. I have great confidence in our successors. And it does not all depend on the chair either: RESCIF may have reached cruising speed, but keeping this Network going over the long term is not easy – it remains a daily challenge.

{"id": 1122, "text": "EPFL researchers have opened the door to a new strategy to fight tuberculosis, the second leading cause of death from infectious disease after HIV. In a study published in EMBO Molecular Medicine on September 17th, EPFL professor Stewart Cole takes a hard look at the natural product pyridomycin, first reported in the 1950s, and determines exactly how it kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pyridomycin inhibits a vital enzyme, much like the best frontline antibiotics, but in a sufficiently different way so it can combat even the most antibiotic-resistant strains that have recently afflicted Russia, South Africa and North America.\n“We’ve rediscovered an old antibiotic that was never developed but may lead the way to treating both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of TB. And above all, the strategy of revisiting antibiotics to find new leads looks like a successful one,” says Cole.\nThe rise and fall of TB treatment\n Tuberculosis is not a disease of the past. Infections take 1.4 million lives every year, with the majority of those cases occurring in Asia and Africa. Drug-resistant strains of TB from places like India and the former Soviet Union are a global threat to public health, often brought to new countries by immigrant populations. More alarmingly, several strains have been discovered that are totally impervious to all currently available treatments. Once a resistant strain infects a human, there is little hope for survival.\nToday’s antibiotic dilemma can be traced back to the 1950s, when a new synthetic compound called “isoniazid” proved to be extremely effective against the malady. Nevertheless, with the recent onset of isoniazid-resistant strains, proper treatment involves four drugs and can last up to two years. Isoniazid has lost its status as the TB wonder drug.\nNew drug target, new hope\n “We have discovered what’s known in the pharmaceutical world as a new drug target, opening the door for the development of new drugs and therapies that attack the same mechanism,” explains Cole.\nLooking for a drug that will kill isoniazid-resistant strains led Stewart Cole on an investigative journey into the past. With a combination of scientific foresight and serendipity, Cole found pyridomycin, an antibiotic extracted from a soil microbe. It was discovered around the same time as isoniazid but was left by the wayside for 60 years.\nCole and his team found that the once-discarded antibiotic, like isoniazid, attacks one of the bacteria’s strongholds—the production of a fatty component in cell walls called mycolic acid. Mycolic acid protects the bacteria from traditional medical onslaughts by helping it weather short treatments or even hiding the microbial invader from the immune system. But Pyridomycin attacks the enzyme from a different entry point, meaning it kills isoniazid-resistant bacteria.\nGoing back to Nature for a cure\n Perhaps even more important than the potential for pyridomycin to combat drug-resistant strains of TB is the strategy that this approach evokes. Back in the 1970s, researchers and clinicians were very excited about synthetic drugs that were easy to make. Now, drug-resistant strains could force scientists to go back to naturally occurring compounds, no matter how difficult they are to make. Going back to look for unused natural antibiotics dips into a largely untapped pool of bioactive compounds, providing the potential to revive a floundering pharmaceutical sector by uncovering new medicines to treat drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and other bacteria.\nFor the next phase of his research Cole is currently collaborating with Professor Karl-Heinz Altmann at the ETH Zürich to synthesize pyridomycin and increase its availability to researchers with the eventual goal of beginning clinical trials. “To purify and synthesize pyridomycin from bacteria is the chemist’s equivalent of climbing Mount Everest,” says Cole, who is nevertheless confident that Altmann’s team has cracked the chemical synthesis problem.\n ****\nTowards a new tuberculosis drug: Pyridomycin – Nature’s isoniazid\n Ruben C Hartkoorn, Claudia Sala, João Neres, Florence Pojer, Sophie J.

{"id": 1126, "text": "From what you have seen and heard today, what is your viewpoint about digitalisation in Swiss schools, and maybe your vision for the future?\n I can see that a lot of progress is going on. It is not just empty talk; I see high hopes and possibilities. There are plans and development work that are realistic.\nCould you tell us about the Impact Programme that you are currently leading?\n The Impact Programme develops big processes; the most important ones are curriculum processes. These are developed in different ways in various levels of education. Many teachers are retiring, new ones are arriving. We ask professors how they found these processes and what there is to develop from their point of view; we are doing a lot of researches. There is still a lot of work to be done, but ideas are coming.\nThroughout your career – considering its length and the numerous hats you have worn, how did you perceive the early days and then the implementation of digitalisation in Finnish schools?\n I was a teacher in the 1980’s when the digital revolution started. Back then, the first personal computers were huge and their power was 20 mega only but they were fine. Development was so quick. That decade saw the raise of a big national programme for teachers in Finland. The learning of the basic IT skills and related further skills had a huge impact on the pedagogical use of ICT. The problem was that the equipment and the connection were not ready for proper pedagogical use. The enthusiasm of the beginnings vanished. Real significant steps started with good equipment: digital white boards, PCs for classrooms, digital cameras… Then the wireless connection came. Today we use these in many fields of education.\nIn the 1990’s municipalities were responsible for health and services, including schools. They noticed that different fields were buying ICT equipment of their own. Purchases should have been pooled but it was not a good solution from the schools’ perspective since the equipment was for office use and not for teaching purposes.\nIt took several years for the stakeholders to discuss the special needs in education. This is not a problem anymore, except for the money: there is not enough to keep the equipment updated.\nWhat was the role and influence of the various stakeholders (teachers, politicians, pupils, companies) involved, and how did they collaborate?\n Cooperation has to be organised in a way that education remains free and coherent.\n As far as business is concerned, cooperation with ICT companies is restricted, yet Microsoft and Apple operating systems were bought for schools, and the latter are now dependent of the former. Many ICT companies would have liked to sell their products labelled “approved by the Finnish Government” but the Government refused. There are a few collaborations with companies today, however not at a large scale. Some interesting start-ups in Finland have an agreement with municipalities, but commercial agreements with schools are not permitted.\n On the tool side, the biggest municipalities are planning to connect our e-curriculum platform to new systems that will help teachers plan their work at school and assess students, amongst other features.\nThe State is not officially involved in the development of those systems, yet it has a link through the municipalities.\nHow does that translate in the field, concretely speaking? I mean by this: financial and human resources involved, trainings for teachers, teaching tools, apprenticeship etc.\n Learning and teaching materials (digital tools, equipment, etc.) are the responsibility of the municipalities, who buy and use them to their best knowledge. In the past, the State subsided the purchase of equipment but not anymore, hence the municipalities using their own resources. It had a large budget to lead huge development programmes but it did not last. The strategy is different today, focussing on small steps. For instance, the State subsidies teachers’ trainings in the equipment but also in the pedagogical use of ICT.\nWhat does digitalisation in schools actually imply?\n Digitalisation is part of a school’s everyday life; we do not separate digital and non-digital daily activities. For instance, children in kindergarten play with tablets, take photos, play games, use the various installed programmes. Teachers document these activities by taking photos and sending them to the parents. In primary school, tablets are considered as learning material, pretty much like a pen or a book. At the vocational education stage, digitalisation is very closely organised with companies and the tools at the students’ disposal are related to their fields of profession. All fields of profession are covered.\nWhat were the challenges of this digital revolution in education/teaching?\n The main challenges were resources – both human and financial. Implementing digitalisation in schools was not an easy task back then, and is actually still the case today. Municipalities are struggling with finances and have to cut in equipment and personnel. Some kindergartens and small schools even had to be shut down.\nWhat has proven to be successful and unsuccessful?\n We believe that digital education has to be organised as an integral part of daily life. We noticed that training is the most effective when it comes directly to the schools. It is a question of empowerment. Students have to believe they can learn it and fix it, even if not right at the first try.\nWhy do these actions work particularly well? How could they be implementable in other countries where culture, school routine and education style are different?\n Some actions could work everywhere, such as developing a network of teachers that would enable them to discuss, visit different places to stay up to date with various methods. Teachers have to look around what is going on in society. Some of them are reluctant to digitalisation at school, but they use laptops, social media, pay bills online etc. themselves. These are nowadays basic skills like reading. The role of teachers is to prepare children for life-long learning, so none can say that s/he is not a “digital person”. It is something more profound, on the kind of society that we want. Learning by listening as we were used to in the past is now over. An old proverb says, “Those things you learn without joy you will forget easily”. We are good learners but we learn bad things too. Whereas the things you are highly motivated to learn, you will remember for the rest of your life.\nHow can digitalisation and essence of play be compatible? Screens are often blamed for making children less intelligent since they do not use their cognitive skills as much anymore.\n It really depends on what you do with the hardware. Is it for entertainment, for instance? Small kids are thrilled with sound and music already.\n There was a discussion in Finland about screen time that led to restrict it, especially for the younger. We consider that, generally, screen time should be used to learn something. We need to learn again how to learn.\nWhat did today’s various presentations and discussions inspire you? Any action that was implemented in Switzerland and France that could also work in Finland, in your opinion?\n Peer-school system, like Ecole 42, is something that we should consider for later. There is a lack in Finland and worldwide of people with ICT and coding skills, which makes this model really interesting. We have to consider informal forms of education, how we develop know-how from hobbies. Is there a system that could be created to recognise this expertise?\n Currently universities of applied sciences organise coding workshops for adults. They are very popular because they are accessible and free.\n I also really liked Mrs. Cesla Amarelle’s presentation about the organisation of digitalisation in schools planned over the next years. I think it is brilliantly done and very concrete. It will surely be a success.\nAbout the event\nThe symposium offered a varied program with presentations, a panel discussion and workshops that provided the framework to explore the topic from various angles. Not only were experiences from different European countries shared, but also speakers from fields ranging from education, industry, politics to the teachers’ union represented the different stakeholders involved in this digital transition in schools. These complementary views on the same topic led to rich discussions.", "summary": "Mrs. Arja-Sisko Holappa is an Educational Counsellor and the Head of Impact Programme at the Finnish National Agency for Education.\n  She was invited by the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences (SATW) as a speaker on Finland’s education model during the symposium on digitalisation at school hosted by EPFL’s Education Outreach Department and SATW.

{"id": 1128, "text": "Only a small hill called Motty, in Ecublens, divides EPFL from Bertrand Cardis’ Décision boatyard. This geographical proximity is amplified by many technical, scientific and even emotional affinities. Rivages, the Vaud navigator Bernard Stamm’s sleek new sea-creature, will add a new chapter to the nautical history of the EPFL laboratories.\nThanks to support from the Sandoz family’s Foundation, which owns the boat and has special ties with our school, EPFL has brought its expertise to bear in several areas and benefited from productive interaction with the navigator’s technical team. The work involved to optimize the boat’s component materials, for example, were carried out at the Laboratory of Composite and Polymer Technology (LTC), with the objective of meeting the construction requirements as closely as possible.\nThe sails in real time\nAs well as taking this “scientific advisory” role in the actual construction, several teams from EPFL are continuing to follow Bernard Stamm’s adventures in real time. The Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB), in cooperation with the company Space3D, has already installed many cameras on the boat. It will now add some more cameras to observe the sails and model their movements in three dimensions and in real time, to gain a better understanding of the wind-flow patterns and to optimize their adjustments.\nSome other experiments, in particular oceanographic, will be conducted on board. Their interest therefore extends well beyond the sailing world itself. The Audiovisual Communications Laboratory (LCAV), which had already developed the environmental sensors for the SensorScope project, is currently working to produce the lightest possible “minilab”. On the hour, this will take a sampling of water, to make an automatic analysis of several parameters (temperature, salinity, oxygenation, turbidity, and micro-organism content) that it will transmit to land-based centers. Oceanopolis and the CNRS will be able to use the findings immediately as part of a specific study of micro-plankton, and these will also be made available to the scientific community. “The race uses routes that are rarely followed around the Antarctic, so it is an excellent opportunity to collect rare and detailed data and compare them with the measurements obtained by satellite”, explains Guillermo Barrenetxea, a scientist working at LCAV.\nEnergy needs\n A high-tech boat like Rivages needs more than a little wind and fresh water. The extensive electronic equipment required for navigation and – in this case – for all the scientific tasks need electricity. How can it be produced on-site and be managed optimally without weighing down and braking the boat? The Industrial Electronics Laboratory (LEI) is working to find the best solution. As Philippe Barrade, First Assistant, sums it up: “We must not only optimize the instruments to make them more energy-efficient, but also develop an intelligent system to manage the use, the reserves and the battery recharging system”.\n Solar cells, wind and water turbines and a diesel generator are the main candidates for supplying electricity. A combination of these sources will have to meet all the boat’s needs without making too many demands on the skipper’s attention. “Our energy production and management systems will therefore need to be extremely reliable”, adds Philippe Barrade.\nOn 11 November 2012, at Sables-d’Olonne, the starting-boat will give the signal for the Vendée Globe race to begin – this legendary solo race with no stopover or assistance. An impressive 60-foot monohull curved like a seagull, Rivages will then launch its assault on the southern seas.\nEighteen months in preparation\n For the moment, Rivages has just undergone a long voyage by special convoy to La Ciotat, near Marseille, where it arrived yesterday. And this weekend it will receive the traditional dose of champagne as a christening, as well as its mast, its sails and all the equipment still to be added. It will make its maiden voyage at the beginning of May, flying the colors of its sponsor “Cheminées Poujoulat”, and will complete several practice races this year (Tour de l’Europe, Transat Jacques Vabre).\nThese are 18 months of preparation that will be useful both to the navigator and his team, but also to the scientists involved in the project. “This partnership will enable us to advance in many fields”, Bernard Stamm comments happily. “As well as collecting important data, we will be able to improve the boat’s reliability and performance.” At EPFL, the impact of this major project is also being emphasized: “Solving practical questions concerning such a spectacular achievement is highly motivating for both the scientists and the students”, declares Pascal Vuilliomenet, in charge of the Strategic initiatives for the Vice-Presidency for Innovation and Valorization.", "summary": "The navigator from the Swiss canton of Vaud is working with EPFL to equip his new boat, Rivages, designed for the Vendée Globe 2012.

{"id": 1129, "text": "Once taken, antibiotics do not simply disappear. Released from the body by urine, some escape water treatment plants unscathed. Traces of antibiotics and a variety of other molecular contaminants such as pesticides and pharmaceutical drugs are consistently measured in Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva, above the site where processed wastewater is released. The impact of micropollutants is receiving ever more attention from the scientific community, but it is still unclear how long they persist and to what extent they pose a threat to organisms. In , researchers at EPFL present findings on the dilution of the micropollutants by lake currents. Their results showed that the pollutants are most persistent during summer, several meters under water. In the winter, they rise to the lake surface and are most effectively degraded by sunlight\nEvery second, between one and three tons of treated wastewater from the city of Lausanne gush out into Lake Geneva from a pipe that ends 700 meters offshore and 30 meters below the lake’s surface. Lake currents disperse and dilute this water in the same way that wind disperses the smoke from a chimney, with a persistent underwater pollutant plume emanating from the discharge pipe.\nFlorence Bonvin from EPFL’s Environmental Chemistry Lab has been studying the dynamics of this plume and the pollutants it contains. “We consistently detect a range of micropollutants – antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and anti-epileptic drugs and urban pesticides in particular in the vicinity of the wastewater treatment plant outfall,” she says. Although the concentrations are very small, she says, they are frequently well above threshold concentrations that are considered to have no effect on organisms.\nDriven by lake currents \nActually getting on a boat and sampling for micropollutants is time-intensive, expensive, and only provides a partial snapshot of the situation at any given time. A computer model gives a more complete image. “We would have to sample hundreds of sites simultaneously – which is basically impossible – to come close to getting as much detail as we can using a computer model,” says Bonvin. This way, she can study two simultaneously occurring processes in great detail: dilution of the micropollutants by mixing with the surrounding lake water, and their degradation by sunlight.\nThe dynamics of the pollutant plume are mostly driven by lake currents, which vary with the season and the weather. Summers see the lake’s surface waters warm up, while the depths remain cool. The interface between warm and cold water – the thermocline – acts as a cap, trapping currents and the pollutant plume several meters under water. But as the lake’s surface waters cool down during the winter, the thermocline disappears and the plume rises to the surface. With increased exposure to surface winds and sunlight, pollutants are diluted and degraded much more effectively.\nThe computer model lets Bonvin quantify the ecotoxicological threat posed by 24 different micropollutants as they enter the lake, disperse into the surrounding water, and eventually degrade. To study two different lake circulation patterns driven by the most prevalent winds, such as the bise, both with and without the summer thermocline, Bonvin used results from a 3D lake circulation model developed by Amir Razmi from EPFL’s Ecological Engineering Laboratory, which reproduced lake currents measured during an experimental campaign carried out in Vidy Bay. The degradation of the pollutants by the sun were based on measurements she performed herself in the lab.\n“Using our simulation results, we can draw a map of where the pollutants are depending on the season, the winds, and the cloud cover,” says Bonvin. And they offer a way to evaluate the potential risk they pose. “The concentrations of each pollutant are very low, but since we don’t know how living organisms respond to being exposed to these pollutants over long time periods, this isn’t an issue we can simply ignore.”\nBonvin previously showed that even antibiotics that have been processed and inactivated in our body and then released into the lake could be revived when exposed to sunlight, returning to their original, active form. This adds another source of micropollutants to the picture. Her findings, which add an additional twist to this story, were published earlier this year in Environmental Science & Technology.\nThis project was carried out in the context of the elemo research campaign, with the support of Ferring Pharmaceuticals and the Russian Honorary Consulate in Lausanne.", "summary": "Antibiotics, urban pesticides, and other contaminants accumulate where wastewater is released into Lake Geneva.

{"id": 1130, "text": "Professor Ortelli began his term as Institute Director in July 1, 2011. Ortelli arrived at EPFL in 1997. In the same year, he oversaw completion of the Palais Franscini, a unique project on the banks of the Ticino river that brought together five cultural institutions and housed the cantonal library and archives. On the EPFL campus, he splits his time between teaching and research, and takes evident pleasure in interacting with students. The students appreciate his dedication as well, awarding him the ENAC teaching prize in 2005 and 2007. Here’s a brief interview with this philosopher-architect. \nHow would you define this discipline?\n An architect maintains a balance between three pillars: art, science and technique. But I consider architecture first of all as an intellectual endeavor and the academic environment is ideal for cultivating this aspect. Architecture theorizes, interprets and envisages that which has been, is and is yet to be. I would like for this to be a fundamental mission of teaching starting with the first year, because it has an undisputable social implication. It makes the invisible visible. But this way of looking at things could very well be endangered today. The pressure to globalize could threaten architectural diversity.\nWhat was the most memorable moment of your career?\n The Aebsicher revolution! The arrival of Patrick Aebischer at EPFL, the Bologna reforms and the creation of a new School that brought engineers and architects together under a single roof obliged me to redefine architecture in the polytechnical environment. Until then, we existed on an island apart, without real connections with the rest of EPFL, much as many architecture institutes still do around the world today. That pushed us into a new dimension of research. Since then, many connections have been created between various ENAC laboratories. Several research projects focusing on subjects such as concrete are being done. I have done research with Aurèle Parriaux from ENAC’s Engineering and Environmental Geology Laboratory on massive stone constructions.\nWhat are the avenues that you would like to explore in your role as Director of the Institute of Architecture and the City?\n I would like to create an avenue that doesn’t exist yet! Come up with research tools that would integrate all the parameters that are known, but that have been used up to now separately, such as historical research, architectural techniques, physics of buildings or even industrial engineering—to take an epistemological viewpoint. Among the major projects that I would like to undertake or reinforce are energy issues, which bring together several ENAC researchers. The issue of habitat, also, can be looked at on several levels. It’s first an ethical issue; I can’t help but think of the millions of people who are homeless, and I would like to undertake research in the area of low-tech housing. That would certainly allow us to provide solutions not only at the Swiss and European level, but also for developing countries.", "summary": "Luca Ortelli is the new director of the Institute of Architecture and the City in EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC).

{"id": 1133, "text": "“The plurality of worlds has left the realm of dreams to become an object of study.” Those were the words spoken by Michel Mayor at EPFL’s 2002 Master’s degree graduation ceremony as he described the discovery that he, along with Didier Queloz, made of the first planet located outside our solar system. Mayor was at EPFL to receive the title of doctor honoris causa. Yesterday, the two astrophysicists from the University of Geneva won the Nobel Prize in Physics for that very same discovery. The award also went to a third researcher in the same field, James Peebles, from Princeton University, for his “theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology.” Jean-Paul Kneib, the director of the Laboratory of Astrophysics (LASTRO) and of EPFL’s Space Center (eSpace), explains the significance of this news.\nWhy does this Nobel Prize mean so much to EPFL?\nJean-Paul Kneib:\n First, it’s pretty uncommon for the Nobel Prize in Physics to be awarded in the field of astrophysics. So it’s an important accolade for this discipline as a whole and a real source of motivation for students who chose this field of research. The Nobel Prize did not go just to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, but also to James Peebles at Princeton for his work on the physical foundations of modern cosmology. The theoretical framework that Professor Peebles developed led to modern observational cosmology, one of the main directions of research at EPFL’s Laboratory of Astrophysics. One of our primary research objectives is to precisely measure, through repeat observations, the cosmological parameters with which we can refine that theoretical model and eventually understand the nature of black matter and black energy.\nHow did the discovery of the first exoplanet affect the research being done at EPFL?\nFirst there’s the question of scientific knowledge, since this and subsequent discoveries – more than 4,000 other exoplanets have been identified so far – have given us insight into how planetary systems form and enable us to prove, or improve, the underlying models in terms of the physical, chemical and accretive processes. Next, in order to locate more exoplanets as well as smaller ones (similar in size to earth), we need increasingly precise technologies. Enormous progress has been made in this respect over the past 25 years, with the precision of radial speed measurements improving more than fiftyfold! The work done by a number of EPFL labs contributed to some of these advances.\nCan you cite some examples?\nDidier Queloz worked with EPFL laboratories to develop differential delay lines for the PRIMA instrument used in the Very Large Telescope Interferometer in Chile. More recently, the Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements teamed up with the Geneva Observatory to develop highly sophisticated calibration mechanisms for the new very-high-resolution spectrographs used to detect exoplanets that are similar to earth. And the CHEOPS mission run by the University of Bern and the University of Geneva drew on the expertise of EPFL’s Space Center to design the CHEOPS satellite. Once launched on 17 December 2019, it will be used to identify and characterize more exoplanets.\nDid these discoveries influence your career or your job choices?\nThe focus of my research owes in large part to James Peebles. His book “Principles of Physical Cosmology” sat on my nightstand while I was writing my thesis.

The student teams have to design, build and launch a rocket, and they’re judged on a number of criteria, including whether their rocket reaches a target altitude, how clever their design is and the craftsmanship used in constructing the payload.\nEPFL was one of 120 universities from around the world to compete at this year’s event. The School’s rocket, called Eiger, came in 12th place overall and fifth place in the 10k-COTS category, where the rocket had to use a commercial off-the-shelf motor and reach an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 meters). “Our category was the most popular, with around 50 teams,” says Albéric De Lajarte, a Master’s student in microengineering and a member of EPFL’s team. “Of course we would’ve liked to end up in the top three, but we’re still really happy with the result. Next time we’ll make it – we know exactly what we need to improve.”\nEiger reached the target altitude with an error of only 6% – a brilliant performance – but had problems on the descent. “The first part of the flight was great with a really straight trajectory. But there was a problem in the second phase of the parachute’s deployment, and the rocket came down faster than expected,” says De Lajarte. That cost the team precious points.\nA launch pad for a career in aerospace\nEiger took nearly 18 months to develop, and the most enthusiastic students spent 20–30 hours a week on it. “We built on the work done by last year’s team for their Matterhorn rocket,” says De Lajarte. “But since our rocket is slightly bigger – three meters long and weighing 23 kilograms – we had to scale up their design. I think we ended up with a slightly more advanced and streamlined rocket. The integrated payload had to be designed from scratch, however. That was an interesting lesson in fluid dynamics – how non-Newtonian fluids can be used as shock absorbers, for example.”\nOverall the team members are pleased with their performance – and with the experience as a whole, which was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “The competition allowed us to develop our skills, meet both volunteers and professionals who are passionate about rockets, and get valuable experience in our fields – all while having fun,” says Jules Triomphe, a Bachelor’s student in mechanical engineering on the EPFL team. De Lajarte adds: “For me it was a chance to get first-hand experience with aerospace engineering through a real-life project. As we went along, I realized this is what I’d like to pursue as a career.

{"id": 1154, "text": "What was so exciting about yesterday's LIGO press announcement?\nThey announced that the LIGO-Virgo Consortium had made the first direct detection of gravitational waves using the Observatory’s advanced technology. Scientists have been trying to track down gravitational waves for decades. In the past, they have found hints of their presence, but through indirect methods of detection. We now have the first direct detection, which means we know for sure that gravitational waves exist. It is very exciting.\nScience is about collaboration – and I find this to be a great aspect of the discovery. Like so many projects in physics today, the detection involved a a large international collaboration: over 1000 members representing 15 different countries have been working together since the beginning of the project in 1997. \nWhat are gravitational waves and why are they so difficult to detect?\nGravitational waves are “ripples” through space-time, which can be caused by violent events in the universe, e.g. the merging of two black holes, or could even be created in early times, just after the Big Bang. Gravitational waves were first proposed by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, based on his theory of gravity – what is known as his theory of general relativity.\nTo detect gravitation waves, scientists use laser interferometers like LIGO’s. These systems bounce lasers over several kilometers and look for tiny, infinitesimal changes in the laser light across the length of the interferometer – think one part in 1021 (that is a 1 followed by 21 zeroes). That would be a sign that a gravitational wave passed through the instrument. It’s an amazing technological challenge, and extremely difficult to measure. \nWhat does the discovery mean for science? How does it change the way scientists observe the universe?\nThis is a breakthrough for science. Gravitational waves will help astrophysicists understand how gravity and black holes work. It also means we now have a whole new window in the universe: instead of observing the universe only with “standard” light (electromagnetic waves, which can be in the microwave, the infrared or the visible parts of the spectrum), we could hopefully now also use gravitational waves.\nWill this affect your own research?\nGravitational waves might also exist in the very early universe, in which case they are called “primordial” gravitational waves. If we can observe these, we can learn more about the very early universe. My colleagues working on the very early universe are thrilled by this discovery.\nWe live in a very special time for science. A hundred years after Einstein worked out his famous theory of gravity, we finally have the technological tools to study the night sky and understand his theory better. There are many things about his theory that scientists are testing today, and its centennial is very exciting for scientists worldwide.\nTo spread the excitement of Einstein’s theory, I collaborated in making a 3-min animation narrated by former “Dr Who” David Tennant on Einstein's theory, with award-winning animator Eoin Duffy and the director Jamie Lochhead.

Using the fact that ancient inks in Europe are iron-based and X-rays cannot penetrate this heavy metal, X-ray tomography can scan through the entire volume of a book, without ever having to open it, to reveal the words written on the paper. The technology is being developed with the myriad of fragile documents at the State Archives of Venice in mind, in the context of the Venice Time Machine launched by EPFL and the .\nA Venetian lady is finally heard\nThe sealed document tells the last wishes of a Venetian woman named Catharuçia Savonario from the year 1351.\nEPFL physicist Giorgio Margaritondo of the Laboratory for Quantum Magnestism explains, “We do not know why the document was never unsealed. Maybe the family disappeared, or there was an epidemic. There are many documents like that in the Venetian Archives. But we were able to read inside without a problem thanks to X-ray tomography, and let this young lady speak to us after so many centuries. It was an emotional experience.”\nMargaritondo, who will give his honorary lecture at EPFL tomorrow night, elaborates, “What we found inside were details, facts, places in Venice that still exist, so it is very much a living document that can speak to us today. There is also a funny detail. She took the time to explain that she had chosen very expensive paper for her will, probably to show that she was a wealthy lady and not nobody.\n“It is the first step towards the use of these techniques to read the documents at the State Archives of Venice.”\nX-ray tomography and classification of inks\nMany of the documents at the State Archives of Venice are too fragile to be opened and read. A non-invasive technique is required to see inside these documents without destroying them.\n“Thanks to the use of iron-based inks that were used in Europe for more than 1000 years, we were able to read the text inside a closed document, a closed book, a closed will,” says EPFL physicist Fauzia Albertin. “X-ray tomography is the solution for preserving this heritage and shedding light on European history.”\nAlbertin had previously worked on an important step towards scanning the centuries of documents at the State Archives of Venice by classifying the different types of iron-based inks that were used in Europe over time.\nBefore revealing the contents of the sealed testament, the physicists developed their scanning technique with a scientific book from 17\nth\n century that could readily be opened for comparison with the data obtained with X-ray tomography. The book was scanned, layer by layer, at EPFL’s PIXE laboratory for X-ray radioscopy and tomography platform. The scientists could therefore navigate through the X-ray data to read the text and drawings of the various pages.\nTheir technique differs from existing techniques that use a different frequency of light for the detection of modern plant-based ink. Also, in contrast to modern-day books, ancient documents present the challenge that the paper is very rarely flat, but rather warped or weathered by time. For the moment, the physicists are manually extracting the pages from the X-ray tomography scans. The next steps include building an algorithm that automatically detects the different pages.\nThe history of Europe \n“Inside the Archivio di Stato there is the history of Europe,” says Margaritondo. “Venice was a very powerful entity, she controlled for example the international market of spices. By looking at the documents about the traffic in the port of Venice, we might be able to better understand the history of Europe.”", "summary": "Scientists see inside a sealed testament from the State Archives of Venice using EPFL technology – without breaking the wax seal­­ – and reveal the last wishes of a Venetian lady from the year 1351.", "claim": "Scientists see inside a sealed testament from the State Archives of Venice using EPFL technology – without breaking the wax seal­­ – and reveal the last wishes of a Venetian lady from tomorrow night.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [32, 33], "noise": false}
{"id": 1159, "text": "“We wanted to put people back at the center of the power grid,” said the three students who created the website ThinkEE. Their site, only accessible on the campus at the moment, is becoming a virtual forum for discussions on energy management. It has three objectives: to help consumers become aware of their energy consumption and allow them to share their experience, and to connect suppliers with consumers.\nTaking their cue from Switzerland’s goal of reducing electricity consumption by 35% between now and 2035 while at the same time limiting the impact of electricity generation on the environment, Jean-Charles Fosse, Johann Bigler and Alexandre Ringwald, long-time friends, wondered how consumers could be made to change their habits. “We spent a lot of time on this one question,” said Johann. “Preliminary work demonstrated that if people are aware of how much energy they consume, this alone will encourage them to find ways to cut back.” A sort of personal challenge.\nAnd the website suggests a number of ways to encourage the right mind-set. ThinkEE users can, for example, compare their electricity consumption with that of their neighbors, in addition to interacting and exchanging ideas with them and other users. Something like Facebook focused on electricity consumption.\n‘Experience points’ are awarded not for reducing watts consumed but rather for the useful tips that users share with others. And users can create groups, to ensure the confidentiality of their data. Only general feedback from multiple users is made public.\nMotivated by comfort\n Comfort can also be a source of motivation. Or rather discomfort, such as: an overheated classroom, hallway lights that are always on, and a building that’s cold in winter. “Let's look at EPFL: if a lot of students feel it’s too hot in an auditorium and mention it on our website, the facility management can reduce the temperature, which will at the same time reduce electricity consumption,” said Jean-Charles. Connecting users of the electrical grid will encourage them to propose changes to energy suppliers, to property managers in the case of rental apartments, and to facilities managers in office buildings.\nIn an environment where outlets and devices are equipped with sensors, as is the case in some EPFL buildings, users can see how much energy their devices use in real time. So they can simply have a look at the sensor, modify their behavior and share their observations on the new energy social network. Until this sensor technology makes its way into their homes, people can manually enter the various types of consumption.\nNew developments in 2016?\n The three students, who are now in their internship semester, are thinking about what’s next for their website. Maybe they’ll turn it into a start-up when they come back in 2016.\nFor Alexandre, this project gave them a taste of engineering in the real world. “Taking the initiative, meeting deadlines and working as a team will be fundamental aspects of our future profession. And the methods we had to learn to create the website will be put to good use in future projects.”", "summary": "Summer series on student projects: Three future micro-engineers have developed an interactive website – a sort of social network about energy – in order to link grid operators with users and encourage users to reduce their electricity consumption and share their ideas.", "claim": "2016 series on student projects: Three future micro-engineers have developed an interactive website – a sort of social network about energy – in order to link grid operators with users and encourage users to reduce their electricity consumption and share their ideas.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 0], "noise": false}
{"id": 1160, "text": "Every year, hundreds of thousands of premature babies die around the world. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries, and the primary culprit is hypothermia. There is a critical need in many countries for reliable incubators able to maintain a constant temperature around babies even if the electricity goes out.\nThis situation led Benjamin Rime, a materials science student at EPFL, to devote a semester project and then his Master’s project to developing a heat reserve based on the principle underlying phase-change materials.\nEnergy from the transformation process\nInstead of heating a simple material (water, stone or metal) in order to recover the heat later, the system that Benjamin developed uses a synthetic polymer. It is solid at room temperature and turns to liquid when heated. “Large quantities of energy are involved when changing state,” said Benjamin. “Throughout the phase in which the material solidifies back, it releases heat at a constant temperature of 52°C.”\nIn order to put this principle to work in a concrete and useful way, Benjamin created a prototype thermoregulator for incubators with support from the  program at EPFL’s Cooperation and Development Center.\nThe  project, which also includes students from the University of Yaoundé in Cameroon together with industry and academic partners, aims to design a sturdy, reliable and easy-to-use incubator capable of maintaining a sufficient temperature even during blackouts lasting several hours. “It works by melting the phase-change material when the electricity is on,” said Benjamin. “If the power goes out, a small battery-powered fan connected to a simple and rugged electronic regulator takes over and maintains a constant temperature in the incubator.”\nShocking conditions\n Benjamin spent two months in Cameroon this past spring to work on his project. “I visited hospitals and met with medical staff and mothers of premature babies,” he said. “I was shocked to see the way the temperature was maintained in incubators – often by simply placing hot-water bottles a few inches from the baby.”\n The hospital staff and the mothers seemed convinced, showing real interest in Benjamin’s project. “The part I dealt with – the regulator – is ready, and my colleagues in Yaoundé still need to finalize the overall design of the incubator and the small electronic regulator for temperature and humidity. Apart from the polymer, all the materials needed can be found there. A completed prototype should be ready this fall.”\nNow that Benjamin has graduated from EPFL, (lien vers le factsheet) is in the hands of the  team and its Swiss and African partners. “It is crucial to have local contacts to make this type of project work,” said Klaus Schönenberger, head of the EssentialTech program. “We have enlisted the support of some 200 African pediatricians and have a solid working relationship with numerous researchers.”", "summary": "Summer series: student projects.\n For his Master’s project in materials science, Benjamin Rime came up with a sturdy and innovative thermoregulation system for incubators in southern countries.", "claim": "several hours series: student projects.\n For his Master’s project in materials science, Benjamin Rime came up with a sturdy and innovative thermoregulation system for incubators in southern countries.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 1], "noise": false}
{"id": 1162, "text": "In September, 26 architecture and civil engineering students from EPFL and Brazil’s Federal University of Bahia spent 14 days at the Smart Living Lab in Fribourg. The students built a prototype modular structure from textile-reinforced concrete, a material that uses carbon fiber in place of steel rods, plus purpose-built metal formwork. The pavilion is far thinner and lighter than similar conventional reinforced concrete structures – the roof shell measures just 9mm thick – without compromising on static resistance. \nPromising applications \n According to the staff who led the workshop, this construction technique has a bright future on account of its sustainability credentials: it uses far fewer materials than traditional methods and is compatible with low-carbon cement, resulting in sharply lower CO\n2\n emissions. What’s more, the load-bearing sections can be taken apart and reused and are light enough to be carried by only one or two people. Ultimately, the new material could allow more people to self-build simple, weather-resistant homes without the need for heavy construction machinery.\nThe research is inspired by \nargamassa armada\n (reinforced mortar), a technique developed by Brazilian architect João Filgueiras Lima, known as Lélé, who specializes in the construction of favelas and prefab buildings. The new method, which replaces steel rods with carbon fiber, addresses some of the shortcomings of Lélé’s existing designs – not least the fact that many structures built from \nargamassa armada\n were prone to corrosion. \nInterdisciplinary teaching\n The project began four years ago as part of “Design Together,” an interdisciplinary teaching initiative at EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). The program was initially taught by five people: architects Patricia Guaita and Raffael Baur from EPFL’s ALICE Laboratory, civil engineering specialists Patrick Valeri and Miguel Fernández Ruiz from EPFL’s IBETON Laboratory, and David Fernández-Ordonez, from the International Federation for Structural Concrete (FIB). Each year, EPFL students have done their part to further research in the field through classes, semester projects and the intensive, interdisciplinary ENAC Week program. \n“This pavilion is the culmination of several years of research”, says Raffael Baur. Patricia Guaita adds: “It may not look like a big deal, but it took a long time to get the design, formwork and materials just right. For architecture students, it’s really exciting to come up with a structure that seems to float in the air.” The civil engineering specialists on the team were just as pleased with the results of this initiative. “The workshop gave the students their first taste of design – and a chance to see just how complex a construction project can be in real life,” says Miguel Fernández Ruiz. “It also demonstrated the sustainable potential of concrete, given the modular and reusable features of the load-bearing structures they developed.” \nKnowledge transfer\n The September workshop was funded by CemSuisse, the Swiss cement industry association, and a 2018 ENAC Exploratory Grant. Sergio Ekerman, an expert from the Federal University of Bahia, traveled to Fribourg to share his expertise with the team, and CemSuisse is monitoring the research outputs with interest.

{"id": 1166, "text": "The Center for Artificial Muscles was inaugurated this morning at Microcity in Neuchâtel following the announcement of a 12-million-franc donation by the Werner Siemens-Foundation a little over six months ago. The event was attended by Jean-Nathanaël Karakash, who is Neuchâtel’s State Councilor for the Economy and Social Action, EPFL President Martin Vetterli and representatives from the Werner Siemens-Foundation.\n Under this ambitious initiative, EPFL is responsible for setting up the Center for Artificial Muscles, collaborating initially with the Bern University Hospital (Inselspital) and then with the Zurich University Hospital. The first project, slated to span the next four years, will focus on developing a less invasive cardiac assistance system for treating heart failure, which many forms of heart disease lead to. In such cases, patients can be saved only by a heart transplant or a complicated assistance system. The prosthetic device that EPFL will develop – in the form a ring around the aorta – will avoid the complications of hemorrhaging and thrombosis because it will not be in contact with blood. Two other projects will follow: a facial-reconstruction project aimed at restoring patients’ ability to make expressions and a project to develop an artificial sphincter using the cardiac assistance technology.\nReal progress has been made since the plans to set up the Center were announced last December. EPFL’s Integrated Actuators Laboratory (LAI) in Neuchâtel now has a team of ten people working on the less invasive cardiac assistance system. The system they are developing will be composed of rings placed around the aorta and controlled by magnetic induction. “Our system will obviate the need to operate on the heart,” says Perriard, who runs the LAI. “The rings placed around the aorta will help the heart pump blood through magnetic induction. This method will therefore be less invasive than current cardiac assistance procedures.”\nA less invasive technology\n The device will consist of a series of rings made out of dielectric electroactive polymers (DEAPs). These polymers dilate when a current is applied and contract when the current is switched off. Because the reactions are immediate, the contraction-relaxation movement can be controlled in real time. The force required by this movement is achieved thanks to a high-precision spring developed by H2i, located in Cortaillod, which has teamed up with LAI. “In December, we already knew that the dielectric electroactive polymers alone wouldn’t be enough,” says Yoan Civet, an LAI researcher. This led to the development and patenting of a high-performance titanium spring whose leaves measure only 0.1 mm.\nThe system comprising the spring and the polymer, when placed around the aorta, helps the heart pump blood.\nTeaming up with Inselspital and the University of Bern\n In order to develop this system, Perriard's lab is working closely with Thierry Carrel, a renowned cardiac surgeon and the chairman and head surgeon of the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at Bern's Inselspital. “For patients, this technology would definitely be less invasive than current cardiac assistance systems because it does not interfere directly with the blood flow or blood cells. It may also turn out to be effective in treating patients earlier on to prevent terminal heart failure,” says Dr. Carrel.\nIn addition to the ten people developing this system, Dr. Carrel's research group at the ARTORG Center for Biomedical Engineering Research and the experimental surgery section of the Department for BioMedical Research at the University of Bern will make a significant contribution to the project. Dr. Carrel will oversee the entire first phase, which will be spread out over four years. At the end of this phase, and after the technology has been thoroughly vetted in laboratory tests, the surgeon will implant the device on animals. It is only then that the researchers will know if the technology is viable.\nAn initiative with real potential\n According to EPFL President Martin Vetterli, “This initiative, at the crossroads of engineering and medicine, offers real potential. I am especially pleased with the university collaborations it has led to, particularly the one with Inselspital.” The Center’s unique features appealed to the Werner Siemens-Foundation. “Through this donation, we really hope to help drive the study of muscle diseases through the advanced research to be carried out by the Center for Artificial Muscles. This revolutionary and forward-looking project aligns perfectly with the Foundation’s sponsorship criteria,” says Hubert Keiber, the Foundation’s chairman.\nJean-Nathanaël Karakash, the Neuchâtel State Councilor for the Economy and Social Action, is equally enthusiastic: “We are very proud that the manufacturing, research and technological capabilities of Neuchâtel's innovation ecosystem, embodied in the innovation cluster at Microcity, are being harnessed for this project. This is a worthy endeavor that will save lives.”\nFirst the heart, then facial expressions\n This initiative will not be limited to cardiac assistance. The Center will branch out into other fields in a subsequent phase, which will take place over ten years starting in 2022. One project will focus on the urinary sphincter, while another will delve into the reconstruction of facial muscles so that victims of serious burns and other accidents can regain control of their expressions.

The ArtLab building and its associated research programs present a variety of ways in which art and science can engage in a fruitful dialogue. The building is the work of Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, who won the competition to design it in 2012. Its construction, which began in August 2014, was carried out by the general contractor Marti Construction SA. Almost half of the 35,5 million franc building, including facilities, was financed using private funds.\n“Beyond its architectural envelope, ArtLab is a research initiative through which EPFL, together with its partners, is setting off to explore a new world: that of digital humanities,” says Patrick Aebischer, president of EPFL. “It’s an emerging field full of scientific questions and challenges that play out at many levels. For example, our projects often produce enormous amounts of data. Merely transforming this big data into something useful and exploitable requires substantial research – it’s extremely stimulating.”\nTechnology for music, art...\nThe ArtLab building, which long went by its project name Under One Roof, is composed of three distinct spaces, all of which are open to the public. At its southern end, the Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL is dedicated to presenting the famous festival’s archives, which are inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. Besides leading the digitization and preservation of the recordings as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, EPFL has designed devices to browse, visualize, and listen to the archives that will be available to the public. In the Montreux Jazz Heritage Lab, visitors will be able to fully immerse themselves into the festival’s concerts. The Montreux Jazz Digital Project, which involved several EPFL laboratories, was made possible thanks to the support of several partners.\n At the center of the building, in an experimental exhibition space, the Gandur Foundation for Art will present its first exhibit organized in partnership with EPFL. Using technology developed by five EPFL laboratories and related startups, the Outrenoirs by Pierre Soulages will be presented in a way never seen before, using approaches such as ultrafast photography and hyperspectral cameras. The exhibit, entitled \"Noir, c’est noir?\" (Is black black?), explores the interaction between light and the French artist’s work.\n... and big data\nFinally, at the building’s northern end, the DataSquare will host a long-term exhibition on big data, represented by two major EPFL research initiatives: the Blue Brain Project and Venice Time Machine. These two complex initiatives have a common denominator in their relationship with data and the need to share their findings with the general public. In the DataSquare, they will be the subjects of highly interactive presentations. The exhibition will also include an innovative interface that visualizes key data about EPFL in which the school itself will be examined through the lens of big data.

{"id": 1184, "text": "On June 23rd, 2015, a primate with spinal cord injury regained control of its paralyzed leg with the help of a neuroprosthetic system called the “brain-spine interface” that bypassed the lesion, restoring communication between the brain and the region of the spinal cord. The results are published today in \nNature\n.\nThe interface decodes brain activity associated with walking movements and relays this information to the spinal cord ­– below the injury – through electrodes that stimulate the neural pathways that activate leg muscles during natural locomotion.\nThe neuroprosthetic interface was conceived at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, and developed together with an international network of collaborators including Medtronic, Brown University and Fraunhofer ICT-IMM. It was tested in collaboration with the University of Bordeaux, Motac Neuroscience and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV).\n“This is the first time that neurotechnology restores locomotion in primates,” says neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine who led the collaboration and holds the IRP chair in spinal cord repair. “But there are many challenges ahead and it may take several years before all the components of this intervention can be tested in people.”\nDecoding brain signals and activating leg muscles\nThe brain is a huge network of cells called neurons. Information is processed in the brain by transmitting spikes of electricity from one neuron to the next. This electrical spiking gives rise to brain signals that can actually be measured and interpreted.\nThe lumbar region of the spinal cord also contains complex networks of neurons that activate leg muscles to walk. Bundles of nerves coming from the brain carry the relevant information to the spinal cord about the intended activation of leg muscles.\nFor intact nervous systems, signals about walking come from a small region (about the size of a dime for primates) of the brain called the \nmotor cortex\n. Signals from the motor cortex travel down the spinal cord, reach the neural networks located in the lumbar region, and these in turn activate muscles in the legs to produce walking movements.\nSpinal cord lesions partly or completely prevent these signals from reaching the neurons that activate leg muscles, leading to paralysis. But the motor cortex can still produce spiking activity about walking, and the neural networks activating muscles in the paralyzed leg are still intact and can still generate leg movements.\nHow the brain-spine interface works\nThe brain-spine interface bridges the spinal cord injury, in \nreal-time a\nnd \nwirelessly\n. The neuroprosthetic system decodes spiking activity from the brain’s motor cortex and then relays this information to a system of electrodes located over the surface of the lumbar spinal cord, below the injury. Electrical stimulation of a few volts, delivered at precise locations in the spinal cord, modulates distinct networks of neurons that can activate specific muscles in the legs.\n“To implement the brain-spine interface, we developed an implantable, wireless system that operates in real-time and enabled a primate to behave freely, without the constraint of tethered electronics,” says Courtine. “We understood how to extract brain signals that encode flexion and extension movements of the leg with a mathematical algorithm. We then linked the decoded signals to the stimulation of specific hotspots in the spinal cord that induced the walking movement.”\nFor partial lesions of the spinal cord, the scientists showed that the primate regained control of its paralyzed leg immediately upon activation of the brain-spine interface. The interface should also work for more severe lesions of the spinal cord, according to the scientists, likely with the aid of pharmacological agents. Note that for these partial lesions, the primate is initially paralyzed and then spontaneously regains full mobility after about three months.\n“The primate was able to walk immediately once the brain-spine interface was activated. No physiotherapy or training was necessary,” says neuroscientist Erwan Bezard of Bordeaux University who oversaw the primate experiments.\nClinical Trials\n“The link between the decoding of the brain and the stimulation of the spinal cord – to make this communication exist – is completely new,” says neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch of the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) who leads the functional neurosurgery department at the Lausanne University Hospital and surgically implanted the brain and spinal cord implants.\nShe continues, “For the first time, I can imagine a completely paralyzed patient able to move their legs through this brain-spine interface.”\nIn collaboration with EPFL, Bloch is currently leading a clinical feasibility study that evaluates the therapeutic potential of this spinal cord stimulation technology, without the brain implant, to improve walking in people with partial spinal cord injury affecting the lower limbs.\nFunding Parrtners: European Community's Seventh Framework Program, International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia, European Research Council, The Wyss Centre in Geneva, Marie Curie Fellowship, Marie Curie COFUND EPFL fellowships, Medtronic, Morton Cure Paralysis Fund fellowship, NanoTera.ch Programme (SpineRepair), National Centre of Competence in Research in Robotics, Sinergia program, Sino-Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation, Swiss National Science Foundation.", "summary": "Non-human primates regain control of their paralyzed leg ­– as early as six days after spinal cord injury – thanks to a neuroprosthetic interface that acts as a wireless bridge between the brain and spine, bypassing the injury.

Your virtual environment can therefore respond to your creative flourishes, even from a 2D or 360 photo: in an instant, your surroundings can change as you push back walls, create space here and there, add furniture and experiment with colors. The beta version of this software program will be available online starting today.\nCreating a 3D scenario ten times faster\nImverse’s time-saving technology could come in handy in a wide range of fields, such as real estate, architects, graphic designers, decorators and photgraphers – engineers could even use it for certain kinds of modeling. But the EPFL spin-off is initially setting its sights on the movie, medias and video game industry, where its software could be used for such tasks as sketching out scenarios in 3D, previewing movie sets and how they could change during a film and mapping out the locations of cameras and actors. “Producers can use it to take a photo of a real set, convert the 360 degrees image into a 3D environment and then, using virtual reality, edit it in order to visualize the scene before they film it. And they’ll be able to do these things ten times faster than with conventional programs,” says Javier Bello, the startup’s co-founder and CEO.\nSetting its sights on the movie industry from the start may seem ambitious, but the company has done its homework. Imverse’s founders have already begun feeling out the industry and making contacts, including at Sundance – the largest independent film festival in the US – early this year, and then later at the Cannes Film Festival. “Our first target market is the entertainment industry, because people who work there are already familiar with the types of software used for visual effects and motion capture. They can quickly grasp how our program can simplify their work and save them time,” adds Bello. What’s more, going after the movie and game industry will put them into contact with heavyweights like Intel, Microsoft and Oculus.\nA voxel-based, high-potential technology\nImverse is also aiming high for another reason: the technology on which its software is based can be used for many other applications. The company’s powerful voxel-based rendering engine obviates the need for those notorious polygon grids so familiar to video-game and animated-film makers. Voxels are not new, but until recently they required too much computing power to be feasible for real-time rendering.\n“This technology was developed over the past 12 years at EPFL’s Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, for use in neurology research. It lets us create smarter tools, processes and approaches for connecting hardware and software,” says Bello, a virtual reality expert. Bello, together with colleague and co-founder Robin Mange, sees broader implications – and thus a particularly bright future – for their technology. “And not just in virtual reality – we started with that field to show the high level of precision it can attain,” he adds.\nShaking a friend’s hand in the real and virtual worlds at the same time \nThe startup is also hard at work on bringing real-time representations of users’ bodies – and of other people around – into the virtual reality environment.

But a decade on, the satellite is still orbiting the Earth. And its systems remain fully operational. On Monday evening, space industry experts and members of the original design team attended a special event at the EPFL Space Center (eSpace) to mark this incredible milestone.\nSwissCube orbits 720 km above the earth’s surface. Traveling at a speed of 7,500 meters per second, or 28,000 km per hour, it completes 15 or so round-trips each day – adding up to a staggering 55,000 since its launch. The satellite has malfunctioned on more than one occasion, requiring a complete reboot. But it has sprung back to life every time, without fail, and is still emitting position, temperature and rotation speed signals today. Even the onboard camera works when activated.\nThe little satellite’s early days were anything but a smooth ride. In the hours after its launch, it was spinning so fast that it was unusable. It took almost a year before the rotation had slowed to the point where the team could control and use its systems. And it hasn’t fully completed its scientific mission: photographing and documenting polar airglow from the upper atmosphere.\nBut the real success story lies in the fact that SwissCube is still going strong. The design team made some bold choices, opting for untested low-cost materials and methods such as a standard cellphone battery that is only designed to withstand 500 charges. SwissCube’s battery has completed 55,000 charging cycles – and it’s still working. Those bold decisions paid off.\nA pioneering mission\nThe SwissCube story began in 2006 when researchers at EPFL set themselves the challenge of building the first all-Swiss satellite. The project lasted three years and involved around 200 students from several Swiss specialized universities. In addition to getting to grips with space technology, the students learned about the design process and gained important skills such as assuming individual responsibility, keeping track of minute details and working both within a team and with other universities. The satellite’s longevity is a testament to the skills of the young students who built it. Some members of the original team have gone on to forge careers in the space industry, including a group of students who founded Astrocast, an EPFL spin-off.\nSwissCube’s impact has been felt far beyond the mission itself. Shortly after launch, the team realized that space debris in the satellite’s path posed a real threat. Over 100 potential collisions have been reported to date. Some team members, including project manager Muriel Richard, decided to make the issue a focus of their research and have established a reputation as world-leading experts in the field.\nTo learn more about SwissCube and track the mission in real time, visit:", "summary": "The tiny Swiss satellite, launched in September 2009, is still working.

{"id": 1201, "text": "Magnesium is the lightest metal found on earth; it is four times lighter than steel and a third lighter than aluminum. It is also abundantly available, being the eight most common element in the earth’s crust. These features should make it the ideal material for all kinds of uses, particularly in the automotive industry where fuel efficiency is greatly improved by reduced vehicle weight. However, the use of this metal remains marginal. \"Magnesium has low ductility, that is, it cannot be stretched very much before it breaks. It also shows unusual behavior, such as a regime of increasing strength with increasing temperature, which is the opposite of most metals”, said Prof. Curtin. The Director of the Institute of Mechanical Engineering and his collaborator Zhaoxuan Wu, a long-term visitor in LAMMM from the Institute for High Performance Computing in Singapore, were able to identify the atomistic origins of Magnesium’s low ductility and unusual behavior. This breakthrough, published in the journal Nature, could open the way to many applications of this lightweight metal.\nSimulations to explain 40 years of experiments\n Solving this mystery had an interesting history: long struggles, tangential advances, a new collaboration, and a “Eureka” moment. \"I worked for 7 years on magnesium”, says Curtin. “We had some accomplishments, but not on the most crucial issues, and I was about to give up, having exhausted what I thought we could do. But then Wu came from Singapore and brought renewed energy, an array of necessary technical skills, and exceptional motivation”. Fast forward two years and the mystery is solved: they managed to establish a picture that unified decades of experimentation.\nThe real progress started with the development of a new description of the atomic interactions in magnesium, a feature essential if atomistic models are to reveal any true material behavior. \"We came across a rarely-used description of magnesium, and were able to tweak it and arrive at a new interatomic potential that predicted many well-established properties of magnesium with high accuracy.” Most importantly, this new potential accurately predicted the structure of an important dislocation, the “c a” dislocation, which is essential for magnesium to flow easily. This dislocation, observed experimentally, could not previously be predicted.\nThen came the “Eureka” moment. “We were performing atomic simulations of the normal “c a” dislocation to better understand its behavior, and suddenly it changed”. The atomic structure of the “c a” dislocation became entirely different, morphing into several possible geometries that locked it in place so that it could not move. Without “c a” motion, magnesium cannot flow plastically and so has low ductility. The new “c a” structures had been observed experimentally but how they occurred, whether they were real or experimental anomalies, and why there were several different structures, were all mysteries in the community. The work of Wu and Curtin showed that these new structures were intrinsic to magnesium, and they described why the different structures arise in different situations, and showed that all of these structures are more stable than the desirable “c a” structure. Thus, they found that it was inevitable that the new “c a” structures would form and kill the ductility of magnesium.\nA path to creating ductile magnesium\n \"To make magnesium malleable, we must fight against the forces of nature,\" said Wu. If science does not yet have a miracle solution to prevent the phenomenon, he notes that it is still possible to slow the morphing process of the “c a” dislocations. \"At room temperature, the morphing occurs almost instantly but when immersed in liquid nitrogen (temperature -195.79 ° C), it could take several months or one year.\" If the process could be delayed for a few seconds at normal temperatures, this could be enough to allow an industrial use.\nSeveral recent experimental studies in Germany have shown that it is possible to increase the ductility of magnesium by creating alloys with rare elements, such as yttrium, erbium, or holonium. Curtin believes these alloying elements bind to the normal “c a” and stabilize it somewhat, relative to the immovable “c a” dislocations. So, this is very promising, but these rare materials are very expensive and therefore unlikely to be used extensively by the automotive industry. Curtin and Wu are starting new research on how the expensive alloys, and other cheaper alloys, might stabilize the normal “c a” . “We must find a compromise between the cost of the alloy and the material performance” says Prof. Curtin. While he cannot predict when magnesium will be used heavily, he believes that the insights revealed by this new work will generate new ideas and approaches because the underlying origin of the poor behavior of magnesium is now more clearly understood.\n---\nThis research was conducted by William Curtin, of the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling in the Institute of Mechanical Engineering at EPFL and Zhaoxuan Wu, a visiting scientist at LAMMM from the Institute of High Performance Computing (Singapore).", "summary": "Zhaoxuan Wu and William Curtin of the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling (LAMMM) have solved the 40-year-old scientific riddle of the low ductility magnesium.", "claim": "Zhaoxuan Wu and William Curtin of the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling (LAMMM) have solved the a few seconds scientific riddle of the low ductility magnesium.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [18, 20], "noise": false}
{"id": 1203, "text": "Some places are avalanche magnets; consider the Vallée de la Sionne on southern flanks of the Sex Noir in Valais, where about one hundred avalanches come rumbling down every year. But evaluating which slopes are most prone to avalanches remains as much an art as it is a science. Today’s most advanced models simulate the physics of avalanches and aim to provide a short-term estimation of the risk for specific slopes. Two years ago, researchers from EPFL proposed a  to assesses long-term avalanche activity and quantify the statistical link between snowfall and avalanches. Using observations of close to 550 avalanches collected in the Vallée de la Sionne over six years, the researchers have now validated their model. They  in the Journal of Geophysical Research – Earth Surface.\nAccording to Benoît Crouzy, co-author of the study, the long-term assessment of the avalanche activity requires statistical methods. Today’s physics-based models are particularly suitable to make operational predictions several days into the future. But like weather forecasting models, they need to be fed with vast amounts of data and their accuracy tapers off after a few days. The statistical model Crouzy and his colleagues validated seeks to answer questions of a different nature. Rather than simulating the detailed mechanics of avalanches and the events that lead up to them, it focuses on their frequency and on their synchronization with snowfall. It further quantifies the degree of certainty associated to avalanche prediction from snowfall.\nThe model simplifies the dynamics behind avalanches as much as possible, says Paolo Perona, who initially developed the model two years ago. As opposed to methods that simulate the detailed physics of avalanches, this statistics-based approach needs only few parameters to calibrate: the average amount of snow per snowfall, the average time between them, and the rate at which the snow is compacted. The triggering of avalanches is modeled using probabilities, taking into account snow depth and a measure of the steepness of the terrain.\nData gathered by the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF in the Vallée de la Sionne provided Crouzy and his collaborators with the above-mentioned values needed for calibration. Combining this information with photographs taken before and after around 550 avalanches geo-referenced on a highly accurate 3D model of the topography, the researchers obtained previously unavailable data on the frequency of avalanche detachment, the expected time delay between snowfall and natural avalanches, and their long-term incidence in a given terrain.\nStatistical approaches to evaluate avalanche risk require observations of hundreds of individual avalanches to be calibrated accurately. But because avalanches are relatively rare – only few occur at the same place in a given year –, this data is often not available, which is one reason why these methods are less common than for the analysis of conventional hydrological hazards such as floods, says Crouzy. The availability of webcams and weather stations could now change that.\nReferences:\nPaolo Perona, Edoardo Daly, Benoît Crouzy, Amilcare Porporato (2012), Stochastic dynamics of snow avalanche occurrence by superposition of Poisson processes, Proc.

A call for projects is issued to scientists across all Schools.\nFrancesco Stellacci, Director of the new research center:\nWhy is it important to address the issue of food?\n Feeding the world's population is the next great challenge for the 21st century. Each year more than one billion ton\nWhat is the mission of the new Integrative Food and Nutrition Center?\n The CNU aims to bring together experts from all disciplines around the topic of food and nutrition and help them to find institutional funding for their projects or to launch start-ups. In conjunction, it will establish a link between researchers and industry, fostering the transfer of technologies.\n The center is built around several axes. These are: improving the means of production, reducing waste and developing new foods capable, for example, of treating certain diseases.\nWhat are the criteria for proposing a project to CNU?\n One of the principal investigators must come from EPFL. Otherwise, the center is open to all specialists. As with the Center for Energy Research, the CNU requires multiple competencies to carry out their projects. The creation of smart packaging or manufacturing new kinds of food requires multidisciplinary expertise, involving engineering as well as chemistry, biology and computer science.\nWhy establish this center in Switzerland?\n Food and health occupy a very important place in Switzerland. Food production accounts for nearly 5% of the GDP, which is the equivalent of the watch industry. The country is home not only to the company Nestlé but also to nearly 2,000 small and medium-sized enterprises operating in this field.

{"id": 1209, "text": "EPFL's fifth annual robot competition drew a sizeable crowd to the Salle Polyvalente this past week. Who were the stars of the show? Five autonomous robots, developed by EPFL students, which took turns strutting their stuff in the arena. Their mission was to collect recyclable plastic bottles scattered around the floor and deliver them to a collection point, while navigating around various obstacles. Each bottle represented a certain number of points depending on its position in the arena.\nThe robot named Baby won with pizzazz: it shot the bottles directly at the collection point with its integrated cannon while AC/DC music pumped in the background. Baby racked up 100 points, using its four sensors - three at ground level and one on top - to tell the bottles from the obstacles. Its approach is simple. When it encounters a bottle, its adhesive mechanical arm swings down, picks it up and drops it into its bin. Then, it shoots the bottles through the air towards the collection point with a cannon. \"The robot has an electronic compass to aim its cannon,\" said Chiara Ercolani, one of Baby's designers. \"And the power of the cannon is adjusted for the distance between the robot and the collection point.\" Antoine Tardy added: \"We thought it would be a waste of time for the robot to go back and forth to the collection point. And the idea of a cannon was really cool.\"\nOnce it had won, Baby had to face off against last year's winner, Conchitor. That robot, with its caterpillar tracks, collected 97.5 points. Not bad, but not enough to beat Baby.\nThe award for the \"coolest\" robot went to Système D, which changed color depending on whether its bin was full or empty. This robot, although nimble in collecting bottles, ran into problems when it came to unloading its cargo.\nManaging a budget and dealing with the workshops\n Professor Auke Ijspeert, the event organizer, was very pleased with this year's entries. \"The robots are developed as part of the students' semester project,\" he said. \"The students, who are all from the School of Engineering, work on them for a day and a half per week over the course of four months, which is not a lot of time. Every year the robots get sturdier.\"\nIt is a demanding exercise, the ultimate goal of which is educational. \"The participants have to manage a budget and learn how to share the work in designing the mechanics, electronics, and software of the robots,\" said Ijspeert. \"They also learn how to work with the School of Engineering's workshops in order to get the parts they need.\" Halfway through, the codes from past years' robots are provided to the participants. But the workload remains heavy. And at the end of the competition, everyone is exhausted. \"I left my sleeping bag in the room - now I can take it home,\" said Tardy. \"And I'm looking forward to eating something other than chips and snacks.\"", "summary": "Five robots developed by EPFL students faced off in the school's traditional robot competition.

{"id": 1212, "text": "What do AI-driven object location, smart baggage trolleys and quieter rail systems have in common? They are just some of the technologies to come out of the dynamic research relationship between Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and EPFL’s Transportation Center (TRACE). \n Today, the Swiss rail company unveiled a new innovation unit at EPFL, dubbed SBB Innocell, in a move designed to further cement this relationship, harness the high-level expertise available on campus, and build more innovation into its everyday operations. “EPFL has a thriving innovation ecosystem supported by big business and researchers specializing in rail transportation,” says Hans-Jörg Stark, who heads the new unit. “Tapping into this network will help us improve rail operations and use innovation to better serve our customers.”\n The School’s specialist knowledge – in fields ranging from bridge design and energy efficiency to passenger flow and timetable optimization – makes it a particularly attractive partner for a company like SBB. The Innocell builds on a formal relationship that dates back to 2014, when EPFL and SBB signed a cooperation agreement. That arrangement, known as SBB Hub, has given rise to a series of major research projects, including some funded by Innosuisse.\nExpertise and creativity\n The benefits of the relationship flow both ways. “We’re constantly sharing knowledge and ideas with our counterparts at SBB, even when we’re not working towards actual research projects,” says Simone Amorosi, who serves as deputy director of EPFL’s TRACE, the body responsible for liaising with industry and the public sector on passenger and freight transportation research. “And because SBB’s expertise is so broad, our labs often end up exploring novel solutions to practical problems that, on the face of it, have little to do with rail transportation.” One such example is the “On the fly” project, which uses building information modeling (BIM) software to create a digital twin of SBB’s network. It will be combined with AI-driven object location software to recognize real-world objects and link them to their equivalents in the digital model. The technology has promising applications for both network maintenance and operations.\nSBB’s arrival at the EPFL Innovation Park reflects a broader desire for collaboration between the railway company and Switzerland’s two Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne and Zurich.", "summary": "Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) opened a new innovation unit today at EPFL’s Innovation Park, further deepening its ties with the School.", "claim": "Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) opened a new innovation unit 2014 at EPFL’s Innovation Park, further deepening its ties with the School.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [11, 11], "noise": false}
{"id": 1215, "text": "Around 55,000 cargo ships ply the oceans every day, powered by a fuel that is dirtier than diesel. And owing to lax standards, maritime transport has emerged as one of the leading emitters – alongside air transport – of nitrogen oxide and sulfur. But the International Maritime Organization has enacted tighter emission limits, with new standards set to take effect in 2020. In response, an EPFL start-up is developing a low-cost and eco-friendly solution: a filter that can be installed in the ships’ exhaust stacks. The start-up, Daphne Technology, could do well on this massive market.\nLowering sulfur emissions to below 1%\nUnder laboratory conditions, the nanostructured filter is able to cut sulfur emissions to below 1% and nitrogen oxide emissions to 15% of the current standards. This is a major improvement, seeing as the new standards will require an approximately 14% reduction in sulfur emissions.\nManufacturing the filters is similar to manufacturing solar cells. A thin metal plate – titanium in this case – is nanostructured in order to increase its surface area, and a number of substances are deposited in extremely thin layers. The plates are then placed vertically and evenly spaced, creating channels through which the toxic gases travel. The gases are captured by the nanostructured surfaces. This approach is considered eco-friendly because the substances in the filter are designed to be recycled. And the exhaust gas itself becomes inert and could be used in a variety of products, such as fertilizer.\nThe main challenges now are to figure out a way to make these filters on large surfaces, and to bring down the cost. It was at EPFL’s Swiss Plasma Center that researcher Mario Michan found a machine that he could modify to meet his needs: it uses plasma to deposit thin layers of substances. The next step is to produce a prototype that can be tested under real-world conditions.\nThe idea to solve the problem of toxic gas emissions came to the researcher after working on merchant freighters while completing his Masters in microtechnology. It took several years, some techniques he picked up in the various labs in which he worked, and a few patents for Michan to make headway on his project. It was while he was working in another field at CERN and observing the technologies used to coat the inside of particle accelerators that he discovered a process needed for his original concept. An EPFL patent tying together the various aspects of the technology and several manufacturing secrets should be filed this year.\nAccording to the European Environment Agency, merchant ships give off 204 times more sulfur than the billion cars on the roads worldwide. Michan estimates that his nanostructured filters, if they were used by all cargo ships, would reduce these emissions to around twice the level given off by all cars, and the ships would not need to switch to another fuel. Other solutions exist, but his market research showed that they were all lacking in some way: “Marine diesel fuel is cleaner but much more expensive and would drive up fuel costs by 50% according to ship owners. And the other technologies that have been proposed cannot be used on boats or they only cut down on sulfur emissions without addressing the problem of nitrogen oxide.”", "summary": "Cargo ships are among the leading sources of pollution on the planet.

{"id": 1217, "text": "In early October 2019, when an unknown caller rang EPFL professor Johan Gaume’s cell phone, he could hardly have imagined that he was about to confront one of the greatest mysteries in Soviet history. At the other end of the line, a journalist from New York asked for  into a tragedy that had occurred 60 years earlier in Russia’s northern Ural Mountains – one that has since come to be known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. Gaume, head of EPFL’s  (SLAB) and visiting fellow at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF, had never heard of the case, which the Russian Public Prosecutor’s Office had recently resurrected from Soviet-era archives. \"I asked the journalist to call me back the following day so that I could gather more information. What I learned intrigued me.\"\nA sporting challenge that ended in tragedy\nOn 27 January 1959, a ten-member group consisting mostly of students from the Ural Polytechnic Institute, led by 23-year-old Igor Dyatlov – all seasoned cross-country and downhill skiers – set off on a 14-day expedition to the Gora Otorten mountain, in the northern part of the Soviet Sverdlovsk Oblast. At that time of the year, a route of this kind was classified Category III – the riskiest category – with temperatures falling as low as –30°C. On January 28, one member of the expedition, Yuri Yudin, decided to turn back. He never saw his classmates again. \nDyatlov's group on February 1st on their way to Kholat Syakhl. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation\nWhen the group’s expected return date to the departure point, the village of Vizhay, came and went, a rescue team set out to search for them. On 26 February, they found the group’s tent, badly damaged, on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl – translated as “Death Mountain” – some 20 km south of the group’s destination. The group’s belongings had been left behind. Further down the mountain, beneath an old Siberian cedar tree, they found two bodies clad only in socks and underwear. Three other bodies, including that of Dyatlov, were subsequently found between the tree and the tent site; presumably, they had succumbed to hypothermia while attempting to return to the camp. Two months later, the remaining four bodies were discovered in a ravine beneath a thick layer of snow. Several of the deceased had serious injuries, such as fractures to the chest and skull.\nI was so intrigued that I began researching this theory more deeply\nJohan Gaume\nWhat exactly happened?\nThe Soviet authorities investigated to determine the causes of this strange drama, but closed it after three months, concluding that a “compelling natural force” had caused the death of the hikers. In the absence of survivors,  is unclear to this day, and has led to countless more or less fanciful theories, from murderous Yeti to secret military experiments.\nThe tent as it was discovered by the rescue group, on 26 Feb 1959. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation\nThis is the mystery that Gaume was confronted with. “After the call from the American reporter, I began writing equations and figures on my blackboard, trying to understand what might have happened in purely mechanical terms,” he says. “When the reporter rang back, I told her it was likely that an avalanche had taken the group by surprise as they lay sleeping in the tent.” This theory, which is the most plausible, was also put forward by the Russian Public Prosecutor’s Office after the investigation was reopened in 2019 at the request of the victims’ relatives. But the lack of evidence and the existence of odd elements has failed to convince a large portion of Russian society. “I was so intrigued that I began researching this theory more deeply. I then contacted Professor Alexander Puzrin, chair of , whom I had met a month earlier at a conference in France.”\nThe Dyatlov Pass mystery has become part of Russia's national folklore. When I told my wife that I was going to work on it, she looked at me with deep respect!\nAlexander Puzrin\nGaume, originally from France, and Russian-born Puzrin worked together to comb through the archives, which had been opened to the public after the fall of the Soviet Union. They also spoke with other scientists and experts in the incident, and developed analytical and numerical models to reconstruct the avalanche that may have caught the nine victims unaware.\nDyatlov group monument erected in 1962 in Mihaylovskoe cemetery, Sverdlovsk. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation\n“The Dyatlov Pass mystery has become part of Russia's national folklore. When I told my wife that I was going to work on it, she looked at me with deep respect!” says Puzrin. “I was quite keen to do it, especially because I had started working on slab avalanches two years earlier. My primary research is in the field of landslides; I study what happens when a certain amount of time elapses between when a landslide is triggered and when it actually occurs.” According to Gaume and Puzrin, this is what happened in 1959: the hikers had made a cut in the mountain’s snow-covered slope to set up their tent, but the avalanche didn't occur until several hours later.\nOne of the main reasons why the avalanche theory is still not fully accepted is that the authorities have not provided an explanation of how it happened\nJohan Gaume\nBridging the gaps in the investigation\n“One of the main reasons why the avalanche theory is still not fully accepted is that the authorities have not provided an explanation of how it happened,” says Gaume. In fact, there are a number of points that contradict that theory: first, the rescue team did not find any obvious evidence of an avalanche or debris. Then the average angle of the slope above the tent site – less than 30° – was not steep enough for an avalanche. Also, if an avalanche occurred, it was triggered at least nine hours after the cut was made in the slope. And finally, the chest and skull injuries observed on some victims were not typical of avalanche victims.\nConfiguration of the Dyatlov group’s tent installed on a flat surface after making a cut in the slope below a small shoulder. Snow deposition above the tent is due to wind transport of snow. \n© \nGaume/Puzrin\nIn their investigation, published in \nCommunications Earth & Environment\n – a new journal by Nature Research – on\nJanuary 28, Gaume and Puzrin attempt to address these points. “We use data on snow friction and local topography to prove that a small slab avalanche could occur on a gentle slope, leaving few traces behind. With the help of computer simulations, we show that the impact of a snow slab can lead to injuries similar to those observed. And then, of course, there’s the time lag between the team cutting into the slope and the triggering of the event. That’s the main focus of our article. Previous investigators have been unable to explain how, in the absence of any snowfall that evening, an avalanche could have been triggered in the middle of the night. We had to come up with a new theory to explain it,” says Gaume.\nSimulation of the dynamics of a snow-slab avalanche and its impact on a human body. \n© \nGaume/Puzrin\nOn the night of the tragedy, one of the most important contributing factors was the presence of katabatic winds – i.e., winds that carry air down a slope under the force of gravity. These winds could have transported the snow, which would have then accumulated uphill from the tent due to a specific feature of the terrain that the team members were unaware of. “If they hadn’t made a cut in the slope, nothing would have happened. That was the initial trigger, but that alone wouldn’t have been enough. The katabatic wind probably drifted the snow and allowed an extra load to build up slowly. At a certain point, a crack could have formed and spread, causing the snow slab to release,” says Puzrin.\nJohan Gaume and Alexander Puzrin making a proof of concept of the Dyatlov case in Davos, Switzerland. © Jamani Caillet\nBoth scientists are nevertheless cautious about their findings, and make it clear that much about the incident remains a mystery. “The truth, of course, is that no one really knows what happened that night. But we do provide strong quantitative evidence that the avalanche theory is plausible,” Puzrin continues.\nThe two models developed for this study – an analytical one for estimating the time required to trigger an avalanche, created by ETH Zurich, and SLAB’s numerical one for estimating the effect of avalanches on the human body – will be used to better understand natural avalanches and the associated risks. Gaume and Puzrin’s work stands as a tribute to Dyatlov's team, who were confronted with a “compelling force” of nature. And, although they were unable to complete their treacherous expedition, they have given generations of scientists a perplexing enigma to solve.\nOf the ten experienced hikers, only Yuri Yudin, who fell sick at the outset and had to return, survived. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and ETH Zurich have conducted an original scientific study that puts forth a plausible explanation for the mysterious 1959 death of nine hikers in the Ural Mountains in the former Soviet Union.

{"id": 1218, "text": "What impressed you about NeighborHub?\nThe whole project fascinated me. I learned about it after the Swiss team’s “famous” victory in Denver, and had the honor of taking Germany’s president on a tour of the building during his visit to Switzerland. NeighborHub’s success shows that a cross-disciplinary approach can be highly effective for resolving complex issues – and that such an approach is one of the strengths our country can leverage. The project brought together experts in fields ranging from energy and ecology to design, mobility and even food production. The project also shows the added value in bringing together EPFL, the University of Fribourg and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Each one added essential skills and experience to the project.\nHow can this type of research initiative help foster progress in your department’s areas of focus?\nEvery field of research has not only its own body of knowledge, but also its own methods. This type of cross-disciplinary approach can bring fresh ideas to discussions that experts from the same field might have among themselves. Also, we’re interested in tangible results, and that’s something NeighborHub delivers. We can market the building and integrate it into our society. This is the kind of initiative that can help effect change.\nWhat advice would you give to the current generation of students?\nThat they need to take a proactive role if they want to advance their fields. According to EasyPark’s Smart Cities Index – which ranks cities according to criteria such as mobility, sustainability, energy, quality of life and digital infrastructure – Zurich comes in fourth place and Geneva, ninth. So we’re not on top, and still have progress to make in the areas that today’s youth are concerned about.\nHow important is the research done by Switzerland’s specialized universities for public policymakers?\nYou are our gems! You do excellent work that bolsters our country’s economy and global reputation. The Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne and Zurich are ranked among the best universities in Europe. You drive innovation and are at the forefront of the latest developments. For us it’s very important to stay updated on what your researchers are doing – what international projects they’re working on. We need to bring initiatives like NeighborHub out into the spotlight. They harbor useful new technology that should be shown and promoted to small businesses and society in general. Our talks with universities are a source of inspiration for us and point the way forward, including in terms of funding.\nTransportation – especially by air – isn’t exactly good for the environment, but people today are traveling more than ever. What are your priorities for responding to this growing need? Planes, trains or automobiles?\nI believe it’s dangerous to set priorities for specific means of transportation. Today’s lifestyles are shifting towards multimodal systems, and that trend is set to accelerate. Our strategy is to identify investment opportunities in various forms of transportation and infrastructure based on their environmental impact, energy use and the number of people they carry. Trains are clearly the best choice for long-distance travel, but when it comes to visiting other countries, flying is an inexpensive, quick and easy solution. All we can do there is question whether those low fares are appropriate or disconnected from the market. And there are the issues of CO\n2\n emissions and the use of kerosene-based versus gasoline-based fuel.\nSwitzerland is behind other countries such as Norway when it comes to electric vehicles. Do you have any measures planned to encourage EV use?\nWe do fairly well when compared with other European countries. Norway clearly comes out on top, but that’s thanks in large part to subsidies – something we want to avoid. Our country’s car importers have set themselves the target of having 10% of new cars be electric by 2020 [the figure is currently 0.4%]. We could do more, but that would depend on three key variables: the vehicles’ range, their cost – which is increasingly in line with that of standard cars – and our country’s charging station infrastructure. We are in the process of building that infrastructure, but we need the support of cantonal and municipal governments as well as the private sector. The Swiss Federal Roads Office is encouraging the installation of charging stations at highway rest stops. For now, electric cars in Switzerland are exempt from taxes and duties, except for the highway pass. But given that these cars are driven on our roadways, it would make sense to eventually ask their drivers to contribute to the cost of maintaining those roadways. However, the timing for that is still very much up in the air.\nDoris Leuthard during one of her visits at EPFL, in 2013. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL\nHow do you feel about self-driving cars? Do you think they could help alleviate traffic congestion and bottlenecks?\nI’m not sure if they could be part of the solution, but I do know that the technology is advancing at a rapid pace. In any case, those cars still need road infrastructure, so that doesn’t change our plans or investment objectives. It will be interesting to see the day when all cars on the road are autonomous. But in the meantime, as long as there’s a mix of driver and driverless cars, that won’t change traffic flows, speeds or safety. Plus there’s a number of legal and ethical issues that still need to be sorted out.\nThis summer EPFL students will compete in the Hyperloop competition. Do you see a future for this technology?\nI see it as a visionary concept, like Solar Impulse. These ideas typically strike us as eccentric, or even unrealistic, but sometimes we need to think outside the box. Such large-scale programs usually result in many smaller projects that churn out genuine solutions. In research, including at EPFL, you need vision and a sense of daring. It would be a mistake to focus only on research where we know the outcome. We have to push boundaries, conceive the unconceivable. But that’s harder in politics, where we have to be pragmatic.\nAnd how do you feel about the planned underground freight system?\nWe’ve been behind this project from the start. There are clear benefits to reducing the amount of freight traffic on our national highways, especially if the funding comes from the private sector. The idea seems feasible and I think the costs can be managed. Now it’s up to the project investors to decide – they will have to submit their plans to the Swiss Federal Council since a special law would need to be passed for the project to go through.\nThe days for nuclear power as we know it are numbered. But Switzerland still has five operating nuclear plants that will need to be decommissioned. Do you think there’s much of a future for careers in nuclear engineering?\nNuclear engineers, physicists and other such experts are still very much needed, and the dwindling appeal of this field is worrying. A nuclear power plant can run for 50 years and takes ten years to decommission, meaning we’ll need qualified personnel for our Leibstadt plant, for example, until 2045. That’s a long career for someone just starting out. But on top of decommissioning, there’s also R&D. We’re still involved in the ITER project because who knows – maybe we’ll see a major breakthrough ten years from now. Not to mention the possible applications in healthcare.\nYou’ve had a lot of success championing various political issues. Which were you the most enthusiastic about?\nProbably Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050. That was especially tough in the months right after Fukushima. I asked myself a lot of questions – what should we do? What’s feasible? Do I have the courage to go through with it? To help find the answers, I worked with businesses, cantons and cities, as well as EPFL and ETHZ, which was all extremely interesting. The EPFL and EPFZ scientists did a lot to support us, providing expertise in areas like energy efficiency, renewable energy and economic feasibility studies. As a politician, I often have a hard time getting my head around the technical details, so it was nice to be able to draw on that network. Thanks to their support, I had the courage to stand behind the strategy, knowing that experts have confirmed that our plans are technically feasible. That left me with the political part of the job – getting the various parties, the Swiss parliament and eventually the Swiss people on board.\nWhat do you plan to do after you leave the Swiss Federal Council?\nThere are a lot of things I’m interested in, but the first thing I plan to do is take some vacation. I promised my husband we’d go on a long trip and get a closer look at the wonders of this planet.\nAfter you go, there could be just one woman remaining on the Federal Council, down from four in 2010. Does that worry you?\nYes, because in politics, as elsewhere, women are underrepresented. I plan to continue to defend women’s issues after I step down from the Federal Council. It’s true that there may be just one or two women on the Federal Council for a while. But I think there is already pressure to change that, especially on the PLR and the UDC which each have two seats. The women are there, but we shouldn’t look only at the federal level; there are also many female political leaders at the cantonal level who could serve on the Federal Council. Parliament just needs to elect them.\nBrief bio\n1963\n Born in the Canton of Aargau\n1991\n Admitted to the bar\n2006\n Elected to the Swiss Federal Council\n201\n0 & 2017 Served as president of Switzerland\n2017\n Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050 approved in a referendum", "summary": "Doris Leuthard, head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, takes a hands-on approach.

{"id": 1225, "text": "With its 500 km diameter, the asteroid Vesta is one of the largest known planet embryos. It came into existence at the same time as the Solar System. Spurring scientific interest, NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft on Vesta’s orbit for one year between July 2011 and July 2012.\nData gathered by Dawn were analyzed by a team of researchers from EPFL as well as the Universities of Bern (Switzerlanf), Brittany (France) and Arizona (USA). Conclusion : the asteroid's crust is almost three times thicker than expected. The study does not only have implications for the structure of this celestial object, located between Mars and Jupiter. Their results challenge a fundamental component in planet formation models, namely the composition of the original cloud of matter that aggregated together, heated, melted and then crystallized to form planets.\nAt EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory (EPSL), led by Philippe Gillet, Harold Clenet had a look at the composition of the rocks scattered across Vesta’s ground. \"What is striking is the absence of a particular mineral, olivine, on the asteroid’s surface,\" said the researcher. Olivine is a main component of planetary mantles and should have been found in large quantities on the surface of Vesta, due to a double meteorite impact which, according to computer simulations, \"dug\" the celestial body’s southern pole to a depth of 80 km, catapulting large amounts of materials to the surface.\nThe two impacts were so powerful that more than 5 % of Earth's meteorites come from Vesta. « But these cataclysms were not strong enough to pierce through the crust and reach the asteroid's mantle,» Harold Clenet continued. The meteorites originating from Vesta and found on Earth confirm this since they generally lack Olivine, or contain only minute amounts compared to the amount observed in planetary mantles. Also, the spacecraft Dawn did not find olivine in the vicinity of the two impact craters. « This means that the crust of the asteroid is not 30 km thick, as suggested by the models, but more than 80 km. »\nComposition of planets\nThese discoveries challenge models that describe the formation of Vesta, and consequently the formation of rocky planets in the Solar System including planet Earth. Cooling theory and \"re- melting\" phenomena in the depths of previously solidified elements would also need to be reviewed. \"The crust might have been thickened by the formation of \"plutons\", that is: igneous rock intrusions, hundreds of meters large, some of which emerged to the surface,\" explained the scientist.\nIf Vesta has less of a (olivine-rich) mantle and more of a (pyroxene-rich) crust, then the proportion of materials making up Vesta, and probably the Earth and other telluric planets (Mars, Venus, Mercury), is different from what was previously expected.\nA more complex model of planet formation therefore has to be considered, one that takes into account not only the original composition of planets, but also their orbits, sizes and related cooling times. Vesta is the only known asteroid that has an earth-like structure - with a core, mantle and crust – making it an incredible laboratory for testing hypotheses and theories.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have a better understanding of the asteroid Vesta and its internal structure, thanks to numerical simulations and data from the space mission Dawn.

{"id": 1226, "text": "Twenty years ago, each research laboratory within the Chemistry Department trained its own technician, which was a drain on resources. So it was decided that a joint training unit for preparative and analytical chemistry would be created in order to improve efficiency and ensure consistency. Francis Perritaz, now head of technician training at EPFL, was put in charge of setting up the training lab. Four budding young technicians made up the first class in 1997, and each year since 2006 there have been 24 trainees across the three years of the course.\nCéline Henzelin runs the Training Laboratory now and also trains the first-year students. \"They're taking their first steps as lab technicians – they’re rookies, so they’re curious and have a fresh perspective. They can easily get hooked very quickly and go far.\" Her colleague, Luke Harris, takes the second-year trainees under his wing, while the third years work with the various research groups.\nHenzelin studied at the University of Lausanne. She completed her doctoral thesis at EPFL before going to work in the pharmaceutical industry. Later on, she did a teacher training course and then applied for the job at the Training Laboratory six years ago. \"What first interested me about this job was being at EPFL and the importance placed on practical training.\"\nBeing a chemistry lab technician is a very demanding job that requires great rigor and strong technical skills. Trainees specialize in preparative and synthetic chemistry. They have to be able to synthesize and characterize known and new molecules for therapeutic or research purposes. They also have to be able to use their know-how in other laboratories, which is what they learn when they work with the research groups for their third-year internships.\n\"Our relationship with the professors, doctoral students and post-doctoral students is very important. We are in regular contact with them so that we know what they'd like us to improve in our training. That way, when the trainees arrive in the laboratory for their final year, they are already autonomous and prepared to further strengthen their skills,\" explains Henzelin. Trainees come out of the course with versatile skills and the know-how they need to work in the chemistry industry.\nAnd even if the training is conducted in an academic setting, the two trainers are always thinking ahead to what the industry will need: \"Both Luke and I know that world well because we came from there.\"\nSo what do the trainees do once they've finished the course? It may sound surprising but the Training Laboratory is also a stepping stone to further studies: a third of trainees end up enrolling in an engineering school and around 2% go on to EPFL or another university – some even finish by doing a PhD. \"One of the first trainees who went through the program is now a research and teaching associate in the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering,\" says Henzelin. \"In each year, there's at least one trainee who goes on to study at the university level.\"\nThe Training Laboratory's 20th anniversary is also an opportunity to look to the future. Starting this September, the laboratory will offer new training prospects for young lab technicians. They will be able to do an in-company internship lasting between six months and a year in the UK, Ireland or elsewhere in Europe to fine-tune both their linguistic and their technical skills once they've earned their qualification.\nSo what's next? Céline Henzelin has a ready answer: \"Keep training motivated young technicians who love their work. And here's to the next 20 years!\"\nAlec Gagnebin, Sarah Mikami and Xavier Volet are in their second year. Their week is divided up into two days of classes and three days in the lab – they all say they prefer the practical training to the theory.\nAlec enjoyed math and wanted to learn more about chemistry. He couldn't really see himself staying in school, sitting in class five days a week. What does he like best about the training program? Making new things and contributing to research.\nSarah decided to follow the training program after doing a chemistry internship.

{"id": 1227, "text": "EPFL experts have offered the Canton of Bern three solutions to preserve the Sutz-Lattrigen archaeological site on the shores of Lake Biel: a submerged dike, a breakwater or a protective flexible concrete mat. All three options are intended to prevent waves from eroding the objects, stilts and other remains of a civilization that dates back to the Neolithic period. The experts were commissioned by the Canton of Bern in 2015 and will present their final report to various representatives of the cantonal government on 31 October.\n\"Our task was to look at ways of protecting the lake bed and shoreline in the most discreet way possible,\" explains Azin Amini, a specialist in coastal projects and director of the study conducted by the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH). With this in mind, the members of the laboratory organized several meetings with those concerned, including environmental, forest and landscape conservationists, representatives from the cantonal archaeological service, and engineering firms already involved in other projects on Lake Biel. These meetings helped the experts to set criteria regarding the extent to which the site and the shoreline should be protected, how sustainable the solution needed to be, and the desired impact on the landscape and the environment, both during the construction phase and afterwards.\nDuring big windstorms, the archaeological remains, which include wooden stilts, weapons, jewelry and other household objects, get washed away by the waves. Once this happens, the items are considered to be lost. The LCH lab came up with three ways of ensuring that the site would be protected in the event of very strong winds and looked at the impact each solution would have for events, which have a return period of 50 years. They had to create a numerical model to examine how the waves propagate and dissipate.\nThree options\n The three options put forward by Amini's team were designed specifically for Lake Biel. The first option involves constructing a submerged dike, surrounding the archeological site, a few hundred meters from the shoreline in order to tame the current. In the inner part of the dike gravel-based material would be spread over the underwater site, forming a protective layer. The advantage of this option is that the dike would be 20 centimeters below the low-water level, which means it would be barely visible. The shore line would then be further stabilized using biological engineering techniques involving plants. The second option consists of building a breakwater all the way around the site so that almost no current or waves can pass the barrier and erode the site. The barrier would be 340 meters long and visible from the shore.\nThe lab's third and final proposal tackles the erosion directly by installing a protective mat over the site. A geotextile or stainless steel net would be held down with blocks of concrete, making the whole structure look like a flexible bar of chocolate. The covering could be removed if needed. biological engineering techniques would also be used to protect the shoreline.\nTraces of the pile dwellers\n The site near Bern provides rare insight into how our first sedentary ancestors lived on the shores of our lakes more than 5,000 years ago. Pile-dwelling remains were initially discovered when the levels of the three lakes in Jura Canton were lowered at the end of the 19th century. These prehistoric pile dwellings are found in only six European countries – France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria and Slovenia. Sixteen Swiss cantons appear on UNESCO's World Heritage list, with the entire Sutz-Lattrigen site added in 2011.\nIn 2014, a protective covering held down with gravel and a supple geotextile was placed over the underwater village. But the strength of the lake’s waves meant that this was not a viable long-term solution. \"In recent years, the erosion observed at Sutz-Lattrigen has been much greater than that seen at other UNESCO pile-dwelling sites, so an in-depth study was needed. The EPFL report is very important because it helps us to understand exactly what's happening,\" says Marianne Ramstein, archaeologist and deputy head of the Canton of Bern's underwater and prehistoric archaeology unit. \"The next step will be to find the most realistic solution and do the costing.\"", "summary": "An EPFL study commissioned by the Canton of Bern has come up with three possible ways of protecting the Sutz-Lattrigen archaeological site, which offers a rare insight into the lives of pile dwellers.

{"id": 1229, "text": "The Bridge City project archives – comprising five models, twelve rolls of plans and dozens of drawings, photographs and files – have just been transferred from New York to their new home at EPFL’s Modern Architecture Archives (ACM). New York-based architect Bernard Tschumi donated the archives to ACM, where they will join those of his father Jean Tschumi, founder of the Lausanne School of Architecture and the architect behind Swiss insurer Vaudoise’s headquarters in Lausanne, the World Health Organization’s buildings in Geneva and Nestlé’s headquarters in Vevey.\nThe Bridge City designs were commissioned by the City of Lausanne in 1988 and were developed jointly by Bernard Tschumi and fellow architect Luca Merlini. Their concept won the City’s request for proposals to redevelop the Flon district, which was then an abandoned industrial zone. Their idea was to build four inhabited bridges between Chauderon Bridge and where Place de l’Europe is currently, in order to link the two sides of the Flon river valley. They also planned to demolish all but four of the industrial warehouses and create a park at the southern end of the site, on the slopes of Montbenon.\nThe bridges would hold residences, shops, a theater, a museum and an auditorium for the University of Lausanne and the Lausanne University of Art and Design (ECAL). Diagonal stairways and ramps would provide passageways between the upper and lower areas.\nBut none of that happened. The designs spent eight years collecting dust in the city hall, as urban planners faced opposition from the property’s owners – LO Holding – as well as a coalition of the right, green and workers’ parties. The Bridge City project was eventually abandoned. Instead, Tschumi and Merlini, along with architect Emmanuel Ventura, built only the Flon interface, which included a pedestrian bridge, Place de l’Europe, the Flon metro station and the LEB station, and was opened in 2001. LO Holding developed the rest of the Flon district on its own.\nTschumi, a dual French-Swiss citizen, is today a prominent figure in the global architecture community. He spoke to a packed room at EPFL on 11 October as part of Archizoom’s \nIsle of Models\n exhibition. We sat down with him for a look back – and ahead – at his field.\nThirty years on, what lessons can EPFL students and researchers learn from the Bridge City archives?\nThere were two aspects to our Bridge City project. The first was architectural and urbanistic in the conceptual sense – we aimed to understand how a site’s characteristics can lead to an abstract idea. And how we can then transform this idea so it becomes an integral part of the site itself. The Flon valley’s topography suggested an approach that was at once architectural and urbanistic. We no longer saw any distinction between the two; the concept and the context blended together. The second aspect concerned versatility. We wanted to transform bridges into places where people can also live, study and shop. We weren’t the first ones to come up with the idea of turning infrastructure into architecture – just look at Ponte Vecchio in Florence. This approach could interest researchers today, especially since – as far as architecture is concerned – culture and usage haven’t changed much from one century to the next. Architects in the 15\nth\n and 21\nst\n centuries face largely the same challenges because we still work in three dimensions, we work with mostly similar materials and we work on the scale of the human being.\nWhat do you think of the Flon district as it stands today?\nI’ve always felt that our Bridge City project was a missed opportunity. The way the Flon river valley has been developed doesn’t take advantage of Lausanne’s topography. The district currently has a lower part, in the bottom of the valley, and an upper part. But the diagonal – passing from the lower to the upper part – is completely ignored. However, Lausanne is one of the world’s few 3D cities – like \nMetropolis\n in the film by Fritz Lang. If you look at drawings by Futurist Italian architect Antonio Sant'Elia [b. 1888, d. 1916], where he imagined a vast network of bridges – that’s Lausanne. I know of no other city with such a high density of bridges. Bridges in Lausanne have an urbanistic function; they are not solely infrastructure. The inhabited bridges in our Bridge City project would have been arteries connecting the upper and lower areas.\nCouldn’t high-rise buildings serve this purpose in Lausanne?\nHigh-rise buildings are a cliché, a lazy concept. And there’s no logic behind simply throwing up high-rises arbitrarily. Manhattan has a lot of high-rises because its surface area is small and narrow, because the ground conditions make it possible and because someone was clever enough to invent elevators. But if an architect told me he was going to build a high-rise in Chavannes, I would ask him “Why? What’s the underlying concept?” The smartest high-rise in Lausanne is still the Bel-Air building because it connects the bottom of the Flon valley with the street level above and is cleverly placed at the end of Grand Pont. A 20-story building rising from the river-valley floor up to and above Pont Bessières would also be a good idea.\nYou were Dean of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture from 1988 to 2003 and ran your own architecture firm. In both of these roles you showed an interest in digital technology. How do you believe the digital transformation has affected the teaching of architecture and the architecture profession? \nWhen I started as Dean in 1988, I never set out to make Columbia a research center for architecture software. But three or four years later I saw that architects were not using the new modeling programs that were out there – programs to create special effects, like those developed for \nJurassic Park\n (1993), and programs used in biology and fluid mechanics. This also has to do with the idea of versatility. So we started looking at how the new software could be used in more versatile ways and applied to architecture. Here we began blurring the lines between different disciplines. AutoCAD had been around since 1985 but wasn’t very exciting. With the newer software being released at the time we entered into an experimental period. We saw that we could invent new types of spaces and tried to apply them to actual projects. It was an exciting time. But software developers soon began adapting their programs to market demand, making them more “civilized.” Now you can easily build a house or a set of shelves or design a landscape, for example.\nWhy is this a loss? \nBecause instead of sparking new ideas, the software mimics reality as it already exists. It creates a kind of hyperrealism that is completely at odds with the experimental mindset I mentioned earlier. And that leads to another problem: today the people commissioning architecture projects want to see images of what the structures will look like, and rather than evaluating designs with their heads, they just take them at face value. They’re interested only in “what it’ll look like.” That means architects have to cater to developers who don’t know how to read a blueprint or a cross-section, or how to comprehend anything abstract. In my view that has done great prejudice to the architecture profession. We can group all these hyperrealistic images into a kind of dictionary of clichés; it’s all become very pedestrian. The tools we use have a big influence on how we think. Mediocre tools lead to mediocre thinking. Today’s architects need to rise above that. Some of the designs for our Bridge City project took abstraction to the extreme. Today our proposal wouldn’t even make it to the shortlist.\nHow do you fight against this standardization of the profession in your teaching at Columbia?\nMy colleagues and I try to bring back the system of representation, such as by deforming computer images or not using them at all. We try to force software to do things it wasn’t designed to do, in an effort to move the concept forward in a way that goes beyond hyperrealism.\nKey dates\n25 January 1944: Born in Lausanne to a Swiss father, Jean Tschumi, and a French mother\n1969: Studied in Paris, London and Zurich; obtained an architecture degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich\n1969–1980: Taught at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London\n1975: Moved to New York\n1981 and 1994: Published \nThe Manhattan Transcripts \n(Academy Editions and St. Martin’s Press\n1983: Won the contract to design La Villette park in Paris and opened an architecture firm in France\n1988: Founded Bernard Tschumi Architects (BTA) in New York; won the contract to redevelop the Flon district in Lausanne with his Bridge City concept\n1988–2003: Served as Dean of the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University, New York\n1994–2010: Published \nEvent-Cities Series\n (MIT Press)\n1994: MoMA exhibition \nBernard Tschumi: Architecture and Event\n, New York\n1997: Fresnoy National Studio for the Contemporary Arts, Tourcoing, France\n1999: Lerner Hall Student Center, Columbia University, New York\n1999: Ecole d’architecture de Paris, Marne-la-Vallée\n2001: Flon interface, Lausanne\n2001: Zénith concert hall in Rouen, France\n2003: Florida International University’s School of Architecture, Miami\n2002: Founded Bernard Tschumi urbanistes Architectes (BTuA) in Paris\n2004: Vacheron Constantin Headquarters and Manufacturing Center, Geneva\n2007: Richard E.

{"id": 1236, "text": "Numerous researchers are looking at the impact of climate change on the Alps. And one of the most obvious effects is the low snowfall observed in recent years. EPFL researchers have discovered that this lack of snow also has an impact on mountain streams. We have known for some ten years now that these streams, together with the Alps’ lakes and rivers, release a large amount of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) into the atmosphere as a naturally occurring phenomenon. But the study shows that a warm winter with little snowfall can change all this. The lack of snow means that once spring comes, the streams release more CO\n2\n than they absorb. “This is the first study that shows the impact of climate change on the global carbon cycle in alpine streams,” explains Tom Battin, director of the Stream Biofilm and Ecosystem Research Laboratory (SBER) and co-author of the study, which has just been published in the journal \nEcosystems\n.\nComparing two winters\n This phenomenon was reported after researchers compared data from two consecutive winters – the winter of 2012-2013, which was considered normal, and that of 2013-2014, which was exceptionally warm. “After a normal winter, our study showed that during a 70-day ‘magic window,’ the streams absorb more carbon dioxide through photosynthesis than they produce naturally,” explains Amber Ulseth, a researcher at SBER and lead author of the study. “After a warm winter with very little snowfall, more production of CO\n2\n takes places during the spring, which means that the streams release more carbon dioxide than they absorb. There is no magic window, and the alpine streams become a net producer of CO\n2\n.”\nAt this stage, it is still hard for the researchers to measure the exact quantity of CO\n2\n released into the atmosphere. They can, however, determine some of the potential consequences. The rivers fed by these small alpine streams will, for example, receive less organic carbon with less snowmelt to drive their metabolism. Less snowmelt could have a worrying impact on the entire ecosystem, as it may end up altering the water flow. The study’s authors also think it would be worth studying the impact that this is likely to have on the hydroelectric network that relies on these rivers – particularly the dams – and the potential consequences to the carbon cycle within these alpine streams.\nHigh-tech sensors\n To better understand how these mountain streams behave, the latest generation of environmental sensors were deployed for 18 months in 12 streams that run into the River Ybbs in the Austrian foothills. The sensors were placed between 700 and 1,500 meters above sea level and measured the region’s water ecosystem – a first in this kind of study. Every five minutes they measured three parameters: light intensity, streamwater temperature and oxygen levels. With this data, it was possible to observe the photosynthesis process and the ecosystem’s “carbon respiration,” which in turn provided information on the carbon flux. “This research couldn’t have been conducted ten years ago because the sensors we used didn’t exist,” says Ulseth. “By collecting data every five minutes, we could really take each stream’s pulse and measure the metabolism of the entire ecosystem.”\nNew Valais study and big data\nBattin’s teams are now going further in their research. For the past year, they have been working on 12 streams located in Valsorey, Champéry and the Val Ferret in Valais Canton, and in the Vallon de Nant in Vaud Canton. The researchers have been taking more in-depth measurements across this region, which is higher and larger than the region in the Austrian foothills used for the previous study. And instead of three parameters, ten parameters are being measured every ten minutes using new sensors. This phase of the research project is being supported by EPFL Valais-Wallis, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the European “C-Cascades” project, which is aimed at better understanding the role of the carbon cycle in regulating the climate.\nFor around three years, the researchers will collect millions of data – a method that has become essential in environmental science. To process the data, Battin’s team is working closely with the new Swiss Data Science Center, a joint venture between EPFL and ETH Zurich with offices in both Lausanne and Zurich.\nReference", "summary": "An EPFL study has for the first time measured the impact of climate change on alpine streams, and the results are quite worrying: after a low-snow winter, these streams release more carbon dioxide than they absorb.", "claim": "An EPFL study has for the first time measured the impact of climate change on alpine streams, and the results are quite worrying: after a low-snow the spring, these streams release more carbon dioxide than they absorb.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [30, 31], "noise": false}
{"id": 1240, "text": "The increase in road traffic is only one problem factor in terms of making the roads safe in winter. “The maintenance services often end up stuck in traffic, and completely incapable of fulfilling their mission”, explains Professor André-Gilles Dumont of the EPFL . To address these kinds of problems, some sections of freeway – for example the Lausanne bypass – have been equipped with valve systems: “They work like automatic lawn sprinklers, and enable us to deliver a preventive salting, which is also ecological, since this method only uses 2 grams of salt per square meter, instead of 15.” Professor Dumont’s laboratory has been working on the method of application of this concept for more than ten years. Today, the use of salt remains the preferred method: studies performed in Berne have shown that the use of gravel or sand is not a solution. Their production, retrieval from the drains, and their decontamination, results in a considerable ecological impact, and although sugar is less abrasive, its current price is too high.\n However, solutions will have to be found. Minus 10° Celsius on Tuesday; 8° on Thursday – these sudden changes in temperature around zero degrees are particularly interesting for the laboratory: “When the climate approaches an exotic kind of model, with sudden temperature changes and such rapid differences, road surfaces can be badly affected, with ruts appearing, and the alternate freezing and thawing can alter the characteristics of the surface.” A thesis project has therefore been launched, financed by the Federal Roads Office, in order to understand the effects of these cycles, using a model that simulates the temperatures both on the surface and underneath. “We can observe speeds of variation of surface temperature of the order of 5 degrees per hour”, adds Professor Dumont.\n And what if the problem of black ice could be resolved by a heated road surface? Professor Lyesse Laloui, responsible for the EPFL studying the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of soils, is exploring this question. The laboratory has been working for around 10 years on a new, renewable energy source – energy-generating geo-structures. It consists of using the foundations of a concrete building to collect and store heat : “After having worked on exchanging energy in buildings, we recently began to look at the problem of black ice on bridges. The idea is to capture the heat on the bridge-deck in summer, and then to use abutments to retrieve it and store it in the earth.” By installing a circuit of tubing under the blacktop surface, like underfloor heating, and then circulating water mixed with a heat-retaining fluid thru it, a temperature is obtained that prevents the formation of a fine layer of black ice.\n Professor Laloui’s ideas on the subject go even further: to use the heat of the tunnels, where there is a constant temperature of about 25° Celsius! “This energy is there, and readily available. Our idea is to use the anchoring bars of the tunnel as heat-exchangers. For us, it involves a genuine transfer of knowledge; the solutions used for the buildings now enable us to perform digital simulations and determine their feasibility.”\n Auto-cleaning road surfaces, heated bridges, energy-producing tunnels – it’s also on our roads that we will find solutions to future climatic challenges.

{"id": 1244, "text": "Peptides are biological molecules, made up of short sequences of amino acids. Because they are easy to synthesize, show low toxicity and high efficiency, peptides such as insulin and other hormones can be used as drugs. But peptides are quickly cleared by the kidneys, which means that we can only use peptide drugs that act within minutes. This problem can be overcome by connecting peptides to ligands that bind blood-serum proteins such as albumin, allowing the peptide to linger in the bloodstream longer. EPFL scientists have now developed such a ligand, which is easy to synthesize and has a high afﬁnity for human albumin. Published in \nNature Communications\n, the new ligand could potentially extend the half-life of peptides from minutes to several days. \nPeptides combine a number of attractive features for drugs: low toxicity and immune reactions, high affinity and efficacy for their targets, and accessible chemical synthesis. The only problem is “renal clearance”: peptides are generally cleared by the kidneys within a few minutes of entering the patient’s blood. For example, one of the most common peptides, insulin, has a bloodstream half-life of only 4-6 minutes. Another hormone, oxytocin — given intravenously to induce or accelerate labor — has a half-life of 10-15 minutes.\nSuch short timeframes imposed by renal clearance severely limit the therapeutic potential of these potentially ideal drugs. One promising way to increase the half-life of peptides is to “piggy-back” them onto blood-serum proteins, such as albumin, which is the most abundant protein in the blood serum and has a half-life of nineteen days. This however, requires an intermediate ligand molecule that can be attached to the peptide during synthesis, and also have a high affinity and selectivity for human albumin.\nThe lab of  has now developed such a ligand, which has a high affinity for human albumin and — more importantly — is easy to synthesize and attach to a peptide. The ligand is made by fusing a fatty acid with another peptide. The resulting molecule is referred to as a “chimera” and combines the best of two worlds from the field of albumin ligands. \nPrevious efforts built ligands based on either fatty acids or peptides, and have tried them on insulin. But whereas fatty acids somewhat extended the half-life of insulin, they generally didn’t bind albumin very strongly. On the other hand, peptide-based ligands bind albumin well, but showed low solubility, meaning it didn’t distribute insulin in the blood very well.\nThe new ligand literarily brings together the advantages of both fatty acids and peptides. The researchers searched for an amino acid sequence that would complement the fatty acid’s weak binding of albumin. Using an elegant “iterative” synthesis and screening method they discovered a peptide sequence that increases the binding of the fatty acid twenty-seven times. The final chimera ligand binds human albumin with high affinity (Kd = 39 nM), is highly soluble, and can be appended to peptide drugs using standard synthesizing techniques.\nThe researchers demonstrated \nin vivo \nthat the ligand prolongs the half-life of several bioactive peptides more than 25-fold. They then appended the ligand to an actual peptide developed to treat pathogenic thrombosis, which has a notoriously impractical short half-life. The ligand was shown to extend the effectiveness of the peptide by several hours, inhibiting the disease in rabbits.\n“We expect that the tag presented in our work will interest a larger research and business audience because it is applicable to virtually any peptide moiety, including small proteins,” says Heinis. “The ligand can be appended to any peptide during solid-phase peptide synthesis on standard synthesizers, making it easily accessible for academic and industry labs.”\nThe innovative technology can potentially also be applied to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of bicyclic peptides developed by , a startup co-founded by Christian Heinis and  in 2009, and of which EPFL is a shareholder. On June 1 this year, Bicycle Therapeutics r. The company's focus is the bicyclic peptide (Bicycle\n®\n) product platform, which combines properties of several therapeutic entities in a single modality: exhibiting the affinity and selective pharmacology associated with antibodies; the distribution kinetics of small molecules, allowing rapid tumor penetration; and the “tuneable” pharmacokinetic half-life and renal clearance of peptides.\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation \nReference\nAlessandro Zorzi, Simon J.

{"id": 1248, "text": "In response to a request from the French-speaking Switzerland chapter of the Swiss Architects’ Federation (FAS), EPFL agreed to study how to better protect architectural heritage even outside of Switzerland. The School launched a project where around 150 first-year architecture students took a fresh look at the Lake Geneva region as a whole from both an environmental and heritage standpoint, with a particular focus on two sites: Patrick Bouchain’s La Grange au Lac, dedicated to the cellist Rostropovitch, and La Buvette d’Evian, which was built in 1957 by French architect Maurice Novarina, structural engineer Serge Ketoff and builder Jean Prouvé.\nBringing La Buvette back to life\n Under the project, the students first spent the winter semester learning about the role architects can play in helping to preserve a local ecosystem. Then in the spring semester, they built the wooden structures that will be assembled near the two heritage sites in Evian. The students’ architectural designs include stages, a projection screen, a garden, a lookout area, a greenhouse, water swings and a bird wall. The project is being spearheaded by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE) with the goal of reviving the La Buvette refreshment area, which, despite being listed as a French historical monument, has been lying abandoned for nearly 30 years. \n After successfully testing their designs in Switzerland, the students will cross Lake Geneva on 27 May to build the structures on site. The structures will be inaugurated at a ceremony on 28 May attended by representatives of the City of Evian, FAS and Evian Resort. In addition, concerts by Zéphyr and Tuorka – two quartets from the Lausanne Conservatory, a play entitled “Paysages Impossibles” by Sébastien Grosset and a sound performance by Louis Jucker on the subject of landscapes will be held on 28 and 29 May.\nPart of a broader initiative \n The French-speaking Switzerland chapter of FAS has been studying options for renovating La Buvette d’Evian since 2014. “Through this renovation project, which EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM) had already worked on, students from ALICE are contributing to a broader initiative to redevelop the whole site. The initiative includes Lausanne’s and the Lake Geneva region’s bid to host the International Union of Architects’ 2023 World Congress, as well as the 2020-2023 Leman Architecture Connection (LAC) – a Franco-Swiss program carried out in association with the Haute Savoie office of architecture, urban planning and the environment. Each of these projects has its own strengths and aims to turn La Buvette and the surrounding area into a high-caliber cultural center that forms an integral part of the Lake Geneva landscape,” say Jeanne della Casa and Sarah Nedir, the two presidents of the French-speaking Switzerland chapter of FAS. \nUntapped cross-border potential \n According to Dieter Dietz, an architecture professor at EPFL and the director of ALICE, the renovation of La Buvette, an icon of modern architecture, could also help forge closer ties between Switzerland and France. “I don’t see the “La Buvette” project as specific to Evian, but rather as part of an infrastructure that encompasses the whole Lake Geneva region. La Buvette could help strengthen ties that, while they do already exist, are not very visible. Things may have changed since the 1970s, when each side of the lake clearly represented two separate countries, but this relationship could still be taken much further. Through our various partnerships on this project, we are trying to build a coherent cultural and territorial narrative,” says Dietz.\n The City of Evian is proud to be a part of the project. “By hosting students from EPFL and showcasing their work, we hope to illustrate how the two sides of the lake are in fact connected. For us, it is important to protect our unique cultural and architectural heritage and enable people to enjoy it – which is the essence of the La Buvette project,” says Evian Mayor Josiane Lei.\nThe evolving nature of architecture \n The work of EPFL’s students in Evian is part of a new ALICE project called Becoming – a three-part exploration patterned on the HOUSE 1, HOUSE 2 and HOUSE 3 series of wooden homes constructed in turn in Lausanne, Zurich and Brussels. With Becoming, Dietz advocates a concept of architecture in constant flux and that upholds the new value system our society must adopt if we are to save our planet. “Our goal now is to learn how we can situate ideas and spatial constructions, in relation not just to our society but to life in general and our natural resources, and how we can anchor architecture so that it can both be and ‘become’ – hence the name for this new three-part series,” he says. \n (pictures and program)\nFrom June 29 to July 6, the Rencontres musicales d'Evian will take place in the structures built by EPFL.

{"id": 1256, "text": "Croatia’s pilot tenure-track program will brighten the career prospects of a handful of the country's top young researchers. The program, which was officially launched today in Zagreb, was developed by EPFL, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education, the Croatian Science Foundation (CSF) and various academic institutions in Croatia. This ambitious program, which has a budget of 4.7 million francs, aims to drive innovation in Croatia and limit brain drain.\nFollowing a selection process that began in March, four young and highly promising Croatian researchers will be awarded tenure-track professor status. They will each receive a budget of one million francs to set up a laboratory, hire a team and put a research program in place – all within four to five years.\n“Not only do we want to encourage the talented pool of Croatian scientists living abroad to return home, but we also want to give young researchers a real chance, responsibilities and future prospects in their own country so they will no longer need to go abroad in order to have a successful career,” says Olivier Küttel, head of International Affairs at EPFL. To achieve this, the program will offer a package that includes a team, equipment, lab space, administrative support and, most importantly, a free hand in managing these resources. If, after four years, the pilot program is a success and the researchers live up to expectations, they will be given tenure.\nTome Antičić, State Secretary for Science and EU funds at the Ministry of Science and Education, describes the importance of this project for his country: “Croatia is home to very talented scientists, and we must offer the best of them career prospects so that we can retain them. The tenure-track program proposed by EPFL, funded by Switzerland and implemented by the Croatian Science Foundation is a very promising model, and we as a Ministry will closely monitor its success. In fact, the Ministry is in the process of establishing a new research system based much more on international excellence, and this model could form the basis for a much larger initiative in the near future.”\nSuccessfully tested\nThe idea dates back four years, right after Croatia joined the European Union. The project, which was even more ambitious at the time, was submitted to the European Commission for funding through the Horizon 2020 program. Then, on 9 February 2014, the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative passed in Switzerland, and the project had to be re-thought and scaled back. In the end, the project will be funded through the one billion francs that Switzerland has contributed to the EU for Eastern European countries. The Croatian government will cover 15% of the project's cost in addition to providing appropriate research facilities.\nThis pilot program presented EPFL’s Senior Management with an opportunity to promote its widely hailed tenure-track system. EPFL is one of the only universities in Europe to use this system, which it put in place in 2000. A total of 171 people have benefited from this status at EPFL, and many of them have won ERC Starting Grants, which are the most prestigious awards bestowed on young researchers by the European Council.\nEPFL experts have played an active role in designing Croatia’s pilot project from the outset. They are also closely involved in evaluating the applicants. The winners will be announced this fall.\n“This initiative is meant to attract and retain the best scientific minds. We also hope that it will have a multiplier effect over the longer term,” says Küttel. “These talented young scientists will certainly attract others like them, create jobs and startups, and ultimately give Croatia’s economy a real boost. And since it’s a pilot project, it could be quickly rolled out in other European countries.”", "summary": "Under a pilot project that draws on EPFL’s expertise, four highly promising young Croatian researchers will be awarded tenure-track professor status and receive a million francs to set up a research program in their country.

{"id": 1267, "text": "A greenish light emanates from a curious structure that has been installed in a pavilion on the Federal Square in Bern. As part of the Swiss Energy and Climate Summit taking place this week, the demonstration bioreactor illustrates a particularly promising technology for synthetic natural gas production developed by Christian Ludwig and his team from the Paul Scherrer Institue and EPFL.\nThese new “powerplants” have many advantages. “Growing algae consume CO2 from the atmosphere,” Ludwig explains in his presentation, which is scheduled for this Friday in Bern. “As it transforms, it re-emits the CO2 but in a concentrated form that we might be able to sequester and store, for example, underground. This system also produces renewable biogas, thus avoiding the problem of competition with food crops.”\nAlgae have one notable advantage over other sources of biomass: they “grow” much more rapidly. In favorable conditions, they can generate 30-55 tons of dry matter per hectare per year – five to ten times more than sources such as corn, soy, or sugar cane. “And above all, they can be cultivated without soil, simply in bioreactors exposed to sunlight, thus avoiding the use of fertile croplands that are needed for food production,” Ludwig adds.\nIn closed circuit\n The process presented this week, which goes by the name SunCHem, transforms the algal biomass into methane via catalytic hydrothermal gasification. “This device doesn’t require any solvents and can use non-potable water,” adds Mariluz Bagnoud, a scientist from EFPL’s Environmental Engineering Institute. “In addition, the nutritive elements the algae need, such as phosphorus, are recycled in the process and re-injected into the culture medium. It is an important breakthrough because these resources are limited, too.”\nAlthough the environmental impact is thus minimal, the yield is enormous: 60-70% of the potential energy of the biomass produced in these “photo-bioreactors” can be recuperated in the form of natural gas, with all the advantages that this represents in terms of transport and use – it can simply be injected into an existing gas distribution network. “We have examined the entire length of the chain, from the choice of algae type and how it’s cultured to its transformation into natural gas, in order to identify the best solutions at every stage,” explains Ludwig. “We’re currently working on the regeneration of our ruthenium-based catalyzer.”\nBiosynthetic natural gas will play an important role in the energy supply in coming decades. Switzerland will depend on its natural gas power plants as it enters a transitional phase of abandoning nuclear power. “A sustainable and decentralized production of biogas that doesn’t require the use of land necessary for food production has many advantages that we should now be exploiting,” concludes Ludwig.", "summary": "Technology developed at EPFL and the Paul Scherrer Institute to transform microorganisms into methane gas will be presented at the Swiss Energy and Climate Summit taking place this week in Bern.

{"id": 1270, "text": "The pandemic-related uncertainty doesn’t seem to have dampened investor appetite or the determination of fresh entrepreneurs. EPFL startups had an excellent year in 2020 when it came to fundraising – they attracted a record CHF 293 million, and four of them raised over CHF 20 million each. What’s more, 21 startups completed their first fundraising round with proceeds of CHF 1–5 million. Also in 2020, 25 new EPFL spin-offs were created, which is close to the previous year’s figure. In addition, 34 business plans are in the works by EPFL researchers who have already received first funding. André Catana, the head of EPFL’s startup unit, says: “The startup world is a unique microcosm where the payoff is long term. And it held up well in 2020 despite the economic fallout from the pandemic, although we did see a decline in the CHF 5–20 million funding range.”\nThe CHF 293 million – which rises to CHF 351 million if the total includes companies that are based on campus but not direct spin-offs of the School – was collected by around 30 young businesses, including four that brought in over CHF 20 million each. These four include Kandou, a maker of high-speed data transfer systems that raised CHF 32 million on top of an already successful round in 2019, and Sophia Genetics, a fast-growing company that develops data-driven medicine technology and that signed up CHF 100 million at the end of the year – the most of any Swiss business in 2020. Other EPFL startups raised a hefty CHF 5–25 million each, such as Lightbend, Lunaphore, CREAL and Insolight. Clearspace also deserves special mention, as it won a CHF 93 million contract from the European Space Agency to conduct further development work on its space debris removal system.\nThe rest of the CHF 293 million went to the 21 firms that carried out their first fundraising round in 2020, bringing in CHF 1–5 million each. This underscores investors’ confidence in and appetite for deeptech startups, which could require many years before the technology they develop in a lab is turned into a market-launched product. “This funding comes in when the businesses have just been spun off, and provides a solid foundation for them to grow and attract more investors,” says Catana.\nA total of 410 startups have come out of EPFL labs and accelerators in the past 50-odd years. Many of them received assistance from the various programs run by the School’s startup unit within the Vice Presidency for Innovation. This assistance includes not just financing to help the engineers reduce risk, accelerate their path to market and build teams but also advice, training, networking opportunities and forums for sharing their experience. The goal is to quickly teach them the ins-and-outs of starting a business and give them a boost in getting their ideas off the ground. 25 new EPFL spin-offs were created in 2020, down slightly from the previous year (27) but not far from the record set in 2018 (29). In addition, with 34 new business ideas being incubated at EPFL, the startup future looks bright.\nA higher number of female entrepreneurs\nA record number of EPFL women started their own businesses in 2020, continuing the positive trend of the past three years. Over a third of EPFL startups created in 2020 had at least one female founder. This trend is also reflected in the many startup awards that women have won recently. For example, Depoly and Oxyle (from ETH Zurich) won the >>venture>> startup competition in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and Xsensio won a 2020 CES Innovation Award at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.\nCleantech and sustainability\nMajor technological advancements have been made in critical areas such as sustainability, the environment, energy and social responsibility. Nearly a third of the EPFL spin-offs created in 2020 (seven of the 25) are developing solutions to address these global challenges.

So we decided to base our project on it,” says Alexis Barrou, who is studying environmental sciences and engineering.\nBarrou, along with five other undergraduate students from EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) – Léo Benjamin, Elise Hautefaye, Doriand Jaton, Delphine Klumpp and Thomas Vila – came up with a plan to transform the wood from discarded pallets on the EPFL campus into everyday furniture by creating a catalog of easy-to-make designs. They dubbed their project CHEAP, for \nCatalog of Handmade Elements Assembled from Pallets\n.\nThe CHEAP catalog presents seven easily replicable designs – a table, chairs, a bar and stool set, a lounge chair, a bench, a coffee table and planters – based on the most widely used type of pallets in Switzerland. The pieces are designed to leave behind the least amount of wood scrap possible – the students kept this constraint in mind as they spent hours researching and experimenting. The result is a series of unique pieces.\nBasic tools\nThis project stands out for another reason too: there’s no need to be an accomplished do-it-yourselfer to bring these designs to life.

The first few pages of the catalog guide the users on how to select the right type of pallet so that their furniture won’t expose them to toxic paint or become moldy.\nThe catalog was enough to convince EPFL’s Act 4 Change Lab, a platform that encourages sustainable projects at EPFL, to support a series of furniture-building workshops on campus in conjunction with CHEAP. The Lab agreed to provide the designers with space for the workshops, so that interested students can come together to build their low-cost and sustainable furniture.\nA virtuous circle\nThe idea for the design manual came out of the Student Kreativity and Innovation Lab (SKIL), which gives ENAC undergraduate students of all backgrounds a chance to explore a research topic of their own. That’s where the six students – who are studying either architecture or environmental engineering – pooled their expertise to develop the CHEAP catalog: “While the environment students cut up the pallets and tried out different designs, the architecture students modeled them using their 3D software and told us what they thought would work,” says Elise Hautefaye proudly. “We learned together every step of the way.” Hautefaye has already used the pallet wood to create a nightstand, bed slats and balcony furniture.\nServing students’ various needs\nThe students behind CHEAP will attempt to awaken the DIY spirit in their peers when they run the furniture-building workshops at the start of the school year: “We want students to see that there’s no need to buy new furniture, which they’ll simply sell after graduating,” says Barrou. “Our approach is more sustainable.” The team also feels that the workshops will serve other purposes, such as helping students who are short on cash, interested in meeting new people or keen to get their hands dirty. A number of finished pieces will be displayed at strategic spots on campus, including during EPFL’s open doors event on 14 and 15 September. This will help to raise awareness of the problem of wood waste and the many ways it can be given a new life. That’s CHEAP: a valuable lesson.", "summary": "A group of EPFL students who came together in the Student Kreativity and Innovation Lab (SKIL) has created a catalog of designs for turning wood pallets into furniture.

{"id": 1275, "text": "More than two months ago, EPFL researcher Julia Schmale joined the crew of the \nPolarstern\n, a German research icebreaker that has been drifting slowly through the frozen waters starting north of Siberia towards Svalbard since September last year. The vessel is carrying an international team of scientists on a year-long research expedition, working in unusual and often challenging conditions: changeable weather, temperatures plummeting as low as –40°C, interminable darkness giving way to endless daylight, and ice as far as the eye can see.\nThe crew is carrying out research as part of a major expedition titled Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, or MOSAiC for short, which aims to gain fundamental insights into conditions in the Arctic, the impact of climate change on the region and vice versa the region’s influence on global climate change.\nSchmale, an atmospheric scientist, is leading the observatory’s atmospheric research team. She and her PhD student Ivo Beck had planned a mid-April return to Switzerland, where she was recently appointed head of the brand-new Extreme Environments Research Laboratory at EPFL, but the COVID-19 crisis means both will remain on board until early June. Schmale is no stranger to polar environments, having taken part in the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) in 2017. Her role in this latest expedition is to study how airborne molecules and particles influence cloud formations in the Arctic. In this interview, she talks to us from the front line about living and working in this extreme environment, what it’s like to head out onto the ice floe, and the aims and methods of her research. The complete interview is available on the EPFL Out there website.\nWhat’s it like living and working on the ice?\n“Unpredictable. The icescape changes frequently and new cracks, leads and ridges form overnight, often preventing us from reaching our research sites on the ice. Depending on how severe the changes are, we might need to go scouting \nfor a new route or reschedule whatever activities we had planned. Sometimes the ice becomes dynamic during the day while we’re out. When that happens, we either have to keep a close eye on our path back to the ship or we get called back by the bridge, where the on-board team coordinates and monitors activities out on the ice. Before we head out, we always complete a trip log detailing who’s going where, what gear they’re carrying and – importantly – who’s acting as the polar bear guard. Most of us are qualified polar bear guards, a role that involves keeping a permanent lookout while our colleagues are working. We carry a flare gun to scare any bears away, as well as a rifle to use if an animal approaches us too quickly. On 23 April, we saw the first bear on our floe since we arrived in early March.\nThe environment is just beautiful. It was still dark when we arrived, with only a slither of daylight on the horizon. The research sites on the floe looked far away, but they were easy to reach across flat ice. Now, with the sun up 24 hours a day, everything seems much closer. But moving about is much harder because \nmany leads and cracks have formed, especially between the ship and our team’s main research site. With temperatures at around –20°C, open leads freeze over relatively quickly – about 6 cm in one day. Sometimes, ridges form when open leads close and we can end up surrounded by ice rising up to 6 meters high in just a couple of hours. On occasion, we can hear the ice moving and, if it happens fast, we can also see it. It’s also fascinating to watch frost flowers grow. We sample them to learn about their biogeochemistry.\nAnd what about the weather?\nWe’ve experienced the full range of Arctic weather conditions in our time here. We’ve had persistent low temperatures of –40°C, which makes working outdoors very challenging and renders some of ship’s equipment unusable. March was particularly stormy, with strong winds and a few complete whiteouts. Conditions have settled down recently, though. We have clear skies, sunshine and light winds – very much like winter in the Alps. Now that we’ve drifted below 84°N, warm air mass intrusions from the Atlantic are pushing temperatures as high as 0°C, bringing surface melt and rain.\nWhat samples are you collecting and why?\nI’m studying the extent to which natural and human emissions modify low-level Arctic clouds. These clouds play a vital role in maintaining the Arctic’s energy and mass balances because they reflect and absorb radiation, and because they contribute to snow cover through precipitation. In general, clouds only form in the presence of cloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles. These are a subset of aerosol particles that can originate from natural sources such as sea spray, phytoplankton emissions or blowing snow, but also from human activities such as fossil-fuel combustion, other industrial emissions and agriculture.\nWe can use our on-board instrumentation to characterize aerosol particles in terms of their microphysical and chemical properties. Variables such as number concentration, particle size distribution, hygroscopicity, chemical composition and fluorescence help us to understand their origin – natural or human – and their potential effects on clouds. Our end goal is to understand how far natural versus human-made processes contribute to cloud formation and to the energy balance in the Arctic, and how this might change as the so-called “New Arctic” evolves and human emissions change in the future. Ultimately, this information can be used in Arctic climate change scenarios.\nWhat have you learned about the Arctic air so far?\nBy looking at the data, I get an almost real-time picture of the composition of the atmosphere. When air masses come from the north – from the High Arctic – the aerosol population is aged, meaning several days to weeks old, and consists mainly of sulfuric acid. This is a common winter phenomenon known as Arctic haze, when sulfur dioxide emissions – mostly from human activity in the mid and high latitudes – accumulate over the wintertime. The haze began forming back in November. Initially, the concentration was about 50 particles per cubic centimeter. Now it’s risen to 200.\nDuring stormy conditions, salty snow is lifted into the air where it forms aerosol particles. The number of particles depends on several factors, including the microstructure of the snow, how wind-pressed it was, and its surface roughness. Because these particles make up a significant share of the overall aerosol population, they likely play an important role in cloud formation.\nWhen air masses arrive from the south, however, all these variables are different. The particles have been processed by clouds, and differ in origin, size and chemical composition. Mid-April is the time when phytoplankton blooms happen in the Atlantic. These blooms emit dimethyl sulfide, which is transformed to methanesulfonic acid – a tracer that we’re now seeing in the aerosol particles. We’ve also found halogens – iodic acid and bromine – in the aerosol population. These are more local in origin, and are connected to snow chemistry and UV radiation. And, of course, we also see exhaust particles from the ship, skidoos and helicopters. They carry a distinctive signature that sets them apart from other aerosol types.\nHave you personally observed changes in the Arctic climate?\nThat’s a difficult question. I don’t have a reliable benchmark because this is the first time that I, like many other members of the team, have been this far north at this time of year. Generally speaking, we didn’t anticipate observing so much mobile ice so early in the year. We expected to see a much more consolidated ice pack. But this might not necessarily be a sign of climate change. What was striking, however, was that precipitation fell as rain instead of snow when Atlantic air masses arrived in mid-April.\nIs the COVID-19 crisis affecting life on an Arctic research vessel? \nYes, definitely. It’s affecting us in two main ways. First, we’re all hearing news from home about how the world has changed and what it means for our families, friends and colleagues. It’s a real cause for concern and we talk about the pandemic a lot. Second, the outbreak has disrupted the crew changeover schedule. It’s taken us several weeks to figure out our options, given the travel restrictions in force around the world. Despite the delays and uncertainty around when we’ll \nreturn home, I’m happy to report that crew morale is high. We’ve grown together as a fantastic team of scientists who communicate openly and look out for each other. It’s also made my job much easier, as one of the five science team leaders on board.\nAs someone who’s used to spending long periods on boats, how are you coping with living under lockdown?\nI’d hardly call this a lockdown. We have a lot more freedom than people back at home. We can still work, go out, hold social gatherings, exercise and eat together. Of course, we can’t travel far from the ship and our activity options are limited. But you don’t really notice those things when you’re surrounded by such a fascinating environment, making friends and building new working relationships. All in all, it’s been an immensely satisfying and rewarding experience.\"", "summary": "The German research icebreaker Polarstern has been drifting through the frozen waters of the Arctic Ocean since September last year.

In conditions where the famous “bise” or a strong wind prevail, it’s common to encounter waves of 1.5 meters or higher. As for the breezes, they vary from shore to shore, sometimes from one extreme to the other.

The frequency and impact of cyber attacks are increasing – Swiss technology company RUAG is a recent victim – and the USA, Russia and China are engaged in a virtual war combining espionage and sabotage. It is no surprise that governments, businesses and the scientific world recognize the need to protect their sensitive data. This neutral virtual space could thus be applied not only to intergovernmental and international arbitration, but also to the commercial and industrial world, as well as any type of exchanges where mutually distrustful parties must find a means and venue to cooperate.\nCommon ground for exchange and negotiation \nData-protection measures are being enhanced, but the need to share data across borders remains a challenge. “Encrypted data can be exchanged through a cloud, but for that you have to trust the service provider in Silicon Valley. Switzerland, on the other hand, has built a track record in creating common ground for exchange and negotiation, and could use this to play a leading role in this field,” said Ford. He believes that “Switzerland can and should develop a neutral virtual space.” This is a technological niche that would give the country a clear edge over other countries providing the same service.\nThis neutral space could be developed through distributed databases called blockchains, which are already being aggressively developed in the field of finance. “Just like with the virtual currency Bitcoin, all transactions are public and verifiable by all participants,” said Ford. Cryptographic technologies that allow transparent validation and processing of data that remains encrypted (unlike Bitcoin) already exist. Several EPFL and ETHZ labs are hard at work developing safer decentralized systems and seeking to improve the methods used for encrypting data, detecting attacks and safely sharing biometric data.\nProgress in this field will be crucial in the coming years, with the rise of the Internet of Things and the advent of self-driving cars. “The security risks raised by these phenomena will be a real challenge for society in the next five years,” said Ford.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nThe Swiss Cyber Research Initiative\nOne of the goals of the conference is to launch the Swiss Cyber Research Initiative, aimed at fostering a community of experts in this field in Switzerland. “This initiative was developed by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation in partnership with other federal entities,” said Karl Aberer, vice president of EPFL and the conference co-organizer. “By bringing together industry, research and government experts, we can enhance the level of collaboration in the field of IT security in Switzerland.”", "summary": "The first Swiss Cyber Risk Research Conference, being held today at EPFL, brings together Swiss and international IT security specialists.

{"id": 1285, "text": "From above, it almost looks like part of the Great Wall of China. Lignon, a massive architectural complex built between 1963 and 1972, is now part of Geneva’s cultural heritage. The longest building in Europe – 1.5 km – today houses some 6,500 people.\nBut the entire architectural design, audacious at the time, no longer meets current energy consumption standards. The 100,000 square meters of thin exterior “curtain walls” have no structural role; they only protect apartments from climatic extremes, but at a level that is now considered substandard. Because they are a fundamental element of the building’s character, however, it was unthinkable to change their outward appearance when it became necessary to update the buildings’ insulation.\nThe government of Geneva and the Lignon property owners’ group thus approached EPFL to study options that would improve the buildings’ energy consumption while still preserving its unique character.\nTwo variants\n Franz Graf, head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM), led this extensive research project, which began in May 2008. “We were lucky to be able to do this in a very systematic and in-depth manner, to reunite all the stakeholders around the same table, and to outline various scenarios,” he explains.\nOf the four options initially considered – from simple maintenance work to complete replacement of the curtain walls – two were seen as feasible: overhauling the existing facades while increasing the level of insulation and replacing windows, for energy savings of about 33%; or their complete renovation, which would involve installing brand new insulation on the opaque panels, for energy savings of 38-40%.\nThese results, delivered in mid-2011 and compiled in an impressive book*, allowed the property owners to make an informed decision about the way they chose to renovate. Above all, since the work had to be done from inside the buildings, they were able to plan the work in the way they saw fit. Over the next six months, 23 apartments will be renovated.\nCommunal areas – hallways and entrances – will also undergo a facelift. And the installation of solar collectors on the roofs will enable the complex to reach a level of energy efficiency compatible with the Minergie standard, as well as reducing CO2 emissions by thousands of tons. Graf hopes that this undertaking will “serve as a model for renovating other buildings like this.”\n* \nLa cité du Lignon, 1963-1971.

{"id": 1292, "text": "Barak Obama insulting Donald Trump, Trump accusing Obama of stealing, and Mark Zuckerberg making worrying claims about how Facebook uses personal data – fake videos like these, which look disturbingly real as a result of artificial intelligence, have been spreading across social media over the past few years. Until recently there were still some tell-tale signs that could indicate videos were fabricated, like eyes that never blink. But today these phony videos – commonly known as deepfakes – have become so realistic that it’s all but impossible to spot them with a naked eye. As a result, scientists, entrepreneurs and government agencies, driven by worries about the consequences of misinformation and motivated by the challenge of weeding out the fakes, are tackling the problem head on.\nBeefing up an existing deepfake detection solution\nEPFL’s Multimedia Signal Processing Group has been working with Quantum Integrity, a startup based at EPFL Innovation Park, on a deepfake detection solution for the past two years. The research team has already completed two pilot tests and recently obtained a grant from Innosuisse, Switzerland’s innovation agency, to accelerate development of a software. The project will start on 1 October. “Quantum Integrity already markets fake detection software. Our role is to make the software more powerful so that it can be used more widely,” says Touradj Ebrahimi, head of the Multimedia Signal Processing Group. His group provides expertise in multimedia signal processing, while the startup brings its many years of experience in detecting fake images. Ebrahimi is affiliated to the Center for Digital Trust () and coordinates its “Digital Information” domain. “Detection of image and video forgery to fight against malicious manipulations is clearly one of the applications where Artificial Intelligence helps to regain trust” says Olivier Crochat, Executive Director of the C4DT.\nA game of cat and mouse\nThe game between deepfake creators and the experts who try to catch them is one of cat and mouse. And the deepfakers tend to be one step ahead, since they can come up with an almost unlimited number of new contents that the experts must then try to detect. As soon as word gets out that deepfakes can be identified because people’s mouths don’t move naturally, for example, a malicious programmer will develop an algorithm to remedy that problem. This is the vicious circle that Prof. Ebrahimi at EPFL, together with Quantum Integrity CEO Anthony Sahakian, aim to put an end to.\nProf. Ebrahimi’s team is keeping the details of its technology under wraps for now, since many other research groups have started to work on the same problem, and they have a two-year advance when compared to competition. Prof. Ebrahimi only states that “the detector also relies on artificial intelligence to keep pace with the latest tricks used by deepfake artists.”\nThe risk of commercial fraud\nThe biggest fear that most people face vis-a-vis deepfakes is that they will be used to steal their identity. But the threat actually runs much deeper – fraudulent contents can also be used to deceive manufacturers, insurers, and even customs officials. For instance, goods can be digitally added to or removed from a cargo ship before it leaves the dock, or transactions could be approved using photos that have been counterfeited.\nThe technology developed by EPFL and Quantum Integrity uses a machine-learning algorithm that has been trained on a huge database that the startup has created over years. This gives their technology an advantage over competing systems. The goal is to eventually create a website where people can upload a content and know immediately whether it has been falsified.\nA threat for social networks \nThe research team’s deepfake detection solution comes at a perfect time, because phony content is becoming increasingly common on social media. A Chinese app called Zao, introduced in late August and currently available in just a few countries, can produce deepfakes that appear astonishingly real using a few photos. Facebook and Microsoft recently announced that they would invest $10 million in a new deepfake detection program, with more details to come in December. The company recently launched the Deepfake Detection Challenge in association with several US universities to find the best solution for what could turn out to be a real problem for social media. EPFL’s solution could be a candidate for the Challenge since it spans a variety of applications, from industrial photos to facial videos. “But we’d need to know more about details of the evaluations criteria and the terms for entering the Challenge, especially as far as intellectual property rights are concerned,” says Prof. Ebrahimi.", "summary": "Deepfakes – or fake videos produced to look real through the use of artificial intelligence – pose a growing challenge.

{"id": 1293, "text": "A number of Switzerland’s ski resorts are reaching a point of saturation, with peak-time traffic jams, buildings popping up in avalanche zones, and general encroachment upon the natural surroundings. While the current trend is to stop construction, an EPFL doctoral thesis suggests that the opposite might actually be necessary: we need to invest in these regions, increase their density, and ensure seamless public transportation to and from them.\nAt the Architecture and Urban Mobility Laboratory (LAMU), Fiona Pià, from the Principality of Andorra, studied and compared the challenges faced by the Swiss resorts Verbier, Zermatt, and Andermatt Swiss Alps, as well as France’s Avoriaz and Canada’s Whistler-Blackcomb. Her thesis highlights the persistent myth of an isolated chalet surrounded by nature and claims that this idyllic image is responsible for the saturation of alpine towns. Using Verbier as an example, Pià puts forward a series of solutions to safeguard the future of this Valais resort while at the same time preserving its natural environment.\nYou began your PhD in architecture just before the Weber initiative was passed on 11 March 2012, which limited second homes to 20% of all construction. What do you think the outcome will be for the Alps? \nThe initiative made the public aware of the need to slow the urban sprawl encroaching upon the alpine landscape. But unfortunately its only solution was to criticize the economic model of having a second home. The images from the 2012 campaign highlighted the issue using ambiguous communication ploys that stigmatized dense construction and the urbanization of mountain resorts. But the campaign oversimplified matters. \"Density\" became something that was harmful to nature and created ugliness, while \"urbanization\" was responsible for the sprawl encroaching upon the landscape. Yet the problems that alpine towns currently face are actually caused by their low density, which results from the growing number of single chalets. Nobody dares to criticize this model, considered so idyllic. But it should be condemned because it is just this model that leads to urban sprawl and encourages people to use their cars. Yet Franz Weber presented it as the ideal: the poster thanking people for accepting the initiative showed Zermatt with an isolated chalet below the Matterhorn, claiming that by stopping all new construction we could return to this alpine \"authenticity\". Weber's remarkable paradox can be summed up as follows: he accepts that urban sprawl exists and condemns it, yet, at the same time, he glorifies the same urban model that caused it and absolves it of all blame.\nSo how can we escape this paradox?\nWe can't keep maintaining this false impression. The initiative’s implicit goal of keeping the status quo will not simply make the large alpine towns above 1,400 meters disappear. Instead of trying to go back to how things were, which is impossible, it would be better to focus on the serious problem of urban saturation and the climate issues that these regions face today. Unless we increase the density of these towns over the long term, they will quite simply fall into decline, and the consequences for the “unspoiled” nature nearby would be catastrophic. The initiative totally ignores this aspect, which is nevertheless essential for protecting the alpine landscape.\nYou used Verbier as a case study. What would you recommend to that resort in terms of future development? \nTo solve the traffic problems, the municipality of Bagnes plans to build two new ring roads, one of which will run through an avalanche red zone. They will further encroach upon the landscape by building more housing on the almost untouched hillsides in Bruson, which will require more new infrastructure. Yet Verbier already has numerous roads and other infrastructure. It would be better to increase the density of the resort to extend its \"lifecycle\" and avoid colonizing untouched areas.\nHow could the density be increased?\nTen percent of public building land is still available. Based on this, I developed a new urban model that brings together housing and public transport. The aim is to resolve current mobility problems caused by everyone using their cars and rationalize how the last plots of land are used. I recommend building five cable-car stations as infrastructure that could be up to 500 meters long. This would be a new type of building that contains housing, real pedestrian areas – often missing in the mountains – public facilities, and transport interfaces. The inhabited infrastructures would have a density of 1.7 compared to 0.3 for a single chalet and would take up six times less land than a chalet. This model would add 250,000 m\n2\n to the 963,000 m\n2\n of existing accommodation, without increasing the urban sprawl on the alpine landscape. An expanded cable-car network could sustainably serve the whole of Verbier without people having to use their cars. I found this form of public transport to be the most appropriate because it’s eco-friendly, relatively quiet and cheap, and it is suited to the alpine terrain while taking up very little land. And it allows people to enjoy the alpine scenery.\nSo we have to give up our dream of a mountain chalet, but how do you convince people to live in this kind of infrastructure? \nInhabited infrastructures meet two requirements that a chalet cannot: that of being able to live in the open air and be at one with nature – without destroying it. We may think that chalets are a part of nature but in fact they just swallow it up. Inhabited infrastructures occupy the land in a rational way and can therefore help us to control our footprint on the natural environment. And it will be through green mobility and respect for natural dangers that we will be able to preserve the unspoiled environment over the long term. What's more, these buildings offer a new way of living at altitude. Without leaving the infrastructure, you can go directly from the cable car to your home or to see a concert at the Verbier Festival, go skiing, go for a drink along the pedestrian area in the middle of the building. Then you can take the cable car over the landscape to go to the market in Verbier village, take a class at the international school or go back down into the valley. There's no need for a car, so you really get to breathe the alpine air.\nWhy is this project so relevant for Verbier? \nThe project is not just about Verbier as a ski resort. It looks ahead to what Verbier will become: an extension of the \"real\" town that is at one with the natural environment at altitude. The municipality of Bagnes intends to draw visitors ten months of the year by 2035. So the future of Verbier's natural environment is being decided today.\nFiona Pià, \"Developing the Swiss Alps: strategies to increase the density of high-altitude towns\", \nsupervised by Inès Lamunière, Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Mobility (LAMU).

Visitors of all ages could be seen walking around with their solar flowers. “The workshop has been full since this morning,” said one of the organizers.\nAll about energy\n This is the first time the festival, which is put together by EPFL’s Science Outreach Department (SPS), was held at one of the school’s outposts. In its first two years, the highly popular event was hosted at the school’s main campus in Ecublens, but this year it was moved to Sion – to the delight of the Valais public. Festival-goers learned about energy in all its forms through fun and informative workshops for kids, talks, presentations and lab visits. The theme was appropriate enough, as energy is one of the main research areas at EPFL’s Sion campus.\nWhat is energy? How is it stored and transformed? What is renewable energy? The interactive exhibit called “Tout se transforme” invited children and adults alike to find answers to these questions. For visitors, this was not just an intellectual exercise but a hands-on experience as well. They could try out an energy-generating bike, a plasma ball and weights attached to a pulley. Researchers were on hand as well to answer questions and explain the science behind what was going on. “Energy is a hot topic these days, and people want to know more,” said Farnaz Moser, head of the SPS. “Part of our mission is to spread knowledge about science and technology among the general public and answer their questions.”\nScientastic is also designed to arouse people’s curiosity about scientific phenomena. For an entire weekend, festival-goers could visit labs, marvel at demonstrations and speak directly with researchers – all in a light-hearted atmosphere. “What the heck is this thing?” asked an older man eyeing an X-ray diffractometer.

{"id": 1298, "text": "The CIBM was founded in 2004 on the initiative of five institutions – EPFL, the University of Lausanne (UNIL), the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). Fifteen years on, the Center is still going strong. And with a new executive director, a new logo and a new structure this year, the CIBM is ready to tackle the future\n.\nThe CIBM has advanced biomedical imaging expertise in electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and signal processing (SP). Its 45 staff members – scientists, post-docs and technical and administrative staff – operate the Center’s various research modules across five main sites: EPFL, UNIGE, Campus Biotech, the CHUV and HUG. Researchers and clinicians work closely together at these facilities. “The CIBM has a real impact on society,” says Dr. Pina Marziliano, the Center’s new executive director, “because the research we do seeks to resolve specific problems brought to us by clinicians.”\nThe CIBM is also open to sharing its expertise with outside partners. “Not only do we have the latest equipment, but we also know how to use it effectively – what equipment is required, the best way to use it, and how the resulting data should be analyzed,” adds Dr. Marziliano. “This is important added value.”\nA real boon for clinical practice\nIn just 15 years of existence, the CIBM has already made significant contributions in the field of biomedical imaging. The Center’s researchers are behind a number of advances that have made their way into everyday clinical practice. Take EEG, for example, a technique that provides highly accurate temporal and spatial information on cerebral function. “We played a central role in the recognition of this neuroimaging technique and the development of methods that have made it possible for this technique to be used routinely in clinics, such as in neonatal care and the treatment of epilepsy,” says Micah Murray, who runs the EEG unit at CHUV-UNIL. “I see this as a case where clinical needs drove applied research. We no longer focus on group or population studies – we now look at individuals, how they respond to a single trial, and the extent to which their functionality can vary.”\nThe future of biomedical imaging \nGiven the progress that has been made, are there any challenges left in the field of medical imaging? “There are issues relating to data management and ethics,” adds Murray, “as well as mechanical problems to be overcome and truly translational discoveries to be made. I also see new avenues to explore in neuroethology and the evolutionary study of physiological processes.”\nWearable technologies and the growing use of medical imaging in developing countries also stand to be improved. “The availability, wearability and affordability of EEG make it the method of choice for the large-scale screening of diseases with a major societal impact in developing countries, such as Alzheimer’s, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder,” says Christoph Michel, the head of the EEG unit at HUG-UNIGE. “We’re just getting started, but the potential is enormous – and the CIBM could make a difference.”\nAnother major challenge will be to develop prognostic and predictive imaging. Martin Walter, a medical practitioner and the head of the PET unit at HUG-UNIGE, says: “At this point, all our PET scanners show the current status of a disease, yet most of the questions that clinicians and patients ask are about the future: How is the disease progressing? What’s the best treatment for this patient? Exactly how effective will the treatment be, and will there be any side effects? Our goal is to develop prognostic and predictive imaging techniques that will help us answer these questions.”\nArtificial intelligence is also poised to play a greater role in imaging. “Artificial intelligence will do much more than just help with diagnosis,” says François Lazeyras, the head of the MRI unit at HUG-UNIGE. “It will be directly involved in MRI image acquisition and other processes, improving quality and removing imperfections – such as when a patient moves while being scanned.” Lazeyras also thinks that “imaging processes themselves will increasingly target the physiology of human tissue in general rather than focusing narrowly on lesion morphology. If they have information on cellular function, doctors will be in a better position to predict how a patient will respond to a given therapy or the chances that a transplanted organ will survive. This is a major step forward for personalized medicine.”\nNew management\nIn April 2019, Pina Marziliano became the CIBM’s executive director, taking over from Rolf Gruetter, the founding director. Dr. Marziliano studied Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Montreal before doing her PhD in Communication Systems at EPFL. She then went on to serve as an associate professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Dr. Gruetter remains in charge of the CIBM’s Animal Imaging and Technology unit.\nDr. Marziliano envisions a more visible and more accessible Center: “I want to raise the CIBM’s profile so that it becomes the leading Swiss biomedical imaging center.” In pursuit of these goals, the CIBM has a new logo and website and will seek outside partnerships more proactively.\nThe CIBM will celebrate its anniversary with a series of talks and a panel discussion on \n30 October 2019\n at the EPFL Rolex Learning Center Forum. This event is designed to thank the CIBM’s members, employees, partners and other stakeholders for their contribution to the Center’s research, teaching and service activities over the past 15 years.

{"id": 1299, "text": "A shower typically uses around 10 liters of water per minute and lasts an average of 10 minutes. That makes it a veritable luxury in places where water is scarce – and that includes some developed countries. Two Bachelor’s students at EPFL decided to address this problem by developing an open-source kit called Showerloop that lets people in arid parts of the world take a full and proper shower.\nTheir device consists of a closed-loop system where the first 10 liters of water are purified and recirculated throughout the shower, which can consequently last 10, 15, 20, 25 minutes – as long as you want. The students have been awarded a grant for their project and in September will install three Showerloop prototypes at a university campus in Colombia.\n10 liters is all you need \nThe Showerloop needs just 10 liters of water to operate, instead of the 100 liters used on average. When you take a shower with Showerloop, the necessary amount of water comes out of the showerhead, and the dirty, soapy water exits through a drain at the bottom just like in a conventional shower. But the water then goes through three different types of filters to be purified.\nThe first type is a mesh filter that blocks particles like hair and dust that could plug up the pipes. The second contains sand and activated carbon to remove pollutants. And the third uses ultraviolet light to sterilize the water and kill harmful bacteria and other pathogens. The purified water is then fed back into the showerhead, and the loop begins again. At the end of the shower, the 10 liters of water are discharged into the regular wastewater system.\nSwiss materials\nThe two EPFL Bachelor’s students behind the project – Judith Capron in civil engineering and Jean-André Davy-Guidicelli in environmental engineering – were inspired by a standard open-source eco-friendly shower kit that a Finnish engineer, Jason Selvarajan, presented at the COP 21 Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015.\nCapron and Davy-Guidicelli took Selvarajan’s model and created a version using materials available in Switzerland. They carried out their work at the Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory (SKIL), a new facility offered by the School of Architecture, Civil, and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) where students can design and build their own prototypes. Constructing their Showerloop turned out to be more challenging than expected, since neither Capron nor Davy-Guidicelli is a natural-born do-it-yourselfer. But that made them even more proud of the end result.\nNew version\nThey also wanted to make a version of the Showerloop that could be used on a larger scale than Selvarajan’s, which requires taking down an existing shower in order to be installed. Rather, they envisioned a system that would require simply adding new parts to an existing shower. So they made the necessary adjustments to Selvarajan’s model with materials they found right here at home.\nThe students calculate that a Showerloop would pay for itself quickly thanks to cost savings on both electricity (since water would not have to be heated continuously) and water (since consumption would be slashed by 90%). According to their initial rough estimates, installing a Showerloop would cost 1,000 francs and have a payback period of around 11 months, depending on the price of electricity. The system’s filters last 1 to 2 years and cost around 40 francs to replace.\nThree prototypes in Colombia\nCapron and Davy-Guidicelli have just been awarded a Development Impact Grant created by the Coopertion and Devlopment Center (CODEV) from EPFL to further their research. These grants fund projects that contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. And the Showerloop fits that bill – it targets major water consumers like public institutions and hotel chains and could represent an important step towards Goal 6, “Ensure access to water and sanitation for all.”\nThe students will use the grant money to develop, test, and install three Showerloop prototypes in the sports centers’ locker rooms of Universidad del Valle in Colombia when the school year starts this September. They chose Universidad del Valle because it’s located in a water-poor part of the country, and because their project fits in with a sustainable development program at the university, which is eager to test this kind of shower on its campus.\nA journal publication \nTo carry out the tests in Colombia, Davy-Guidicelli will team up with Marisa Boller, also a Bachelor’s student in environmental engineering at EPFL, rather than with Capron. That’s because Boller and Davy-Guidicelli will already be spending the 2018–2019 school year in the country for their required internship year, where they will work on a water treatment system for a cassava processing plant. In parallel, they will develop a version of the Showerloop suited to the materials available in Colombia and to other local constraints, and perform a complete life-cycle analysis of their device.\nTheir goal will be to make the Showerloop as attractive as possible from an environmental and financial perspective, and to publish an article illustrating its cost benefits in order to attract interest from businesses and organizations. Selvarajan, the engineer behind the very first Showerloop, fully supports the students and will be following their progress closely.\nBut the student’s plans for the Showerloop don’t stop there. Once back in Lausanne in September 2019, they intend to draw on the lessons learned in Colombia to roll out their system across the EPFL campus as part of their Master’s studies.\n (Copyright: © Jamani Caillet / EPFL 2018)", "summary": "Summer series.

Making matters worse, women are frequently assaulted when they have no other choice but to relieve themselves in the open. These observations spurred Marc-Edouard Schultheiss and Alexandre Bouchet, two students in the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), to head to India for a three-month humanitarian project supported by Engineers of the World, a student association at EPFL.\nOnce there, they focused on teaching villagers – especially women – how to build a shower and toilet connected to a pit. But the two students quickly ran into illiteracy problems and the language barrier: it simply wasn’t possible to provide instructional videos in 18 different dialects. “And since the women never went to school,” said Marc-Edouard, “understanding a diagram and using numbers – even for measuring things out with a meter stick – was a challenge for them.”\nTo resolve this dilemma and enable the women to pass along their skills far into the future, they came up with a surprising idea: that of using LEGO blocks to create a model. The kit comes complete with bamboo sticks and strings with colored markers to use as a measuring instrument. “We also prepared an animated drawing to remind them of the key steps in the building process,” said Alexandre.\nThis fun and innovative project has been undergoing testing since the summer by other volunteers on the ground. But it has already caused a buzz among humanitarian organizations, and Marc-Edouard and Alexandre were invited to present their idea in early July at a conference organized by the United Nations Academic Impact in New York. “We were able to go to New York thanks to the support of our School, and Silvia Hostettler of EPFL’s Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV) described our work in front of 500 people,” said the two students. They hope their contribution will help improve the living conditions of women in India in the years to come.\nTheir project will be presented at EPFL at a conference planned for the week of 12 October.\nThis project was made possible by the support of EPFL, the , Ammachi Labs, Amrita University, and the association Engineers of the World.", "summary": "Two EPFL students have developed a model to teach women how to build toilets in India.

But EPFL now counts three listed startups that were founded to market technology developed at the School,” says Hervé Lebret, head of EPFL’s startup unit. “These exits are the icing on the cake, since EPFL startups usually end up being acquired by other companies, as we saw with Faceshift, Lemoptix and most recently Darix.” Since being founded in the UK in 2009, Bicycle has raised nearly $116 million.\nBicycle Therapeutics develops cancer drugs that are made from chains of amino acids, called peptides, which form in two loops – hence the company’s name – in order to stabilize their geometry. They are unique in that they can bind to just about any biological structure, including proteins, and change their function. And because they can act on diseased cells while leaving healthy cells intact, they can attach to the protein of a tumor cell, for example, and prevent it from growing without affecting the neighboring tissue. Bicycle’s drugs have a vast range of possible therapeutic applications: cancer; respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; psychiatric disorders; and hemophilia. The company is based in Cambridge, UK, and leverages technology licensed from EPFL.\nChristian Heinis, today an EPFL professor, came up with the idea while performing post-doc research at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge . He developed a molecular structure that enables proteins to form bonds similar to those of antibodies, but much smaller, so that they can be diffused through tissue efficiently and produced by chemical synthesis. Heinis also worked with Sir Gregory Winter, a retired University of Cambridge researcher who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, to develop a method for isolating bicyclical peptides that can bind effectively to a clinically important range of target cells.

The work of Majid Jaidi and Hugo Lakshmanan has highlighted the impact of this activity on urban, economic, human, environmental and architectural development resulting from the rise of the Alang port on the west coast of India.\n“As we haven’t been able to go there, we’ve gathered hundreds of pages from numerous theses, and from information based on the reports of NGOs on the ground, we extracted a huge amount of data,” said Majid Jaidi. While on the trail of steel, he uncovered the mechanisms of this spontaneous city that has been built along the sea due to the 14.4 km long dismantling site.\nMetal is the anchor of this research. Many questions and multiple avenues of exploration all revolve around it. What is the origin of the 270 ships that are cut up each year? How is the recovery, processing and redistribution of the steel organized? What are the causes and conditions of employment for those 25,000 to 50,000 required personnel, depending on the season, who are responsible for the proper functioning of this industry? A number of points analyzed by civil engineers provide the first answers.\nThe Alang shipyard, built 30 years ago, has had a significant impact on neighboring villages. They have rapidly prospered, and their people were the first to invest in ship-breaking. Steel is a developing economy for India. It constitutes up to 90% of the vessels, and the rest of the pieces – down to the door hinges – are also recycled in local markets. The steel is used as is or can be fused to produce structural components.\nAll the removed metal heads for the domestic market. Alang shipyard alone provides 4% of India’s steel. However, the environment pays a heavy price for this rapid and chaotic development. Ships are full of heavy metals, asbestos or organic waste that are handled incorrectly and pass, for the most part, directly into the sea.\nToday, Alang is the fastest growing city in India. Its residents also benefit from the migration of tens of thousands of workers. This workforce, which sometimes\nEven without having gone to the other side of the world to carry out this project, Majid Jaidi retains a strong impression of the collected data and his analysis of it: “I could see that this industry is 100% dependent on humans, and yet they aren’t treated well. That really affected me.”\nThe three ENAC laboratories will continue their collaboration and their investigation by asking this time for architecture students to focus on recycling and reusing marine containers in construction. All over the world, tens of thousands of them have been simply abandoned. The Freitag Flagship Store in Zurich shows what can be done with containers and a little bit of imagination.

{"id": 1316, "text": "A 30-strong group of EPFL students came up with an impressive array of inventive ideas during the pilot , with the goal of making our campus – and society – greener and cleaner. Their ideas included an “Eco-Score” to rate the environmental impact of meals served at EPFL restaurants, a new digital currency and platform called Karma for exchanging goods and services within the EPFL community, and a web browser add-on called Web Citizens to combat misinformation and encourage critical thinking.\nThe event was organized by a team of around a dozen students along with representatives from EPFL’s Vice Presidency for Academic Affairs, Vice Presidency for Innovation, Vice Presidency for Responsible Transformation, ENAC and College of Humanities. During the five-day event, students from different disciplines worked in groups to develop systems in line with the circular economy. Because today, our economies are anything but circular – supply chains are pretty straight and then hit a dead end. Raw materials are extracted from the Earth and processed into a consumer good, which is packaged, shipped, used up and thrown away. In some cases a handful of materials are recycled, but most of the used products end up in a landfill. And since around 45% of global CO\n2\n emissions come from producing everyday consumer products (according to a ), we can do a lot to save our planet by extending products’ lifetimes and recycling them to a greater extent.\nChallenging the problems \nThe student groups were called on to think creatively about sustainable, actionable solutions that have a positive impact on the climate, the environment and our society. “We want our event to foster collaboration and cross-disciplinary thinking, which is why we didn’t make it a competition,” says Michka Mélo, CSAW coordinator. “The goal was to encourage cross-fertilization among different projects, leverage synergies with existing technology and encourage participants to form networks whether in academia, the non-profit sector or the companies. This pilot version went very well and we’re really pleased – most participants were actively involved right up to the end.” He adds: “We weren’t sure how it would go since it was held just before the start of the semester, included a weekend and was entirely online. It was hard to find the right format so that participants could interact smoothly and effectively.”\nThe groups consisted of two to five Bachelor’s and Master’s students from different EPFL sections. Participants first had to learn the fundamental concepts of sustainability and the circular economy, before then thinking about how they could best put their architectural and engineering skills to work. “We wanted students to focus more on the problems that need to be addressed than the solutions to develop,” says Eric Domon, a project officer at EPFL Sustainability and one of the CSAW organizers. “So we allocated a substantial amount of time to helping them understand the problems through a systemic approach.” Mélo adds: “The idea was to prompt students to challenge the problems put in front of them and how those problems are formulated.”\nThe event included talks from EPFL professors and outside speakers who discussed concrete projects they have worked on related to the circular economy. By the end of the event, the student groups had created seven “pretotypes” of their inventions.\nProjects to be explored further \nOne such invention was Plast’Impact – a machine that can be installed at food shops for customers to scan products and find out how much microplastic they contain. The data would be displayed through an application, helping to draw consumers’ attention to the prevalence of these plastics. “In an ideal world, the government would pass a law requiring food producers to list the microplastics contained in each of their products. But for now our system can be designed to use averages,” says a member of the Plast’Impact team. The machine would work in tandem with a reward system for customers who purchase the least microplastic. An awareness-raising approach similar to the Eco-Score idea, which is based on calculating carbon footprints but also factors in the conditions under which meal ingredients were produced.\nSeveral of the students’ projects related to reducing waste and encouraging the reuse of old objects through sharing. One group had the idea of creating an object library for the Vortex dormitory, which would be run by the . Another group imagined an app that lets users swap clothes they don’t wear anymore and coordinate community events, such as for giving new life to old outfits. And a third was behind the Karma platform, which “could one day become a feature included in the EPFL Campus app.”\nBuilding awareness about the circular economy was the goal of one group, which designed a board game called Circle It. The game is intended to familiarize all age groups with the concept of the circular economy in a fun, educational manner. In a similar vein, the Web Citizens add-on aims to make internet users aware of misinformation and train them to think critically about what they read, such as by looking at the comments at the bottom of an article, checking several different news sources and seeking out diverse viewpoints. Digital citizens could contribute to the initiative as volunteers.\n“All the student groups thought about how their ideas could be taken further once the week was over, through either a semester or Master’s project or . We’ll have to wait and see how that goes,” says Mélo. “We also plan to debrief participants on this pilot version and get their feedback on the format, the cross-functional skills they acquired over the five days and what we can do to improve at the next CSAW, in September, which we hope to be able to carry out in person.”", "summary": "Around 30 students took part in the pilot version of EPFL’s Climate and Sustainability Action Week, working in cross-disciplinary groups to outline circular economy solutions.

The students will take to the stage for a special concert to mark the opening of the new pavilion on 4 June. \nAs good as new\n “The Lausanne city council has launched its Lausanne-réutilise recycling website, and the Swiss government is working on a new directory of construction material recycling firms – so this project is very much in keeping with a much wider movement,” says Martin Fröhlich, an associate professor from Berlin who, along with Anja Fröhlich, co-directs EPFL’s Laboratory of Elementary Architecture and Studies of Types (EAST). “By using recycled materials, the students have built a structure that’s as good as new without the waste. What’s more, the pavilion is easy to dismantle, meaning the components can be used again and again.” \n The students chose wood as their construction material for sustainability reasons, used hand tools instead of power tools wherever possible, and sourced naturally made wood stain from a small-scale supplier in Finland. \nTwo locations\n Servion Zoo is home to over 200 animals of 60 different species.

Considering the unprecedented scale and complexity of the data, The Time Machine’s AI even has the potential to create a strong competitive advantage for Europe in the global AI race.\n“Time Machine is likely to become one of the most advanced Artificial Intelligence systems ever built, trained on data from wider geographical and temporal horizons”, explains Frederic Kaplan, Professor of Digital Humanities at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Coordinator of the Time Machine Project.\nCultural Heritage as a valuable economic asset\nCultural Heritage is one of our most precious assets, and the Time Machine’s ten-year research and innovation program will strive to show that rather than being a cost, cultural heritage investment will actually be an important economic driver across industries. This constant source of new knowledge will be an economic motor, giving rise to new professions, services and products in areas such as education, creative industries, policy making, smart tourism, smart cities and environmental modelling. For example, services for comparing territorial configurations across space and time will become an essential tool in developing modern land use policy or city planning. Likewise, the tourism industry will be transformed by professionals capable of creating and managing newly possible experiences at the intersection of the digital and physical world. These industries will have a pan-European platform for knowledge exchange which will add a new dimension to their strategic planning and innovation capabilities.\nA new age for Social Sciences and Humanities\nTime Machine will mark a new age for Social Sciences and Humanities, as it will offer open access to Europe’s past via unified data and new AI services. This will give “super powers” to researchers by revolutionising the individual researcher’s search capabilities, drastically raising the overall scale and scope of social sciences and humanities research. The resulting knowledge will enable the field to effectively contribute to the development of strategic answers to major pan-European challenges such as sustainable growth, social welfare, migration and integration of migrants, and the safeguarding of European democracy.\nTransforming education\nEducation is a crucial factor for the social and economic well-being in Europe and the world, and Time Machine will help transform it by creating a dynamic new industry for the production of educative digital material based on aligned massive datasets. The resulting online courses, materials, simulations and other experiences will promote active engagement with our combined cultural heritage and make continuous learning more accessible and inclusive.\nA unique alliance and a network of cities\nTime Machine promotes a unique alliance of leading European academic and research organisations, Cultural Heritage institutions and private enterprises that are fully aware of the huge potential of digitisation and the very promising new paths for science, technology and innovation that can be opened through the information system that will be developed, based on the Big Data of the Past. In addition to the 33 core institutions that will be funded by the European Commission, more than 200 organisations from 33 countries are participating to the initiatives, including seven national libraries (Austria, Belgium, France, Israel, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland), 19 state archives (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary,Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland), famous museums (Louvre, Rijkmuseum), 95 academic and research institutions, 30 European companies and 18 governmental bodies.\nTime Machine is also a growing network of cities. The project is based on a “franchise” operation model grouping scholars, cultural heritage organisations, government bodies and large groups of volunteers around specific integrated projects focusing on cities. The engagement of a large number of volunteers, often local citizens, in these Local Time Machine initiatives is another key element to ensure their long-term sustainability of the project. Local Time Machines are currently being developed in Venice, Amsterdam, Paris, Jerusalem, Budapest, Regensburg, Nuremberg, Dresden, Antwerp, Ghent, Bruges, Naples, Utrecht, Limburg and more. In the next 12 months, Time Machine is expected to grow as a large community of communities, sharing a standardised platform, with more empowering tools.\nBackground\nIn early 2016, the European Commission held a \n of the research community to gather ideas on science and technology challenges that could be addressed through future FET Flagships. End of 2016, Commissioner Oettinger hosted a \n event with high-level representatives from the Member States, industry and academia. They agreed on three major areas where promising grand science and technology challenges could be addressed by the FET Flagships: \n\"ICT and connected society\", \"Health and the life sciences\" \nand\n \"Energy, environment and climate change\"\n. As a result, a \n for future research initiatives was launched in October 2017 as part of the . From the 33 proposals submitted, six were selected after a two-stage evaluation by independent high-level experts.\nThe 33 institutions receiving parts of the €1 million to develop Time Machine:\nECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE\nTECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET WIEN\nINTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR ARCHIVAL RESEARCH\nKONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE AKADEMIE VAN WETENSCHAPPEN\nNAVER FRANCE\nUNIVERSITEIT UTRECHT\nFRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITAET ERLANGEN NUERNBERG\nECOLE NATIONALE DES CHARTES\nALMA MATER STUDIORUM - UNIVERSITÀ DI BOLOGNA\nINSTITUT NATIONAL DE L'INFORMATION GEOGRAPHIQUE ET FORESTIERE\nUNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM\nUNIWERSYTET WARSZAWSKI\nUNIVERSITE DU LUXEMBOURG\nBAR-ILAN UNIVERSITY\nUNIVERSITA CA' FOSCARI VENEZIA\nUNIVERSITEIT ANTWERPEN\nQIDENUS GROUP GMBH\nTECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT\nCENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE\nSTICHTING NEDERLANDS INSTITUUT VOOR BEELD EN GELUID\nFIZ KARLSRUHE- LEIBNIZ-INSTITUT FUR INFORMATIONS INFRASTRUKTUR GMBH\nFRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.\nUNIVERSITEIT GENT\nTECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET DRESDEN\nTECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT DORTMUND\nOESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBIBLIOTHEK\nICONEM\nINSTYTUT CHEMII BIOORGANICZNEJ POLSKIEJ AKADEMII NAUK\nPICTURAE BV\nCENTRE DE VISIÓ PER COMPUTADOR\nEUROPEANA FOUNDATION\nINDRA\nUBISOFT", "summary": "The European Commission has chosen Time Machine as one of the six proposals retained for preparing large scale research initiatives to be strategically developed in the next decade. €1 million in funding has been granted for preparing the detailed roadmaps of this initiative that aims at extracting and utilising the Big Data of the past.", "claim": "The European Commission has chosen Time Machine as one of the six proposals retained for preparing large scale research initiatives to be strategically developed in early 2016. €1 million in funding has been granted for preparing the detailed roadmaps of this initiative that aims at extracting and utilising the Big Data of the past.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [25, 26], "noise": false}
{"id": 1322, "text": "Biological processes occurring in our bodies are far from static, but instead the rhythm of most of them is dictated by an internal, 24-hour biological metronome called the ‘circadian clock’. During each day-night cycle, many physiological processes follow oscillatory waves orchestrated by this clock, allowing them to adapt and anticipate the body’s demands at a given time of day. EPFL scientists have now used cutting-edge proteomics to monitor the temporal accumulation of over 5,000 different proteins in the nucleus of mouse liver cells, and have identified over 500 that are connected to the 24-hours cycle. The study, , is the first in this field in terms of scale and resolution, and has significant implications regarding our understanding of the interconnections between rhythmic metabolism and nutrition.\nBiology is affected by time\nOur bodies follow the day-night, or “diurnal”, cycle, by finely tuning metabolic processes to time of day — this is why we can sleep for hours without going hungry through the night but can barely stand eight hours after breakfast, or why jet lag can sometimes cause digestive problems. Such oscillations are the focus of “chronobiology” a research field that looks at how biological functions are organized in time and how disease could arise when this time organization is disturbed.\nThis regulation of metabolism is connected to how our genes produce proteins. Many genes follow our circadian clock by adjusting the rate at which they produce proteins, and knowing which genes do this would help us understand how metabolism changes over the course of a day. Unfortunately, even though the human genome was mapped out more than a decade ago, investigating how genes control the production of proteins on a time-dependent scale is still difficult, mostly because of the sheer number of proteins present in a cell.\n500 liver proteins affected by the day-night cycle\n and , have now made a breakthrough in our understanding of time-dependent metabolism. Working only the nuclei of liver cells, the scientists identified 5000 proteins of which more than 500 were affected during the diurnal cycle; more specifically, the proteins entered and left the nucleus over the course of the day. In addition, they found that key cellular functions such as DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle and chromosome regulation (polyploidy) were also affected by diurnal regulation.\nTo counteract the huge complexity of the proteome, the researchers only focused on the cell’s nucleus instead of the entire cell. The nucleus is where genes produce proteins that are then sent to various locations around the cell. As such, the nucleus is very sensitive to environmental and biochemical signals, and can translate these into molecular responses by controlling protein production.\nThe scientists used biochemical techniques to isolate the nuclei from liver cells taken from mice with and without a functioning circadian clock. Having isolated the nuclei, they extracted all the proteins from them and analyzed them with mass spectrometry.\nCutting-edge proteomics\nLike genomics for genes, proteomics is the field of digital biology where computers are used to create detailed databases and maps of the complete set of an organism’s proteins. The scientists used a technique called SILAC coupled with high-resolution proteomics, which can efficiently quantify proteins — in this case, the proteins are quantified in the nucleus at different time-points throughout a 24-hour cycle. By doing this, they were able to get a global picture of how the diurnal cycle affects protein accumulation in the liver-cell nucleus.\n“While many studies approach physiological functions statically, our temporal approach gave us unprecedented insights into how metabolism cycles over a day,” says Felix Naef. “We were surprised by how pervasively nuclear functions in liver are influenced by the day and night and feeding cycles.”\n“The study also shows that this quantitative proteomics approach is an excellent tool for systematic analysis of cell functions,” says Frédéric Gachon. “This would not be feasible with conventional proteomic techniques.”\nThis work involves a collaboration between EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering and the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, with contributions from the University of Lausanne, and the Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier. It was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, EPFL, the European Research Council (ERC), and the Leenaards Foundation.\nReference\nJingkui Wang, Daniel Mauvoisin, Eva Martin, Florian Atger, Antonio Núñes Galindo, Loïc Dayon, Federico Sizzano, Alessio Palini, Martin Kussmann, Patrice Waridel, Manfredo Quadroni, Vjekoslav Dulić, Felix Naef, and Frédéric Gachon. \nNuclear proteomics uncovers diurnal regulatory landscapes in mouse liver.\nCell Metabolism\n 03 November 2016.

A wall of ice seven meters high will go up on Place Cosandey. Supervised by two professionals, amateur rock climbers, along with the more practiced, are invited to attempt the climb. A rink open late into the night sets the stage for a disco on ice! A competition between various groups with ice games or jass will culminate in the coronation of Miss and Mister Polynice. Additionally, Polynice is an occasion for associations to meet one another: Forum EPFL, PolyBeach, RoboPoly, as well as others, will step up for the occasion. Mulled wine, raclette, hot dogs, hamburgers, waffles and crepes make it possible for everbody to warm up before taking to the ice. …And all to the tune of music.\n Thursday: evening heat guaranteed! For its birthday party, l’AGEPoly invited an international DJ who will set the dancefloor on fire at Place Cosandrey. This party is a way to remember that since 1952, l’AGEPoly has been engaged above all with representing EPFL students, informing them and defending their interests. The association works closely with the direction of EPFL. Its role is to facilitate student life on campus and to create events that permit not only exchanges and encounters like Polynice or Polynite, but also the orientation week for new arrivals, who are rapidly required to become immersed in the academic world, find their bearings, and develop a network.\n The work of l’AGEPoly reaches into three arenas:\n - \nStudent Services\n of all kinds: MyJob, an employment platform, a book exchange, scheduled blood donations, and special rebates for telephone, cinema, and insurance.\n - \nCampus activities\n, with the help of Activities & Sports, who organize a myriad of events throughout the year, such as the Welcome Back Ball, Integration Week, and Vivapoly.\n - \nStudent Representation\n, for which l’AGEPoly nominates students in diverse university committees, forms work-groups for various subjects, and relies on a group of students who meet weekly to take positions on various subjects and debate current topics.\n Not to be overlooked are the eighteen associations integral to l’AGEPoly which propose activities for all students, for example the game of Go, tango dancing, cinema club, or the sailing club.

{"id": 1328, "text": "The school is participating in the international quest for the controlled fusion of hydrogen, a virtually inexhaustible source of energy. On the 15th and 16th September, Swiss, European and American scientists submit more than 80 projects that propose sharing the use of EPFL’s Tokamak. This imposing confinement chamber enables the heating of hydrogen to more than 170 million degrees, at which temperature the gas can potentially fusion. The international teams are preparing in particular to use the  experimental fusion reactor.\nAbout thirty Tokamaks are in use in Europe, Asia and North America. The principle is broadly the same for all of them. Confined in a round chamber, in the form of a donut, a cloud of hydrogen is maintained in suspension by an intense magnetic field. The procedure allows the heating of the gas to extreme temperatures. Like at the heart of the sun, isotopes can fusion into helium, a reaction that produces an enormous quantity of energy.\nModeling a hydrogen cloud\n Plasma physics is a well-organized world of its own. Each Tokamak has its own particularities in terms of power, flexibility of use or heating system. Because of this, physicists regularly exchange usage slots, to test their models in different conditions.\nEPFL’s Tokamak has some interesting features. In particular, it’s by far the most flexible one in the world, in terms of how it creates the shape of hydrogen plasma – hence its full name, Variable Configuration Tokamak (TCV). This is a crucial factor in terms of performance.\nH mode: to prepare ITER\n Among the projects submitted to EPFL by the international teams, many of them concern “H mode”. This is sort of recipe for obtaining the ideal plasma that will be mainly used in ITER. Temperature, density, heating system and the shaping of the plasma are all elements that need to be minutely measured to achieve this result.\n“Mode H is a little like insulating a house,” explains Yves Martin, assistant director at the Plasma Physics Laboratory at EPFL. “If you add a layer of insulation, you need less power to maintain a high temperature. But you also need kinds of valves through which the resulting helium can be evacuated, so that it doesn’t stifle the reaction.”\nThe challenge is a highly complex one. The TCV uses a microwave heating system, which is calibrated to transfer its energy to the electrons. By targeting small zones to be heated, the physicists influence the circulation of the electric current inside the plasma, which subsequently impacts the stability and requires adjustments to the magnetic field. “All the parameters are linked, and must be recalculated in real time, which requires a large computing infrastructure,” adds Yves Martin. “That’s the price we have to pay for improving performance.”\nOther more experimental modes, like the IC mode (improved confinement mode) will be tested on the TCV. With approximately 1500 discharges of two seconds per year, EPFL’s Tokamak is designed to provide European and American teams with the possibility to test their models and prepare the era of ITER which, in 2019, will need to maintain plasmas for more than 400 seconds at a stretch.", "summary": "This week, physicists from 15 American and European universities are sharing EPFL’s Tokamak to develop the future of hydrogen fusion.", "claim": "two seconds per year, physicists from 15 American and European universities are sharing EPFL’s Tokamak to develop the future of hydrogen fusion.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 3], "noise": false}
{"id": 1330, "text": "In 2014, two researchers produced a detailed map showing the  in Geneva. The map, which revealed parts of the city with a high body mass index (BMI), was compiled by Prof. Idris Guessous, head physician, Department of Primary Care and Emergency Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and associate professor, Department of Community Health and Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva (UNIGE), and by Dr. Stéphane Joost, senior scientist, Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG), EPFL.\nA new study by Prof. Guessous and Dr. Joost, using similar analytical methods and an even larger sample size, demonstrates a significant spatial overlap between weight problems and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The findings reveal that 43% of people residing in neighborhoods with a higher-than-average BMI also live in areas where excess SSB consumption is an issue.\nThe causes of obesity are many and complex, but in recent years a number of international studies have pointed to sugary drinks as one of the culprits behind the growing prevalence of the condition. This body of research has nevertheless sparked intense global debate. The paper published today strengthens the link between SSB consumption and body weight at the local level.\nOver 15,000 participants\nThe paper’s authors analyzed data on 15,767 residents of Geneva Canton between the ages of 20 and 74. The dataset, spanning 1995 to 2014, was compiled as part of the  study by HUG’s Population Epidemiology Unit (UEP), led on behalf of the Geneva State General Directorate of Health t. Each year, 500 men and 500 women – a representative sample of the canton’s population – attended an appointment at the UEP, where they completed a health, exercise and diet survey, had their height and weight measured, and underwent a blood test.\nPrecision spatial analysis\nMost spatial epidemiology studies involve predefined geographical units or zones, such as towns or neighborhoods. In this case, the researchers adopted a different approach, choosing instead to map participants solely by the precise coordinates of their place of residence. They then measured the distance between places of residence and looked for similar patterns of behavior between participants, to produce the maps shown below.\nUsing this precision analysis method, the researchers found that differences in BMI among Geneva’s residents are not randomly distributed. As the maps below reveal, there are areas of the city where BMI is above the canton-wide average of 25. The researchers then used the same method to map SSB consumption. When they compared the two maps, they observed a significant overlap between areas of above-average BMI and excess SSB consumption.\nMore targeted prevention campaigns\nThe study also underscores the importance of targeted public health programs, as recommended by the . For instance, focusing efforts on areas where BMI and SSB consumption are high and tailoring interventions and prevention campaigns to the target audience could potentially deliver better outcomes.\nWhat are sugar-sweetened beverages?\n Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are drinks with added sugar, including soft drinks, flavored juice drinks, sweetened tea and coffee, energy drinks and electrolyte replacement drinks. While SSBs have different sugar contents, some – especially soft drinks – can contain as much as 39 grams per 330 milliliters. SSB consumption has increased steadily in Switzerland and Europe in the past 20 years. The average Swiss person drinks 80 liters a year, below the European average of around 95 liters.\n In addition to contributing to weight gain, SSBs contain high levels of fructose, a substance that can provoke potentially harmful metabolic responses. Excessive fructose intake is associated with increased visceral fat, lipid metabolism disorders and reduced insulin sensitivity.  (see ref. 10 to 16) have also found that even moderate SSB consumption could increase the risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.", "summary": "In a groundbreaking study published today, scientists used precision geospatial analysis techniques to show that obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are more prevalent in some parts of Geneva than others. The study, a collaboration between HUG, EPFL, UNIGE and CHUV, is the first of its kind to establish a link between place of residence, SSB consumption and high body mass index (BMI).", "claim": "In a groundbreaking study published between the ages of 20 and 74, scientists used precision geospatial analysis techniques to show that obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are more prevalent in some parts of Geneva than others. The study, a collaboration between HUG, EPFL, UNIGE and CHUV, is the first of its kind to establish a link between place of residence, SSB consumption and high body mass index (BMI).", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 11], "noise": false}

In partnership with the Bühler Group and the Junior Enterprises of EPFL and ETH Zurich, you’re invited to come up with ideas for limiting the losses and waste that occur between the field and consumers. \n A third of the world’s food supply never makes its way into human stomachs. Losses and waste occur all along the production chain, from farms to households. If this situation persists, arable land will not be able to support the 8 billion humans that will populate the Earth by the year 2025.\nThe family-run Bühler Group, a major supplier of food processing solutions, soon to be present in EPFL’s Innovation Park, would like to innovate and re-think the food value chain to solve this pressing problem. At the end of the online Fusebox challenge, the best “ideators” will be invited to company headquarters in Uzwil to participate in a workshop that has a CHF 10,000 prize at stake. Fusebox has given itself a facelift for the occasion, with a more engaging interface. This challenge will be an opportunity to bring EPFL and ETH Zurich together, and because of this the contest will be run in English.\nFrom farm to plate the food chain is long and fraught with difficulties. Conditioning, storage, transport, processing of agricultural commodities into food products, management of the flow between suppliers and consumers via retailers – these are some of the stages on a journey in which innovation is necessary in order to reduce loss. How can storage be improved? Will new information technologies allow us to manage stocks better? How can we re-value losses? How can we reduce the amount of transport needed or encourage more local production and consumption?\nFive times the surface of India\n Losses all along the value chain lead to the disappearance of a third of all the food that is produced agriculturally in the world. According to estimates done by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the amount of arable land needed to produce this food would be five times the size of India.

{"id": 1335, "text": "After more than two years of intense preparation, the Swiss team can be proud of the performance of its students. All in all, over 250 students contributed in the design and construction of their solar house called , big winner of the international sustainable housing competition . The 44 solar decathletes surpassed themselves on the competition site in Denver to build and show visitors around their house. «During the construction phase, I was impressed by the team’s determination. It was really hard, we were wet, tired, and cold, but everyone was driven by the project, because deep down, we believed in it.», says Florian Meyer, telecommunications student. The house travelled over 10'000 kilometers through the ocean, rail and road; a perilous route made even more difficult by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Architecture students, Axelle Marchon and Sarah Sauthier, say: «At the beginning we were scared because of the missing container. During the construction phase, we were in survival mode. And finally, regarding the community house concept, we thought we could either make it or completely break it! We started believing in it when the first results were announced. At that moment, the house was up and running, and we said to ourselves that we are really participating in the competition!»\nA risky bet that paid off\nThe NeighborHub, a solar community house, convinced the jury, and was awarded eight contests out of ten - six of them in the first place! One interesting conclusion about the competition is the fact that the juries either loved our unusual concept and granted us awards for it or considered it off-topic and penalized it. As a reminder, the Swiss team made the audacious bet of coming up with a different concept, proposing a house at the service of a community, rather than a family home. Most members of the jury appreciated the boldness of the concept, by granting the first place on the following contests: architecture, water management, health and comfort, home life, energy, and engineering, that is to say, six contests out of ten! The team was awarded the second place in appliances, and the third place in communications.\nThe bet is won, and the Swiss team wins the competition with a solid lead of 50 points. «Such a big gap is rare!», says Linda Silverman, Solar Decathlon 2017 director.\nTeam cohesion, the greatest triumph\nA natural explanation of this great success, would be the synergy and convergence of people from different backgrounds towards a shared goal: architects, engineers, as well as communicators and economists. Joëlle Baehr-Bruyère, civil engineering student says: «Everybody was curious about one another’s disciplines. There was a strong intellectual energy! This dynamic, this emulation, was extremely rewarding».\nThey all looked for and found a common language. That was the greatest challenge during these three years of co-creation : «It took time to put in place a common language, but once we made it, everything started flowing, even though there was over 40 of us working together!», says Marin Thaller, architecture student. «Everybody struggled to make themselves heard and to have a chance to bring what mattered to them in the project. So yes, we all had to make concessions, but now we are all very proud, because the project is consistent, everything is well integrated, and everything’s been pushed to the limit», adds Alexandre Rychner, architecture student.\nValues put to the test\nThis adventure could not have been possible without the expertise provided by the four partner schools (EPFL, HEIA-FR, HEAD and UNIFR), the unfailing support from 48 partners with their expertise and know-how. Students were well aware of their chance to have such generous partners. Marin Thaller, architecture student, explains: «We made powerful connections with our partners, and that may lead to employment.»\nThe strength of the Swiss team consists in its multidisciplinary cohesion; everybody went along with it, regardless of their background. Joëlle Baehr-Bruyère, civil engineering students says: «We worked together, and we succeeded together. We helped and carried each other.» The Swiss team applied the NeighborHub values all the way through by making the sharing element the key of their success.\nThis project also provided the students with a unique, unforgettable, and inspirational learning opportunity. Xavier Tendon, environmental sciences and engineering student, is full of enthusiasm when it comes to speaking about the practical skills acquired: «I have learned to build a solar thermal system from A to Z. I’ll install one at home later, that’s for sure!»\nThe  will be long remembered as a pioneering project providing a unique learning and sharing framework for its students, a real school of life.

{"id": 1336, "text": "“Fill it up with hydrogen, please!”\nIn just a few years, this request won’t be a fictional one. The clean vehicles we occasionally see on the roads will increasingly become the norm.\nWhether they are electric with lithium batteries or a fuel cell, or burn hydrogen instead of petroleum, these vehicles will still need, like today’s cars, to be regularly refueled. “Electric cars still need lengthy periods of time to recharge – several hours on the 230-volt grid”, says Hubert Girault, director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Physical and Analytical Electrochemistry.\nOne of the avenues being explored in his lab is found at the pilot facility in Martigny (Valais). It is a device that stores electricity in a mega-flow battery and then releases it as direct current. The mega-flow battery acts as a buffer between the electricity being produced (e.g. by wind) and its rapid transfer to a vehicle, which could be charged up in a short time. “These mega-batteries are capable of delivering 500 volts at 300 amperes, like Tesla’s Supercharger stations,” explains the professor.\nThe pilot facility in Martigny is based on a vanadium redox-flow battery. Unlike traditional lead or lithium batteries, in which the charge accumulates in electrodes, in this battery the charge accumulates in liquid electrolytes. The power is proportional to the electrodes’ surface area and the accumulated energy is proportional to the reservoir volume. The technology is intrinsically extremely safe, with no risk of explosion.\nThese mega-flow batteries, some of which can produce hundreds of megawatts, do have one drawback: what do you do when the battery is full, but the wind-turbine providing the electricity is still running?\nEPFL has an answer: you store it as hydrogen. This energy-rich gas can be burned in a combustion engine or used in a fuel cell to produce electricity. In this pilot facility their device combines the two stages of the process, foreshadowing the fuel stations of the future that will be able to provide both direct current and hydrogen.\nEPFL deliberately chose to build the mega-flow battery in Martigny’s water treatment station, in partnership with the District of Martingy, CREM (Centre de recherches énergétiques et municipales) and the public works (Sinergy). In addition to sourcing energy off a wind-energy project in the region, the facility will also use the hydrogen it produces to completely turn the biogas generated when treating waste water into methane. Biogas is a mixture of methane and CO\n2\n produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic matter; once it is \"methanized,\" it can be used to fuel vehicles that run on natural gas.\n“In the longm we believe that this site will be very advantageous as a platform for testing a variety of technologies that will be necessary in the transition towards renewable sources of energy,” says Girault.\nPresentation video (in French)", "summary": "The pilot hydrogen storage and production facility that EPFL has built in Martigny (VS) had a public open house yesterday.

{"id": 1337, "text": "EPFL scientists have managed to get rats walking on their own again using a combination of electrical and chemical stimulation. But applying this method to humans would require multifunctional implants that could be installed for long periods of time on the spinal cord without causing any tissue damage. This is precisely what the teams of professors Stéphanie Lacour and Grégoire Courtine have developed. Their e-Dura implant is designed specifically for implantation on the surface of the brain or spinal cord. The small device closely imitates the mechanical properties of living tissue, and can simultaneously deliver electric impulses and pharmacological substances. The risks of rejection and/or damage to the spinal cord have been drastically reduced. An article about the implant will appear in early January in Science Magazine. \n So-called “surface implants” have reached a roadblock; they cannot be applied long term to the spinal cord or brain, beneath the nervous system’s protective envelope, otherwise known as the “dura mater,” because when nerve tissues move or stretch, they rub against these rigid devices. After a while, this repeated friction causes inflammation, scar tissue buildup, and rejection. \nAn easy-does-it implant\nFlexible and stretchy, the implant developed at EPFL is placed beneath the dura mater, directly onto the spinal cord. Its elasticity and its potential for deformation are almost identical to the living tissue surrounding it. This reduces friction and inflammation to a minimum. When implanted into rats, the e-Dura prototype caused neither damage nor rejection, even after two months. More rigid traditional implants would have caused significant nerve tissue damage during this period of time. \n The researchers tested the device prototype by applying . Not only did the implant prove its biocompatibility, but it also did its job perfectly, allowing the rats to regain the ability to walk on their own again after a few weeks of training. \n “Our e-Dura implant can remain for a long period of time on the spinal cord or the cortex, precisely because it has the same mechanical properties as the dura mater itself. This opens up new therapeutic possibilities for patients suffering from neurological trauma or disorders, particularly individuals who have become paralyzed following spinal cord injury,” explains Lacour, co-author of the paper, and holder of EPFL’s Bertarelli Chair in Neuroprosthetic Technology.\nFlexibility of tissue, efficiency of electronics\nDeveloping the e-Dura implant was quite a feat of engineering. As flexible and stretchable as living tissue, it nonetheless includes electronic elements that stimulate the spinal cord at the point of injury. The silicon substrate is covered with cracked gold electric conducting tracks that can be pulled and stretched. The electrodes are made of an innovative composite of silicon and platinum microbeads. They can be deformed in any direction, while still ensuring optimal electrical conductivity. Finally, a fluidic microchannel enables the delivery of pharmacological substances – neurotransmitters in this case – that will reanimate the nerve cells beneath the injured tissue. \n The implant can also be used to monitor electrical impulses from the brain in real time. When they did this, the scientists were able to extract with precision the animal’s motor intention before it was translated into movement. \n “It’s the first neuronal surface implant designed from the start for long-term application. In order to build it, we had to combine expertise from a considerable number of areas,” explains Courtine, co-author and holder of EPFL’s IRP Chair in Spinal Cord Repair. “These include materials science, electronics, neuroscience, medicine, and algorithm programming. I don’t think there are many places in the world where one finds the level of interdisciplinary cooperation that exists in our Center for Neuroprosthetics.” \n For the time being, the e-Dura implant has been primarily tested in cases of spinal cord injury in paralyzed rats. But the potential for applying these surface implants is huge – for example in epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and pain management. The scientists are planning to move towards clinical trials in humans, and to develop their prototype in preparation for commercialization.", "summary": "New therapies are on the horizon for individuals paralyzed following spinal cord injury.

For the first time since 2003, when EPFL started to analyze how students and staff get to and from campus, bikes now outnumber cars. 2,489 versus 2,288, to be precise. According to EPFL’s Sustainable Campus team, which conducted and analyzed the 2016 survey, this is a meaningful development that corroborates efforts to promote sustainable transport.\n“In 2014, the number of people using eco-friendly transports was higher than the number of car users,” said Luca Fontana, who handles mobility-related questions on campus. “Now this trend is borne out in absolute figures.” According to the latest study, cycling and walking gained 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively, between 2015 and 2016. The survey had 3,582 respondents – a quarter of all staff and students.\nHigher parking fees in 2016 led to a 1.66% decrease in the number of people who commute to campus by car. “This mainly concerns staff members, since the number of parking spaces for students is extremely limited,” added Fontana.\nPublic transport also saw a decline in use (-0.8%). Rush-hour crowds have something to do with this. As does the construction work on the Renens train station and the fact that inter-city trains no longer stop there. At the same time, the number of people with a public transport pass is falling, especially among those who use several means of transport on a daily basis or as a function of the weather. More than one out of 10 commuters opts for a combination of transports, a solution that offers greater flexibility.\nThis year, for the first time, the Mobility Survey looks at commuter behavior at EPFL's other campuses. These figures now establish a baseline.\n“These results encourage us to further expand the measures we use to support the Mobility Plan,” said Philippe Vollichard, who is in charge of Sustainable Campus. And there certainly is room for improvement. For example, in terms of support for those who use public transport or carpooling: 40% of students said that they could carpool, but only 6% do it.

{"id": 1354, "text": "EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab), led by professor Pascal Fua, now has a new tool that makes it possible to follow multiple players at once on a field or court, even when they’re buried under a pile of bodies in a rugby match or crouched behind another player. The athletes are represented on a screen with a superimposed image bearing their jersey color and number, so spectators, referees, and coaches can easily follow individuals without mixing them up. And there’s no need for the players to wear extra gear or RFID chips.\nAt the International Conference on Computer Vision in Barcelona today, Fua and his team describe their method for tracking players continuously from the time they enter the field. The system is made up of eight standard cameras - two on each side of the field or court, two that film from above and two that zoom – and three algorithms. After a tackle, goal, basket, or pileup, the system reattributes the jersey number to each player automati-cally. No more getting lost in the crowd.\nThree algorithms developed by Jerôme Berclaz, Horesh Ben Shitrit, Engin Turetken, and Pascal Fua in collaboration with François Fleuret from Idiap make the system work. The first detects individuals at a specific moment in time, independently of where they were the moment before or after. To do this, it slices the playing area into small 25 cm2 squares, removes the background in all the images simultaneously, and from this deduces the probability of the presence of a player in each of the small squares. The other two al-gorithms connect the results obtained for each moment in order to establish individual trajectories. All three use global optimization methods, resulting in a very robust system capable of tracking people in real time in a reliable manner.\nHoresh Ben Shitrit, a Ph.D. student in the CV Lab, improved on a prototype of the tracker that had been installed in Lausanne’s Olympic Museum. In the process, he and his collaborators have created a marketable tool that can be used for international sporting competitions. A student in the lab is now making final adjustments that will allow television cameras to provide direct input to the system.

{"id": 1355, "text": "A number of books have already been written about EPFL, recounting our School’s history and achievements. But EPFL President Martin Vetterli – as passionate about photography as he is about research – wanted to create something new: a sophisticated book of photographs, or rather photographers, that capture EPFL as it stands today. The result, \nPerspectives on EPFL\n, has just been published by EPFL Press, in association with EPFL and the Musée de l’Elysée. The museum’s director Tatyana Franck chaired the committee that selected the photographers, and subsequently the photographs, for the book.\nFree rein for three photographers\nLeutenegger – originally from Lausanne and winner of the Prix Culturel de la Photographie (awarded by the Fondation Vaudoise pour la Culture) and Swiss Federal Design Awards – takes us behind the scenes for an unorthodox view of scientific research. Konopka, who in 1998 won the second Vevey International Photo Award given by Festival Images, took still-life images of EPFL’s buildings. And Christinat – also from Lausanne – captured the simple, subtle gestures that constitute campus life. Christinat is known for being one of the 28 photographers featured in \nPhoto Suisse\n, an international production by the Swiss broadcasting corporation (SSR SRG Idée Suisse) that included a series of artist documentaries, a book and a travelling exhibition.\nThese three photographers had free rein to depict our School as it is currently and how they see its future. Throughout 2018 they crisscrossed our campus, going behind closed doors and exploring all the angles to capture rare, revealing moments. In addition to the book \nPerspectives on EPFL\n, their work will also be presented in a contemporary exhibition titled \nInfinity Room I.\nInfinity Room I\n: an augmented version of the book\nInfinity Room I\n is inspired by the book as well as the mathematical concept of boundlessness, especially in the context of scientific exploration and innovation at our School. It will be held in the ArtLab building from 12 April to 28 July.\nThe exhibition will invite visitors to experience the three photographers’ works from new perspectives, which spring both from the unique staging developed by Professor Sarah Kenderdine, director of ArtLab and head of EPFL’s Laboratory for Experimental Museology (eM+), and from the visitors themselves. “The idea was not to take the book and put it on the walls, but to augment the book, and to work with each photographer to reframe their images,” explains Kenderdine. “\nInfinity Room I\n opens up the space for interpretation and contextualization in different ways, but the real interpretation resides in the viewer.”\nThree artists, infinite perspectives\nVisitors will enter the exhibition by “walking through” the pages of a giant book. On one side will be displayed Konopka’s black-and-white portraits of EPFL’s iconic buildings from the Lausanne, Fribourg, Neuchâtel, Valais-Wallis and Campus Biotech sites. These photographs will be displayed in the wall-mounted format of traditional photography museums.\nFurther along in the exhibition, visitors will discover Christinat’s images, which capture the energy and emotion of study, research and life at EPFL. To convey the complexity of campus life, his images will be presented on a 30-meter movie screen stretched along the ArtLab’s southwest wall, like a window onto EPFL.\nFor her contribution to the book, Leutenegger ventured inside some of EPFL’s laboratories to capture images – from the digital to the microscopic – that bring EPFL research into focus. To contextualize the complexity of research spaces, she employed augmented reality technology: a panoramic video, spherical gigapixel images that allow visitors to “explore” the labs captured in her photographs, and an augmented animation of a blood sample from Professor Vetterli himself. A walk-in “aquarium” will also provide information on the ethical implications of using animal subjects, such as zebrafish, in scientific research.\nA second part of the exhibition, \nInfinity Room II\n, will open in September.

{"id": 1356, "text": "The city of Berne constitutes a model in terms of public transport and sustainable mobility. It is even an ideal for Lausanne and Geneva. The good news is that both cities are in the right path according to a study performed by the Urban Sociology Laboratory at EPFL and the University Mobility Observatory at UNIGE. The study compared data from 1994 and 2011 showing that Lausanne and Geneva’s active urban groups are no longer reliant on a single mode of transport as they now combine their transportation modes according to their purposes. As a result, car usage has decreased in favor of public transportation, two wheels or even two feet.\n In order to better understand what determines the choice of transportation mode, the researchers focused on three major cities: Geneva, Lausanne and Bern, as well as a smaller town, Yverdon-les-Bains. They based their study on a survey of 2,500 motorized active groups and evaluated the major developments that took place over the last fifteen years.\n The study was led by Vincent Kaufmann (LASUR) and coordinated by EPFL’s Transportation Center. It was financed by the cantons of Vaud and Geneva, the city of Lausanne, the town of Yverdon and Lausanne and Geneva’s Public Transport network.\nPublic transport and two-wheelers are the most popular\n In the 1990s mobility mainly revolved around the use of cars in French-speaking Switzerland. Today, the active groups’ choice depends on their context or purpose. The majority opts for a public transport subscription (PT) and a two-wheeler (motorized or not). However, the disparities among the studied cities are significant: 81% of respondents had PT subscriptions in Berne. In the case of Lausanne they were 55% and in Geneva and Yverdon-les-Bains they were 48%.\n The diversity of this portfolio is explained by the choice of means of transport. \"Fifteen years ago, we would mainly use our cars, a bus from time to time and the bike on Sunday. At present, people are more likely to move by train and public transport and to use their cars on Sundays,\" explained Sébastien Munafò, researcher at LASUR and OUM.\n Car use has been relegated in favor of public transport. In 1994, a third of the people surveyed in Geneva and Lausanne were frequent PT users (more than twice a week) whereas they are almost half at present. \"If the people surveyed in Geneva use PT to go to work almost as frequently as the ones in Berne, at an individual level, the chosen mode of transport is in some cases more of a constraint -more or less accepted- than an actual choice,\" explained Sébastien Munafò.\n Researchers analyzed a number of factors to explain these behavioral changes: the traffic increase, the restrictions in parking choices, the improvement of public transport, federal incentives and all efforts carried out in favor of pedestrians and cyclists... \"The population of the studied cities appears very willing to using other means of transportation than cars. This is an advantage for carrying out policies aimed at developing eco-mobility,\" summarized Vincent Kaufmann.\nA matter of image\n The changes observed are related to means of transport that have themselves too, changed dramatically. Cars are now perceived as polluting and sometimes more harmful than beneficial. The reputation they’ve lost has been public transport’s gain. For example, PT’s positive image has doubled from 30% to 61% in Lausanne. \"The improvement of public transport’s image is unprecedented,\" said Christian Liaudat, in charge of mobility projects at the State of Vaud. He sees the construction of the M2 metro line combined with a better RER offer as the reason behind this increase in popularity. In Geneva, the image of public transport has also improved from 39% to 52% positive perceptions.\n The study’s recommendations confirm the strategy proposed by the Canton of Geneva, says Damien Cataldi, engineer on analysis and mobility projects at the Directorate-General for Mobility in Geneva. \"The \"Mobility 2030\" strategy pursued by the canton on Geneva aims at facilitating the practice of multimodality and in fact responds to the changes in people’s observed behavior.\"\n For its part, Lausanne is required to \"avoid a two-tier development of public transport as all of its areas are not equally equipped, and to \"reduce the parking availability at work.\" In the case of Yverdon-les-Bains, it is a fast growing town and its inhabitants are still quite attached to using their cars. Its strategy should \"bet on soft mobility for travelling within the city.\"\nThe study and a synthesis of \"Typology and evolution of modal choices logics behind motorized urban groups” are available, in French, at:", "summary": "A study carried out by EPFL and UNIGE and conducted in Lausanne, Geneva, Bern and Yverdon-les-Bains reports the way active urban groups have greatly diversified their modes of travel over the past two decades.", "claim": "A study carried out by EPFL and UNIGE and conducted in Lausanne, Geneva, Bern and Yverdon-les-Bains reports the way active urban groups have greatly diversified their modes of travel over Fifteen years ago.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [36, 38], "noise": false}

Coordinated by the Swiss Space Center, as part of the European Space Agency’s  initiative, IGLUNA focuses on designing technologies that will help astronauts live in space.\nStarting in September 2019, 150 students from 10 European countries put their expertise and creativity to the test. They worked on topics such as how to design living spaces, produce oxygen, food and electricity, navigate and communicate with Earth, maintain physical and mental health, and conduct scientific experiments.\nA special year\n“For 2020, we raised the bar by introducing remote-controlled operations,” says Tatiana Benavides, project manager at the Swiss Space Center. “This reflects the reality of space exploration: missions to the moon will begin with robots that are remotely controlled from Earth.”\nThe students were originally scheduled to meet up in Luzern from 10 to 19 July. To simulate extreme environments like the Moon, their prototypes and experimental designs were to be installed on Mount Pilatus and piloted from a control room at the Swiss Museum of Transport.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, however, forced the team to rethink the event. “We were caught off guard and had to learn as a group how to organize a virtual campaign,” says Benavides. She and her team provided support for participants as things changed, giving them advice and tips for their presentations.\nThe new format, however, had a silver lining: the online presentations not only allowed everyone to take part, but also fostered greater student involvement. “In 2019, due to time constraints and the distance between the two campaign sites in Zermatt, some people were unable to see the other projects,” says Eva Buchs, IGLUNA communications officer. “This year, the teams could connect via YouTube live chat and see what everyone else was up to!”\nOutstanding results \nEach team was given one hour to present its project to the general public as well as aerospace professionals. The  team from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences unveiled its system for growing plants without soil, a technique known as hydroponics, or soilless culture. The students used human waste to provide plants with necessary nutrients, while a closed loop ensured that water was used sustainably. They developed customizable LED lighting and created an environment conducive to plant growth, all of which is monitored by sensors and controlled by an intelligent system.\n“We believe the time has come to reuse satellites, in the same way as rockets,” says Mayank, head of the  project. At the Technical University of Berlin, Mayank and his team have been developing their own antennae and satellites fitted with a communication system that is operable in space and that can be remotely reconfigured for various missions.\nIs there life in outer space? To find out, the  team from the University of Bern has been working on ORIGIN, a compact, lightweight and easy-to-use instrument that detects biosignatures and performs chemical analyses of planetary surfaces. The team also built the rover that will carry ORIGIN and installed a cryogenic cooling system on the device to simulate the extreme conditions of space.\nRounding out the 2020 edition, three teams were honored during the IGLUNA Space Awards ceremony. ,  and  distinguished themselves by the excellence of their accompanying documentation, their ability to find sponsoring, their team spirit, the structure of their presentations and their involvement across the ten days of the campaign.\nBack to the future\n“Students take part in IGLUNA not only for the experience, but also with an eye to their own future,” says Benavides. “There is the educational side, as well as a chance to network with aerospace professionals, and lastly, technology transfer.” For example, the Celestial team just launched a startup, and  (now an EPFL association) has been fine-tuning its prototype – a robot that grows and harvests plants automatically and without human intervention – since last year.\nIGLUNA 2021 will be even more demanding, with an expanded “business” component.

{"id": 1364, "text": "Growth continues in the student numbers enrolled at EPFL. The new academic year started last Tuesday in the atmosphere of a heartening increase in the number of enrollments for the fourth consecutive year—a record. Across all the study courses, the new enrollments recorded on September 9th are 9.5% higher than for the same period in 2010. Because of inevitable withdrawals resulting from multiple enrollments or accommodation problems, particularly acute this year, the final figures will not be established till the end of October.\nThe provisional figures show that 1467 new students, 28% of whom are women, have been accepted on to one of the Bachelor’s courses.\n In parallel, 296 students (+11%) coming from other institutions or the higher education college (HES) pathway, 30% of whom are women, will begin a Master’s course at EPFL. There they will rub shoulders with the 636 students who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree at EPFL this summer and are continuing their program of studies here.\nAll these newcomers to the lecture-halls are joining students who are following a continuous program at EPFL. Their total for the academic year 2011–2012, allowing for probable disenrollments, will exceed 8000 students (an increase of around 10% on the final figures for last year). The Bachelor’s students will increase by around 10%, those on Master’s courses between 10% and 20% and, finally, there will be 5% to 10% more doctoral candidates than in 2010–2011.\nAn increase in almost all the courses\nAlmost all the Bachelor’s courses are anticipating an increase in their student numbers. At this stage of enrollments, it’s mainly courses in civil engineering (+67 students, +75% on the final figures for 2010), mathematics (+29 students, +38%) and mechanical engineering (+32 students, +30%) that account for the increase in the number of new faces that will be seen at EPFL this year.\nAt the Master’s level, despite the risks of making comparisons given the small numbers, there is evidence of a strong attraction for students from outside EPFL to the computer science section (+21 students, +48.8%). The College of Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship also has a full house, with 25 new students enrolled (+400%). Finally this year 20 students, 17 of whom are from other institutions, are starting the new Masters in Energy Management and Sustainability, which they will partly attend at EPFL Middle East in Ras Al Khaimah (United Arab Emirates).\nWorking in small groups is becoming standard in the first year\nThe students who are starting at EPFL this year will benefit substantially from an innovative educational system specific to this institution: the “tutorial” principle, designed to reinforce the supervision of exercise sessions in the analysis and physics lessons. In this system, a group of eight students is presented with exercises to solve under supervision of a “tutor” recruited from the more advanced students. The emphasis is on problem solving, which the participants debate together. “This system, which we tested out four years ago, has proved its merits”, states Nadine Stainier, Teaching Advisor for Pedagogical Research and Support (CRAFT). It gives the students the opportunity to be much more active in seeking solutions and teaches them to argue their standpoint with their colleagues. It helps them to build their network and to integrate into the academic community.’\nAnother new feature is the requirement for Master’s students on engineering courses to carry out a minimum of eight weeks’ work experience in a company to obtain their diploma. This means they are confronted very early on with the realities of the working world.\nThese two examples demonstrate EPFL’s dynamism also in terms of its primary mission, teaching. They occur in the context of a major review that will ultimately lead to a fundamental reorganization in Bachelor’s courses. In the future, this will allow more communication between subject areas and will place an even stronger emphasis on practical activities.", "summary": "EPFL’s latest enrollment statistics point to an increase of nearly 10%, to more than 8000 people, in the total number of students for the academic year 2011–2012. It is the fourth consecutive year of growth.

This discovery has the potential to help restock coral reefs in other parts of the world which are more vulnerable to the effects of global warming.\nTransnational Red Sea Centre\nAgainst this backdrop and in order to facilitate collaboration among the region's scientific communities, the EPFL has decided to set up a regional research facility, the Transnational Red Sea Centre. \nAddressing the conference, Federal Councillor Cassis explained the reasons that motivate the FDFA to support projects that provide opportunities for dialogue between scientists and policymakers. As an innovative country with a large scientific community, Switzerland has the resources and credibility to facilitate and promote dialogue in the Red Sea region, which remains a politically and culturally fragile part of the world.\nGeneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator foundation\nMr Cassis stressed that this kind of project is in line with the Federal Council's decision to create, together with the canton and city of Geneva, the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator foundation. This foundation aims to provide the international community with an innovative and flexible vehicle that will spur international organisations into swift action to address the challenges of multilateral diplomacy in the 21st century. Meeting the challenges brought about by these developments, identifying governance needs and proposing solutions requires innovative partnerships among a variety of stakeholders across national borders.\nAt the conference in Bern, EPFL president Martin Vetterli explained the importance of the project for the Red Sea region: \"For me personally, there is nothing more inspiring than working for an institution like ours, which, as we mark the EPFL's 50th anniversary, is making a clear commitment to the future of our planet.\"\n(Based on DFAE press release)", "summary": "Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis, Head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), announced on Tuesday Switzerland's support for EPFL's project to create a \"Transnational Red Sea Research Center\".

Over 11 half-day sessions, they learnt how to create their own website. \"Don't lose that curiosity that led you to the course,\" urged Suzan LeVine. During her speech, the ambassador, who herself has a scientific background, told the audience about her unusual career path, which took her from studies in aerospace and English to volunteering to work for Barack Obama’s election campaign in the area of social media. She's a real source of inspiration for young girls.\nAnd yes, it was a course just for girls. In fact, the Science Outreach Department organizes a whole series of activities aimed at sparking an interest in information and communication technology in young girls. The proportion of female students in this field at EPFL, for example, was still only 14.5% in 2015. \"We need to give young girls more confidence in their capacties and ensure they get proper training so that later on they will consider entering these fields at university and professionally,\" said Farnaz Moser, Head of the Science Outreach Department, who has been organizing these courses for 13 years.\nEleven weeks to build a dog robot\nCertificates for the robotics courses were also awarded today.

{"id": 1372, "text": "The use of anticoagulants has the effect of limiting the formation of blood clots in the veins, arteries or heart. But this treatment requires frequent monitoring of blood flow in the hospital. To overcome this constraint, Qloudlab, a start-up based in EPFL’s Microengineering Laboratory, is developing a test whose results can be read by a smartphone screen. The data can then be sent directly to a physician through an application. “Such a test will significantly improve the quality of life for people undergoing this kind of treatment,” said Arthur Queval, founder of the start-up.\nTransformed into a mini-laboratory by a small single-use film, the smartphone reveals an indication of coagulation within a few dozen seconds. Still in development, the film deposited on the device is made of a microstructured plastic layer that is a few micrometers thick. A drop of blood enters by capillary action and comes into contact with a molecule initiating the coagulation process. But how does the phone read the results? It analyzes disruptions in the electric field, which is the surface of the iPhone or Samsung screens, for example – similar to what happens when you touch the screen with your finger. This change of the electric field produced by the path of the blood in the film is analyzed and interpreted with a specific app also developed by Qloudlab.\nSince the wrong dosage of anticoagulants can cause cardiovascular complications, it is essential that people who take them are carefully monitored to prevent any inappropriate treatment. Self-monitoring devices, along the same lines as blood-sugar tests for diabetics, are currently arriving on the market. But the new tool developed by Qloudlab has the advantage that data can be sent directly to the doctor through the application. The specialist in possession of other data about the patient can then quickly estimate whether treatment should be modified.\nThe start-up has filed for a patent and has demonstrated the feasibility of the concept as well as the technology. They just received funding from Venture Kick that has enabled them to hire a biochemist. The three scientists have set the goal of 2015 to demonstrate that this new tool is as reliable as a laboratory test and thus can move to the industrialization phase and then commercialization.", "summary": "Using the properties of a smartphone screen to perform blood tests: the device developed by Qloudlab allows at-home analysis in less than a minute.

{"id": 1377, "text": "Tracking individuals in a large group, be they ants or humans, is no trivial task. By applying statistics to mobile phone signals picked up in a large crowd, Master’s student Elisaveta Kondratieva developed a way to more accurately follow and understand the behavior of the individuals that make up the crowd, revealing the potential and the pitfalls of this new approach. For her semester project, she evaluated an extensive dataset gathered at the 2010 Paléo music festival in a campaign entirely planned and carried out by researchers in the research groups of Patrick Thiran and Martin Vetterli in collaboration with Olivier Dousse at Nokia.\nEvery year, the Paléo music festival attracts well over 40,000 music aficionados per day. Many carry mobile phones with activated bluetooth devices. In 2010, ten “agents” were part of the crowd, equipped with special mobile phones programmed to pick up and store the identity of all detectable bluetooth devices in their vicinity. The data they gathered provides a list of all of the detectable bluetooth devices surrounding each of the walking agents at any given time throughout the evening.\nOften, these data are not enough to discriminate between different nearby locations. Were the detected individuals at the Asian food stall, the stand right next to it, or were they on the way to their next concert? Detecting the presence of bluetooth signals narrows down the position of the mobile phone that emits it, and that of its owner, to a radius around 10 to 20 meters around the agent. The inaccuracy of the agent’s GPS adds up to 10 more meters of uncertainty. Furthermore, many devices were only detected a handful of times in the course of the evening.\nThis is where statistics come in handy. “Using an approach based on Bayesian statistics, that is by taking into account certain pieces of available information, the accuracy of the outcome can be improved,” she says. Concert schedules, a detailed map of the festival grounds, and other sources of information can help fill in the gaps between separate detections and provide likely estimates of the exact locations of the individuals.\nFor such an approach to work, a significant fraction of the audience have to have their bluetooth devices set to be detectable. Fortunately, this turned out to be the case: fixed detectors at the entrance to the festival  - just over 8% of the 40,500 people that attended the festival that day.\nThe quality of the results depends largely on how effectively the agents fan out across the festival grounds. “Two of our agents basically spent the entire evening at the festival together,” says the student, “so the data they obtained overlapped. Also, none of our agents ever went to one of the more remote stages.” To fix these loopholes, future campaigns could involve a larger number of fixed detectors and mobile agents. Additionally, a similar approach could be adopted to follow individuals using their WiFi signals.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES (4) - For her semester project, an EPFL Master’s student applied a different approach to tracking the flow of the crowds at the Paléo music festival – using cell phone data and statistics.", "claim": "the evening (4) - For her semester project, an EPFL Master’s student applied a different approach to tracking the flow of the crowds at the Paléo music festival – using cell phone data and statistics.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 1], "noise": false}

Partners (investors, companies, NGOs and other organizations) provide briefs, problem statements, reality checks and feedback. Students must test their ideas, pitch, make a live demo or even negotiate. They are encouraged to consider their project from an end-to-end perspective, from problem scoping to implementation.\nHuman-centered design\n: Students are incentivized to alter their points of view to create through the eyes of someone else. Using designers’ research methods, students are asked to observe contexts, question people and exercise empathy. Their assumptions are challenged, pushing them to reframe problems and opportunities.\nPossibility to fail\n: An environment is created to make failure acceptable and productive. This requires building trust, psychological safety, and providing students with formative feedback. Students are assessed on how they deal with different challenges and understand root causes of their success and failures. Both productive success and failure are acceptable; unproductive failure and success are not.", "summary": "Twelve student volunteers, including those from EPFL and the EPFL + ECAL Lab, spent 10 days developing and testing four solutions to everyday challenges facing Bangalore residents as part of the India Switzerland Social Innovation Camp (INSSINC) pilot program.

{"id": 1383, "text": "The tool developed by Attolight amounts to a revolution in the observation at nanoscopic scale. It can film moving electrons through the combination of an ultrafast laser with a scanning electron microscope. Its applications include the quality control of chips, LEDs and photovoltaic cells. At a global scale, Asia constitutes the main region where these devices are manufactured; hence its market is showing great excitement about Attolight’s novel tool.\nWhy did you aim at Asia?\n We began by exploring the market of United States’ laboratories, but we felt an unfavorable economic environment. Purchasing our machines requires a significant investment, which wasn’t easy to get approved. At the same time, some researchers from Chinese and Japanese companies contacted us as they were interested in this new generation tool for quality testing. Even though these initial contacts were not successful, we started to feel that there were more business opportunities for our products in the east.\nHow do large Asian institutions or companies get to trust a Swiss start-up to the point of purchasing high cost equipment from it?\n Firstly, we tackled the language and cultural barrier by hiring a Chinese consultant that had carried out her PhD studies at EPFL’s Institute of Quantum Electronics and Photonics. In the autumn of 2011, she established the first contacts with potential representatives. Then, in spring 2012, we travelled to meet them, together with Olivier Gougeon, one of our colleagues. We met about fifteen companies and chose Quantum Design, a U.S. company with a subsidiary in China, to represent us. It was key to be able to find the right people, understand the company’s structure and the financing specifics. Obviously, this would have been impossible without a way of understanding Chinese. Furthermore, EPFL’s excellent reputation helped us enormously. Without the support of Adrienne Corboud-Fumagalli, Vice President for Innovation and Technology Transfer, as well as Benoît Deveaud-Plédran, professor at the Laboratory of Quantum Optoelectronics, it would have been a lot more difficult to break into the Asian market.\nWhat is your advantage in the market, what is a company looking for when it approaches you?\n Our device allows testing miniaturized integrated components, which are commonplace in the market of semiconductors, where we are positioned today. It provides information on the material’s structure and the problems that can reduce its long-term durability or influence its effectiveness. We have a big edge over our competitors in terms of ease of use and on-screen image quality.\nHow is the current economic situation in China?\n The current context is quite favorable for us. China has decided to invest in renewable energy. Therefore, this is a great opportunity for start-ups like ours. I am frequently impressed when I see the equipment they use at their research and development establishments, especially among LED manufacturers.\nWhat are your sales expectations in the Asian market?\n This year, we are hoping to sell a machine. Then, the idea is to double our sales every year through the applications that our equipment can provide today. At the same time, we are developing new usage scenarios and we are carrying out technical analysis in our laboratory. Some companies send us samples of their material and tell us what to measure. Others send us their specialists, who come to do the measuring themselves.\nWhat are the next markets that you aiming at and how are you going to do so?\n Each country has its own culture. We'll adapt our way of doing things. In China, our representatives will contact prospective clients, but the sale will go through us. In Japan, a major scientific instruments company wishes to sell our devices, the main reason being that their customers require having a stock at hand. In Singapore, we also have a representative and we are thinking to do the same with India, Taiwan and South Korea, where we are expected to expand by next summer.\nHow can you control the work done at the other end of the world when you're a small start-up of 6 employees?\n We have our requirements: we demand for a representative to be dedicated to our machine. We are planning to make at least two trips with each representative in order to meet the contacts they’ve established and to ascertain the links they have with potential customers. For example: is he dealing with a technician or a laboratory manager? How does he present the product? Additionally, we ask our potential partners to finance a trip for our representative to come to Switzerland to do a first week of training and for follow-up training each year afterwards. It gives us an idea of the effort they are willing to make. We also ask for regular reports and carry out telephonic interviews every month.", "summary": "Attolight, EPFL’s spin-off, is looking towards the rising sun.

{"id": 1385, "text": "What is the best size of a parliament? That is a question at the center of many countries today, including the 2020 referendum in Italy where almost 70% of voters selected to slash the number of members of parliament by about a third. Among others, the complex issue involves matters of governing efficiency, logistics, and financial costs.\nBut one thing many people might not realize is that there is a science behind all this. In 1972, political scientist Rein Taagepera published  proposing that the ideal size of a parliament corresponds to the cube root of the country’s population: \nA=αP\no\n1/3\n, where A is the parliament size, P\no\n is the population size, and α is a constant. In general terms, the bigger a country’s population, the bigger its parliament ought to be.\nTaagepera’s famous “cube-root law” was quickly taken up by governments, but hasn’t been without critics: In 2007 and 2012, researchers used empirical data to come up with a square-root relationship rather than a cube-root, while another paper in 2019 questioned the actual cause-effect sequence that lies at the foundation of Taagepera’s law. So while all agree that a bigger parliament would be needed for a bigger country, the exact relation has remained a matter of dispute.\nNow, physicist Giorgio Margaritondo, Professor Emeritus with EPFL’s School of Basic Sciences, has published a paper analyzing Taagepera’s model. , his findings challenge the math behind the paper and the accuracy of its predictions, and raises concerns about the way the data was used.\n“I was astonished,” says Margaritondo. “The law has been, – and still is – widely used, but the paper’s flaws have gone undetected for half a century.” He points out that Taagepera’s original paper actually evaluates the actual size of a parliament not its “optimal” size.\nFour fatal flaws\n“The original derivation of the ‘cube-root law’ is affected by fatal mistakes, unnoticed for half a century,” says Margaritondo. Taking a physicist’s view, he analyzed the 1972 paper, and discovered four flaws.\nFirst, that the cube-root law was not derived from the paper’s data and that the corresponding trend that led to the formula was “arbitrarily forced”.\nSecond, that the theoretical steps used to derive the formula incorrectly evaluated one of its key factors.\nThe third flaw has to do with real-world politics: Taagepera’s model assumes that each member of parliament spends on average an equal amount of time communicating inside and outside parliament, which Margaritondo describes as a “an arbitrary hypothesis that has unrealistic consequences.”\nFinally, there is generally no evaluation of “optimal” size based on a power law that can reach meaningful accuracy, and that includes the cube-root law.\nSquare, not cube\nMargaritondo’s suspicion was that the paper’s data could better fit a broader, more “general” formula that the cube-root law. But in the paper, Taagepera challenged this notion by claiming that the it would be a “dead end” and that it would be “\nmore fruitful to look for a plausible theoretical model which would fit the observed general trend\n”.\n“This argument is fundamentally flawed from a physicist’s point of view,” writes Margaritondo. “It considers only one hypothesis, renouncing \na priori\n to demonstrate its superiority with respect to others.” Spurred on, Margaritondo used the paper’s original data and applied to them the same statistical fitting method that Taagepera had in 1972. Except that here, he used a similar, but more general formula to fit the data: \nA=αP\no\nn\n. Here the cube root changes and the exponent is n.\nApplying this equation to the 1972 data, Margaritondo discovered that n equals 0.45 ± 0.03. This is actually closer to a square-root law,  by the researchers Emmanuelle Auriol Robert J. Gary-Bobo. “Even the original data did not support the cube-root law,” says Margaritondo. “The fit was arbitrarily forced.”\nBeyond math\nIn short, it seems that, at least for now, physics cannot decide what the optimal parliament size is based on math alone, but it might be time to abandon a cherished rule that has governed governments for almost half a century.\n“To think that we can accurately derive the ‘optimal’ parliament size with a power law is an illusion,” says Margaritondo. “It’s akin to fake news: the wrong use of ‘scientific’ arguments to propagate political notions.”", "summary": "Analyzing a classic paper that has influenced the size of parliaments for almost half a century, an EPFL physicist discovers major flaws with its methodology, challenges its fundamental assumptions, and calls for a complete and careful re-think of its government-governing rule.", "claim": "Analyzing a classic paper that has influenced the size of parliaments for 1972, an EPFL physicist discovers major flaws with its methodology, challenges its fundamental assumptions, and calls for a complete and careful re-think of its government-governing rule.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 12], "noise": false}

These are just some of the sights that will greet visitors who drop in to the refreshment room at the 2020 Bex & Arts sculpture triennial. This outdoor exhibition, running from 22 June to 18 October, consists of monumental sculptures, installations and land art by around 30 artists. The reuse initiative, which aims to educate the public about the merits of using recycled materials in construction and design, is the brainchild of EPFL’s Laboratory of Elementary Architecture and Studies of Types (EAST). It ties in nicely with the theme of this year’s triennial: industrialization, the digital revolution and the climate emergency. \nThe bathroom stalls. © Tiago P. Borges\nThe project builds on a longstanding EPFL tradition. EAST laboratory co-directors Anja and Martin Fröhlich set architecture undergraduates an annual challenge: to design and build a full-scale pavilion using reclaimed materials from a demolished building and applying circular-economy principles. As in previous years (see links below), the students spent time considering the best way to give each part of the building a second lease on life. The idea behind the EPFL program is twofold: to give architecture students a chance to roll up their sleeves and get creative, while at the same time stressing the importance of environmentally friendly design. \nFrom Bern to Bex\n This year, the students spent the first semester renovating the former Burgernziel Alter tram depot in Bern. The prime contractor Losinger Marazzi granted EPFL access to the site and gave the students firsthand insights into the project’s aims, practical considerations and on-the-ground challenges. \n In the second semester, the students set about designing structures using parts of the depot’s grandiose main hall, including the prefabricated steel frame and the original bricks that, despite their age, have retained their mechanical properties over time. Some of the reclaimed materials were used in a new teaching building at EPFL, featuring attractive and structurally solid brick pillars.\nOther projects included a new type of greenhouse for the Geneva Botanical Gardens, where the bricks filter, store and radiate the sun’s heat, and a temporary structure in Thun with versatile facade modules that can be removed and used to reconfigure the interior. The students also designed a reclaimed material recycling center in Lausanne, with a curved, textured facade, and a plant pavilion for the Arboretum in Zurich, with vaulted ceilings that lend a distinctive quality to the internal space.\nThe Bachelor’s students were intending to take some of their ideas from the drawing board to the real world this spring. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and plans had to change. “This year has been a lesson in perseverance for all of us, teachers and students alike,” says Tiago P. Borges, a researcher at the EAST lab. “We had to put in place alternative plans without compromising on our values and our key message: the importance of transitioning to sustainable, responsible architecture.” \nA redesigned refreshment room\n Despite the uniquely challenging circumstances of this academic year, the EAST lab managed to arrange a parallel project: designing and fitting out a new refreshment room inside the barn at Parc de Szilassy, which is hosting the Bex & Arts triennial. The building is owned and managed by Vaud Canton’s Buildings and Heritage Department, which provided valuable support. \nThe students and researchers obtained sinks from Protravail, a charity that had reclaimed them from an abandoned villa in the canton, and recovered doors and wall lights from the former EPFL daycare center. Next they turned to La Porch, a carpentry and joinery firm founded by former EPFL students, to develop digital manufacturing solutions and build wooden partitions that can be easily dismantled. \nThe result? Three transportable, reusable bathroom stalls that are much more impressive than the mobile, plastic type often found at summer events. The team applied the same reuse principles to the refreshment room lights, developing a template for 3D-printable lampshades made from recycled PET. EPFL-branded leaflets will detail where the objects came from and explain the sustainable thinking behind them. “We recognize that this is a small-scale project,” says Borges. “But it’s a useful example of research applied to a real-world use case. We also want to get people thinking about the bigger picture. If we can apply circular economy and reuse principles to a small project like this, what difference could they make to our lives on a much bigger scale?” Something for visitors to reflect upon at this summer’s triennial in Bex. \nThe refreshment room in a barn, at the 2020 Bex & Arts sculpture triennial. © Tiago P.

Microsoft provides one million Swiss francs per year in funding for IT-related research projects at the two universities over a period of five years. The collaboration is a continuation of a project launched in 2008 that focused on embedded technology software solutions and prototypes. The new collaboration will now broaden the areas of computer science and deepen the collaboration between the three partners.\nA steering committee jointly made up of representatives from EPFL, ETH Zurich and Microsoft selected the projects to support from applications submitted by computer scientists and researchers in IT related fields. The only requirement was the participation of a scientist from Microsoft Research in the project.\nScientists in Lausanne and Zurich submitted 27 proposals, seven of which were selected by the steering committee. Four of these projects originated at ETH Zurich and the other three were from EPFL. “We were pleasantly surprised at how many high-quality project proposals were submitted,” says Markus Püschel, Head of the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich and a member of the steering committee. He believes that the large number of applications is an indication of the value and fruitful results already accrued from the longstanding cooperation between the two universities and Microsoft.\nThe scientists receiving funding this year are at EPFL Professor Babak Falsafi, Professor Serge Vaudenay, Dr. Edouard Bugnion, Dr. Florin Dinu and Dr. Pamela Delgado. Professor Otmar Hilliges, Dr. Torsten Höfler, Dr. Gustavo Alonso and Roger Wattenhofer, at ETH Zurich, were also successful in their applications for project grants.\nExploiting synergies for cutting-edge research and education\nThe support also covers funding for doctoral student positions. The steering committee also decided on the number of funded doctorate positions per project. “This year we have decided to support as many motivated scientists as possible, rather than giving large amounts of money to just a few projects. I think we have struck a very good balance,” explains James Larus, Dean of the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL. Larus is full of praise for the excellent cooperation between the two universities. “We are all pulling in the same direction and pursuing the same interests: to exploit synergies for cutting-edge research and offer our upcoming young researchers the best possible training.”The new research partnership begins today with a launch event at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, where the scientists who have been awarded funding are presenting their projects.\nExamples of research project\nAt the EcoCloud center at EPFL, Dr. Edouard Bugnion and Professor Babak Falsafi are carrying out research into energy-efficient memory architectures for data centres that can handle huge amounts of data. To do this, they are combining thousands of energy-efficient micro-servers in a way that enables them to access the memories of the other servers with a minimal time delay. The two computer scientists are working with Dr. Dushyanth Narayanan and other scientists from Microsoft Research in Cambridge to develop new applications for this system, known as Scale-out NUMA.\nOtmar Hilliges, a 34-year-old assistant professor, is one of the successful project applicants. The young computer scientist from ETH Zurich studies the interaction between people and computers. For his project, he and Dr. Shahram Izadi from Microsoft Research are investigating how flying robots can work and interact with people in active scenarios.

These findings were published recently in the journal \nPNAS\n. The paper is co-authored by Professor Andrea Rinaldo, who heads EPFL’s Laboratory of Ecohydrology (ECHO), and scientists from the Polytechnic University of Milan, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, the University of Zurich and the University of Padua.\n“We can conclude that the drastic measures taken by the Italian government have had a decisive effect, preventing the country’s healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed,” say the authors.\nCaption:\n Chart showing the expected number of hospitalizations under different scenarios.

What makes this study both important and unique is its spatial resolution. The disease-spread geography is modeled in 107 provinces and metropolitan areas – the most granular level of detail available.\nThe team calibrated the model to account for human mobility, using census data from Italy’s National Institute of Statistics to estimate pre-epidemic mobility, and the findings of an independent study based on cell phone geolocation data to ascertain the extent to which the government-imposed restrictions had reduced people’s movements.\nAfter confirming the model’s accuracy by comparing the map of infections with observed data, the researchers used it to study the effects of the early containment measures.\nCaption:\n The map on the left shows the spread of the epidemic as simulated at the municipal scale. The other two maps show the geography of the epidemic as simulated by the model at the province scale (center) and as observed in data (right). / M.

They also suggest that better contact tracing and localized restrictions could help stop the spread of the epidemic while limiting social and economic disruption.\nIntervention strategies\nAndrea Rinaldo, a recipient of a European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant Fellowship and a full professor at EPFL, has over a decade’s experience in epidemic modeling. His past research findings have been used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to develop intervention strategies to limit the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases.\nProf. Rinaldo was keen to get the COVID-19 study up and running as quickly as possible, so he reached out to colleagues who had previously worked at his lab. “I recruited former PhD students and postdocs and a visiting professor virtually overnight,” he explains. “By repurposing technologies we’d worked with in the past, we were able to develop the new model in next to no time.

For Alain Jarne, it was important to compile this data in a book. “As the project neared its end, we wanted to highlight certain results concerning the state of this country, which has been in a state of upheaval since the end of the 90s, and which has a population of three million and probably one million emigrants.” Now it’s complete!\n Although the CEAT is commissioned by several countries because of its competence in spatial planning and urbanism, it performs most of its missions on Swiss soil.

If a ray of light comes close to a mass (e.g. a galaxy), the light will be distorted as it would if it went through a lens.\nThis phenomenon can distort the images of objects hidden behing other celestial bodies. \"If you look at a light source hidden behind a galaxy, the light rays that reach us will bend and produce mirage images,\" says Frédéric Courbin, Senior Scientist at LASTRO.

{"id": 1417, "text": "A decrease in sea ice, changing vegetation, reduced biodiversity, plastic pollution and altered atmospheric processes: these are just some of the climate-change topics that the 40 scientists participating in the GLACE expedition will tackle. Organized by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) and supported by the Swiss Polar Foundation, this expedition will circumnavigate Greenland clockwise for two months between the end of July and the end of September 2019 (see inset below for details).\nFifteen research projects were selected to be run onboard. One of them, which will study how airborne particles influence the Arctic environment, is being led by EPFL. Athanasios Nenes, the principal investigator on that project and a professor at EPFL’s Laboratory of Atmospheric Processes and their Impacts (LAPI), tells us about this important research.\nWhat is the Arctic atmosphere made of? \nThe Arctic is a unique environment. It is one of the most climate-sensitive regions on Earth, warming twice as fast as the global average. This accelerated warming is thought to be driven by complex interactions between ice, the atmosphere, the biosphere and the ocean, and airborne particles – also known as aerosols – are thought to play a significant role in this. Much of how the particles interact with the Arctic atmosphere and climate is still unknown.\nWhat exactly will you study during the expedition?\nWe will study where the particles found in the Arctic come from – forest fires, biogenic and other natural sources as well as anthropogenic emissions – and how they impact the local climate by absorbing or reflecting sunlight and by affecting clouds. For example, we will look for specific types of molecules that persistently remain dark and absorb sunlight for very long periods of time – including well after they have fallen from the sky and been deposited on ice, which can accelerate melting. The goal is to understand which particles exacerbate the rapid climate change experienced in the region and which tend to help cool the climate.\nDo air particles play an especially important role in the Arctic? \nYes – numerous roles, in fact. Some serve to warm the climate, while others reflect sunlight and, in so doing, can cool the region. Yet others may carry nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorous, iron and copper; when these nutrient-rich particles fall into the Arctic Ocean, they can act as a fertilizer and promote phytoplankton growth. Phytoplankton is at the bottom of the food chain and absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis – so it is very important. We would also like to see if there are significant amounts of airborne biological particles – that is bacteria, viruses and biological debris from both ocean and land activity. Compared to other types of aerosols, there are few biological particles, but some of them are extremely good at triggering ice formation in clouds. When this happens, clouds can rapidly precipitate, and this can greatly affect the amount of sunlight hitting the Earth’s surface. If the cloud cover in the Arctic changes systematically, then we may see rapid changes in ice cover and the local climate.\nWhat can such tiny air particles teach us about global warming? \nAir particles are a key component of the Arctic environment, a complex and rapidly changing system. Studying them is difficult, however, because they act in so many different ways: they can affect clouds, warm or cool the air, melt ice, lead to changes in the biosphere, and the list goes on. If this were not enough, these effects are subtle yet ongoing in ever-changing processes. This opportunity to go to the Arctic and precisely characterize the sources, properties and functions of Arctic aerosol is critically important for our ability to understand current and future changes in the region and around the world.\nForty scientists head to Greenland to study climate change\nThe Arctic ice sheet has been melting at unprecedented rates as a result of global warming. The Greenland Circumnavigation Expedition (GLACE) is a unique opportunity for researchers to study this rapidly changing environment. The expedition will depart from Kiel, Germany on 30 July 2019 and return to the same port on 29 September 2019.\nGLACE is a scientific expedition organized by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI), which is based at EPFL and supported by the Swiss Polar Foundation. The expedition’s integrated scientific program consists of 15 research projects selected by an international panel of scientists. Six of the projects – in oceanography, atmospheric sciences and ecology – will be Swiss-run. The rest will be headed by leading international scientists active in Arctic research.\nA total of 44 scientists from many different countries will spend two months on the Russian research vessel \nAkademik Treshnikov\n. The ship will land at six \nsites around Greenland, allowing the scientists to carry out their research on land, on the ice and along the coastline. They will have access to remote and understudied areas. A nuclear-powered icebreaker will support the research vessel along the North Greenland coast, breaking the thick multi-year ice.

{"id": 1418, "text": "Researchers from EPFL and MIT have shown that human mobility is a major factor in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue even over short intra-city distances. In a paper published in Scientific Reports, the team compares different mobility models and concludes that having access to mobile phone location data can prove crucial in understanding disease transmission dynamics – and, ultimately, in stopping an outbreak from evolving into an epidemic. Yet, according to the researchers, this kind of information is hard to come by. They recommend bringing in new legislation to fill a legal void and enable scientists, NGOs and political decision-makers to access people’s phone location data for public health purposes. \n“Urbanization, mobility, globalization and climate change could be all factors in the emergence of vector-borne diseases, even here in Europe,” explains Emanuele Massaro, the paper’s lead author and a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS), which is led by Claudia R. Binder. “Until now, most research has examined how mobility affects the spread of infections in larger areas such as countries or regions. In this study, we focused on the same question, but this time in towns and cities. We also wanted to explore when people’s mobile phone location data might prove useful.”\nThe authors studied the interplay between human mobility and the 2013 and 2014 dengue outbreaks in Singapore. They found that even low levels of mobility can cause the epidemic to spread, underscoring the need for an effective spatial distribution model. \nDengue is a viral disease carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. It occurs in the tropics and subtropics, and is particularly prevalent in rural areas and poor urban communities. Symptoms include headache and fever, and mortality rates vary from 1% when treated to as high as 20% when left untreated. According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold worldwide over the past 50 years. Some 3.9 billion people in 128 countries – almost half of the world’s population – are exposed to the virus.\nComparing models\n The researchers used an agent-based transmission model in which humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents that go through the epidemic stages of dengue. Using digital simulations, they compared how the system responded to an outbreak against actual reported cases from 2013 and 2014 in Singapore, where a further spike in cases has been recorded this year. \n The team then compared four different mobility models, each using different datasets: mobile phone location data, census records, random mobility, and theoretical assumptions. In each model, citizens were assigned two locations – home and work – as places they visit daily and could potentially become infected. The mobile phone model was based on anonymized device data sourced from a Singaporean mobile operator, using call, text and other activity records to pinpoint users’ home and work addresses. \nUseful during an outbreak\n The researchers demonstrated that the mobile phone data and census models were effective at predicting the spatial distribution of dengue cases in Singapore, and that such data could be obtained without infringing on people’s privacy. Their findings invite further discussion about the merits and drawbacks of using mobile phone data to model disease outbreaks, as well as other potential applications. “In an emergency, having accurate information makes all the difference,” says Massaro. “That’s why phone location data is better than annual census records. The problem is that the data is owned by private companies. We need to think seriously about changing the law around accessing this kind of information – not just for scientific research, but for wider prevention and public health reasons.” \nThe team’s model could equally be applied to other vector-borne diseases, which, led by malaria, together account for 17% of all infectious diseases. The UN estimates that over 80% of the world’s population is exposed to at least one vector-borne disease, with over 50% exposed to two or more.", "summary": "A new EPFL and MIT study into the interplay between mobility and the 2013 and 2014 dengue outbreaks in Singapore has uncovered a legal void around access to mobile phone data – information that can prove vital in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.", "claim": "A new EPFL and MIT study into the interplay between mobility and the this year and 2014 dengue outbreaks in Singapore has uncovered a legal void around access to mobile phone data – information that can prove vital in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [13, 14], "noise": false}
{"id": 1425, "text": "Solar cookers – or solar-powered ovens – can be used to cook foods at low temperatures (60–120°C) for anywhere from 30 minutes up to four hours. This makes them perfect for a range of dishes, such as potatoes, vegetables, rice, stews and even cupcakes. EPFL scientists have been working on an enhanced version of the conventional solar cooker since 2018. In research that appeared in Solar Energy, the scientists show how their design can operate in Switzerland’s sunniest areas, such as Valais Canton, for 240 days per year – or two thirds of the year. And in the country’s cloudiest areas (such as Zurich), it can operate for 155 days per year, a figure that surprised even the researchers.\nThe scientists in question work at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB). But how did building experts come to be interested in cookers? “It all started with a chocolate cake – and it’ll all end with a chocolate cake,” says Andreas Schüler, a research associate at LESO-PB. One day, Olivia Bouvard – a scientist at the lab – arrived at work with a cake she’d baked in a solar cooker. That got her colleagues interested in how these devices work. They ordered one from Solemyo, an association based in Geneva, and began to reverse-engineer its design. \nLike a miniature building \n “A solar cooker is actually like a tiny building with glazed facades,” says Schüler. Which is right up his alley, since he has been working on advanced window-glazing technology for the past few years. Schüler and his colleagues at LESO-PB made improvements to the size of the cooker they’d ordered and added more glazing – using, of course, their innovative type of glass. That boosted the amount of sunlight entering the cooker, but it did not increase the amount of heat loss, thanks to their glass’s superior insulating properties. The scientists worked with the Swiss Design Center to create a prototype of their model, and they filed for a patent in 2018. Then, using an EPFL Enable grant and an ENAC InnoSeed grant awarded the same year, they teamed up with TZ Menuiserie SA – a carpentry firm based in Valais – to manufacture ten prototypes.\nThe EPFL model is designed specifically for Switzerland. In addition to glass, it uses pine wood and is surrounded with aluminum to reflect and guide the sun’s rays. The cooker’s shape and glazing are engineered to create a “sunlight trap” so that it doesn’t have to be moved during cooking to follow the sun’s rays. With dimensions of 33 cm x 33 cm, it is large enough to hold a standard casserole dish. “We also looked into the idea of creating a collapsible, portable cooker, along with a fold-up casserole dish, that people could use when they go hiking or to the beach,” says Schüler, who himself is a proud owner of one of the prototypes. \n“We believe our cooker could help reduce the load on Switzerland’s power grid during the peak lunch and evening hours. Cooking is the third-biggest use of household power in Switzerland, behind heating systems and water boilers. With our cooker, you could put all the ingredients in before going to work, for example, and have a meal ready for you when you get home – without using gas or electricity,” says Schüler. \nDesigns for other countries, too \n The method for calculating how many days a year the solar cooker could work was developed by Dasaraden Mauree, an LESO-PB scientist specialized in modelling techniques. “We combined climatic data for Switzerland with our cooker’s operating data to develop a mathematical model that can subsequently be used for any other region in the world,” says Mauree. The scientists tested their model by collecting data from their cooker over one month, on the roof of their lab, and comparing the data with the model’s predictions. In addition to validating the model, these tests showed that their solar cooker, when equipped with aluminum reflectors, can deliver 55% more cooking days per year than the same cooker without reflectors. \nToday the scientists are working on further increasing their cooker’s efficiency and on making it a “smart cooker” by incorporating an app that would let users monitor the oven when they’re not at home and that would send an alert when a meal is ready. They are also thinking about adjusting their design so it can be used in other countries through a technology-transfer approach. “We’ve had Master’s students work with us on this project, and their ideas and enthusiasm really helped us move it forward. We owe them a lot!” says Schüler. Now they can apply the lessons learned while developing the cooker to their research on making buildings tighter. So after shifting their focus from buildings to cookers, the researchers can now apply what they learned on cookers to buildings.\nJérémy Fleury, Dasaraden Mauree, Andreas Schüler and Olivia Bouvard. © Alain Herzog / EPFL", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a glass-paneled solar cooker that delivers exceptional performance.

Born in Ticino in 1943, he studied architecture in Venice in the late 1960s and – like many architects of his generation – made a name for himself building villas for wealthy families. We spoke with him while he was on campus this November to give a talk at the “\nHabiter la modernité : villas de style internationales sur la Riviera vaudoise\n” [“Living in Modernity: International Style Villas in the Swiss Riviera”] exhibition held by EPFL’s Modern Architecture Archives Department (ACM) at the Archizoom exhibit hall.\nEarly on in your career, you said that a home should be a shelter, like a “mother’s womb.” Is building these types of villas still feasible in Switzerland today?\nIt’s true that land isn’t used in the same way as it was, and we therefore can’t build villas like we used to. Lifestyles have changed and we need to pay attention to the collective values governing how land is managed. But the expression “home sweet home” is just as valid as it ever was. We all need a shelter, a safe haven where we feel at peace yet connected to a larger community. And I still believe a home should be a womb where we can rest and replenish our strength, ready to face a new day. The challenge faced by architects is finding a way to create spaces that give users greater enjoyment – while fitting those spaces within the contradictions of today’s society.\nYou helped found the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture in 1996 and served as its dean from 2002 to 2003 and 2011 to 2013. What makes your Academy different from other architecture schools? \nFirst of all, we called it an “Academy” because we wanted to distinguish it from technical schools. We believe architects should be trained more in the human sciences than in technical fields, so that they can address the complicated challenges facing modern society and the rapid pace of change in land use. The human sciences should be the cornerstone of architectural work, as it was during the Italian Renaissance. We want our architectural students to be the ones who point out problems instead of providing solutions – they’ll learn how to come up with solutions later, when they start working. In our view, a school’s role is to teach students how to identify problems.\nWhat advice would you give architecture students?\nArchitects need time and a lot of experience before they can master their trade. So I’d tell students to be patient. I’d also give them the advice that my mentor, Louis Kahn, gave me when I graduated with my architecture degree: there are three things you must do to become a good architect: work, work and work.\nWould you say there’s a typically Swiss architectural style, like there is a French or American style?\nThe construction process is more complicated here than in other countries, due to Switzerland’s 26 cantons. But all Swiss buildings are built with the same two goals in mind – to be sturdy and to last. Those are important values here.\nYou often say that of all your work, your favorite is the San Giovanni Battista church in Mogno, in the canton of Ticino – your very first religious building.\nYes, it’s my first love! Designing this church showed me the strengths and fundamental elements of the architectural construct. Even though it’s a place of worship, I was able to explore secular themes, such as the importance of gravity, of light and of the threshold separating the interior from the exterior. Building a church helped me understand all of that.\nYour portfolio of architectural work is quite impressive. Is there any kind of building you haven’t yet done but would like to do?\nI’d really like to create a monastery. That’s the ideal city because every building is built in response to a spiritual need. Residents are there because it’s a life choice they have made. They need to be surrounded by the beauty, nature and landscapes that inspire study and introspection. And, just like cities, monasteries provide services and have areas for recreation. They are at once tucked away in the country and a centralized workplace.

{"id": 1439, "text": "Switzerland’s very first Certificates of Open Studies (COSs) were handed out this past Thursday at a ceremony at EPFL. These certificates were granted to participants who completed a new continuing education program that the school has made available to anyone, with no previous degrees required. “These first COSs mark a major step forward for our school. We had to fight to get this program off the ground because nobody thought it could work. We met with a lot of resistance – but we believe that education is a lifelong endeavor,” said Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at the ceremony on Thursday. He handed out the certificates alongside Marcel Salathé and Laura Downhower, the academic director and executive director, respectively, of the EPFL Extension School. They too worked hard to roll out the new program. “This is a historic moment for EPFL,” said Salathé.\nThe currently offers COSs in two areas – Applied Data Science: Machine Learning and Web Application Development. The courses are given online and participants get personalized feedback from their instructors and can request a videoconference. To obtain the certificate, participants must plan, carry out and present a significant individual project showing that they have acquired all the requisite skills.\n“In a fast-moving field like IT, you have to continually refresh your skills. I usually learn new things on my own,” said Germain Hugon, an electrician by training who currently works as an IOS-Web Developer. “But when it came to machine learning, there were some concepts I was having trouble grasping. That’s why I decided to take an online course. And I selected EPFL’s program since the school is nearby.” Hugon, the father of two small children, completed the COS program in eight months while continuing to work at his regular job. “That required a big commitment since it’s a demanding program. I think my family is happy that I’ve finished!” he says. Hugon doesn’t have a university degree so is happy to have the EPFL certificate in his pocket.\nParticipants from a variety of backgrounds\n21-year-old Valentin Kaelin is also a COS program graduate without a university degree. “I had three months free before starting my civil service, and I’ve always been interested in web development. This program is really well designed with lots of exercises. And the certificate will look good on my CV,” he says. With its new program, the EPFL Extension School aims to encourage people to learn more about digital technology, enable existing professionals to refresh their skills or change careers, and help job-seekers find employment. Zuriati Balion, who holds a Bachelor’s degree in information technology, is a stay-at-home mom proud to have completed the COS program – especially after all the late nights of studying. “I want to return to work and I hope this certificate will help,” she says.\nThe 20-odd graduates of this first year of the COS program come from a variety of backgrounds and ages. Philippe Terrier, who holds a PhD in biomedical engineering and works as a research scientist on clinical trials, takes an avid interest in continuing education. So when he saw the new program on offer at EPFL, he jumped at the chance. “The program was really intense, but it’s good to be able to walk away with a diploma recognized by EPFL.”\nMany other students pointed to this benefit of the program, especially since those who complete it earn 15 ECTS credits. Daniel Müller, who worked as a doctor before an accident forced him to change careers, has discovered a talent for IT. He wrote a program that can predict the amount of solar power a station will generate based on weather forecasts. “The program works – I tested it out on my own solar panels. Some of the exercises and projects we had to do were quite challenging, but the important thing is we learned a lot. I plan to get a COS in another field next year,” he says. In 2019, the EPFL Extension School will add a third COS option – Applied Data Science: Communication and Visualization.", "summary": "Last fall, EPFL introduced a new continuing education program whereby participants earn a Certificate of Open Studies (COS) – the only one of its kind in Switzerland.

{"id": 1440, "text": "Mid-sized cities around the world are facing a real threat of decline in their downtown areas, and Switzerland is no exception. EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) was commissioned by the Neuchâtel branch of Cobaty, an international building-industry association, to study possible options for the future of downtown Neuchâtel. The researchers were asked to find concrete urban solutions that would ensure downtown Neuchâtel remains vibrant and attractive. We spoke with Emmanuel Rey, an architect and urban planning expert and the head of LAST, who just published a book on this project.\nHow are the challenges faced by downtown Neuchâtel typical of those faced by other European cities?\n The areas surrounding mid-sized cities are growing and expanding, but paradoxically, their downtowns are at a standstill, losing their energy and vitality. That means downtowns must increasingly compete with suburbs to attract residential, cultural and business activity. These cities are also grappling with costs that exceed their spending capacity – yet they struggle to raise funds and generate enthusiasm for renovation projects. But many of their public spaces, especially pedestrian areas, are partially obsolete because they were designed with a car-centric vision of city life.\nIn your book, you give three strategies that cities can adopt to revitalize their downtown. What are they? \n Becoming the home of a prestigious building or high profile social or cultural event, like the Théâtre de Carouge or the Images Vevey Festival, can help rejuvenate a city by giving it a strong identity and character. Bilbao is often cited as a prime example: its once desolate downtown area was turned around completely by the opening of the Guggenheim Museum. Another strategy is to build housing in strategic areas and using innovative architecture – such as urban villas, apartments with rooftop gardens and residential buildings with novel features. An example here would be the recently completed Kalkbreite cooperative, which is a multigenerational housing complex in Zurich. And the third strategy is to renovate public spaces and promote green transportation. This is where we see the biggest gap between city residents’ expectations and what mid-sized cities currently offer. Downtown Sion, which has been remodeled to allow cars and pedestrians to coexist peacefully, is an example of this type of strategy.\nWhat approach did you take for the city of Neuchâtel?\n Cobaty – which is an international association of individuals and organizations involved in construction, urban planning and the environment, and that aims to improve the quality of today’s buildings – gave us free rein on this project. But we didn’t want to outline a utopian vision. Based on a Master’s project being carried out at our lab, we developed projections looking one generation ahead – that is, to the 2030s–2040s. We first had to redraw the contours of the city’s downtown, because by then it will extend well beyond the historical center and probably stretch from the tram yard in the west to Microcity, EPFL’s Neuchâtel campus, in the east. That’s what’s now called the greater downtown area. Then we identified the city’s main points of interest, which attract lots of people: the Ecoparc district near the train station, the university, Microcity, the Jeunes-Rives park and La Maladière stadium. Even though these sites are relatively close to each other, it’s not easy for pedestrians to get from one to another. Obstacles arising from road traffic make moving between them on foot less appealing. Then we looked at projects already underway and ideas that people had brought up, even casually, and decided to use some of them.\nA main pillar of your recommendations for Neuchâtel is extending the lakeshore tram line (Littorail) by 2030...\n We believe this tram line could become the backbone of a revitalized downtown. Our idea is to build attractive public spaces around the new tram stops, and to replace the underground link between Place Pury and the lakeshore with an above-ground one. Investing in this rail-line expansion would also enable the city to create new hubs, such as at Quai Philippe Godet and Rue de la Pierre-à-Mazel, with innovative residential buildings and spaces for shops, offices and cultural activities.\nWhat additional measures do you think the city should take alongside the extended rail line?\n Neuchâtel could use the opportunity created by building the new transportation infrastructure to make green transportation seamless across the city center, thereby making it more attractive. It could also build more housing in the downtown area. Other options would be to build park-and-ride stations around the city limits and create 30 km/h zones along the tram line so that different transportation methods can function smoothly and effectively side by side. In our approach we talk about urban “intensity” rather than “density,” since density is often purely quantitative. Our research aims to not only increase the urban density of Neuchâtel, but also enhance its quality of life and make it easier for people to meet and make the most of their city under the best possible conditions. And our approach can obviously be applied to other European cities of the same size.\nReference\nIntensities Urbaines: Une vision prospective pour le centre-ville de Neuchâtel\n, \npreface by Thierry Oppikofer, Federal President of Cobaty\n, \nLausanne: EPFL, Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies, 2017, 78 pages.\nA copy of the book can be obtained from Cobaty at", "summary": "Downtown areas of mid-sized cities are facing a growing challenge in maintaining their appeal.

{"id": 1442, "text": "One out of two CHESS satellites\nDesigning a satellite and launching it into space is no run-of-the-mill project. Rather, it’s one that forever marks the early careers of the students who take part – just ask the EPFL students who designed the SwissCube, a 1U CubeSat (a small standardized unit measuring 10 cm x 10 cm) launched in 2009. Today, a new group of students, the EPFL Spacecraft Team, is taking on a new challenge. With the support of the EPFL Space Center (eSpace), they are developing a constellation of two satellites, called CHESS, that will be launched in two years. The team is currently seeking additional members and sponsors.\nThis ambitious project has already signed on six universities, three companies, 15 professors and 53 students.* The two satellites will work in concert; each one will be a 3U CubeSat bearing primary and secondary payloads. They will orbit at different altitudes – one will travel in a circular orbit at the low altitude of around 550 km, and the other will travel in an elliptic orbit at an altitude oscillating between 400 km and 1,000 km. The constellation will be launched in March 2023 and remain in flight for at least two years.\nThis project will give the students who participate each year a chance to learn about complicated space technology and gain experience working on a cross-disciplinary team. “It’s a way to learn the real-world skills required in our industry, like team management, coordination, communication and fundraising,” says Emmanuelle David, the deputy director of eSpace. “These are skills you can’t learn only from a book. And they will let the students become operational as soon as they start their first job or when and if they decide to start their own business.”\nOne satellite will be placed in a circular orbit at around 550 km, while the other will travel in an elliptic orbit between 400 km and 1,000 km.\nUnderstanding the exosphere’s chemistry\nIn addition to giving students valuable experience, the CHESS mission will have several other objectives. The first is scientific. As the two satellites orbit around the Earth, they will collect detailed information about the exosphere – the outermost layer of the atmosphere, starting at 400 km above the planet’s surface. Since the satellites will follow separate orbits, they will collect complementary spatial and temporal datasets.\n“The last time this layer of the atmosphere was analyzed in detail was nearly 40 years ago,” says Dr. Rico Fausch, a physicist at the University of Bern’s Space Research & Planetary Sciences Department. “So these updated data will be very useful in helping us better understand the exosphere’s chemistry and how it has changed over time, especially in light of global warming. They will also let us check whether the upper layers of the atmosphere are indeed cooling as recent studies have suggested – which would be another direct consequence of the accumulation of greenhouse gases around our planet.”\nThe satellites will collect detailed data on the various gases in the exosphere – nitrogen, oxygen, ozone, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, etc. – and their isotopes. The overall goal is to study temperature fluctuations, the processes and mechanisms by which atmospheric gases escape into space, and how many free-floating electrons and ions there are in the exosphere. Molecules are much harder to find at high altitudes than low ones, since individual particles collide and bind together much more slowly.\nTechnological advancements\nThe CHESS mission also aims to spur technological innovation. The satellites will be equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, such as the new mass spectrometers being developed jointly by the University of Bern and the company Spacetek Technology AG – two pioneers in this field. The spectrometers will be used to identify specific compounds and their chemical structures by taking mass measurements, and will be lighter and more efficient than the ones used back in the 1980s.\nNew technologies will be tested thanks to the CHESS mission.\nThe satellites will also feature next-generation Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers that are lighter, less expensive, and more accurate than existing models. These receivers are being developed jointly by ETH Zurich and u-blox. They will not only record extremely precise data on the satellites’ positions (on the order of ±1 cm), but also measure air density and the number of free-floating electrons. In addition, the CHESS mission will perform \nin situ\n tests of a new kind of solar panel designed specifically for spacecraft, based on technology developed at RUAG. And because the two satellites will send radio communications to ground stations, they will help create a Swiss-wide X-band network – a communications network using an ultra-high-frequency radio band.\nSwitzerland’s growing space industry \n“I was lucky enough to work with the team that designed, built and launched SwissCube – which is still operational today, some 11 years later,” says Muriel Richard, an aerospace engineer and the co-founder & CTO of ClearSpace. “I’ve been following the CHESS project closely for the past two years, and I see that these students are just as skilled, smart and motivated – and are worth believing in and investing in. They’ll send these satellites into orbit, that’s for sure!”\nCHESS forms part of a broader trend of growing interest in space-industry R&D, both at EPFL and in Switzerland as a whole. The project will help train the next generation of aerospace engineers, pull together skills from a wide range of fields, expand the existing space-industry network and forge ties among the scientific community.\n*\nPartner organizations\n: University of Bern, Hochschule Luzern, HES-SO Valais-Wallis, ETH Zurich, Haute École ARC, Spacetek, u-blox and RUAG\nPresskit\n: \nIllustrations\n:\n ©E.Nardini /EPFL Spacecraft Team", "summary": "The EPFL Spacecraft Team has set itself the ambitious goal of launching two satellites by 2023.

{"id": 1446, "text": "“Where is He who has been born King of the Jews, who has just been born? For we saw His star when it rose…” The Gospel according to Matthew is the only one to mention the presence of a bright star that guided the Three Magi to the stable where Jesus was born. This statement is the starting point for our inquiry: was there an extraordinary astronomical phenomenon around year 1 that could be identified with the biblical text?\nThe Bible itself already provides a few clues. Firstly, we can read that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod. Yet, the latter died shortly after a lunar eclipse which happened in the year 4 B.C. Secondly, the census commanded by Cesar, and which was the reason Marie and Joseph fled toward Bethlehem, took place in the year 8 B.C. Thus Jesus’ birth is calculated as being between years 8 B.C. and 4 B.C.\nDid something extraordinary happen in the sky during those four years?\nA supernova, a violent explosion of a star at the end of its life, could provide a good explanation. Unfortunately, these explosions are very rare in our galaxy, and do not remain visible for very long – just two to three weeks. And yet the legend states that the Magi set off after they had observed a luminous phenomenon. They observed the same phenomenon a few weeks later in the sky over Jerusalem, which guided them toward Bethlehem. The unique characteristic of a supernova gives little credence to this hypothesis – it’s estimated that there are only three per century in our galaxy.\nComets have the advantage of coming back in a recurrent manner, since they orbit around the sun. It is a spectacular event which could therefore have made an impact on observers. Besides, according to some Chinese texts, two comets were visible to the naked eye in 5 B.C. and 4 B.C. But if the Christmas star was indeed a comet, why not describe it as such?The scriptures make clear reference to a star, discrediting the theory of the comet.\nThere remains the hypothesis of a conjunction: that is, the apparent convergence of two bodies in the sky. When two planets are practically in the same line of vision, the eye is no longer capable of distinguishing them, and only sees one object, but brighter. A simple astronomic calendar software enables us to see that during the year 7 B.C it was possible to observe, on three occasions, conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn. These triple conjunctions are particularly rare. In the year 7 B.C., they happened on May 29, October 6 and December 1. At the time of the first conjunction, the Magi would have set off on their journey, at the second, they would have visited King Herod, and at the third, they would have been guided toward Jesus in Bethlehem. Should we celebrate Christmas on 1 December?\nWe are left with a fourth hypothesis, perhaps the most credible – the Christmas Star never existed and all this is just a charming legend.", "summary": "Is the Christmas star, that is believed to have guided the Three Kings to Jesus, a scientific reality?

{"id": 1448, "text": "Whether arriving by car - driver or passenger - train, motorcycle, bicycle, on foot or by a combination of any of such means, people attending the Paleo festival arrive in high spirits. Departure is sometimes a little less exciting, but overall about 90% of music lovers are satisfied with their evening in terms of transportation. This was revealed by an internet survey conducted in 2012 by the Laboratory of Urban Sociology (LaSUR) at EPFL and coordinated by EPFL’s Transportation Center.\n In the month following the festival, the survey was conducted on nearly 4,000 participants -enlisted as they purchased their electronic ticket- and on Paleo newsletter subscribers. It reveals that over a third (36%) of festival-goers makes use of public transport to get to the festival venue, of which a 4% combine it with the use of a car. For returning, the same amount of people used public transport, but twice of them (9%) combined it with a car. Both ways, there is a 37% of people behind the wheel, while 19% are passengers.\n In general, speed and cost are the most important factors when choosing a mode of transport. As for Paleo, they play a secondary role. In this case, the key factors are its flexible hours (for 80% of drivers and 71% of passengers), alcohol consumption (for 39% of public transport users) and environmental concerns (for 36.5% of public transport users). \"It’s important to add that Paleo offers exceptional accessibility conditions compared to other cultural and sporting events,\" said Emmanuel Ravalet, scientific collaborator at EPFL and author of the work: \"It is so rare to find parking spaces near the site.\"\n The survey also shows that the average journey time is 68 minutes plus 4.6 minutes of ticket control. On average, spectators take 12.7 minutes to exit the concerts’ location and 12.6 minutes to totally leave the festival site, its parking lot or the train station.\nAt least one empty place in three quarters of the vehicles\n One of the aims of this study was to scientifically validate some figures and trends. It also intended to assess the actual possibility of limiting the crowding of the Nyon-St-Cergue train that serves the festival and to encourage carpooling. \"With a satisfaction rate of 90% for outbound trips and 87% when returning home, there is little incentive to change,\" said the researcher. Even crowded, the Nyon-St-Cergue service remains attractive.\n As for carpooling, the survey confirms that it is already taking place, with an average occupancy rate of 2.87 persons per vehicle. But even if Paleo encourages rationalizing the use of private vehicles, trips are mainly shared by friends or family members. Three out of four festival-goers have already taken passengers, but trips with strangers only account for 4% of the current carpool tendencies. So, even though the majority (75%) of vehicles counts with least one place available, the car-sharing potential specifically concerns the remaining quarter of drivers who do not practice it. The main obstacles mentioned are the reluctance to wait or causing to wait and the lack of warranties.", "summary": "Appointed by the Paleo Festival, EPFL has carried out a survey on the event’s accessibility.

The ship’s arrival in this small city, at the southern tip of South America, marked the end of the expedition’s second leg. The \nTreshnikov\n left Cape Town, South Africa at the end of December on a 90-day voyage around Antarctica. The ship is carrying 50 international researchers who are conducting 22 research projects.\nThe second leg of the journey, which began on 22 January in Hobart, Australia, was action-packed and filled with scientific discoveries. It’s the only leg with a stop on the continent itself, on the Mertz Glacier. This glacier lies to the east of Antarctica, and its tongue reaches into the Southern Ocean – where an 80-kilometer-long chunk of ice broke off in 2010.\nWhile some teams took ice cores on top of the glacier in order to find out more about our climate’s history (owing to the presence of gases and other particles), others had a look at the glacier’s underbelly. Operating a submersible equipped with cameras and robotic arms, the researchers saw what was hidden below the glacier tongue and collected various samples. By analyzing these organisms – sponges, plankton, brittle stars and krill, to name just a few – scientists hope to learn more about how these ecosystems evolve and adapt to climate change.\nThe researchers also ventured onto several totally uninhabited islands, including the Balleny Islands and tiny Scott Island, where they took numerous samples and conducted both cartographical and ornithological surveys.\nAll did not go as planned during this leg, however. The scheduled stop on Macquarie Island was cancelled because of a storm, and the visit to Peter I Island had to be cut short. To make up for this, an impromptu stop was made on Siple Island, a volcanic island located close to the continent and partly embedded in its ice. This island is rarely visited and not well documented, which made the measurements and samples taken there even more valuable.\nOne more leg, three more islands \nThe \nTreshnikov\n reached Punta Arenas on Wednesday and will head back to sea tomorrow for the third and final leg of the expedition. The submersible is no longer on board, and there are no plans to stop on the continent. Most of the projects will nevertheless continue: visits to three subantarctic islands will give the researchers plenty of opportunities to take both ocean and land measurements.\nThe first island, South Georgia, is the largest of the three to be visited. This mountainous island is a British territory. The second island is actually a group of volcanic islands: the Sandwich Islands. The flora and fauna on these two sites are of significant scientific interest, and these islands are important nesting grounds for many bird species.\nThe third stop will be on Bouvet Island, a Norwegian dependency. This 50-square-kilometer island, entirely covered in ice, is one of the most remote places on earth. It is inhabited by elephant and other seals, birds and penguins and can only be reached by helicopter.\nOn 19 March, the ACE expedition will reach Cape Town, completing its trip around Antarctica. But the work will not stop there. A recap of the expedition and preliminary scientific results will be presented to the press the following day.

{"id": 1451, "text": "We could have sworn that the profession of elevator operator was gone. At worst, we pictured a bellboy in an elevator in a luxury hotel in Mumbai. Yet, the profession comes back to life in what could become a means of transport as popular as the one inaugurated in New York on 23 March 1857. Since 17 April the EPFL campus is a life-size laboratory for testing autonomous shuttles as part of the European CityMobil2 project. There is no driver but there is a bellboy. Welcome aboard!\nLet us be clear: for the moment, the main motivation of the shuttles’ users is curiosity. Passengers can neither go very far nor very fast. The proposed route connects the M1 line stop at the Innovation Park, the Esplanade parking lot, the Rolex Learning Center, the Starling Hotel and the Estudiantines student residence. \"It was the only possible route on campus that does not disturb the traffic and which avoids construction sites\" explains our groom.\nDuring this first phase of testing, it takes 20 minutes to cover a distance of about 1’500 meters. Unless the passenger leaves the Starling hotel with 3 suitcases in the pouring rain, this formula has only a purely scientific interest. The turns of the itinerary require a safe speed and even during the few tens of meters of straight route the vehicles cannot use all their power: they are limited for security reasons.\nWhy a bellboy?\n The mystery remains: why a bellboy in a driverless bus? In addition to being polite and answering questions, the bellboy is a complement to a developing technology. When leaving each stop, he presses the button to close the doors. This is an essential security gesture, followed by the sounding of a bell and a gentle start. Just like in the good old days! Except for the shuttle’s cutting edge technology. For each identified hazard, the vehicle slows down and sometimes even weeds and daisies unnecessarily activate its corner radars. Passersby also test its reflexes, honed by a radar on the roof. Although the vehicle can go faster, it is not the testers’ current intention. The technology is being tried: so far there are no accidents to report.\nInside the vehicle, it is possible to follow the path, already mapped on a large screen, and see through the eyes of the radars. Small red dots highlight potential obstacles whereas a continuous line marks the trail left by a cyclist. Suddenly the shuttle stops, stubborn as a mule. A large truck stands before it. \"It is not yet able to go around obstacles,\" explains the modern times elevator operator. Without hesitation, he takes the vehicle’s controls and asks the truck’s driver to move his 26 tons. Once the way is open, he returns the controls to the electric vehicle and the journey resumes.\nThere are between 150 and 200 curious passengers per day using the shuttle for this quick getaway. The same must have happened in the old days when people would use the elevator just \"to see how it is.\" It's fun, entertaining, and innovative. One feels a bit like a pioneer whose grandchildren will say one day: \"When Grandma was young buses still needed drivers.\"\nPublic transport on demand\n Behind its casual appearance, this life test unique in its kind is a step towards the future. \"It aims to develop a piece of software that enables to manage a fleet of autonomous vehicles in real time from a control center,\" said Raphael Gindrat, CEO of the BestMile start-up, collaborating with the project. This promises interesting applications such as in airports, campuses, industrial centers, recreational parks or even for public transport on demand.\nApart from the technology developed by EPFL’s start-up, CityMobil2 is interested in the sociological and legal aspects related to vehicles without drivers. The passengers willing to share their impressions are invited to answer a questionnaire and report their \"user experience.\" By testing the autonomy, responsiveness, speed, security and various other parameters, they will also help to establish a framework for the laws required for public transportation without drivers.", "summary": "Since April 17, driverless vehicles roam the EPFL campus.

{"id": 1452, "text": "Paralysis of an arm and/or leg is one of the most common effects of a stroke. But thanks to research carried out by scientists at the Defitech Foundation Chair in Brain-Machine Interface, in association with other members of EPFL’s Center for Neuroprothetics, the Clinique Romande de Réadaptation in Sion, and the Geneva University Hospitals, stroke victims may soon be able to recover greater use of their paralyzed limbs. The scientists’ pioneering approach brings together two known types of therapies – a brain-computer interface (BCI) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) – and has been published in \nNature Communications\n.\n“The key is to stimulate the nerves of the paralyzed arm precisely when the stroke-affected part of the brain activates to move the limb, even if the patient can’t actually carry out the movement. That helps reestablish the link between the two nerve pathways where the signal comes in and goes out,” says José del R. Millán, who holds the Defitech Chair at EPFL.\nTwenty-seven patients aged 36 to 76 took part in the clinical trial. All had a similar lesion that resulted in moderate to severe arm paralysis following a stroke occurring at least ten months earlier. Half of the patients were treated with the scientists’ dual-therapy approach and reported clinically significant improvements. The other half were treated only with FES and served as a control group.\nFor the first group, the scientists used a BCI system to link the patients’ brains to computers using electrodes. That let the scientists pinpoint exactly where the electrical activity occurred in the brain tissue when the patients tried to reach out their hands. Every time that the electrical activity was identified, the system immediately stimulated the arm muscle controlling the corresponding wrist and finger movements. The patients in the second group also had their arm muscles stimulated, but at random times. This control group enabled the scientists to determine how much of the additional motor-function improvement could be attributed to the BCI system.\nReactivated tissue \nThe scientists noted a significant improvement in arm mobility among patients in the first group after just ten one-hour sessions. When the full round of treatment was completed, some of the first-group patients’ scores on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment – a test used to evaluate motor recovery among patients with post-stroke hemiplegia – were over twice as high as those of the second group.\n“Patients who received the BCI treatment showed more activity in the neural tissue surrounding the affected area. Due to their plasticity, they could help make up for the functioning of the damaged tissue,” says Millán.\nElectroencephalographies (EEGs) of the patients clearly showed an increase in the number of connections among the motor cortex regions of their damaged brain hemisphere, which corresponded with the increased ease in carrying out the associated movements. What’s more, the enhanced motor function didn’t seem to diminish with time. Evaluated again 6–12 months later, the patients hadn’t lost any of their recovered mobility.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have shown that combining a brain-computer interface (BCI) with functional electrical stimulation (FES) can help stroke victims recover greater use of their paralyzed arm – even years after the stroke.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have shown that combining a brain-computer interface (BCI) with functional electrical stimulation (FES) can help stroke victims recover greater use of their paralyzed arm – even at least ten months earlier after the stroke.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [34, 38], "noise": false}

The students are provided with housing around Lausanne, and are offered some financial support. The SRP usually runs from the beginning of July to the end of August, when each student presents a poster at the Closing Symposium of the results they obtained from their individual research project.\n\"I feel immense pride in witnessing the impact of such a program on these students,” says , the SRP’s Director. “Not only do they immerse fully into a top research lab but they also participate actively in workshops and seminars on themes that sharpen their ability to succeed in a research career. A vast majority of SRP alumni have found that their summer experience with us was pivotal in choosing their career path.\"\nBut it’s not only work. There is a significant social component to the SRP, which adds its own value to the overall experience.

{"id": 1455, "text": "Researchers from EPFL and the AN Bach Institute in Moscow have discovered a new and extremely promising antibiotic for tuberculosis, especially effective against multi-resistant strains of the disease, which are on the rise in Eastern Europe. The drug, developed as a European FP7 project, has proven very effective against the disease. In an article published in EMBO Molecular medicine, the researchers show that, when combined with other drugs, the new antibiotic, called “PBTZ169”, can take down even the most resistant strains of tuberculosis bacteria. Following the publication, the researchers formed the IM4TB Foundation on their campus. Supported by EPFL, the foundation aims to bring the new treatment to the market. This unusual step was taken because traditionally, technology transfer from academia to the pharmaceutical industry doesn’t work well with tuberculosis: development costs are too high and the affected countries are often barely able to maintain their own healthcare infrastructures. \n With the IM4TB Foundation, EPFL intends to pick up the slack in the limitations of the industrial model. “The development of antibiotics is increasingly expensive and the countries most affected by tuberculosis are still emergent,” says Benoit Lechartier, co-author of the PBTZ169 study. “The recent closure of the AstraZeneca research center in India illustrates the extent to which it is difficult for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in infectious diseases.”\nHuman trials in 2015 \nLocated on the EPFL campus, the IM4TB Foundation plans to move onto human trials within a year, in collaboration with the University of Lausanne Hospitals (CHUV). \n PBTZ169 shows much promise. It attacks the bacterium’s strong point – the cell wall, which forms an impenetrable shield against antibiotics and the patient’s immune system. “Our molecule makes the bacterium literally burst open,” explains Stewart Cole, director of the study and head of EPFL’s Global Health Institute. \nA cheap but formidable weapon against resistant strains \nThe researchers showed that PBTZ169 is extremely effective in tri-therapy, where it is combined with a standard drug, pyrazinamide, and a more recent one, bedaquiline – and both these drugs have already been approved by the EU and the FDA for multi-resistant strains. “This could be the winning strategy”, says Cole. “These molecules attack different targets in the bacterium. By combining them, we drastically reduce the risk that it will mutate into more resistant forms.”\n As a treatment, PBTZ169 has many advantages. It is not expensive to produce, since it is relatively easy to synthesize. Initial tests have shown good compatibility with other anti-tuberculosis treatments and it is expected to be equally compatible with antiretrovirals used to treat AIDS, as HIV-positive individuals are particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis, and cases of cross-infection are on the rise. \n This molecule is the culmination of many years of research. The preliminary versions were formidable in the laboratory, where they decimated bacteria in culture. However, their effectiveness in vivo was limited. New technologies like structural biology enabled researchers to redesign the molecule so that it could be more rapidly absorbed. “Thus we were able to improve its pharmacodynamics,” explains Cole. “Tuberculosis is often wrongly considered a disease of the past, but in order to fight it, we needed to employ 21st century technologies.”\nMore than 1.5 million deaths per year\nTuberculosis still kills more than 1.5 million people every year. It is uncommon in Europe, although certain countries such as the Ukraine are experiencing a resurgence of patients infected with multiresistant strains. The EU is leading a program that aims to eliminate the disease. The research team at EPFL that developed PBTZ169 received funding from the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission, in the framework of an international collaboration.", "summary": "Even though tuberculosis kills more than 1.5 million people every year, the market is not cost-effective for pharmaceutical companies.

Unfortunately, there are no effective therapies for unstable blood pressure after spinal cord injury”. said Dr. Aaron Phillips, co-lead author of the study (see affiliations below). “We created the first platform to understand the mechanisms underlying blood pressure instability after spinal cord injury.”\nTheir findings, published today in Nature, builds on research that has already enabled several paraplegics to walk again through epidural electrical stimulation (EES). But instead of targeting the region of the spinal cord that produces leg movements, they delivered EES in the region containing the neural circuits that regulate blood pressure. In addition, they adapted the stimulation protocol in real-time based on measurements taken by a blood-pressure monitor implanted in an artery. The monitor measures blood pressure continuously, and adapts the instructions sent to a pacemaker that in turn delivers electrical pulses over the spinal cord. The stimulation is biomimetic, since it recapitulates the natural activation of the body’s hemodynamic system. “The stimulation compensates for the broken communication line between the patient’s central nervous system and sympathetic nervous system,” says Courtine. \n© 2021 EPFL Mediacom Communication visuelle\nThe research team initially tested their method in preclinical rodent and nonhuman primate models in order to understand the mechanisms that disrupt blood pressure modulation after spinal cord injury, and to identify where and how the stimulation patterns should be applied to obtain the desired hemodynamic responses. Jocelyne Bloch, the neurosurgeon who heads the .NeuroRestore research center with Courtine and who carried out the surgical implants, was surprised at how quickly the stimulation protocol worked. “It was impressive to see the blood pressure rise to the target level immediately after the stimulation was applied,” she says.\nThe electrical stimulation treatment provided a huge relief – much more effective than medication.\nRichdeep Gill, first patient\n After these initial tests, the scientists tried their method on a human patient. \n“I suffered from daily episodes of low blood pressure, especially in the morning and evening,” says Richi, 38 years old. “But since I’ve had the implant, it happens much less often – maybe once every couple of weeks.” Himself a surgeon, Richi lost the use of all four limbs after a sport accident. “Those daily episodes of hypotension were a real burden. They also disturbed my vision and prevented me from performing even simple everyday tasks. The electrical stimulation treatment provided a huge relief – much more effective than medication.”\nOne of the physicians working with Richi, Dr. Sean Dukelow, states: “Since using this system, Richi was able to completely stop all drugs he was using to manage blood pressure instability. This has been transformative, and over the long-term may reduce Richi’s risk of cardiovascular disease.” \n The team intends to continue its research thanks to a large grant received from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

{"id": 1462, "text": "All you need to generate a little electricity is cardboard, Teflon tape and a pencil. A team from EPFL, working with researchers from the University of Tokyo, used these materials to make an 8 cm-2 device that can generate a considerable power. This is a simple, eco-friendly and inexpensive system that can operate a remote micro- sensor or system.\nIt all starts with static electricity \nThe principle underlying this system is well known: static electricity (i.e., triboelectrification effect). When two insulators like paper and teflon come into contact, they gain or lose electrons. The system is made up of two small cards, where one side of each card is covered with a graphite carbon layer by penciling. The carbon layers serve as the electrodes.\nTeflon is then applied to the opposite side of one of the cards. When brought together, they make a sandwich: two layers of carbon on the outside, then two layers of paper, and one layer of Teflon attached to one of paper cards. They are then taped together to form the arch-shaped geometry (see the video for more details), enlarging the output performance.\nBy pressing down with your finger on the system, the two insulators come into contact. This creates charges at the surfaces: positive for the paper, negative for the Teflon. When you release your finger and the cards separate, the net charges are generated on the carbon layers due to the electrostatic induction.\n To boost the device’s output, Xiao-Sheng Zhang, a postdoc at EPFL’s Microsystems Laboratory and a visiting researcher with the University of Tokyo, used a process of sandpaper imprinting. Pressing the sandpaper firmly against the cards and the Teflon tap gives them a rough surface. This increases the effective triboelectric area, which in turn improves the system’s output more than six times. If you press your finger on the cards, even at a very low rate of 1.5 times per second, the fabricated device can generate enough power to drive micro- or nano- sensors, which need only a little electricity to run\nThe first ‘TENG’ fully made with household materials \nThis type of system is quite promising since it can be constructed with everyday items. Research on the use of static electricity to generate energy, dubbed ‘TENG’ (triboelectric nanogenerator), began in 2012. “The one that we developed in the framework of this European project provides a promising novel approach to produce a remarkable power source by using natural, everyday and environmentally friendly materials,” said Jürgen Brugger, a professor at the Microsystems Laboratory. This could have applications in many fields, such as portable electronics and biomedical microsystems. Ultra low-cost sensors made of paper for various diagnostic purposes, which would be especially practical for developing countries, are already being tested. This proposed TENG shows robust output power when pressed by fingers demonstrating its use as energy harvester based on low-cost, commodity materials such as paper, Teflon and graphite. This paper system could represent the next step, since it would remove the need for conventional batteries.", "summary": "A small device made from everyday materials can generate enough energy to power several diodes.

This will all take place during a 30-minute virtual game that, according to its developers, is a cross between Pokemon Go and an escape game. For Codex D., the EPFL spin-off behind the app, this game is just the beginning; the company already plans to introduce a new scenario next spring, taking place in historical Paris.\nTo play the game at Forum EPFL, visitors simply need to install the app on their smartphone and launch it whenever they want. As they go through this virtual treasure hunt, they will learn interesting facts about each start-up’s business as well as anecdotes about them. Users will be asked questions along the way, which they can answer by photo or text. Automatic recognition programs will analyze the answers and, if they’re right, send out the next challenge.\n“This game is only the first of a whole series of adventures,” says Stefan Rotarus, one of Codex D.’s founders. He and the other founders – Jeremy Bensoussan and Paul Renauld – are already brimming with ideas. Several new scenarios are in the works, all taking place at various tourist destinations – starting with Paris in 2019. The scenarios are interactive and structured as gamebooks where the story unfolds according to choices that the user makes along the way. Codex D.’s target market is young people and techies, although a family version without time limits is also planned. The scenarios will be designed to provide a fun way of learning interesting details and anecdotes “without having to schedule a session ahead of time, as is the case with conventional escape games,” says Rotarus.\nPlayers writing their own scenarios\nJust like with any online game, the key to success is building a community. Codex D. will aim to engage with the most creative users first through an app that enables them to create their own scenarios – taking place at any location they wish – and post them online. No special programming skills required. Other users will then be able to vote on the scenarios and a ranking will gradually be established of the best ones.\nThe ideal opportunity for applying theory learned in class \nCodex D.’s founders didn’t wait until they had their EPFL degrees in hand to launch their business. Currently third-year students at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, they are big fans of escape games as well as history, programming and even philosophy. This new business venture lets them combine the skills they learned in class with their hobbies and entrepreneurial spirit.

And it’s the perfect opportunity for applying all the theory we’ve learned.”\nJust a few months after they created Codex D., they received funding from the XGrant program which also includes training for entrepreneurial-minded students. They likewise received support from the European Venture Program, which brings together universities from across Europe and gives the Codex D. founders an international perspective.\nIn late September the founders launched a crowdfunding campaign (\n) to raise the CHF 9,000 needed to design graphics for characters for their new scenarios, purchase libraries for their scenario development app, hold real-world events to expand their user community and put together advertising campaigns in Paris and eventually other cities. “We hope that this venture will give users a new way of experiencing tourism and their favorite destinations.

{"id": 1468, "text": "Rivers and riverbanks are worlds in themselves; they are teeming with a rich and varied diversity of plant and animal life. But humans are constantly modifying this environment. Enormous projects such as canals, drainage, dams, diversions, and vegetation introduction have been undertaken to reclaim land and divert or obtain access to water.\nIt is now possible to precisely measure the impact of these alterations on riparian (river zone) biodiversity. Laboratory experiments using microorganisms have demonstrated the relevance of mathematical models that analyze the evolution of populations in these specific situations. The research, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), was conducted by scientists from EPFL, EAWAG (the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology) and Princeton University.\nTheir conclusions should lead to increased caution when considering the alteration of riverbeds. The researchers showed that the observed biodiversity at a given point in the river is highly dependent on all the smaller tributaries feeding into it, and not uniquely on the specific conditions at that particular location. Channeling a branch of a tributary doesn’t just harm the fauna in that stretch of the tributary, but could have consequences on the entire river, even several kilometers downstream.\nA river network in the lab\nIn their experiment, the scientists used trays, each holding 36 boxes of culture media, into which they distributed ten different species of microorganisms (protozoans and rotifers). In one case, they removed the water and its inhabitants from one box and transferred it to another, following a “dendritic” network based on the real path of an actual river and its tributaries. In the other case, they systematically pipetted it into the four closest boxes. “The organisms chosen allowed us to observe the evolution of populations over 50-100 generations, which took a month,” explains Francesco Carrara, a PhD student in EPFL’s Ecohydrology Laboratory (ECHO) and first author on the paper.\nThe main conclusion of the research is that an evolution that follows a branched network ends up yielding a much higher variety of species at locations where waters come together. But that’s not all: populations that live close to the “sources” of each tributary also exhibit a much broader degree of diversity. According to the scientists, maintaining this rich upstream community is indispensable for the development of downstream biodiversity.\nIt is thus now proven that choking off any of these tributaries or modifying any hydrologic network could compromise the natural balance and downstream biodiversity – a fact that can no longer be ignored by anyone considering water management projects that would alter natural waterways.", "summary": "To alter natural waterways is to take a serious risk of endangering species living on the entire length of a river.

{"id": 1470, "text": "Inspired by origami, the folding drone developed by a team at EPFL and NCCR Robotics unfurls and takes off in a third of a second. The moment it is turned on, the rotors engage, the articulated arms extend and the drone begins moving. This eager device could be quickly released in large numbers over a disaster zone in order to bring back photos and establish contact with people in need.\nUsing the power of the rotors\n The arms, made of fibreglass and light inelastic polyester, fold up into the shape of a trapezoid. When not in use, they wrap horizontally around the body of the device. What sets this device apart is the ability of the arms to unfold by themselves: the force generated by the rotors causes the arms to move into place. The rotors turn in the same direction, causing the arms to rotate out the opposite way and open around two vertical folds. When the arms are fully extended, their upper section moves horizontally and locks the segment open. Small magnets hold everything in place.\nFor a quadrotor to maintain stability while in flight, two rotors diagonally across from each other need to turn clockwise while the other two spin anticlockwise. The drone must therefore reverse the spinning direction of two of the rotors before taking off. This action takes place automatically in under 50 milliseconds once a sensor has detected the arms have locked into place. This ingenious system has been patented and will be shown on 25 May at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Seattle, which will bring together some 2,000 robotics specialists.\nNatural stiffness\n This quick-starting drone, while simple in appearance, is made up of a number of well-thought-out parts. The stiffness of the arms, for example, is critical to the quadrotor’s manoeuvrability. If these parts were flexible, they could bend and vibrate while in flight, causing instability and reducing the quadrotor's response time to external commands. Stiffness in the arms is a key factor for folding, and by spreading out horizontally the arms avoid imbalances caused by the laws of gravity. There is no need for an additional reinforcing mechanism, which would add to the weight of the device.\nOne advantage of this design is that it’s reversible. “This prototype still needs to be folded by hand, but it takes less than 10 seconds for someone with practice,” said the device’s designer, Stefano Mintchev, who is already planning a version that folds up on its own.\nFuture efforts will focus on fine-tuning. This includes further reducing the weight so larger models can be developed, and strengthening the arms so they can withstand crashes. The principle of origami folding as applied by the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, headed by Dario Floreano, could very well be applied to other types of flying devices in the form of wings, a protective cage or other innovations.", "summary": "Thanks to the power of its rotors, this fold-up quadrotor extends its articulated arms and takes off in a fraction of a second.

{"id": 1473, "text": "Short and sweet. Last night, 22 entrepreneurs were given just 90 seconds each to pitch their projects to an audience of over 250 alumni and investors. Amélie Béduer, the CEO of Volumina Medical, won over the spectators and the jury with her company’s injectable implant. This biomaterial is designed to reconstruct soft tissue, following breast cancer surgery for example. It is injected with a syringe and represents a potential alternative to existing, more invasive, treatments. The product is currently in preclinical testing.\nFor these entrepreneurs, who are all in search of funding for their companies, the visibility they gained from their pitch last night was capital. The aim of this annual event, which is put together by EPFL Alumni, Innogrants (EPFL’s startup support fund) and Venturelab, is to forge ties between the School’s graduates and up-and-coming firms. It’s a networking initiative that keeps gaining momentum, based on the fact that graduates and successful entrepreneurs are investing more and more in the next generation of companies.\nBoth current and future entrepreneurs in attendance Thursday night drew inspiration from the keynote speakers. Steve Anavi, an EPFL graduate, described how he went from being an engineer to a serial entrepreneur. And Madiha Derouazi explained how she created her cancer-vaccine startup in 2012 and grew it into a company with some 15 employees – while raising 37 million francs along the way. “If you want to start a business, you need strength, endurance and boundless enthusiasm,” she said.\nFollowing the pitches, the audience shortlisted four companies: Wakeit, Resistell, Volumina Medical and SwissDeCode. The four finalists were then asked the following question: “What keeps you awake at night?” Amélie Béduer clinched victory with her response; the jury particularly appreciated her “sense of duty and responsibility.” Steve Anavi added: “What’s more, the product she is developing builds on something that exists already – and that will facilitate buy-in among users.”\nFor Béduer, this was the first time she presented her work to such a large group of people. But she has faced tougher challenges as an entrepreneur: “Time pressure is much greater in business than in academic research. In order to start bringing in money, you need to develop your product quickly and make the right decisions. There’s no margin for error. It’s also important to choose your outside partners wisely, making sure they click with your team.” Thanks to Amélie Béduer’s focus and drive, Volumina Medical is certainly on the right track.", "summary": "Yesterday evening, Volumina Medical walked away victorious at the Start-up Champion Seed Night.

{"id": 1474, "text": "This summer, 15 containers were stacked up three levels high in the parking lot between the GC and BM buildings on the EPFL campus. Intended to house the new Student Kreativity and Innovation Lab (SKIL), this structure contains a vast array of research equipment, from miniaturized electronics to large machines like laser cutters and 3D printers. A full kitchen rounds out the creative working space. SKIL is an ENAC initiative to enable students to carry out research projects they design themselves, under the guidance of the school’s professors. This academic makerspace will be inaugurated on 24 September.\nLearning from trial and error \n“During the Solar Decathlon project, we saw that our school was missing an educational framework for students to design interdisciplinary projects, as well as a dedicated workshop where they can test out their own ideas. That’s what prompted us to create SKIL,” says Marilyne Andersen, who spearheaded the initiative during her tenure as dean of ENAC.\nAccording to Samuel Cotture, head of SKIL, “Our lab gives the students a space to develop and carry out research projects either individually or in a group. They can come with a potential innovation already in mind, or with just a vague idea and get the support they need to turn that idea into an innovation. Here they have a safe place to try things out and make mistakes, all while learning valuable lessons about the creative process and project management.”\nAn initiative-taking culture\nSKIL was launched in the spring 2018 semester in connection with a course for third-year Bachelor’s students offered as part of the Design Together program. It aims to encourage interdisciplinary research across all of ENAC’s core disciplines: architecture, civil engineering and environmental engineering. Nine research projects have already been carried out under the initiative – one on uses of mycelium, an environmentally-friendly shower, a system to recover weather balloons, and even a community website.\n“We wanted to foster a new culture where students are encouraged to take the initiative and are supported in their nascent projects. Students should be given a chance to explore their own ideas and learn to work with their own two hands using a variety of materials and equipment. EPFL never had such a facility until now. Today, EPFL students have a new framework for fully developing their creativity,” says Anders Meibom, a SKIL professor and scientific advisor.\nAn open approach to interdisciplinary research\nSKIL is currently being funded by ENAC with the support of central services. It is intended mainly for ENAC students but, because it aims to encourage interdisciplinary research and student initiatives, it is open to any group or project team with at least one ENAC student. Two of the projects already underway – EPFL Rocket Team and Lausanne Racing Team – are examples of this open approach.\nThe new structure will serve as students’ very own fab lab, although technicians will oversee the use of any equipment that requires special training or experience. Otherwise, students can sign up and work when they wish; the lab will be open 24/7.\nSKIL is one of the many initiatives at EPFL to revamp teaching and promote innovation. Other such initiatives include its interdisciplinary research projects, X-grants, student clubs for makers, and the Enable program. SKIL empowers students to lead applied-research projects in their fields on topics they are interested in, and that contribute to their education. The lab and its equipment are being offered hand-in-hand with similar facilities set up under the Discovery Learning Program. Together these resources give students the tools to develop a broad range of skills.\nGoing forward, the lab will adapt to how students actually use it and what their needs are. In addition to accommodating hands-on courses and semester projects, it could also host high-school students during the school’s open-door days, provide training facilities or house a number of other student initiatives.\nThe inauguration ceremony will be held at 5:15pm on 24 September. Entry is free of charge; visitors can tour the building and learn about its equipment and the SKIL projects already underway.

Personally I think that what you’ve been able to achieve in just one weekend is truly inspiring!” EPFL President Martin Vetterli lavished praise on the projects presented on Sunday afternoon at the end of LauzHack 2017. This event, which was being held for the second time, pulled in over 250 participants from 24 countries, including 90 EPFL students. They split into 70 groups and spent the entire weekend developing highly creative projects in the hall of the BC building.\nThis event is unique in that it is run entirely by EPFL students. “There are 12 of us, all volunteers. Most of us are studying computer science, but not all of us, and we’ve even got some PhD students,” says Tatiana Nikitina, a member of the organizing committee. The students began putting together the hackathon back in June. “It took a lot of effort, but it’s taught us to work as a team and divide up responsibilities. The hackathon was great because it showed the participants what sort of projects are interesting from an industry perspective rather than just from an academic one.”\nThe teams could work on a challenge of their own making or chose from the ones the event sponsors came up with. At the closing ceremony, a panel of judges composed of EPFL professors and industry representatives chose the top three projects. The winning group, the Motion Drawing team, developed an easy way of drawing on a computer with gestures. The group in second place came up with a new technique for using augmented reality to display screen interfaces or to change the appearance of the user on the screen. The group finishing third, the Clickbait Killer team, had a project using artificial intelligence to make summaries of articles for a reader to consult without clicking on their links. Several teams also won various challenges given by the sponsors of the day.\nThe hackathon also hosted a girls-only workshop on Saturday, run by the association GirlsCoding. The aim was to introduce programming to girls aged 9 to 12 and to encourage them to take an interest in technology-related fields. Participants in this mini LauzHack were able to try their hand at cryptography and programming problems.\nWhen the event came to a close on Sunday evening, the organizers promised another round in 2018.\nFor more information:", "summary": "The second LauzHack took place this past weekend at EPFL.

{"id": 1480, "text": "There are many ways to express improbability, such as “when pigs fly” or “when hell freezes over.” How about “when vegetables grow on the Moon”? Actually, that might just happen, if the GrowBotHub team has its way. This interdisciplinary student project is part of the IGLUNA 2020 initiative, launched by EPFL’s Swiss Space Center on the initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA). The goal of IGLUNA is to determine what technologies astronauts need to survive on a mission to the Moon (or to other planets).\nThis is the second year of the IGLUNA campaign, and the project presentations – originally slated to take place in Lucerne on 10–19 July – will instead be held online. This year’s theme is remote control. The campaign brings together over a dozen teams made up of some 130 students from universities in ten European countries. Each team is focusing on an innovative solution for sustaining life in extreme environments, in areas such as water and food management, housing design and construction, communication and navigation systems, energy production, making and repairing tools, and human health and well-being. The previous year’s edition was held inside the Matterhorn glacier in Zermatt.\nGrowBotHub, which recently became an EPFL-accredited association, is the school’s sole contribution to IGLUNA 2020. There are some thirty student members, most of them in Master’s programs. The team is pooling their knowledge from a variety of disciplines – such as robotics, chemistry, life sciences, data management, communication systems, microengineering, materials science and electrical engineering – to create an aeroponics system to grow and harvest vegetables without human intervention.\nAeroponics does not require soil. Instead, the plants’ roots are regularly sprayed with nutrient solutions. GrowBotHub’s robotic system intelligently calculates the variables based on each plant’s needs, including the composition and quantities of nutrients, pH, humidity, light and ambient temperature.\nSpinach, radishes and chili peppers\nIn environments where resources are extremely scarce, the challenge is how to utilize and recover them as efficiently as possible. A vertical carousel system makes optimal use of available space and produces a maximum number of vegetables. To date, GrowBotHub has successfully produced green lettuce and spinach, as well as radishes, arugula and basil. Since lengthy stays in space tend to alter and diminish one’s sense of taste, the team is also looking at how to grow more pungent plants, like chili peppers, and whether it’s possible to cultivate root vegetables such as potatoes.\n“The idea is for the system to meet 25% to 30% of astronauts’ nutritional requirements, and to harvest food at least once a day,” says Victoria Letertre, a systems engineer who’s also the president of the GrowBotHub student association. “The two months of lockdown – during which we had no access to either the campus or the robot – were an excellent test. We were worried about our project remaining viable, but in the end, the plants held up well and even continued to grow, which shows that the system really works.”\nGrowBotHub has uses beyond the field of aerospace. It could also be deployed for polar expeditions or underwater exploration. Moreover, it has implications for sustainable living, with potential for small-scale, local, autonomous vegetable production.\nPresentation of GrowBotHub on “Astronomy on tap”: \nIGLUNA first edition in 2019 in Zermatt:", "summary": "Using robotics to grow and harvest plants without human intervention?

EPFL, as well as the rest of the partner institutions, has committed to complete the funding.\nSimulating and testing before producing\nThe new NCCR will be led by Professor Nicola Marzari and will aim to trigger a revolution in the field of materials design and discovery. “At this point, the power of supercomputers combined with our knowledge of quantum mechanics allow us to imagine innovative materials and simulate their characteristics and behavior without having to first create them in the lab, he said. In this manner, we can progress much faster than we used to, avoiding costly trial-and-error efforts.”\n The development of novel materials will attract many players in various domains, starting with the energy industry. “Breakthroughs are required in order to harvest energy, convert it, and store it in an efficient and economically viable manner,\" continued Nicola Marzari.\nAnd this is not all: advanced and consumer electronics, basic science and experimental research, and even the pharmaceutical industry need materials’ understanding and innovation.

{"id": 1499, "text": "Widespread drying as a result of climate change is driving an increase in forest fires around the world. By the end of the 21st century, Switzerland is expected to experience many more fires between May and November than it does today. According to experts, the worst-affected areas will be the Aare valley and lowland areas of Bern Canton. Moderate increases are predicted in Ticino Canton and the Engadin, while larger areas of Valais Canton will likely be set ablaze. These fires could trigger erosion and compromise the protective role played by forests. “Forest fires will become commonplace in Switzerland,” predicts Johan Gaume, who heads EPFL’s Snow and Avalanche Simulation Laboratory (SLAB). “The good news is that, unlike with other climate-change impacts, we’re looking at fairly long timescales.”\nIn 2018, a fire destroyed six hectares of trees in Les Voëttes, a forested slope in the Diablerets mountain range in Vaud Canton. Gaume and Xingyue Li, a postdoctoral researcher at SLAB, were keen to learn more about whether and how the damage might have affected the forest’s ability to protect against avalanches in the winter. So they asked two Master’s students in environmental engineering to examine the case for their Design Project, working directly with Vaud Canton’s Environment Department (DGE).\nMap of the position of trees after forest fires © SLAB/EPFL\nMapping avalanche risk\nUsing a digital model developed at SLAB, the students produced a new avalanche risk map to inform the DGE’s reforestation strategy. They found that, although future avalanches will move faster down the slope at Les Voëttes, the relatively shallow gradient will stop them from reaching the houses below. The expanded avalanche risk zone only includes one extra chalet that was previously outside the boundary.\nThe students made two recommendations for the DGE: to plant dense clusters of trees in highly localized spots in order to improve stability, and to employ random planting patterns across the rest of the forest to provide enhanced protection. “Smaller, non-hazardous avalanches play a key role in supporting biodiversity,” says Francesc Molné, one of the two Master’s students who worked on the Design Project. “In ecosystems like these, plants and wildlife are adapted to these types of event, so it’s important that they continue.”\n“Our findings were broadly in line with what we expected, but they’re less alarming than the DGE’s own predictions,” says fellow student Clara Streule. “We know that trees hold back some of the snow during an avalanche,” adds Molné. “The EPFL simulation model factors in the spatial distribution of trees to a high degree of accuracy. The model the DGE uses” – the RAMMS model developed at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF – “isn’t quite as accurate on that front. Perhaps that’s where the difference lies.”\nMultiple parameters\nThe engineering students fed multiple parameters into the model, all of which influence how quickly an avalanche travels and how it behaves. These included the precise position and layout of surviving and damaged trees, the exposure and topography of the terrain, and different types of snow (fresh snow, wet snow, and packed and densely packed wind slabs). Molné and Streule used a drone to take aerial photographs of the area, which they combined using photogrammetry. They also scoured historical records for the region, using the heaviest snowfall figures for the past 100 years in their model.\n“What I found most interesting was putting our faith in a digital model to come up with effective solutions, while recognizing the model’s limits and understanding how different factors influenced the end result,” says Molné. Streule notes: “The complex terrain made the topographic survey challenging. Programming the drone’s flight path put our math skills to the test – I really enjoyed rolling up my sleeves and applying the theory we’d learned in class to a hands-on problem.” She adds: “Making recommendations for Vaud Canton also taught me an important lesson about my future career. If we can’t reverse climate change, a big part of my job will be finding ways to adapt our lifestyles and shield ourselves from its worst effects.”\nMore collaborations to come\nThe students’ method could be applied to protection forests across Europe. “This pilot study was a chance to test our digital model,” says Gaume. “Now we’re keen to see how far we can take it.” His enthusiasm is shared by Vaud Canton. “This research gives us new insights into how forested slopes protect against avalanches at low altitude and will help improve our forest maintenance strategy,” explains Jean-Louis Gay from the DGE’s Forestry Inspectorate Division. “We’ll be working with EPFL again at other sites in the Canton.” A scientific paper based on the students’ work is also in the works.\nLes Diablerets, in Vaud Canton. © iStock", "summary": "Two EPFL students have compared the ability of a forest in Vaud Canton to protect against avalanches before and after it was ravaged by fire in 2018.

{"id": 1504, "text": "The symbolic first stone of the Under One Roof building was laid today, six months after the start of a construction project to be completed by autumn 2016. About half (CHF 18 million) of the total cost of the future building (39 million) is financed by the Swiss Government, while the balance is provided by sponsors including the Rolex watchmaking firm, the Fondation Gandur pour l’Art and a group of partners involved in the Montreux Jazz Digital Project.\n The sleek, spectacular building still referred to under its project name (Under One Roof) was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma and is being built by general contractor Marti Construction SA. It will fuel the heart of EPFL with new dynamics around the three areas brought together under its roof, close to 250 metres long. Each of these spaces aims to bridge science, art and society in its own way.\n To the north of the new complex, \nthe first space will be dedicated to promoting key EPFL research projects\n. In a spirit of knowledge sharing and interaction with the general public, the goal of this area is to stage the major scientific, technological and societal issues addressed by these projects through an ambitious exhibition design. Opening out onto the Esplanade, this main campus meeting point intends to provide a new Agora open to all. Supported by Rolex, it will initially host two projects of international scope – an exhibition on the Human Brain Project, in which the watchmaking brand is also involved, and the Venice Time Machine. The support by Rolex for this space is an extension to that which it already provides via the Rolex Learning Center. According to Bertrand Gros, Chairman of the Board of Rolex SA, “The Rolex Learning Center offered a bold setting to the learning sciences. We now accompany the EPFL towards a new frontier of knowledge at a crossroads between technology, cultural heritage and society. We look forward to help make major science ventures of today and tomorrow accessible to a wide audience.” \nA museum research and experimenting area \nwill fill the second space at the centre of the development. Serving as a lab to experiment exhibition designs of the future, it will allow the many research projects in digital humanities to test museum innovations in situ. “Creating novel interactions between the visitors and exhibits, enriching the experience, fostering the historical and symbolic understanding of a work of art… Such are the objectives of this space aiming at making museums more accessible, easier to understand and closer to the visitors”, says Jean Claude Gandur, Chairman of the Fondation Gandur pour l’Art (FGA). In addition to providing funding for this pavilion, the FGA will also contribute to developing its content by designing exhibition programmes in close cooperation with the EPFL, exhibiting artworks from its collections, and via research conducted in the framework of the newly announced Fondation Gandur pour l'Art Chair. Dedicated first and foremost to experimentation, the pavilion will be open to the public and form future partnerships with other institutions.\n Finally, t\nhe Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL\n will occupy the southern part of the complex overlooking Lake Geneva. More than just a food hall, and thanks to the support of Audemars Piguet SA, the Café will also be a hub of experimentation dedicated to enhancement of the Montreux Jazz Festival audio-visual archives digitised by the EPFL, which include over 5,000 hours of recordings (part of the UNESCO Memory of the World register since 2013). The public will be given opportunities to discover these, in particular via immersive visualisation and navigation devices developed at EPFL. These digitisation and enhancement operations were performed in the framework of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project thanks to support by Audemars Piguet as well as other partners who joined the initiative – Logitech SA for developing the demonstrators, the Ernst Göhner Foundation, Amplidata, the Fondation Lombard Odier, Loterie Romande as well as private sponsors.", "summary": "Last August, a public-private partnership enabled the launch of construction of the Under One Roof building, designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma to house three areas dedicated to interactions between science, art and society.", "claim": "2013, a public-private partnership enabled the launch of construction of the Under One Roof building, designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma to house three areas dedicated to interactions between science, art and society.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 0], "noise": false}

Slowly, doing their best not to tremble, the participants gradually added weights, then nails, to the bucket attached to their ephemeral work: a model bridge. Its fatal destiny that night was to collapse from the load. Above the stage a giant screen enabled the spectators – and especially the competitors – to catch every second of the spectacle.\nLast Monday was the second time that the “Cardboard Bridge Contest” was organized by EPFL, with the support of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). “We plan to repeat it each year,” says Alexandru Moraru, director of the 2012 edition. Previously, a similar contest had been hosted by the school’s alumni association, A3.\nThe competition is open to all, even if it is spearheaded by the interest of students in the ENAC School – architects and civil engineers leading the pack. The principle is simple: to construct a bridge whose expanse reaches exactly one meter, using only white, brown or gray cardboard, along with white glue. The final weight of the bridge must not exceed 100 grams.\nAt the competition, the teams place their construction on a support, hang a bucket, then proceed to add weight until the breaking point. “We measure the resistance by dividing the supported weight by the weight of the bridge itself,” explains Alexandru Moraru. “An ultra-light structure therefore has a good chance of success.” A jury ranks the bridges as well for their aesthetic value.\n“Qu'à cela ne tienne”, from Vincent Nadeau and Simon Pracchinetti, took 1st Place for Aesthetics. © Alain Herzog / EPFL\nOver 27 Kilos on the Scale!\n “The Tourists” stole the show this year.

It permits, at hardly any cost, to experiment with audacious structures and forms and to open minds to new approaches in building and construction.

{"id": 1515, "text": "The energy-intensive construction industry is among the biggest culprits when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and rising global temperatures. But with storms, floods, heat waves and other natural disasters set to grow in frequency in the coming decades, the built environment is also one of the victims of climate change. The urgency of the situation calls for a rethink – one that starts with architects.\nThe construction industry makes up a sizable share of the Switzerland’s environmental footprint, accounting for  – ahead of any other sector – and a large portion of the country’s energy consumption. Labs at EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) are pushing the boundaries of innovation and developing sustainable design and construction methods that will shape the buildings of the future. One example is the , led by associate professors Martin and Anja Fröhlich, where researchers are investigating how recycling and reusing building materials could conserve energy and resources. \nShifting mindsets\nIn 2016, EAST began exploring more efficient ways to recycle and reuse unwanted construction materials and disused structures. This new way of thinking, which considers buildings by type and potential, is part of a wider effort to change the way architects are trained. It takes its cues from the concept of \nBaukultur\n, a holistic approach to built-environment design. Every year, the lab sets students a challenge: to design and build mock-ups from recycled materials. Working in teams of 30, they have to think creatively and come up with two designs using the same constituent parts. In one project, students  near Lausanne.\n“We want our architecture students to consider sustainability at every stage of the design process,” says Martin Fröhlich. It’s a view shared by Tiago P. Borges, an architect and assistant at the lab: “In five years, or maybe a decade from now, today’s students will be tomorrow’s leaders. If we want them to change the world, we have to press home the right values now.”\nEAST’s work will take center stage at the third , held every two years in Lugano by the International Institute of Architecture . This year’s event, which focuses on the theme of reuse, will run from 1–3 October. Fröhlich will take part in a panel discussion entitled “Reuse at School” alongside Prof. Martin Boesch from the University of Lugano (USI) and Prof. Jan de Vylder from ETH Zurich.\n“It’s important to get young people thinking about sustainable design from an early age. It has to start at school, long before they come to us. By the time they get to university it’s almost too late, because it’s the last opportunity to shift mindsets. Students need to take the driving seat, not the back seat – they should be acting, not reacting.”\nMartin Fröhlich\nWith a structure composed of elements of a scaffolding and a paraglider, EAST's students designed and produced a prototype pavilion for the Swiss Alpine Club. © 2020 EAST EPFL\n“Something needs to change”\nThe event will also feature an exhibition, entitled “Rather Than – Sustainable design principles in the work of Studio EAST”, that takes an in-depth look at the design and construction of three of the pavilions. “We want to show that demolishing a building isn’t the end of the story,” says Tiago P. Borges, who’s co-organizing the exhibition. “Why throw away perfectly serviceable materials when we can reuse them and conserve resources in the process? Given the scale and breadth of the construction industry’s footprint, wasting materials is just irresponsible. Something needs to change – and that starts with better design.”\nResearchers at EAST argue that most of the solutions needed to make buildings more sustainable and less energy-intensive are already out there. The challenge now is to abandon the wasteful practices of the past – a process that will require a concerted effort from architects, construction-industry professionals, clients and society at large.", "summary": "In order to shrink the construction industry’s vast carbon footprint, architects will need to build recycling and reuse principles into their design process.

{"id": 1516, "text": "“I never thought I’d become a professor. I never considered myself to be particularly gifted,” says Aleksandra Radenovic. “But I’ve always enjoyed pushing my boundaries and trying new things.” That curiosity – coupled with an avid interest in science – is what prompted her to pursue a career in research. And she has no regrets. \nRadenovic, who is from Croatia, developed an interest in science after being inspired by a high-school teacher. “I initially wanted to become an archeologist and so I decided to study Latin and Greek,” she says. “But then my physics teacher got me enthusiastic about that subject. So I enrolled at the University of Zagreb as a physics major, and later switched to biophysics so I could combine physics and biology.”\nLessons from the conflict\nRadenovic’s life was disrupted by the Yugoslav wars that ravaged the country between 1991 and 1995. Fortunately, the capital city of Zagreb was spared the worst of the fighting. “I don’t see myself as a victim – I didn’t lose my house or have to flee the city. But it was a time tough, and my whole family was really lucky,” she says. However, her old high school was bombed during her first year at the university. Radenovic recalls her experience during the war with a sober tone, adding that it taught her some important life lessons. “Experiences like that shape you,” she says. “I learned that nothing is permanent and everything can change in the blink of an eye. So now I try to live in the present and do what I can to build a better future.” \nAfter graduating with a physics degree, Radenovic obtained a PhD in biophysics from the University of Lausanne. She was one of the last students to graduate before the fundamental sciences were transferred to EPFL. Radenovic then worked as a postdoc fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, under the Swiss National Science Foundation’s postdoc exchange program. “I really liked how open-minded and international people were at Berkeley, as well as the freedom we were given. It was fun being a foreign student in that environment,” she says. \nRaising responsible citizens \nIn 2008, Radenovic was awarded an assistant professor position in EPFL’s bioengineering department. “I was glad to come back to Lausanne because I’ve always liked this city,” she says. “And as a biophysicist I feel at home at EPFL, since it’s a cross-disciplinary school by nature. I appreciate the spirit of teamwork here and the discussions you can have with people who share the same interests. It’s a young, dynamic school.” Radenovic also chose to start a family in Switzerland. “This country – unlike the Balkans – doesn’t have a violent past. I’d like my children to grow up in a climate of peace and respect, so that they can become global citizens and, as they get older, help protect our planet.” \nIn her laboratory at EPFL, Radenovic aims to create an atmosphere where people feel free to express their opinions. “I also think it’s important to give each student a chance,” she says. “I support and encourage my students as much as possible. You can’t work with people who you don’t appreciate.”\nBio\n1975: born in Zagreb, Croatia\n1994–1999: studied physics at the University of Zagreb, Croatia \n2003: obtained a PhD in biophysics from the University of Lausanne (under Prof. Giovanni Dietler)\n2004–2007: worked as a postdoc fellow in the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley\n2007: worked as a visiting scientist at NIDCR, one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n2008–2015: worked as a tenure-track assistant professor in the bioengineering department of EPFL’s School of Engineering\n2015–present: works as an associate professor (tenured) in the bioengineering department of EPFL’s School of Engineering", "summary": "Summer series: A calling for research.

Yet some of it remains out of view – the hobbies, special interests and unique life experiences of the students, professors, staff and visiting researchers. At EPFL, Master’s student Chloé Carrière created the \nGalactic Chloé Show\n to bring some of these otherwise hidden aspects of these people’s lives to light. The show was put together with the help of Mediacom, and the first episode will be released today on the YouTube channel of the same name. New episodes will follow every three weeks.

She just completed a Bachelor’s degree in physics and has started her Master’s with a minor in space technology. Carrière founded a student association called , which holds “Astronomy on Tap” evenings where students, experts and members of the general public meet for a drink and discuss astronomy, satellites and missions to Mars. These events have been put on hold because of the pandemic – which is what spawned the idea for the YouTube show. Carrière wanted to keep up the discussions and relaxed setting, even if only virtually for now.\n“I love talking about this field, and if I can share my enthusiasm in a fun setting, that’s just perfect,” she says. “Now I’m trying out this new format, which is halfway between a US talk show and a science documentary, and it’s an exciting challenge.”\nA breath of fresh air\nIn each 15-minute-long episode, Carrière will interview a guest on a set decorated to look like a lunar outpost. The idea is to give certain people at EPFL – who you probably walk past every day – an opportunity to reveal things that others might not know about them, such as about their life before or outside EPFL: their childhood, hobbies, interests, families, milestones in life, and so on.

A staunch climate advocate, she received Germany's Federal Cross of Merit in 2019 and was recently appointed as a climate advisor to the German government.\nThe Erna Hamburger Prize is awarded every year by the EPFL-WISH Foundation to an influential woman in science. The award is named after Erna Hamburger, who, when she was hired by EPFL in 1967, became the first female professor at a Swiss federal institute of technology.\nOne of Prof. Boetius’s breakthroughs was to describe the anaerobic oxidation of methane. She believes that, in the absence of molecular oxygen, the earliest forms of terrestrial life may have survived thanks to methane. She has also posited that such life forms could help slow the pace of climate change in the future. This is because methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, and there are vast quantities of deep-ocean microorganisms that can break it down and limit its release into the atmosphere.\nDubbed by some “Marie Curie of the sea,” Prof. Boetius has also coordinated numerous marine and polar expeditions and has been involved in measuring firsthand the effects of global warming.

{"id": 1526, "text": "Twenty years ago, squats, vacant land and brownfields were a common feature of European cities. Now, these spaces have disappeared, taking the cultural activities they once harbored with them. A new book by researchers at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR) takes stock of this dramatic shift, exploring what role – physical or symbolic – remains for unprofitable, experimental and subversive activities today. In other words, where does counterculture fit into the modern-day city?\nThe researchers look at three cities – Geneva, Lisbon and Ljubljana – focusing on the period between 2013 and 2017. They find that, just as municipal authorities are championing creativity and supporting varied year-round arts programs in their cities, they are simultaneously stifling, regulating and institutionalizing counterculture like never before. This puzzling contradiction is reflected in the title of the book, published by MétisPresses: \nLa contre-culture domestiquée : art, espace et politique dans la ville gentrifiée\n (Taming counterculture: art, space and policy in the gentrified city).\nThe authors show how gentrification is ridding cities of informal spaces and working-class neighborhoods and, in the process, oppressing and excluding people and groups living on the margins of society. Culture is no longer distinguishable from urban policy, with its focus on the role of the creative process and the most experimental and subversive social movements in cities. In fact, over the past 40 years, counterculture itself has evolved into post-counterculture, whereby art is expected to serve the attractiveness, entertainment and profit motives of wider cultural policy. \nRegulated spaces\nThe researchers argue that, in today’s cities, urban planning reigns supreme. Yesterday’s alternative venues have been replaced by tightly regulated and policed spaces that are heavily publicized on account of their appeal – and expected to yield a return on investment. “Today’s tourists make no distinction between listed castles, museums, festivals and alternative neighborhoods,” says Luca Pattaroni, a senior scientist at the LASUR and the editor of the book. “In Lisbon, for instance, the LX Factory alternative arts center was recently sold to an international consortium as a financial asset.” In another example, the authors show how competition for real estate means that artists are only granted temporary occupation of vacant premises until a more lucrative outlet is found.\nThe four-part study begins by looking at the emergence of counterculture in 1970s Geneva, and how the proponents of this movement claimed space to house their activities. The researchers then explore the changing narrative around counterculture, noting how the “avant garde” of the 1970s gave way to “alternative culture” in the 1980s. Their analysis of Geneva’s shift from a post-squat city in 2000 to the densely packed and heavily regulated place it is today shows how counterculture has become steadily institutionalized and absorbed into museums, concert venues and purpose-built alternative arts spaces. In part three, the authors turn their attention to Lisbon and Ljubljana – two cities where, in just a few short years, counterculture has undergone much the same transformation as in Geneva. Their analysis shows that this is not a uniquely Swiss phenomenon. \nResistance\nThe book ends on a more optimistic note, exploring pockets of resistance against this trend. The authors demonstrate how artists and artisans are taking over buildings and spaces, reclaiming the city’s streets and forming cooperatives and, in doing so, speaking up and pushing back against attempts to restrict their creative freedom. Because, as Pattaroni makes clear in the introduction to the book, art is about more than entertainment. It cannot be reduced to a policy tool. \nThis richly illustrated book was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, which funded the publication of  including RTS archive footage, photographs, an extra chapter and portraits of alternative spaces and neighborhoods in the three cities.\nBook launch at 6pm on 12 March at the Librairie du Boulevard bookstore, Geneva.

But there was a catch: they had to develop a concept based on the idea of ‘living together’ but with a utopian element. The entire effort was overseen by Superstudio, the workshop headed by Paola Viganò.\nThe students came up with 11 projects. They range from very simple – setting up modular tarpaulin structures on campus (We Are A Monument) – to highly ambitious – taking over unused land owned by the city of Lausanne (Collection). In between the two, some students suggest repurposing existing buildings (Beautiful Carpet, Sans feu ni lieux, Space Time Blur), while others would like to see a new building on the north side of campus. That project (Boucle verte) includes plans to expand the community vegetable gardens to bring the students into contact with local residents.\nTheater on the lake\nOne group of students was more provocative, proposing to turn the iconic Rolex Learning Center into the Student Center and build a partly floating platform on the lake’s edge to hold an open-air theater and café (Yapalfeuolac). Several groups of students sought to tighten links between EPFL and the University of Lausanne, playing on the different levels of existing buildings (Superliken Campus, Treillis d’union).\nWhat do all these projects have in common? They give us a peek at the future of EPFL. A more open campus, with improved access routes from the outside and revamped and rearranged public spaces on campus.

{"id": 1528, "text": "When you’re out of work, starting a company can be a good solution, both for you and for the economy. This is the conclusion of a recently released study led by professor Marc Gruber, holder of EPFL’s Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization Chair. Conducted with the support of several regional employment agencies, this study analyzed in detail and for the first time which unemployed individuals are starting their own businesses, what factors drive them to take this step, and how their companies are developing. The scientists compared data from several countries – Switzerland, Germany, France and Belgium. Gruber gives us an overview of the study.\n-Your study shows that companies started by unemployed people do much more than just provide them with a job.\nAbsolutely. It appears that these companies generate employment. In Switzerland, these enterprises created on average 2.2 jobs after three years, in addition to the position of the company’s founder, and thus they’re potentially taking other people off the unemployment rolls. In addition, they have a very encouraging survival rate, even higher in Switzerland than in the other countries we studied: 88% of them are still viable after three years, compared with 80% in Germany and 77% in Belgium.\n- Can you give us a profile of someone who’s likely to start a successful company?\nThis is a heterogeneous group, made up of people coming from very diverse backgrounds, from landscaping to architecture to consulting. Even so, there are certain commonalities. These people are by and large male, in the 30-60 year-old age bracket, and thus have a certain amount of previous job experience. Two profiles stand out: those who have always dreamed of starting their own business but resisted as long as they had salaried jobs; for them, unemployment provided the needed impetus and opportunity. And there are those who only considered starting a business after months, if not years, of unemployment, and then as a last ditch solution. Those in this second category are in the minority.\n- How can the results of this study be used?\nThe goal of this study was to better understand the effects that interventions and government support, which vary considerably from one country to another, have on the evolution of unemployment. These results will thus be primarily of use to policy makers in the area of unemployment, to improve programs designed to facilitate business development, better target their financial or training support systems, or develop new kinds of assistance. These data can also be helpful for entrepreneurs or those who would like to become entrepreneurs; they will discover possible avenues for developing their strengths, anticipating possible difficulties, identifying gaps they need to fill in education or management skills, and learning how to get the support they need. Understanding how to handle all these aspects is all the more important now that everyone is likely to change jobs or go through job restructuring several times in the course of his or her life.\n- Do you think that for these companies there is a “recipe for success?”\nWe often believe that luck is the main ingredient in success. You need it, that’s for sure! But in this study, we were asking ourselves about other components that systematically had an impact on the performance of new start-ups -- the idea itself, the founder’s expertise or knowledge, his management experience and personality – which make a company prosper, create jobs and turn a profit. In fact, two factors favorably influence success: an idea with growth potential and a founder with prior management experience. You have to know how to stay afloat in a competitive environment and understand how your competitors are handling it, as well. Our results show that specific expertise in the new company’s domain is less critical for these “high performers,” because they can always acquire knowledge along the way or get outside support by bringing in skilled collaborators.\n- Could starting a company be possible for all the unemployed?\nEntrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. But we could at least ask everyone who is jobless to consider it, to see it as a possible alternative. There are certainly many people who would make good entrepreneurs, but who don’t think of it or won’t even allow themselves to consider the possibility.", "summary": "More than 90% of companies launched by unemployed individuals are still viable after three years.

{"id": 1530, "text": "Air bubbles in a glass of water float freely up to the surface, and the mechanisms behind this are easily explained by the basic laws of science. However, the same laws of science cannot explain why air bubbles in a tube a few millimeters thick don’t rise the same way.\nPhysicists first observed this phenomenon nearly a century ago, but couldn’t come up with an explanation – in theory, the bubbles shouldn’t encounter any resistance unless the fluid is in motion; thus a stuck bubble should encounter no resistance.\nBack in the 1960s, a scientist named Bretherton developed a formula based on the bubbles’ shape to explain this phenomenon. Other researchers have since postulated that the bubble doesn’t rise due to a thin film of liquid that forms between the bubbles and the tube wall. But these theories cannot fully explain why the bubbles don’t rise upwards.\nThe bubble not rising upward Credit: EPFL\nWhile a Bachelor’s student at the  within EPFL’s School of Engineering, Wassim Dhaouadi was able to not only view the thin film of liquid, but also measure it and describe its properties – something that had never been done before. His findings showed that the bubbles weren’t stuck, as scientists previously thought, but actually moving upwards extremely slowly. Dhaouadi’s research, which was published recently in \nPhysical Review Fluids\n, marked the first time that experimental evidence was provided to test earlier theories.\nDhaouadi and EMSI lab head, John Kolinski, used an optical interference method to measure the film, which they found to be only a few dozen nanometers (1 x 10\n-9\n meters) thick. The method involved directing light onto an air bubble inside a narrow tube and analyzing the reflected light intensity. Using the interference of the light reflected from the tube’s inner wall and from the bubble’s surface, they precisely measured the film’s thickness.\nDhaouadi also discovered that the film changes shape if heat is applied to the bubble and returns to its original shape once the heat is removed. “This discovery disproves the most recent theories that the film would drain to zero thickness,” says John Kolinski.\nThese measurements also show that the bubbles are actually moving, albeit too slowly to be seen by the human eye. “Because the film between the bubble and the tube is so thin, it creates a strong resistance to flow, drastically slowing the bubbles’ rise,” according to Kolinski.\nThese findings relate to fundamental research but could be used to study fluid mechanics on a nanometric scale, especially for biological systems.\nJohn Kolinski and Wassim Dhaouadi\n Dhaouadi joined the lab as a summer research assistant during his Bachelor. He made rapid progress, and continued the work of his own volition. “He essentially participated out of his interest in the research, and wound up publishing a paper from his work that brings to rest a centuries-old puzzle”, says Kolinski.\n “I was happy to carry a research project early in my curriculum. It is a new way of thinking and learning and was quite different from a Homework set where you know there is a solution, although it may be hard to find. At first, We did not know if there would even be a solution to this problem\n.\n,” says Dhaouadi, who is now completing a Master’s degree at ETH Zurich. Kolinski adds: “Wassim\nmade an exceptional discovery at our lab. We were happy to have him working with us.”", "summary": "An EPFL Bachelor’s student has solved a mystery that has puzzled scientists for 100 years.

{"id": 1531, "text": "This past winter, EPFL associate professors Anja and Martin Fröhlich challenged their students to build a small pavilion using structural elements from an old industrial site. That pavilion has now been completed: it sits between the Amphimax and Génopode buildings on the University of Lausanne (UNIL) campus. It will be inaugurated on 1 June and will be used for six months as an exhibition space in partnership with Le Cabanon, an association run by art history students at UNIL.\nIn 2016, another group of EPFL architecture students led by Anja and Martin Fröhlich also built an art pavilion at UNIL. They used recycled materials too, but all from the dismantling of the International Olympic Committee’s old administrative building, a Lausanne landmark. This year, the team led by the Fröhlich duo is focusing its energies on the decommissioned industrial site in Saint-Aubin, in Fribourg Canton.\nInventorying and brainstorming\nEarly in the 2017-18 winter term, the architecture students spent time at the site inventorying all the potentially reusable materials, ranging from the steel wall framing all the way down to the faucets, locks and door handles. Through this painstaking work, they were able to assess the extent to which the existing structures could be reused or eventually recycled – resources that would have been overlooked in a standard demolition project.\nThe students then came up with ideas for what could be built on the site, such as a sports facility, a textile workshop and processing plant, or an ecological center for sorting waste and producing renewable energy.\nIn the spring semester, the students moved on to a new task: designing an art pavilion using building materials from a section of the site that had been stripped of its economic value and was set to be demolished. Out of six designs, the best one – made mostly from wood – was prepared and developed on site before being taken and reassembled at UNIL. During the design phase, walls made out of concrete and recovered flagstones replaced the wood ones.\nEuropean Heritage Days\nEPFL’s interest in Saint-Aubin doesn’t stop there: the students will convert part of the remaining complex into a museum-style exhibition as part of the European Heritage Days on 1 and 2 September. Visitors will learn all about the students’ projects at Saint-Aubin, with a particular focus on their ideas for repurposing the buildings left empty since 2016.\nThird edition\nEvery year, Anja and Martin Fröhlich, Berlin-based architects and co-directors of EPFL’s Laboratory of Elementary Architecture and Studies of Types (EAST), have their undergraduate students experience an architectural project from design to delivery under the principle research through design. The catch? The students must learn to identify reusable parts of buildings that are slated for demolition. The goal is to instill in students the idea that craftsmanship with reused materials is an alternative and that sustainable development is about more than just energy efficiency. The Saint-Aubin project is the third spearheaded by the couple; the first two involved old buildings from the International Olympic Committee (in 2016) and the Swiss Alpine Club (in 2017).\nSide event\nDiscover the work of EPFL's architecture workshops at the \"Expo Ubiquitaire\", SG building, EPFL, free admission:\nFriday 1 June: 5:30pm-10pm.

{"id": 1533, "text": "A new scientific magazine is hot off the press. Technologist explores science with a modern and avant-garde attitude, fully embracing its European position. The first edition will run 45,000 copies in French, English and German. It’s the fruit of a unusual partnership between a team of independent journalists and four leading universities in the area of technology and innovation: Technical University of Denmark, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Eindhoven University of Technology, and Technische Universität München. From today, Technologist is available for purchase in 20 European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, the UK, France, the Netherlands and Denmark.\n “Europeans hear about research done in their own country and in English-speaking countries, but often have no idea what’s going on in neighboring countries,” says Daniel Saraga, Executive Editor of Technologist. “The result is a general impression that most science is done in the U.S., whereas European research is incredibly dynamic.” The ambition of the new magazine is an attempt to rebalance the scales.\n Technologist’s model is one that is not often seen in the media: it is edited independently but funded by the partner universities. “One of our models is the MIT Technology Review,” explains Saraga. “It has proven that information can be treated objectively and in an interesting manner even though it’s funded by an institution. We discuss content with our partner universities, but we maintain our independence as to the way in which we present the information.”\nFracking: comparing the U.S. and Europe\nAlthough Technologist has a distinctly European tone, that doesn’t mean it ignores the rest of the world. The first edition covers “augmented reality” and describes research on robotic prostheses being developed in Switzerland, Germany and Brazil that could give paralyzed individuals the ability to walk again. A special section on shale gas compares the situation in the U.S. and Europe and looks at the political and scientific controversies surrounding hydraulic fracking. “Europe is home to some of the most interesting scientific programs in the world, and we have access to top experts in every subject from the universities on the continent,” says Saraga.\n The magazine calls upon the contributions of a fleet of high-caliber journalists based throughout Europe who write for magazines such NewScientist, Nature, Spiegel and La Recherche, and well-known graphic designers and illustrators who contribute to publications such as Domus, Wallpaper and Newsweek. The team is coordinated in Switzerland by the LargeNetwork Press Agency, and the website is managed in Copenhagen by a scientific editor.\n For the partner universities, it is critical that Europe’s scientific face has a strong media presence and that citizens are informed of scientific progress on the continental scale. This is why the project was included as part of their Eurotech consortium.\n Launched on June 24, 2014 at the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Copenhagen, Technologist aims to bridge, even modestly, the gap in language and culture.

The injection of capital comes on top of a CHF 10 million EU grant awarded to the HIPERION consortium, which brings together a range of industry and research partners. The company, whose technology has achieved record efficiency of 29% for sun-to-electricity conversion, will initially target the agricultural sector with translucent panels that can act as both greenhouse covers and power plants.\nTargeting agriculture first\nThe photovoltaic modules developed by Insolight, based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, represent a novel approach to solar power generation. Lenses embedded in a thin glass layer focus sunlight on tiny, high-efficiency, space-grade solar cells below. The lenses move a few millimeters throughout the day to track the sun’s movement across the sky and keep the cells aligned with the light rays. The system can be fitted to conventional solar panels to maximize energy production. But the translucent modules can also work as standalone power plants while serving other functions such as promoting crop growth.\nInsolight is planning to team up with major solar energy suppliers to target the agricultural sector with panels that can be installed in fields, on greenhouses and on green roofs. Users will be able to switch between two modes: an electricity generation mode, in which the lenses concentrate light on the high-efficiency solar cells, and a maximum light transmission mode, in which all incoming light passes through the panel to reach the crops below. “The agrivoltaics market may be relatively new, but it’s already worth an estimated CHF 700 million, with total installed capacity of 5 GWp,” says Insolight CEO Laurent Coulot.

{"id": 1539, "text": "EPFL’s Technology Transfer Office (TTO) has recently seen a surge in requests for licenses for your software, which generates color-coded graphs highlighting the key elements of websites’ data protection policies. Who are all these requests coming from? \nIt’s true that the TTO has received over 20 license requests in the past few months. Most of them come from companies offering web services – such as personal data protection software and data monetization applications – as well as lawyers drafting data protection policies and disclaimers, who want to test their texts. Some ad agencies have requested licenses so that they can place ads in accordance with new regulatory requirements. A few of the requests we have received were for exclusivity agreements, which is something we want to avoid. We just entered into a license agreement with DuckDuckGo, a US search engine that stands apart for its commitment to protecting personal data. For instance, it doesn’t store any personal information about its users.\nWhat benefits does your software offer DuckDuckGo?\nIts developers plan to incorporate our AI algorithms into the search engine’s Privacy Essentials extension. This extension already provides a summary of important data protection information, but that summary is generated by hand based on the policies of just a few dozen websites. With our algorithms, the summary generation process can be automated and expanded to include tens of thousands of websites. However, it’s worth pointing out that the summaries produced by our software have no legal value – they’re for information purposes only – but they do have a nearly 80% accuracy rate at this point.\nDid you expect Polisis to be so successful when you were developing the algorithms?\nWe spent a year and a half developing the technology at EPFL’s Distributed Information Systems Laboratory, in association with the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan. The development was done for research purposes, but the number of license requests the TTO has received since we put the program online has far exceeded our expectations. And over 30,000 people have tried it out. Part of Polisis’ success is due to the fact that it’s easy to use – you don’t have to be an expert to understand the color-coded graphs it generates. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that took effect in May also helped. Our program clearly provides the easiest way to decipher all the different data protection policies, which are often long-winded but now mandatory for all websites. The GDPR has also prompted people who are simply curious to take an interest in our program. That makes me almost wish we had created a start-up to market our technology!\nDo you have any competitors?\nThere are other websites out there that analyze data protection policies, but they don’t work the same way. They highlight specific sentences and clauses based on what a user searches for. But they don’t provide automatically-generated summaries of how websites use personal data.\nAre you surprised by some of the things you found using your program? \nIt was interesting to see that some websites that you wouldn’t think are much concerned about data privacy actually show up as having robust policies. The developers of those websites probably hired an army of lawyers to comb through their policies and introduce generic terms that make it through filters. The end result is policies with extremely vague terms like “with our partners for different reasons,” “if necessary” and “effectively.” These policies seem clear when you first read them, but dig deeper and you’ll find that’s not the case. And the GDPR has not completely eliminated this trend. Our algorithms are designed to boost transparency and draw attention to these kinds of highly important details. We are currently working with Kassem Fawaz’s lab at the University of Wisconsin to improve our algorithms so they can better recognize generic terms.\nYour software can help identify where personal data are sent and how they’re used, but can it check whether websites are actually following their data protection policies? \nNo, because we don’t have access to websites’ servers. But extensions like those provided by DuckDuckGo can spot advertising trackers and check whether websites disclose them in their data protection policies.

This time, the soldiers performed routine tasks while the app ran on their phones, and took note of each time they came into contact – defined as “less than two meters for more than five minutes” – with another person.\n“We wanted to establish a baseline for how people actually act in different situations,” Payer explains. He adds that an additional challenge was to calibrate the system to work regardless of whether a user’s smartphone was in their hand, in their backpack, etc. “We tested different parameters, such as signal strength and frequency, to ensure that the system generates good information without too many false positives, and without draining your phone battery.”\nThis signaling system is at the core of the DP3T technology: it uses Bluetooth signals to continuously broadcast random and impossible-to-guess strings of characters between smartphones. All sent signals, as well as those received from nearby devices, are stored on users’ phones for a maximum of 14 days. If a user is diagnosed with COVID-19, their unique character sequences will be added to a hospital list, which other users’ phones will check regularly to see if they ‘recognize’ any of them. If a match is found that indicates a user was near a COVID-19 patient long enough to risk infection, the app will display an alert, asking the user to self-isolate and enabling him or her to get tested as soon as possible.\n“Privacy by design” \nThe idea of using smartphones for proximity tracing has raised concerns over data privacy, as critics argue that such a system could create new opportunities for personal information to be abused, even after the pandemic eases. But the DP3T team is working to ensure that even if a hacker could get their hands on the signal data – which will be stored only on users’ smartphones, rather than a centralized server – it would be useless to them.\n“This is privacy by design: we wanted to create a system that respects the need of citizens, which is not just to stop the coronavirus, but also to preserve freedom. So, we are building an app that cannot be used for anything other than contact tracing – it cannot be used to know location, identities, or activities,” says Carmela Troncoso, head of EPFL's Security and Privacy Engineering Lab ().\nShe adds that the system is also designed to dismantle itself organically as soon as the app is uninstalled from a smartphone, which will delete all stored signal data, thus placing control of the system in the hands of users.\nLooking ahead\nAs the parameter tests of the DP3T system are completed, all results will be published online to encourage continuous feedback and refinement. A beta version of the DP3T app is anticipated by mid-May; however, the researchers emphasize that the rollout of the app for use by citizens is ultimately within the purview of the Swiss government.\nIn the meantime, the DP3T team is working to ensure that the system will be ready to welcome a forthcoming application program interface (API) , which is still under development.\n“This is all happening in parallel. We have an app that works using our protocol, and that is compatible with Apple and Google’s protocol. As soon as that protocol is available, we will switch to it, as it will simplify integration with iOS and Android devices,” Payer says.\nAbout the DP3T project\n At EPFL, the team working on DP3T includes Alfredo Sanchez, Apostolos Pyrgelis, Carmela Troncoso, Dominique Quatravaux, Edouard Bugnion, Daniele Antonioli, James Larus, Jean-Pierre Hubaux, Ludovic Barman, Marcel Salathé, Mathias Payer, Pascal Fua, Sylvain Chatel, Theresa Stadler, and Wouter Lueks.\n At ETH Zurich, the team working on DP3T includes David Basin, Dennis Jackson, Jan Beutel, Kenneth Paterson, and Srdjan Capkun.\n Elsewhere in Europe, developers include Bart Preneel, Nigel Smart, Dave Singelee, and Aysajan Abidin (KU Leuven); Seda Gürses (TU Delft); Michael Veale (University College London); Cas Cremers (CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security); Reuben Binns (University of Oxford); and Ciro Cattuto (University of Torino / ISI Foundation).\n In Switzerland, the project is being coordinated by the  of the Swiss Federal Council, and is  by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health ().\n Internationally, DP3T has been listed as one of several privacy-preserving, decentralized approaches to contact tracing in a  endorsed by some 300 scientists from over 25 countries.", "summary": "Over the past two weeks, EPFL computer scientists have been testing and refining the smartphone-based system developed by the international Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing project (DP3T), with the help of the Swiss Army.

{"id": 1544, "text": "Lausanne’s traffic is the noisiest in Switzerland, often exceeding 55 decibels – the upper safety limit recommended for Europe. That’s largely due to its steep roads, which result in excessive engine noise when vehicles get moving and accelerate. For the first time, scientists from EPFL, CHUV and HUG have crossed data from 3,697 Lausanne residents who reported high levels of daytime sleepiness in a CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study with the results of a noise survey carried out by the Swiss Federal Office of the Environment (OFEV). “This research, published in the \nInternational Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health\n, establishes a link between where people suffering from daytime sleepiness live and the noise caused by cars and trains passing through those areas at night. It shows that some areas of Lausanne are particularly problematic,” says Stéphane Joost, a researcher at EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG).\nReal health risks\nSleep disturbances can have serious health consequences, as they can lead not only to daytime sleepiness and higher stress, but also to a greater risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, fatigue-induced accidents, depression and other psychological disorders. For their study, the scientists mapped out the neighborhoods where people suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness live and compared that with traffic-noise data obtained from the OFEV’s sonBASE. They found distinct neighborhoods with similar levels of reported sleepiness, illustrating the effects of nocturnal noise pollution on Lausanne residents.\n“Daytime sleepiness is a common complaint among the people who contact us,” says Raphaël Heinzer, head of the Sleep Disorders Center at CHUV. “This study is the first to show that where a person lives can be a major contributing factor.” The red zones on the scientists’ map indicate neighborhoods with both a high occurrence of daytime sleepiness and elevated levels of nighttime noise – meaning they are probably areas where residents don’t sleep very well. On the other hand, the blue zones indicate neighborhoods with low levels of daytime sleepiness. “The difference in nighttime noise between the red and blue zones is over five decibels, which is huge considering that volume doubles with every three decibels,” says Joost.\nLegend: \nBlue zones correspond to neighborhoods with below-average daytime sleepiness and where similar sleepiness levels are reported within a range of at least 400 meters. Red zones correspond to neighborhoods with above-average daytime sleepiness. \nLausanne’s red zones are located primarily at the intersection of Avenue d’Echallens and Chemin de Montétan – which is especially noisy between 10pm and 6am – and below the train station near the Place de Milan. In addition, the equivalent continuous sound level (Leq) in neighborhoods near major thoroughfares and train tracks can exceed 50 decibels, which is the maximum allowed by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.\nMaking targeted measures possible \nThe study’s authors hope their work will help policymakers identify which neighborhoods can benefit the most from noise-reduction measures to improve residents’ health. “Fortunately, sleep disturbances and the resulting health problems are reversible. We can reduce nighttime noise by introducing speed limits, restricting certain kinds of vehicles, or using sound-absorbing surfaces, for example,” adds Joost.\nDoctors are also advocating such measures. “Improving patients’ health through urban-planning policies designed to reduce the amount of noise pollution they are exposed to is one aspect of a new field of healthcare called urban health,” says Idris Guessous, a primary care physician at HUG and a coauthor of the study. “We want to build awareness among not just doctors, but also urban planners, geographers, architects, lawyers and sociologists of the role they can play in working together to improve the health of a city’s residents. Our maps were developed jointly by several public-sector institutions, and they can help local governments make better informed decisions. We hope our research will speed progress towards targeted public-health policies.”\nA similar study is being carried out in Geneva using data on the city’s residents collected during HUG’s \nBus Santé\n program. Follow-up research is also planned on the Lausanne study; while that study relied on subjective data collected from answers to a questionnaire, the new research will use objective measurements of sleepiness obtained from electroencephalography (as part of a HypnoLaus study).", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL, the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) compared the geographical distribution of nearly 3,700 Lausanne residents suffering from daytime sleepiness with the noise caused by road and railway traffic in those parts of the city at night.

In the most severe cases, the sufferer may become fully paralyzed and in need of permanent assistance.\nThe TOBI project (Tools for brain-computer interaction) is financed by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7) and is coordinated by EPFL. Since 2008 it has focused on the use of the signals transmitted by the brain. The electrical activity that takes place in the brain when the patient focuses on a particular task such as lifting an arm is detected by electroencephalography (EEG) through electrodes placed in a cap worn by the patient. Subsequently, a computer reads the signals and turns them into concrete actions as, for instance, moving a cursor on a screen.\nTests involving more than 100 patients\n Based on this idea, researchers from thirteen institutions together with TOBI project partners have developed various technologies aimed at either obtaining better signal quality, making them clearer, or translating them into useful and functional applications. During the research, more than 100 patients or handicapped users had the opportunity to test the devices. Three of the technologies developed within the framework of TOBI were publicly presented at the closing seminar of the research program that took place in Sion from 23 to 25 January 2013.\nRobotino, for helping rebuild social ties when bedridden. \nCombining EEG, signal recognition, obstacle sensors and the internet, researchers have been able to develop a small robot equipped with a camera and a screen that can be controlled remotely by physically disabled people.

Coupling EEG with electrical muscle stimulation can allow a patient to voluntarily control the movement of a paralyzed limb.

{"id": 1547, "text": "Why is it that we don’t wake up in the middle of the night feeling hungry while it’s hard for us to endure eight hours without eating after breakfast? In our daily life, every one of us realizes that our body responds to the rhythm imposed by the succession of days and nights, which has important metabolic consequences. The jet lag syndrome is another manifestation of the interaction between our internal clock and the environmental cycles.\nWhile many molecular studies have been conducted on living organisms’ circadian clocks, new analytical tools currently available allow a closer inspection of the real impact of this clock on some biological processes, in particular at a level of temporal protein abundance. This is exactly the research carried out in a joint study between EPFL and the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences (NIHS), thanks to a grant from the Leenaards Foundation disbursed in 2012. Their results have been published this week in the journal \nProceedings of the National Academy of Science of the USA\n (PNAS).\nThe researchers, under the direction of Frédéric Gachon (NIHS) and Felix Naef (EPFL), used mass spectrometry to analyze mice liver proteins. They measured the concentration of more than 5000 different proteins – whereas previous techniques only allowed to identify a few hundreds at best. \"We have observed that 6% of the proteins are expressed in a rhythmic manner, explained Felix Naef. This rate seemed low to us, since we know that almost half of the active genes in the liver follow a rhythm in messenger RNA abundance. But the most amazing part was that more than half of these rhythmic proteins originate from genes whose messenger RNA is not influenced by the circadian clock.\"\nThis apparent paradox suggests that the circadian clock does not only influence the production of proteins by the genes, but also the way the liver regulated the storage and release of proteins into the body.\nThe researchers observed an overnight accumulation of proteins, suggesting that their secretion is higher during the day. This results in a maximal plasma concentration during the night, the active period for mice. Unlike humans, mice are nocturnal animals, they eat and are active at night while resting during the day. \"Our experiments seem to prove that the pace set by feeding patterns takes precedence over the circadian rhythm. However, it appears that the strongest effect takes place when these two rhythms overlap\", said Frédéric Gachon.\nA next step in this research will attempt to translate some of these results to humans. \"Our work will help develop strategies focused on diet to help treat patients suffering from disorders associated to circadian dysfunctions\" said Felix Naef.", "summary": "Living organisms have adapted to the day-night cycle and, in most cases, evolved a \"circadian clock\" – that is: an actual cellular metronome – whose effects are not completely known yet.

{"id": 1551, "text": "Successful takeoff! The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) was launched into space this morning from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and is on its way to Mars. Scheduled to reach its destination in October, it's carrying a camera developed at the University of Bern*. Researchers from EPFL's Space Engineering Center (eSpace) will participate in the data analysis from this instrument. They will discuss the project and present their particular contribution to it at a public talk that will be held at EPFL on Wednesday, 16 March.\nThis launch is the first mission in the ExoMars program, a joint initiative of the European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency. Its main purpose is to search for signs of present or past life on Mars. The second mission, which will land an exploration rover, is planned for 2018.\nWhen the TGO reaches Mars, it will go into orbit around the planet. That’s when it gets down to work: it will seek trace concentrations of gases – less than 1% – in the Martian atmosphere. It will then attempt to identify their geographical source. This is of interest because, as previous analyses have shown, the accumulation of certain chemical substances, like methane, can vary by location and season. The TGO will help expand our knowledge of the planet’s topography, which turns out to be more dynamic than once thought, in order to determine whether these fluctuations are biological or only geological in origin.\nStereo images\nThe camera that the Swiss team developed – a high resolution imaging system called CASSIS (Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System) – will play a key role in this task. It will work together with the other instruments on the probe, including the NOMAD spectrometer and the FREND neutron detector, in the effort to identify geological sites.\nSites whose features – crevasses or traces of erosion, runoff or volcanism – indicate potential sources of gas will then be analyzed in greater detail by CASSIS. The camera will take color photos using stereoscopic imaging, a process of taking photos from two different angles, and at a high resolution: better than 5 m.\nThe TGO will be in a non-sun-synchronous orbit – it won’t fly over the same spot at the same time – which means that the probe will allow researchers to observe the surface of the planet at different times of day. They will be able to see various processes at work, like condensation and ice sublimation at the poles and the formation of dust devils. The data will also be used to identify landing sites for future probes.\n3D representations\nResearchers at EPFL’s eSpace worked mainly on the calculations for calibrating the camera as well as on algorithms for processing information provided by the stereoscopic images. “The CASSIS camera is designed to enable easy generation of digital elevation models – 3D representations of the surface,” said Anton Ivanov, the lead researcher on the project at eSpace. Together with PhD student Stepan Tulyakov, he also developed a program to precisely identify the position of photographed sites, which will supplement data obtained during previous missions.\n*\nThe camera is a cooperation between the University of Bern, the Astronomical Observatory of Padua, and the Space Research Center in Warsaw with the support of local industries and funded by the Swiss Space Office (SSO), the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the Polish Space Agency (POLSA).\nTo celebrate the launch of the Trace Gas Orbiter, eSpace will hold a talk on Wednesday, 16 March from 6-7:30pm in room CO 1:\n\"Trace Gas Orbiter Launch Event: The Search for Life on Mars\"\nSpeakers:\n- Anton Ivanov, Space Engineering Center (eSpace)\n - Pierre Brisson, Mars Society Switzerland", "summary": "The Trace Gas Orbiter, which will search for traces of biological life on the red planet, was launched into space this morning.

However, solar and wind sources’ peak availability takes place at times that do not usually correspond to peak demand hours. Therefore, a way must be devised to store and later reuse the energy generated. To address this issue many avenues have been explored, ranging from electrochemical batteries to water pumping to geographically elevated reservoirs.\nAlfred Rufer, director of the Industrial Electronics Laboratory (LEI) at EPFL, has worked for over ten years on an original storage system: compressed air. The use of a hydraulic piston (water pumped into a cylinder that compresses the air in the remaining space) instead of a mechanical piston delivers the best system performance, generating much less losses in the form of heat. The obtained high pressure air can be safely stored in bottles without losses until it is necessary to generate new electricity by expanding the gas in the cylinder. \"One of the advantages of our system is that it does not require rare materials. Also, its robustness makes it durable, \"says Alfred Rufer.\n\"Turnkey\" system\nSylvain Lemofouet carried out his doctoral thesis at LEI and founded the start-up Enairys Powertech to develop this principle and create \"turnkey\" electrical energy storage and retrieval units. As a result, the HyPES project was born.\nHis first prototype was launched in 2007. In 2011, a unit of industrial dimensions could already absorb 10 kW to be stored as compressed air. As of this year, a 25 kW pilot will be installed at the Mont-Soleil (JU) photovoltaic park. \"We talk in terms of the electric power that the system is able to absorb and release rather than about energy storage capacity, which does not entail significant expenses: we just need to add more bottles ,\" said Sylvain Lemofouet.\nIn the future, there will be 250 kW installations at first and 2’500 kW ones afterwards. \"The stored energy that we can provide will be adapted to decentralized production units such as solar parks warehouses or wind farms,\" said Sylvain Lemofouet.\nIn line with the canton’s politics\nDuring a press conference that took place at EPFL on 12 May 2014, the Canton of Vaud announced its backing to the development of the HyPES system in the form of a 1,66 million francs grant and by promoting the entry of the HyPES devices into the market.

{"id": 1565, "text": "According to figures released by the UN yesterday, natural disasters have killed more than 1.2 million people since 2000 and cost nearly $ 3 trillion.These pressing threats bring into sharp focus the need for new answers to the problem of soil stabilization. Scientists at EPFL’s Laboratory of Soil Mechanics (LMS) have developed a number of sustainable solutions, including one that uses enzyme metabolism. Although these methods work for a wide range of soil types, they are considerably less effective when it comes to clay soils. In a paper published yesterday in \nScientific Reports\n, the team demonstrates how chemical reactions can be enhanced by using a battery-like system to apply electric current.\nA new type of biocement – produced in situ and at ambient temperature – has recently been put forth as a promising method for stabilizing various soil types. The method harnesses bacterial metabolism to produce calcite crystals that durably bond soil particles together. This biogeochemical process is energy-efficient and cost-effective, and could be rolled out quickly in the coming years. But since the ground needs to be impregnated for the method to work, it is less suited to low-permeability clay soils. Now, the LMS team has developed and successfully tested a viable alternative, which involves applying electric current using sunken electrodes. “Our findings show that this geoelectrochemical system does indeed influence key stages of the calcification process, especially the formation and growth of the crystals that bind the soil together and enhance its behavior,” says Dimitrios Terzis, a scientist at LMS and one of the co-authors of the paper.\nThe biocement is formed by introducing chemical species into the soil. These include dissolved carbonate and calcium ions, which carry opposite charges. Sunken anodes and cathodes are used to create an electric field, much in the same way as a giant battery. The current forces the ions to move across the low-permeability medium, where they intersect, mix together and eventually interact with soil particles. The result is the growth of carbonate minerals, which act as links or “bridges” that enhance the mechanical performance and resistance of soils.\nTechnology transfer grant\nThe paper, which sets out the team’s findings from observing and measuring the quality of these mineral bridges, paves the way for future developments in the field. Further tests, at different scales, are needed before the technology can be applied in the real world. The research was carried out under a 2018–2023 European Research Council (ERC) Advanced grant awarded to Prof. Lyesse Laloui, who heads the LMS and is a co-author of the paper. The project has three verticals, targeting the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that occur at the soil-particle scale (micro-scale), the advanced characterization of mechanical behaviors at laboratory scale, and the large-scale development and demonstration of innovative systems in natural environments. In July 2020, the same research team obtained an additional ERC Proof of Concept grant to accelerate technology transfer to industrial applications.\nIn the past, soils were treated solely as a mix of solid earth, air and water.

Amazentis, in conjunction with EPFL researchers, identified some of the benefits of this compound in 2016 – and their work soon attracted the attention of Nestlé Health Science. The multinational has just entered into an agreement whereby it will take an equity stake in the startup and include urolithin A in future dietary supplements, foods, drinks and medical nutrition products. The agreement also provides for a joint research program in order to further develop the compound for use in other areas, such as health and medicine. The general safety of Urolithin A has been recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThe anti-aging compound acts on an important mechanism in cell metabolism and health: mitochondria. These organelles – the cells’ powerhouses – play a major role in the aging process. Urolithin A is the first natural bioactive compound able to slow that process, which it does by clearing away old and damaged mitochondria. Tests on both nematodes and rodents produced spectacular results.\nOur bodies produce urolithin A naturally after we eat foods containing its precursors, such as pomegranate. Yet we would need to consume a huge quantity of that fruit to reap a significant benefit. What’s more, the amount of urolithin A produced by our bodies can vary widely depending on the flora present in our gut microbiome.

{"id": 1571, "text": "There is indeed a glamorous side to the star performer who “spends half his life in the air between New York and Singapore.” Then there is the reality of people who spend two hours every day in a train, bus or car. Sociologists call them ‘highly mobile’ people, whether or not they choose to commute so far and regardless of whether this brings them a big paycheck or career success. Researchers at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory analyzed how this phenomenon has evolved over the past 10 years in four European countries: Switzerland, France, Germany and Spain. Their work has now been published in book form.* In it, they show how people increasingly accept long commutes in response to economic difficulties.\nA highly mobile person is someone who spends more than two hours per day commuting or over 60 nights per year away from home. The book is based on two studies, conducted in 2007 and 2011, that surveyed some 7,000 working people between the ages of 25 and 54. The researchers used the data they collected to construct a biography of these people on the basis of their residential, professional and family lives and their commuting habits over the course of their lives. By revisiting some of the same people in 2011 as in 2007, the researchers were able to measure subtle changes in their behavior and in how they talk about commuting, as well as to estimate the effect of the 2008 economic crisis.\nA way out of unemployment\n First observation: many people commute a long distance to work. Between 11% and 15% of workers between the ages of 25 and 54 are highly mobile. The rates were highest in Germany and Switzerland and grew between 2007 and 2011. “In these countries, people mainly choose the long-distance commute,” said Vincent Kaufmann, Director of LASUR. “This is facilitated by the fact that long trips are made easy by the very effective transit system.”\nOn the other hand, in Spain – and to a lesser extent in France – long commutes tend not to be by choice and are sometimes the only way out of unemployment. The 2008 crisis is still being felt. In Spain, the number of long-term commuters fell, while the number of people away from home has doubled. In 2011, one out of every two highly mobile commuters became that way to escape unemployment, versus 28% in France, 22% in Germany and 13% in Switzerland.\nIn addition to comparisons by country and over time, the book categorizes highly mobile commuters in a way that often belies stereotypes. In most cases they are not well-paid people with a high level of education. And their efforts will not necessarily lead to career success. While it is generally a springboard in Switzerland and for women in France, in Spain it is more the result of need. More personally, the book looks at how people deal with the need to commute a long distance over the course of their lives. Why does one commute? Is it by force, choice or necessity? How do people view their own situation? What do they hope to gain from it?\nIn the grand scheme of things, what is the social cost of high mobility? In short, marital instability and lower birth rates. Among women surveyed who had never experienced episodes of high mobility, 10% did not have children at the time of the interview. These figures rise to 18% for women who experienced high mobility, 22% among long-term commuters and 23% among those who commuted long distances early in their career. One must add to this stress, fatigue and a “higher burn-out rate,” according to the sociologist. “Professional exhaustion often causes people to rethink their choices and give up the highly mobile life.”\n“High Mobility in Europe,” by Vincent Kaufmann and Gil Viry, published by Palgrave Macmillan, August 2015.", "summary": "What drives people to spend hours commuting to and from work?

{"id": 1573, "text": "Hydraulics research in French-speaking Switzerland is turning 90 this year. It plays a strategic role in the country’s renewable-energy industry and has changed considerably since Alfred Stucky built the first hydraulics lab in 1928 at what was then the Lausanne School of Engineering – and now EPFL.\nTo mark this anniversary, EPFL’s Environmental Hydraulics Laboratory (LHE) and Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) will be holding a special event at the school’s SwissTech Convention Center on 8 March. And since that is also International Women’s Day, they asked six female Doctoral-School alumnae to be the guest speakers, discussing the state of hydraulics research in Switzerland and internationally. The event will also include videos by other key figures from both business and academia. \nLCH director Anton Schleiss is the event organizer. He has headed the lab for 21 years, and was the one who wanted to put the spotlight on women researchers. Schleiss is also the president of the International Commission on Large Dams and advocates academic research that is both practical and competitive on an international level. We spoke with him about this event and his view of the hydraulics industry.\nWhy did you choose female alumnae as the guests of honor for the commemoration?\nIt’s a message we wanted to send. In my experience, it’s very important for a research lab to include scientists from all over the world and have a good balance of men and women – especially if we want to bring in new ideas, create positive energy and instill respect among colleagues. Around a third of the 50-odd thesis projects that I have supervised were by women, which is a pretty good percentage in this field. The women who will speak on March 8 are active around the world and will share their experience with us.\nHow has your discipline evolved over the years?\nHydraulic energy expanded rapidly in Switzerland and internationally between 1928 and the 1970s. For instance, a number of dams and large hydroelectric plants were built in the Alps. Academic research at the time supported these large-scale projects by providing expert reports that aimed to tackle specific problems, such as by conducting experiments on scale models. Research – that is, with no direct link to a major infrastructure project – didn’t reach EPFL until 1972 when Professor Walter H. Graf joined the school. That research studied things like sediment transport in rivers, sand build-up in dam reservoirs and lake hydrodynamics.\nWhat changed in the 1980s?\nBefore, engineers used concrete to completely dam up rivers and canalize them. But when the Reuss river flooded in the Canton of Uri in 1987 – causing over CHF 1 billion in damage because the whole dike failed – we realized that a river will always return to its original course during a flood. That natural disaster triggered a paradigm shift because it showed us we need to pay more attention to rivers’ natural behavior. So engineers started thinking about how to improve existing dams and build better ones in the future, in order to better protect the environment.\nAnd how did this affect research at EPFL?\nWhen I got to the school in 1997, it wasn’t very well-known in Switzerland for providing expertise on river engineering projects carried out under this new paradigm. Contractors turned mostly to ETH Zurich, even in French-speaking Switzerland. So I helped bring this culture to EPFL and increase the number of publications by our researchers. That bolstered our reputation in the scientific community, not just in Switzerland but around the world. We also developed pioneering theories on subjects like the scouring of rocks by high-velocity jets downstream of dams, models to simulate and predict lake floods in the Alps, and walls to protect areas against floods. Our PhD alumni still use these theories, and many of them have set up their own engineering firms. Of course, the research we conduct at our lab changes in line with industry needs. For example, we developed floating retention dams to use in the case of an oil spill; for that we worked on the artificial beaches set up for the Swiss national exposition in 2002. We also studied the safety of reinforced shafts in high-head hydroelectric plants – that research was prompted by the shaft failure and tragic accident at Cleuson-Dixence, just above Nendaz, in 2000. We were also a pioneer in protecting fish in canalized rivers by creating refuges.\nHow has climate change influenced hydraulics research in the past few years?\nIt has given rise to a host of new research topics. River floods have become more frequent and it is now more important than ever to protect rivers’ natural courses. More recently, the melting of glaciers has become a particularly worrying development in Switzerland. As glaciers melt, they form lakes that carry down increasing amounts of moraine – which can accumulate upstream of dams. If a large chunk of a glacier melted into one of these lakes, that could potentially be very dangerous. So we need to continue studying such scenarios.\nHow have your researchers addressed these issues? \nWe formed cross-disciplinary research teams, which was crucial for identifying all aspects of a given project and thus avoid the objections that could cause delays. We introduced a new methodology called Synergie that aims to develop “multi-purpose engineering solutions.” By that we mean solutions that strike the right balance between generating the power that people need and preserving the natural environment. For example, at Riddes in the Canton of Valais, we suggested creating an artificial lake on the Rhone and building a hydroelectric plant. That would not only generate power, but also help protect against floods and eliminate drawdown in the river. What’s more, a lake would provide a thriving habitat for wildlife, a rest area for migrating birds and even a place to go kitesurfing since the region is very windy.\nDams are still controversial, even within the scientific community. What would you say to detractors? \nOne of the biggest challenges of the 21\nst\n century will be to make renewable energy – and, of course, water – available to everyone under the best possible conditions. Out of the around 60,000 large [over 15-meter-high] dams around the world, only a handful are really debatable. Hydropower still has enormous potential worldwide and could replace many of today’s coal-fired plants. But that’s only if we keep to the notion of “synergy” and don’t try to build the biggest and highest dams at any cost. I often say that we need to build better dams for a better world. And that’s a challenge for engineers and companies alike.\n“Hydraulic Laboratory in Civil Engineering, 1928–2018, 90 years of impact thinking,” 8 March 2018, 3pm–5pm, SwissTech Convention Center.

{"id": 1574, "text": "The agreement signed on 19 December between the State of Valais and EPFL has endorsed the bases of the project launched in January 2012. It confirms the creation of eleven research chairs in energy and health. Additionally, the agreement has enhanced the original project as it now incorporates an experimental research platform named Energypolis as well as the creation of an infrastructure for technology transfer in Valais with the support of the Ark Foundation. The project will be materialized through the construction of a new campus in the Train Station District in Sion, home to the permanent EPFL and HES-SO outposts in Valais.\nThe establishment of the cluster will entail the creation of about 120 to 150 high value-added jobs. The global investment of around 335 million CHF will be distributed throughout the next ten years. The EPFL Valais Wallis campus will open in 2014 and the HES-SO will move in from 2015. The whole constitutes a unique collaboration platform in Switzerland between a Federal Institute of Technology (EPF) and a University of Applied Sciences (HES), paving the way for a vital association linking basic and applied research with innovation. This innovation value chain will be completed with the arrival of CimArk, operational arm of the Ark Foundation.\nLaunch of an international architecture design competition\nThe entities of the EPFL Valais Wallis cluster will be connected to the HES-SO Valais Wallis site in a new campus spanning from the south of Sion’s train station to the Central Institute of Valais Hospitals in Champsec. At the same time, the urban development plan known as \"the City of the 21st century” will also get under way. The new campus will be designed by the winner of an architecture competition in which prestigious Swiss and international architects will participate. This project aims to radically transform the social and economic dynamics of Valais and its relationship with the rest of Switzerland. The scope of the competition is expected to provide international visibility to the canton, symbolic of its innovating ambition and standing.\nEleven chairs and two research groups focused on energy and health\nThe EPFL Valais Wallis academic cluster will comprise a total of eleven chairs and two research groups. EPFL will transfer four chairs and two research groups, and the State of Valais will create seven new chairs. These chairs will be based upon common areas shared by EPFL and the HES-SO Valais Wallis with the purpose of covering the entire added value chain ranging from basic and applied research to economic exploitation. Part of the research will focus on the hydrodynamics of turbomachinery by optimizing the production of hydroelectricity, a method of energy production specific to Valais (currently 10 TWh; potentially + 1.2 TWh). The research will also deal with water management and optimal use of lakes and rivers. Furthermore, another part of research will be devoted to green chemistry (biomass from agricultural areas, CO2 capture and processing, etc.), health (biotechnology / bioengineering) and nutrition. The latter will be achieved in collaboration with SUVA, the western Valais hospitals and the Institute for Research in Ophthalmology (IRO).\nApart from establishing two EPFL health research chairs, the State Council decided to assign the Valais Hospital, in collaboration with the HES-SO, the task of drafting for an architectural competition. The aim of the contest is to design a health campus on the Sion Hospital area, which will stimulate the emergence of valuable collaborations thanks to the proximity of students and researchers from the HES, EPFL and the IRO, as well as health professionals from the Valais Hospital and the SuvaCare rehabilitation clinic.\n“Energypolis”: exceptional testing facilities in Switzerland and in Europe\nThe campus will be complemented with the creation of an infrastructure, unique in Europe, comprising testbeds shared by EPFL and the HES-SO Valais Wallis. Named Energypolis, it will contain impressive facilities for testing hydraulic turbines, hydroelectric dams as well as the water flow on natural and built environments. Some of the equipment used in this project will be moved from Lausanne to Sion. Energypolis will also include a novel “green chemistry” platform for the development of innovative energy sources, particularly from biomass or seaweed farming.\nAn innovation park for technology transfer\n Such research infrastructures will contribute to foster a valuable relationship with industry through the creation of Sion’s “Innovation Park”. Similar to EPFL’s Innovation Square, the park is likely to become a regional hub of the “Swiss Innovation Park” that the federal government intends to create for encouraging technology transfer and wealth creation. The EPFL Valais Wallis Innovation Park will constitute an essential part of the economy of Valais by involving research institutions, large companies and SMEs. It will radiate throughout the entire Valais thanks to the canton’s economic promotion and to the support of the Ark Foundation, which is active in Monthey, Martigny, Sion, Conthey, Sierre and Visp.\nValais to become the pioneer of the Swiss energies of the future and a model for Europe\nTo prove the relevance of the multidisciplinary approach undertaken, the project aims to transform Valais into a large-scale \"systemic demonstrator\". The idea is to illustrate on a regional scale the way energy producers and consumers can interact to achieve an optimal energy flow and be able to make savings while reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. This demonstration will run from Gletsch to St-Gingolph. By integrating all the energy factors pertaining to an entire region (water, CO2, biomass, smart grid), and testing them on its territory, the Valais area will become a model for the energies of the future in Switzerland and internationally.\nFinancial partnership between the State of Valais and EPFL\nThe annual cost of research chairs at the EPFL Valais Wallis cluster will be of 18.3 million CHF during the first seven years. EPFL will provide 9.9 million for the transferred chairs and the State of Valais will allocate 8.4 million to the creation of new chairs. The State will ensure the provision of initial equipment whereas EPFL will take over afterwards. Both parties have also agreed to carry out their search for sponsorship together.\nImpact on the Canton\nThe economic and scientific impact of the agreement signed today will be monitored from 2014 onwards. With the EPFL Valais Wallis cluster, Valais will host a Federal Institute of Technology of international standing. By creating platforms with the HES-SO Valais Wallis and the Ark Foundation, active throughout the entire canton, the academic cluster will directly and indirectly contribute to the entrepreneurial development of Valais and shall give the canton a prominent position in Switzerland and around the world.", "summary": "This morning, the Council of State of the canton of Valais in corpore and EPFL signed an agreement for the creation of the EPFL Valais Wallis academic cluster.

The presentation on sports innovation was included for the first time this year.\nHow are technology and sports related?\n Just like in biomedicine, where technology can enable doctors to carry out less invasive treatments, develop artificial tissue and prescribe personalized therapies, advancements in sporting equipment can enhance performance, aerodynamics, and ergonomics – allowing athletes to push the limits of their sport even further.\nSo will their exploits be human or technology-driven? \n Modern technology can make poles more resistant, skis more flexible and tennis rackets lighter, meaning they are safer and easier for athletes to use. But the records that athletes set will remain a product of their individual or team performance, as they should.\nWhat research areas are used in sports innovation?\n Two prime examples are materials science, to develop components for skis, and microelectronics, to make sensors for studying the movements and mechanics of the human body. Research like this can help athletes to excel in their achievements. Computer science is also being increasingly used to model specific actions, generate real-time images of match statistics and analyze competitors’ performance.\nIs EPFL involved in this research?\n Sports professionals have a long history of teaming up with high-tech labs. EPFL was involved in the design and testing of yachts for the Alinghi team, which won the America’s Cup in 2003 and 2007. EPFL labs also took part in the Solar Impulse project where Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg – a former mechanical engineering student at EPFL – circled the world in a solar-powered aircraft.\nIt sounds like only high-level athletes can benefit from sports innovation.\n No, not at all! Anyone who enjoys playing a sport can use the latest technology. Advancements initially developed for professional athletes are usually launched in the retail market later.

{"id": 1586, "text": "For the past 5 years, Andrea Bassi’s research group has been investigating densification and its effects on urban spaces. In the meantime, the Swiss population has voted to put an end to urban sprawl, putting villages and cities under pressure to accommodate growing numbers of residents without spilling over their perimeters. But what does this mean for people living in cities? Can dense urban centers offer them the quality of life they are after? On Thursday, September 19, Andrea Bassi will present findings from a four-year research project, which focused on the transformation of Geneva’s Praille neighborhood, at the Semaine de la densité, held at the Pavilion Sicli in Geneva.\nIf we look into the past, we come across several failed attempts at urban densification. What have we learned in the meantime that you believe could help us avoid repeating them? \n This is true, but it is important to remember that modernity is still only around 100 years old. 50 years ago, we hadn’t yet had enough time to learn how to deal with such high population densities. And like after any other kind of revolution, be it political, scientific, or social, initially, ideologies dominate. In urban planning, the ideology behind zoning, promoted by Le Corbusier in particular, and the separation of residential, commercial, and industrial areas connected by a transportation network prevailed. Today, in contrast, we have reached a level of maturity that allows us to distance ourselves from these strict ideologies. At least here in Switzerland, we see through them and appreciate the pros and cons of each approach. Rather than blindly applying ideological solutions, we respond to challenges using our knowhow and experience.\nHow can architects address the challenges that come with urban densification? \nOne of the main challenges we run into in cities is personal mobility, largely due to the separation of residential, commercial, and industrial areas. By promoting urban mixity, that is, the coexistence of spaces dedicated to these activities and to recreational purposes, we can reduce the reliance on motorized means of transport. But to architects, this means that we have to put more emphasis on designing the spaces that connect different activities, which lie somewhere at the crossroads between collective, anonymous, and private spaces, and have an appeasing effect by promoting social interactions. Think about it. If you have to drive your children to school every morning for 5 minutes, you are much less likely to interact with a neighbor than if you walk them to school. And the same is true of shopping, the movies, etc. With increased mixity, city life becomes more organic.\nSo what will these dense neighborhoods look like? \nWe understand that there is no single type of building that works best in this context. Instead, we should leverage the diversity of building types and make them coexist – high-end apartments next to subsidized housing, etc. Here, diversity is an important asset. But would we feel comfortable in a city, where some buildings are built using wood, others using concrete, and others still using plastics? I argue in favor of a more homogenous approach based on concrete. In the past century, this would have created a dry, dull atmosphere, but today, we know how to work concrete and take advantage of its many surprising facets.\nWould this be sustainable? \nIt may come as a surprise, but yes. Studies conducted at the federal level have shown that in the middle to long term, building with concrete is more sustainable as building with wood. But it entails a paradigm shift in the way we look at cities. In the past, cities drew on their surroundings for natural resources. Quarries provided stone and sand, while forests provided wood. But today, cities are increasingly becoming their own quarries, where materials from torn down buildings are recycled and provides the primary resources to build new ones. In this case in particular, but also otherwise, the components used to produce concrete are much more local than wood, which is typically transported hundreds of kilometers by truck.\nSo when do we begin moving in this direction? \nWe already are! The master plan for the Praille neighborhood in Geneva is based on a mixed, dense program. A national construction program outlining many of these themes is already in place. The Lemanic metropolis has been a reality for the past two years. And cement recycling is already happening.

{"id": 1594, "text": "The Swiss Energy Strategy 2050 reflects the decision to abandon nuclear power in the medium term. In the coming decades the reduction in the amount of available electricity will need to be made good successively by power generated from other resources. In order to avoid the additional burden on the climate that increased carbon dioxide emissions would entail, the principal candidates are renewables, namely solar and geothermal energy, and wind.\nSupply shortfall in wintertime\nThe amount of electricity generated by solar energy in particular is subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. As a general rule, in summertime PV systems generate more electricity than is needed by the market. In winter, on the other hand, a supply shortfall arises because of reduced solar radiation. There are fewer daylight hours, the sun is lower in the sky, and fog and low stratus cloud frequently impede sunshine at low altitudes in particular. In order to overcome the disparity between supply and demand, electricity produced in the summer needs to be stored for available use in wintertime. This is currently feasible on a large scale only in pumped storage power stations, but available capacities are lacking. Furthermore, this solution entails high energy wastage. For that reason, it would make better sense to generate greater amounts of solar power in winter.\nPV systems in high Alpine regions\nIn a study published recently in the leading scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Annelen Kahl and her colleagues in the snow processes research group of the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF and the Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences (CRYOS), which is affiliated to EPFL, examine whether more electrical energy could be produced in wintertime in particular by installing PV systems not on the Swiss plateau, but in high Alpine regions. Among the resources they utilised to answer this question were data captured by remote sensing satellites, which provide an estimate of solar radiation reaching the ground across the whole of Switzerland. On this basis the researchers calculated the potential for generating electricity with PV systems. This investigation now shows that PV systems installed in high Alpine regions can significantly reduce the seasonal supply shortfall in wintertime because the amount of solar radiation in winter is greater there than on the Swiss Plateau, which is often shrouded in fog.\nSnow raises electricity production\nThe researchers also investigated the influence exerted by the snow-covered ground and the inclination of installed solar panels on the amount of electricity generated. Kahl explains, “When PV systems are installed in the mountains, solar radiation reflected by the snow can be used additionally to produce electricity.” According to the study, this reflected radiation is exploited most efficiently when the solar panels are installed at a steep angle. Taking this action can further increase the amount of electricity generated in wintertime. “Our study shows that PV systems in the mountains, compared with installations on the roofs of buildings in the Swiss Plateau, are much more capable of overcoming the supply shortfall that will arise as a consequence of abandoning nuclear power because, per square metre, solar panels at high altitudes produce electricity not only in larger quantities, but also when it is needed,” adds Kahl.\nSystem trials above Davos\nWith the aid of an experimental system on the Totalp in the Parsenn ski resort above Davos, the SLF and EPFL, together with the utility company that supplies the canton of Zurich (EKZ) and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), are currently examining technical and practical issues arising from the installation of PV systems in the mountains, including the angle at which the panels have to be mounted so that deposited snow slides off by itself.", "summary": "Installing photovoltaic panels in high mountains could significantly reduce the power deficit experienced by this renewable energy in winter, according to a joint study by the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF and EPFL.", "claim": "Installing photovoltaic panels in high mountains could significantly reduce the power deficit experienced by this renewable energy in 2050, according to a joint study by the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF and EPFL.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [18, 18], "noise": false}

Participants will use new technologies to cook up original forms of cultural mediation in a truly creative marathon. At the end of the three days, the general public will be invited to try out the prototypes.\nApplications welcome from all and sundry\nSix 6-person teams will endeavor to create a unique and truly interactive visitor experience. Each team, headed by a coach, will consist of a mediator, designer, maker, coder, content expert and communicator.\nApplications to participate in this creative marathon of cultural mediation have just opened at . The event will take place from 10 to 12 November on EPFL's campus.\nExperts from ArtLab, facilitators and technical teams from FabLabs and Hackerspace will be on hand to help the teams build their prototypes. Museomix CH is still in need of volunteers – particularly technical, IT, graphic design, social media and coaching experts – to help ensure the event runs smoothly. And there are still some spots open on the organizing team too.\nRemixing four adjacent spaces\nAt ArtLab, the museum mixers will train their focus on four adjacent spaces: the Montreux Jazz Café, where visitors can watch and listen to all of the festival's concerts, the Art and Sciences Pavilion, which explores innovative techniques for art installations, DataSquare, where EPFL research on big data is presented, and Place Cosandey in front of the building.\nFor Museomix, which usually works with one or two museums, this will be a new challenge, since ArtLab brings together science and the arts for the general public in one extended space. For EPFL, hosting this year's Museomix means connecting this space with outside communities even more, strengthening the spirit of sharing and interaction with visitors, and developing prototypes in a very tight timeframe.\nVenice, machines and connecting with nature\nThe museum mixers will be given a mission for each of ArtLab's three pavilions. For the Montreux Jazz Café, their task will be to make the equipment for listening, browsing and viewing the festival's archives more interactive and dynamic. In the Art and Sciences Pavilion, which will house an exhibition on interactions between humans and machines, the question of who is really in control will be explored. And in DataSquare, which holds the archives of the city of Venice and a project on modeling the brain, the participants will consider whether the truth is to be found elsewhere.\nThe mixers will also take over Place Cosandey, the outdoor space between the ArtLab building and the Rolex Learning Center. They will be given the challenge of making the square more vibrant and connecting people with nature. Finally, a unifying theme – data waves – will link the four spaces.\nCheck out  for more details.\nMuseomix – an international community\nThis will be the fourth Museomix event in Switzerland. At the same time, mixers will meet in France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Austria and Mexico to transform museums there into giant laboratories and come up with new ways of viewing their collections. Museomix, which was created in France in 2011, is now an international movement. In an increasingly digital world, it aims to tap into our collective intelligence in order to develop new ways of approaching and interpreting museums, placing the visitor at the center of the museum experience.

The robots attempted to accomplish their missions, on the theme of “Body Forward”, in a sometimes highly charged atmosphere.\n The FIRST LEGO League was created 11 years ago and today takes place in 56 countries. It brings together around 200,000 young people who share the same passion for robotics. This first regional event was organized by the Equal Opportunities Office at EPFL: “We created the  a year ago, with the slogan ‘Robots are for girls as well!’. So it seemed logical that they take part in this adventure.” said Farnaz Moser, Director of the office. The result was the creation of Tek No Feel, the most feminine team in the competition.\n Tess, Linda, Amélie, Sébastien and Lucien have been meeting every Saturday from 13:00 to 19:00 since September. “As we’re beginners – it’s the first time we’ve taken part – we built a basic robot and tried to make some improvements,” said Lucien, 12, who was initially apprehensive about starting to work with “intelligent” LEGO bricks.

The objective is that each team collect the maximum number of points throughout the day, and to try in three sessions to accomplish as many missions as possible. The first three teams qualify for the national final.\n At the end of this intense day, Tek No Feel finished 7th ex aequo.

{"id": 1608, "text": "The molecule developed by Cellestia Biotech, an EPFL spin-off, is a targeted therapy designed to treat cancers resulting from a mutation of the Notch gene. Clinical trials are scheduled to start soon in Spain. This oral treatment is the first to work by stopping the problem at its roots, i.e., in the cell's nucleus. It inhibits the protein complex – which allow cancerous cells to multiply – so that they cannot generate signals.\nOne of the alternatives to chemotherapy currently being investigated by experts is the array of signals generated by proteins in a cell’s nucleus. A normal Notch protein plays an indispensable role in embryonic development and in the formation and maintenance of stem cells. Genetic lesions, however, can result in an abnormal signaling pathway that facilitates the development of cancerous cells and causes resistance to conventional therapies. This vicious signaling pathway has been the subject of several recent studies that have confirmed its link to breast cancer, leukemia and several types of lymphoma. Around 250,000 patients worldwide are diagnosed each year with a cancer related to this type of genetic lesion.\nBinding with the protein to keep it quiet \nThe safest way to block the signaling pathway is to cut it off at the source, preventing the protein from activating signals in the nucleus. Molecule CB-103, discovered by Rajwinder Lehal during his doctoral studies in Freddy Radtke's laboratory at EPFL, binds with the protein complex and inhibits its activity inside the nucleus. This cuts off all Notch signals regardless of how they are activated, thereby killing off the cancerous cells. Other therapies that target the Notch signaling pathway have also been investigated by research groups, but their effects remain peripheral – some block only part of the pathway while others inhibit different mechanisms involved in other cellular processes.\nPatents have been filed for the molecule and for the development and marketing of several similar molecules. Both in-vitro and in-vivo tests carried out on the molecule showed excellent efficacy and tolerance. It also demonstrated rapid uptake and distribution in tissues.\nThe clinical trial will be partly funded by the CHF 8 million in seed financing raised by the startup early this year. The researchers will investigate several factors such as tolerability and the dosages for adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Biomarkers have also been developed to ensure that patients taking part in the trial have the right type of cancer for the molecule.\nA highly coveted molecule\n\"The Notch pathway has become a key target for cancer therapies because of the critical role it plays in tumorigenesis. That’s why it’s being researched by so many pharmaceutical companies,\" says Rajwinder Lehal, Chief Science Officer at Cellestia Biotech.

{"id": 1609, "text": "From a Bachelor’s project to the top of the charts. At the invitation of Jilion, a start-up company based in Innovation Square, EPFL computer science student Andrea Coiro developed a weather application for Apple’s iPad for his Bachelor’s project. Yet another weather app? “It’s true that there are already a lot of them on the market,” admits Mehdi Aminian, co-founder of the company. “But most of them are either too tacky or contain too much information, sloppily presented.”\nJilion, which has already developed an Internet service called “Sublime Video” that can incorporate a universal video player into web pages (even readable on iPhone and iPad using the HTML 5 format), was looking for something exceptional, and, above all, beautiful from a design standpoint. “We were naturally interested in what’s being done in luxury watchmaking,” continues Aminian.\nThe application, baptized Aelios, opens onto a world map. In the center, a finely-detailed dial evokes both antique navigational instruments and Swiss luxury watches. The user can drag the dial around the map and zoom, putting the area of interest in the center of the dial. A circle is automatically drawn around the largest city. The local hour is displayed, both digitally and on the 24-hour clock on the dial. The length of the day and night are even shown – in this month of June, you can watch the night portion dwindle to nothing the farther north you drag the dial.\nBut Aelios’ selling point is of course how it shows the weather. As soon as a city is selected, symbols appear around the dial: in a single glance, you can see the local forecast for the entire day. A small tap on the dial and it displays forecasts for the upcoming week. The forecasts come from a service at the world-reputed Norwegian Meteorological Institute (). “Our application is set up to get input from several sources, however – which will soon be implemented in the US,” says Aminian.\nPerformance, speed and an elegant presentation: all the ingredients came together to seduce iPad users. And they didn’t need much persuading. In Switzerland and Germany, thousands of people didn’t hesitate to shell out a few coins (3.30 chf in Switzerland) to buy the app, and in a few days it was the number one iPad download in Apple’s online store. It was quickly at the top of the “weather apps” category in twelve countries, without any promotion at all save a “buzz” that got started on Twitter and an “app of the day” selection by the site Gizmodo.com. “For us it was a pleasant surprise,” admits the Jilion co-founder.\nWhen his project was finished, Coiro joined the Jilion team – a \nmodus operandi \nthat Aminian would like to encourage. “We would like to use this as a model -- get other students going on exciting projects, and then hire them when they’ve proven themselves,” he concludes.", "summary": "Aelios is an application that was developed as an EPFL Bachelor’s project.

{"id": 1612, "text": "The Earth’s orbit is full of all kinds of floating debris; a growing crowd of abandoned satellites, spent rocket stages, bits of broken spacecraft, and fragments from collisions are rocketing around the planet at breathtaking speeds. NASA keeps close tabs on at least 16,000 of these objects that are larger than 10 cm in diameter. When an operational spacecraft such as a satellite collides with one of them, serious, costly damage can result; often the satellite is complete destroyed. And the collision itself then generates thousands more fragments, further exacerbating the problem.\n“It has become essential to be aware of the existence of this debris and the risks that are run by its proliferation,” says Claude Nicollier, astronaut and EPFL professor. To move beyond mere rhetoric and take immediate action to get this stuff out of orbit, the Swiss Space Center at EPFL is launching CleanSpace One, a project to build the first prototype in a family of “de-orbiting” satellites.\nThe project developers have chosen a symbolic target for the initial CleanSpace One launch: either Switzerland’s first orbiting object, the Swisscube picosatellite which was put in orbit in 2009, or its cousin TIsat, launched in July 2010.\nOne satellite, three technological hurdles\n The cleanup satellite has three major challenges to overcome, each of which will necessitate the development of new technology that could, in turn, be used down the road in other applications.\nAfter its launch, the cleanup satellite will have to adjust its trajectory in order to match its target’s orbital plane. To do this, it could use a new kind of ultra-compact motor designed for space applications that is being developed in EPFL laboratories. When it gets within range of its target, which will be traveling at 28,000 km/h at an altitude of 630-750 km, CleanSpace One will grab and stabilize it – a mission that’s extremely dicey at these high speeds, particularly if the satellite is rotating. To accomplish the task, scientists are planning to develop a gripping mechanism inspired from a plant or animal example. Finally, once it’s coupled with the satellite, CleanSpace One will “de-orbit” the unwanted satellite by heading back into the Earth’s atmosphere, where the two satellites will burn upon re-entry.\nAlthough its first model is destined to be destroyed, the CleanSpace One adventure will not be a one-shot deal. “We want to offer and sell a whole family of ready-made systems, designed as sustainably as possible, that are able to de-orbit several different kinds of satellites,” explains Swiss Space Center Director Volker Gass. “Space agencies are increasingly finding it necessary to take into consideration and prepare for the elimination of the stuff they’re sending into space. We want to be the pioneers in this area.”\nThe design and construction of CleanSpace One, as well as its maiden space voyage, will cost about 10 million Swiss francs. Depending on the funding and industrial partners, this first orbital rendez-vous could take place within three to five years.\nAbout space debris\n 16,000 objects larger than 10 cm in diameter and hundreds of millions of smaller particles are ripping around the Earth at speeds of several kilometers per second. From the beginning of the Space Age, Earth’s periphery has been increasingly encumbered by all kinds of debris, primarily concentrated in Low Earth Orbit (less than 2000 km in altitude, where the International Space Station is orbiting) or Geostationary Orbit (35,786 km in altitude). Many of these objects are spent rocket stages or satellites that have broken up in orbit. If they collide with another orbiting object, say a functioning satellite, they can cause massive damage, or even destroy it. This is what happened on February 10, 2009, when the U.S. satellite Iridium-33 exploded upon impact with the abandoned Russian satellite Cosmos-2251. The financial consequences of these collisions are enormous, particularly for insurance companies involved in the space sector; a sum currently estimated at $20 billion to insure existing satellites.\nCases such as this one are bound to increase in number. Even in the immensity of outer space, the increasing density of human-generated waste is becoming a problem. It’s expanding exponentially, because each collision generates in turn several thousand more fragments, which, although smaller, are no less dangerous than a large, abandoned satellite. NASA, which tracks 16,000 of these objects, can only monitor the largest ones (greater than 10 cm in diameter) – but at these incredible speeds even a simple paint chip can seriously damage a solar panel or the window on a shuttle. To avoid the largest objects before they get critically close, the International Space Station must constantly alter its orbit. It managed to do this again just recently, on January 29, 2012.\nLast year the Swiss Re insurance company published a study showing that every year, there is a nearly one in 10,000 chance that a 10 m2 satellite traveling in a sun-synchronous (600-1,000 km) orbit will collide with a piece of space debris larger than 1 cm.", "summary": "The proliferation of debris orbiting the Earth – primarily jettisoned rocket and satellite components – is an increasingly pressing problem for spacecraft, and it can generate huge costs.

They brought their diverse backgrounds and skills to bear on practical, social, and technological challenges at two schools located in migrant camps just outside of Bangalore.\nIn this unique program, however, the prototyped solutions are just one outcome: the other is the valuable learning process that goes into creating them. “We like to say that a prototype is not a product, but a process,” summarizes academic coordinator Marc Laperrouza, a researcher and lecturer in the EPFL  (CDH).\nThe one-room schools, set up by INSSINC partner the , can accommodate up to 60 students of all ages. Space, time, and resources are often in short supply. To ensure that solutions were applicable beyond the context in which they were developed, the three groups of students from Switzerland each tested their prototypes at both schools.\nA new measure of innovation\nDana Ghosn (Mechanical Engineering) addressed the problem of crowding in her project with Jean-André Davy-Guidicelli (Environmental Sciences and Engineering). They reimagined the schools’ open spaces using modular activity boards that doubled as light partitions. The boards – which can support magnets or chalkboards – help to reduce disturbances, while encouraging students to complete educational activities autonomously.\n“The major takeaway from this program for me is the understanding that innovation is much more about positive social impact than profitability,” Ghosn says. “I used to think of innovation in terms of market viability, without realizing that by thinking like that, you focus on people who can afford innovation, thus restricting it to a certain social class. Having learned how to bring together a positive social perspective and professional ambitions is truly special to me.”\nMeanwhile, Valentine Calame (EPFL + ECAL Lab) and Amara Slaymaker (Energy Science and Technology) aimed to optimize the work of the teachers, who spend a lot of time record-keeping using pen and paper. The students noticed that while the teachers did not have access to computers, most did have smartphones, and so they prototyped an easy-to-use, custom app to help take care of administrative tasks.\nFinally, Iscia Vos (Physical Engineering) worked with Patricia Cavestany (Mechanical Engineering) and Romain Talou (EPFL + ECAL Lab) to develop a mobile, modular and washable display panel that could be used to present different types of student projects in different settings. However, practicality was only one driver of the students’ design.\n“We realized that showcasing the students’ work would increase their self-esteem, as well as their parents’ acceptance of the school and teacher, which in turn would have an impact on the community’s perception of education,” Talou explains.\nA “convergence of solutions”\nINSSINC design coordinator Marius Aeberli, who led the 2020 edition, says that this year the final prototypes are the result of “a convergence of solutions”, having been selected from several initial concepts based on the results of field tests.\nThe program organizers are now working to ensure that this unique iterative design process can be applied to other student programs in the future, notably through EPFL’s Digital Resources for Instruction and Learning () program.\n“The INSSINC human-centered design process is invaluable for the development and refinement of social innovation, as it facilitates new streams of thought and techniques to be integrated into very complex and deeply embedded social challenges,” says Hilda Liswani, Business Development Manager at INSSINC partner .\nAbout INSSINC\n INSSINC is a collaboration with a local partner in India, the , which works to bring sustainable energy solutions to under-served communities.

While waiting for it to come out, here is a selection to whet your appetite.\n-\nWhat actually causes hearing loss in humans? And what are the best therapeutic approaches to this problem? These questions are constantly nipping at the heels of doctors. One reason is because current methods of observing cells in the inner ear cannot be done without irreparable damage to the cells. Researchers at EPFL and Harvard Medical School are working on a non-invasive laser technology that would allow for in-vivo, high-resolution images of these cochlear cells for the first time.\nSome nuclear waste has to be safely stocked for thousands of years. Over time, microscopic chemical factories, better known as bacteria, change the storage environment little by little. Researchers have developed a method that combines genetics, computer science and geography to better understand the possible effects of the proliferation of these microorganisms in subterranean environments.\nWhat do rumors on Facebook, viral epidemics and information on cellular telephone networks have in common? Their propagation follows shared rules. Pedro Pinto, researcher in computer science, has written an algorithm that is able to get to the source of the information. He was able to prove, after the fact, the origin of a cholera epidemic in Africa and even the originators of the attack on the Twin-Towers on September 11th.\nThanks to electrical-chemical stimulations and the help of a robot, paralyzed rats have been trained to walk again—and the movement is completely voluntary. Even more surprising is the report that nerve connections grew not only at the medullary lesion but also in the brain itself. The research, published in Science, was picked up by the media around the world.\n-\nThousands of rocket and satellite fragments circle the Earth at a speed of 30,000 km/h, and this proliferation of space debris is a growing risk for space exploration and industry.

{"id": 1637, "text": "A veritable gangrene for steels and other structural metals, hydrogen is one of the most important causes of ruptures in industrial parts, such as pipelines. At the slightest defect in a material, these atoms introduce themselves in the crack and weaken the structure dramatically, making it brittle. The material need only be in contact with aggressive substances or placed in an aqueous environment from which for the dangerous hydrogen atoms enter the material. This phenomenon of \"hydrogen embrittlement\" has been known for many years, but so far no one managed to capture the physical process or predict when hydrogen embrittlement will occur. Bill Curtin of the Laboratory of Multiscale Mechanical Modeling at EPFL and his collaborator Prof. Jun Song at McGill, tackled this problem and developed a mathematical model to understand the behavior of hydrogen atoms in iron-based steels and thus to predict steel fracture. This is revolutionary in the world of materials, and serves as the subject of an article in the journal Nature Materials.\nHydrogen Attracted by Fractures\n To establish their equation, the researchers studied the behavior of iron at the atomic level. They showed that the reason hydrogen weakens the materials comes from the tendency of hydrogen atoms to cluster at the tip of a crack. \"In the absence of hydrogen, dislocation defects form around a crack, allowing it to relax the stress in the material and preventing the crack from growing, making the material more resilient or tougher, explained Bill Curtin. By grouping around the crack, the hydrogen atoms prevent the creation of these dislocations, and prevent the stress relaxation, allowing the crack to grow and the material becomes extremely brittle.\"\nA mathematical model that predicts the fracture\n Using their simulations, the scientists were able to establish a complex mathematical model that calculates when a material in contact with hydrogen will start to break. Several factors are taken into account, such as the concentration of hydrogen in the environment, the speed at which the hydrogen molecules move toward the crack, type of steel, and the load on the structure. If a combination of these parameters attains a critical value, computed from the simulations, then the material will break. Using the model, they predicted the breaking point for a various steels under various conditions. \"Our predictions coincided with the experiments in 9 out of 10 cases, rejoiced Bill Curtin. And the 10th case was right on the border\".\nThis knowledge should allow scientists to tackle the problem armed with new weapons. It will become easier to identify adverse operating modes and to construct materials that are more resistant to this type of deterioration.\n----\nHow does hydrogen come into contact with a material? \n•When welding in damp conditions (presence of H2O).\n •When steels are used in the presence of hydrogen or hydrogenated gas mixtures (hydrocarbons in pipelines, for example)\n •Hydrogen can originate from corrosion in an aqueous environment, for example.\n Additional information:", "summary": "EPFL researchers have elucidated a century-old mystery: how hydrogen destroys steels.

For two weeks in late July 2019, the European Architecture Student Assembly (EASA) will look at the role architecture plays in responding to these challenges.\nThe event will be held in Villars-sur-Ollon, in the canton of Vaud, marking the second time Switzerland is hosting the event; the 2005 edition was held in Bergun, in the canton of Graubünden. The Swiss organizing committee comprises around 15 students, including approximately 10 from EPFL’s architecture section and the remainder from ETH Zurich, the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture (in the canton of Ticino) and the Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD).\nOver 50 different countries\nEASA is a non-profit association run by architecture students. It is intended to promote the culture, exchange and teaching of architecture throughout Europe and is a meeting platform that promotes learning through manual and practical experimentation.\nEASA, which dates back to 1981, is a major event held every year in a city somewhere in Europe. The 2019 edition is expected to attract some 600 architecture students and recent graduates from across the continent, as well as delegations from India and South America and an international delegation. A total of over 50 different countries will be represented. The event will look specifically at the relationship between architecture and tourism, with around 30 different activities planned including theoretical seminars, physical models, interactive presentations and performing-arts shows. In honor of the event’s host town nestled in the Swiss Alps, a special focus will be put on travel in this region.\nAn opportunity for students\n“EASA gives architecture students an opportunity to learn in an environment beyond their school, and for students who haven’t already built full-scale models, a chance to do so,” says Adam El-Hamadeh, a second-year Bachelor’s student in architecture at EPFL and member of the 2019 EASA organizing committee. El-Hamadeh took part in the 2018 edition in Croatia, where he gave a workshop. “Villars-sur-Ollon is an excellent case study. It has a long history of attracting tourists, especially in the winter, but has had to reposition itself over the past few years and keep its infrastructure and hotels operating all year long due to Switzerland’s increasingly warm winters,” he says.\nWith its collegial and decentralized operation, EASA is unique in that it is entirely managed by students.

What is the cost of climate change, and what are the\n possible ways in which we can adapt? “In Switzerland, for example, climate change is\n already affecting winter tourism.

Many countries, including Switzerland, have managed to keep the virus’ spread under control, but the emergence of new hotspots shows that it’s too soon to let our guard down. Hygiene measures and other recommendations can still slow transmission chains. Now Swiss public health officials have a new weapon to combat SARS-CoV-2: the SwissCovid tracing app. Developed over the past few months by an international team, it will be released to the general public at midnight on 25 June 2020. Alain Berset, head of the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs, stressed at a press conference today that it’s essential for as many people as possible to download the app so that the cantonal doctors don’t rely on manual tracing alone to identify those who have come into contact with a carrier of the new coronavirus.\nProtecting others \nThe cantonal doctors conduct a form of manual tracing whereby people who may be infected are notified and instructed to take the appropriate measures (self-isolation and mask-wearing, for example). Scientists estimate that someone infected with the new coronavirus is contagious up to 48 hours before the first symptoms appear. Manual tracing therefore aims to identify everyone who was in contact with a COVID-19 patient during the two days before he or she started showing symptoms.\nAlthough this method is fairly effective, it has some drawbacks. It’s not easy to remember every person you came into contact with over a given period – and if you used public transportation or went to a restaurant, for instance, you probably came into contact with people you don’t know.\nThat’s where the SwissCovid app comes in. It automatically sends alerts to everyone who was within 1.5 meters of a COVID-19 patient for over 15 minutes (the exposure that scientists believe is necessary to become infected) – provided that the patient and the people around him or her have the app. Once a patient tests positive for the disease, he or she must enter his “Covid code” in the app; the notification sent to other users is anonymous.\nData security a top priority \nThe app uses the DP3T protocol, which was developed by a consortium of researchers led by EPFL and ETH Zurich. It is designed for use with both the Android and iOS (Apple) operating systems, making it compatible with almost all smartphones currently on the market. Because the data are stored on users’ phones rather than a central server, they are extremely difficult to hack. And they are stored in a way that makes it impossible to automatically identify users who send out a Covid notification. A \n carried out by MELANI, Switzerland’s Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance, concluded that the app provides an adequate level of data security, despite some vulnerabilities that researchers have identified.\nPilot tests of the app began on 25 May 2020. They were meant to be conducted among select categories of users (including EPFL employees) identified by the Swiss federal government. But in the end over 150,000 people in Switzerland downloaded the beta version of the app – many more than were in the initial test groups.\nThe release version is available for free on  and the  since midnight on 25 June 2020.\nWhat is contact tracing?

They measured the expansion rate – called the Hubble constant, or H\n0,\n – using gravitational lensing, a brand-new technique, completely independent of any previous method, that EPFL’s Laboratory of Astrophysics (LASTRO) has been working on for many years.\nThe study was led by a group called H0 Lenses in COSMOGRAIL’s Wellspring, or H0LiCOW. COSMOGRAIL, which stands for COsmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses, is a large international project initiated by EPFL astrophysicists to monitor gravitational lenses. It represents the most precise measurement yet using the gravitational lensing method, where the gravity of a foreground galaxy acts like a giant magnifying lens, amplifying and distorting light from background objects.\nThe results suggest a faster expansion rate in the local universe than expected. The researchers calculated a Hubble constant value of 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec (with 2.4% uncertainty). This means that for every additional 3.3 million light-years away a galaxy is from Earth, it appears to be moving 73 kilometers per second faster, because of the universe’s expansion. This value differs significantly from the previous number of 67, which was based on observations by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite on how the cosmos behaved more than 13 billion years ago.\nThis troubling discrepancy between the two values – the expansion rate calculated from gravitational lensing measurements of the local universe, and the rate as conventionally predicted from background radiation in the early universe – has caused turmoil in the astrophysics community. This is because knowing the precise value for how fast the universe expands is important for determining the age, size and fate of the cosmos. Unraveling this mystery has been one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics in recent years.\n“If these results do not agree, it may be a hint that we do not yet fully understand how matter and energy evolved over time, particularly at early times,” said H0LiCOW team leader Sherry Suyu of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany.\nS\nix faraway quasars\nThe H0LiCOW team used Hubble to observe the light from six faraway quasars, the brilliant searchlights from gas orbiting supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Quasars are ideal background objects for many reasons; for example, they are bright, extremely distant, and scattered all over the sky. The telescope observed how the light from each quasar was multiplied into four images by the gravity of a massive foreground galaxy.\nThe light rays from each lensed quasar image take a slightly different path through space to reach Earth. The pathway’s length depends on the amount of matter that is distorting space along the line of sight to the quasar. To trace each pathway, the astronomers monitor the flickering of the quasar’s light as its black hole gobbles up material. When the light flickers, each lensed image brightens at a different time.\nThis flickering sequence allows researchers to measure the time delays between each image as the lensed light travels along its path to Earth. To fully understand these delays, the team first used Hubble to make accurate maps of the distribution of matter in each lensing galaxy. Astronomers could then reliably deduce the distances from the galaxy to the quasar, and from Earth to the galaxy and to the background quasar. By comparing these distance values, the researchers measured the universe’s expansion rate.\n“The length of each time delay indicates how fast the universe is expanding,” said team member Kenneth Wong of the University of Tokyo’s Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe. “If the time delays are shorter, then the universe is expanding at a faster rate. If they are longer, then the expansion rate is slower.”\nObserving 40 lensed systems\n“One of the challenges we overcame was having dedicated monitoring programs through COSMOGRAIL to get time delays for several of these quasar lensing systems,” said Frédéric Courbin, a researcher in EPFL’s LASTRO lab, and the founder and leader of COSMOGRAIL.\n“New mass modeling techniques were developed to measure a galaxy’s matter distribution, including models we designed to make use of the high-resolution Hubble imaging,” added Suyu. “The images enabled us to reconstruct, for example, the quasars’ host galaxies and to characterize the environment of the lens system, which affects the bending of light rays. The new mass modeling techniques, in combination with the time delays, help us to measure precise distances to the galaxies.”\nBegun in 2012, the H0LiCOW team now has Hubble images and time-delay information for ten lensed quasars and intervening lensing galaxies. The team’s goal is to observe 30 more lensed quasar systems to reduce their 2.4% percent uncertainty to 1%.\nContact: \nEPFL:\nFrédéric Courbin, EPFL Astrophysics Laboratory,  +41 22 379 24 18\nMartin Millon, EPFL Astrophysics Laboratory, , +41 22 379 24 39\nNASA:\nDonna Weaver, Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, , +001 410-338-4493\nRay Villard, Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, , +001 410-338-4514", "summary": "New measurements using gravitational lensing, an innovative method that EPFL researchers have been working on for many years, suggest the universe is expanding faster than previously thought.", "claim": "New measurements using gravitational lensing, an innovative method that EPFL researchers have been working on for 24 18, suggest the universe is expanding faster than previously thought.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [17, 18], "noise": false}

However, it was held in person and with all the dignity – and festivity – warranted by such an event. A total of 1,072 Master’s students received their degrees during this unprecedented ceremony held over two days, 2–3 October, in the time of COVID-19.\nIn keeping with the sober tone, the ceremony was not held in the large auditorium in the SwissTech Convention Center (STCC), but rather in its less-prestigious smaller rooms, in certain auditoriums and in the Rolex Forum. Despite the more spartan setting, attendees were dressed just as elegantly with smiles beneath their masks and, for a few of them, tears in their eyes. Each graduate could invite up to two people, and the attendees were divided by section into groups of under 300 people each. Social distancing was maintained inside the rooms.\nEPFL President Martin Vetterli addressed the graduates virtually this year, with a speech that had been prerecorded on the STCC’s large stage. “Dear EPFL alumni, you are more than scientists, engineers and architects: you are also, most importantly, citizens of the world. With the degree we are granting you today, you have the chance to have a real impact. You also have a duty towards society and the future of our planet,” he said.\nSurprise guest Thomas Wiesel \nThe ceremony included awards for outstanding students and the Polysphère awards for the best teachers (see insets). Also on hand to congratulate the students was a surprise guest: local comedian Thomas Wiesel. In a two-part video filmed at the Satellite and at Place Cosandey, he adroitly and playfully poked fun at the School and its students. Even this year’s sober tone didn’t stop people from enjoying Wiesel’s jokes. And as Chloé Carrière, the EPFL student who hosted the ceremony, pointed out: “Thomas didn’t go easy on us, but he did save us from a 2.5-hour-long ceremony.” His video lasted 38 minutes.\nAlumni Awards\nWiesel’s video was followed by the handing out of degrees, although this year it was performed by section heads and with the required social distance between each person.\nThe Alumni Awards will also be given differently this year: a separate ceremony will be held at the Rolex Learning Center on 13 November, from 12:15pm to 1:15pm. The 2020 winners are Leila Schwery-Bou-Diab, who graduated with a chemistry degree in 1999 and is now the Vice President of Value Chain Management for a Johnson & Johnson company, and Robert Mardini, who graduated with a civil engineering degree in 1996 and is now the Director General of the ICRC.

Another car passes the vehicle in front of it, after the driver pushes the appropriate button. A truck recognizes a traffic jam and automatically slows down. All of these highly automated driving features have been developed through the collaboration of the European automotive industry and scientific community, with an eye toward making driving safer, more environmentally-friendly and more comfortable. The developments will be presented today and tomorrow at the Final Event of the EU funded research project HAVEit (“Highly automated vehicles for intelligent transport”) in Borås (Sweden) and at the nearby Hällered Volvo test track. Seven demonstration vehicles will be on display. With Volvo, EPFL has developed a color camera designed to recognize traffic light signals up to 130 meters away.\nCollaboration of different partners\n 17 partners from the European automotive industry, including Continental, Volvo Group, Volkswagen, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), as well as EPFL, have worked together to develop vehicle concepts and technologies through this project. Aside from networking technical innovations from research and science, HAVEit also aimed to secure the top spot in the international automotive industry for Europe and to tie together research and development resources.\nA Hybrid Bus—Active Green Driving Technology\n EPFL technology is integrated into one of the seven vehicles that have been developed—a hybrid bus that uses Active Green Driving Technology that takes hybrid technology, a combination electric and gasoline vehicules, to a new level. Hybrid vehicle technology can go much further in improving energy efficiency by making the switch between electric driven and gas driven modes to store brake energy created when going downhill automatic, for example. Automatically switching between these sources with high efficiency due to advanced information gathered from various sensors is called hybrid driveline control. Beyond the purely automatic control, the driver learns to interpret these data and drive more appropriately – he or she is even given feedback during and at the end of each trip.\nOne key aspect of hybrid driveline control is the detection of stop lights at a considerable distance ahead. The color camera mounted on the front of the bus recognizes red lights that are 5 to 60 meters away (working range) and could detect up to about 130 meters. The camera, developed at, transmits this information to an onboard computer that fuses data about the vehicle's surroundings from several sources. The camera needs to be rugged and withstand freezing temperatures in the coldest streets of Europe and around the world. Automobile compliable, modular and low-cost, it uses algorithms to dependably recognize red lights among the multitude of information captured. These algorithms make corrections for the relatively low quality images that are a result of automobile regulations for such devices.

{"id": 1660, "text": "The pressure was on. Not only did last year’s EPFLoop team put in a hugely successful showing, but this year’s team invested a lot of time and energy in a design that would make it through the qualification round. However, the effort paid off – the team was one of the 20-odd entrants selected to compete in the 2019 Hyperloop Pod Competition, beating out thousands of other hopefuls. “Even though we’ve already spent hundreds of hours putting together our team, designing our pod and finding sponsors, the real work is only just beginning,” says Lorenzo Benedetti, the EPFLoop team’s technical leader.\nThe idea for the Hyperloop Pod Competition came from Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who wanted to promote a fifth kind of transportation – in addition to cars, trains, planes and boats – whereby passengers travel in pods propelled through vacuum tubes called Hyperloops at speeds of up to 1,000 km/h. His company SpaceX launched the Competition in 2015 to test the technical feasibility of his idea. Student teams have to design a self-propelled pod that can travel through a 1.2 km-long Hyperloop test track at maximum speed with successful deceleration.\n“Being part of a competition so difficult, where the level of engineering is so high, is an invaluable experience. Last year the team learned how to work with SpaceX engineers, discuss technical specifications and solutions, and implement those solutions within a 24–48-hour timeframe. This year we have a better grasp of what the competition organizers expect and are better poised to meet their requirements, starting with the testing phase at EPFL,” says Benedetti. This year’s competition will take place mid-July 2019 on the test track at SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, like last year.\nLighter and more powerful \nThe EPFLoop team has unveiled the name of its pod: \nBella Lui\n. But the team members are understandably keeping the design and technical details under wraps. Benedetti has nonetheless given us clues about the team’s strategy: “The most important metric for a winning pod is a high power-to-weight ratio. The top three teams last year (from TUM, Delft and EPFL) had pods with very similar ratios, and they all performed nearly equally in the finals. This year we will aim to reduce the weight as much as possible while increasing the power available for the propulsion system.”\nSupported by the EPFL Vice-Presidency for Education in the context of interdisciplinary projects, the EPFLoop team currently has 38 members including 33 EPFL students from seven sections.

{"id": 1666, "text": "For more than 100 years, electricity grids around the world have worked with alternating current (AC). However, direct current (DC) is now back in fashion and – thanks to advances in power electronics – is already becoming the new norm.\n Today, most of our appliances such as computers, LEDs and electric cars all run on DC. Batteries and photovoltaic panels also produce DC current. And while high-voltage DC is an efficient and proven method for transporting power over large distances, the interconnection still requires legacy AC grids. If we are to one day achieve DC grids that can facilitate the smart grid concept, further technological progress in this area is still needed. This transition will require flexible, efficient and high-performance power electronic conversion devices – commonly referred to as solid-state transformers (SSTs).\nSSTs can perform any desired electrical energy conversion (i.e., AC-AC, AC-DC, DC-DC, DC-AC), depending on the needs of the application. In this way they are similar to a multi-purpose Swiss Army knife.\nThis is where EPFL’s researchers from the School of Engineering’s \n(PEL)\ncome in. They have developed a way of optimally designing and producing medium-frequency transformers (MFTs), which are one of the key enabling technologies for SSTs.\nThe researchers have designed, optimized and built a working MFT prototype, rated for 100kW and operated at 10kHz. Following rigorous testing, it serves as the basis for technical tutorials, some of which have already been given to various specialists from the academic and industrial worlds.\nControllability of power grids\n Full controllability can be achieved. “We can be highly flexible and quickly alter the power flow – and we can do that very efficiently,” explains Marko Mogorovic, one of the device’s designers. “This will be very important when it comes to integrating the intermittent energy generation from renewable sources into tomorrow’s smart grids.”\nThe higher the frequency, the smaller the MFT\n Another plus is the small size of the device: “In an AC system, the frequency at which transformers operate depends on that of the surrounding grid. In Europe, that frequency is fixed at 50Hz,” explains Drazen Dujic, director of PEL. Since the frequency cannot be changed, miniaturization is impossible.\n“In a DC system, however, transformers operate within converters at very high frequencies of up to several tens of kilohertz, thanks to power electronics. And the higher the frequency, the more compact the device,” says Dujic.\nThe reduced size of these transformers will be particularly useful in traction systems, in terms of both efficiency and integration: “A lighter locomotive would consume much less energy,” says Mogorovic. In traction systems, the device would transform the AC from the railway lines into DC for the traction/propulsion chain. The railway grid in Switzerland operates at 16.7Hz, which until now has translated into rather bulky transformers inside the locomotives.\n At the same time, however, miniaturization represents a real challenge for engineers, who have to deal with many cross-disciplinary constraints, including thermal, dielectric and magnetic issues. EPFL researchers developed a set of sophisticated and very fast models that can quickly generate several million designs. It makes it possible to then select the best design, depending on the performance they want to achieve.\n“The fact that we’ve made this type of transformer inside a lab is a major step, given the safety and function-related problems that usually arise,” explains Dujic. “We managed to get it to work perfectly. That’s what’s important for experts in this field.”\nA gathering of such experts is already scheduled. The European Center for Power Electronics (ECPE) will hold a workshop called “New Technologies for Medium Frequency Solid State Transformers” on 14–15 February 2019 at EPFL.

{"id": 1667, "text": "For members of EPFL Racing Team, the winter exam session ended with an additional – and significant – challenge: on 31 January, the students spent the day demonstrating their technical expertise in an attempt to qualify for this summer’s Formula Student races. They qualified for competitions in Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany this summer, having already made it into July’s season-opening race in Zurich as one of the home teams. So it will be a summer of speed for the approximately 50 students, including two women, who are taking part in EPFL’s motor racing adventure.\nFor many of the team’s members, the challenge started more than a year ago. “Our 2020 car is the result of all the experience we gained in 2019 and the lessons we learned from the mistakes we made,” explains José Hajjar, who is in charge of partnerships. “Last year, our aim was to have a functioning car. This year, we want a high-performance car. We’re doing all the same things, but twice as well.”\nThe team’s efforts have focused on improving the car’s engine, weight, batteries, layout and structure. EPFL Racing Team’s single-seater will have two engines, one to control each of the rear wheels, supported by an electronic assistance system instead of a differential. “The control software will take into account all of the car’s fundamental parameters in real time in order to control things like skid and stability,” says team leader Pierre Georges. “So it will really boost performance.”\nLighter and faster\nThe car is not only smarter but also lighter, because some of the mechanical equipment is no longer required. Although the 2020 model features roughly the same design as last year’s version, its weight will drop from around 300 kg to around 200 kg. That reduction is the result of improvements in the construction process, but also in materials due to greater use of carbon fiber for example. The battery represents another key enhancement. “By using copper connections between the battery cells, we can reduce resistance and increase output throughout a race,” says Hajjar. All of these innovations do not come cheap: the budget has almost doubled between 2019 and 2020.\n“This year we have rethought every aspect and how it affects the rest of the car,” says Georges. The team has received support from EPFL through the MAKE program and is advised by Mario Paolone, a leading expert in batteries.\nPublic unveiling on 12 May\nThe design process for all of the car’s various components has now been completed and the custom parts are being built in-house. Final assembly will take place between mid-March and mid-April, in time for 12 May, when the car will be unveiled to the public at EPFL’s Rolex Learning Center. Its first competition will take place from 15 to 19 July in Zurich. EPFL Racing Team will then take part in races in Most, Czech Republic from 20 to 26 July, Zalaegerszeg, in Hungary from 4 to 9 August, and in Hockenheim, Germany from 17 to 23 August.\nFormula Student, which was created 40 years ago, gives engineering students a chance to design a single-seater racing car to take part in competitions in various countries. The challenge involves designing the car and racing in up to nine competitions in Europe per year.

Smartphones and tablets, with built-in GPS devices, are now capable of automatically obtaining relevant information on historical monuments and leading tourists, step by step, along historically outstanding routes.\nImagination knows no boundaries when it comes to enriching a walker’s experience. Tania Palmieri and Orhan Öçal have proven the former with their end of semester project for the College of Humanities. The two master students jumped at the suggestion of Frédéric Kaplan, head of the Digital Humanities Laboratory. The idea was to find the places depicted in the prints of the book: “Merveilleuse Venise” by Sophie Monneret and then create a database focused in the transformation they have been through the years.\n\"Our goal was to find the corresponding present-day image for each print, taken from the same angle,\" says Tania.

Thus, this possibility is visible on the image and also displayed on a list to the right of the screen.

{"id": 1683, "text": "With a projection head of 1 cm3 , and a total size smaller than a credit card, this new micro projector is a real breakthrough. It can be integrated in a portable computer or mobile telephone , or even an MP3 reader, while keeping its bright, high-quality image. This new device will enable the projection of documents and videos onto a wall, in the same way as current fixed projectors. The size of the image can be adjusted simply by modifying the distance between the projector and the projection surface; the resulting image remains uniformly clear.\n Another significant advantage: this projector uses very little energy, requiring on average 30% less current than the matrix- or LED-based technology currently available on the market. This solution, now being finalized, should be available in 2011 for industrial applications, and the following year for consumer electronics, according to Nicolas Abelé, Technical Director of the start-up, located in the EPFL Science Park.\n Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are only beginning to be used as a basis for the next generation of optical material. “This micro-projector functions using tiny mirrors of less than a millimeter’s thickness. Positioned on a silicon (wafer) disc, they reflect red, blue and green laser beams,” explains Maher Kayal, the EPFL research director who developed the microelectronic aspects of the system. The device, contained in a tiny glass case (3 mm x 4 mm), oscillates so rapidly that the beam can scan a surface up to 20,000 times a second. In August, Maher Kayal’s team was able to generate a color image in VGA resolution (640 x 480px) for the first time.\n This pocket projector works at a minimum distance of 50 centimeters, and enables the projection of images onto a surface equivalent to a 15-inch screen. During the last few months, the Lemoptix team has considerably improved the architecture of the optical head containing the laser light sources and the MEMS mirrors, thereby reducing the size of the whole device and its energy consumption. The manufacturing and assembly processes have also been defined, and the first sub-contractors identified. Moreover, the company succeeded in raising 1.4 million Swiss francs of new funds at the end of August.\n This technology has many advantages that will enable it to succeed in the market. “The micro-components used can be manufactured in thousands, even tens of thousands, at low cost,” emphasizes Nicolas Abelé. It will be developed from now until end-2011 for industrial applications. For example, it could be used by automobile manufacturers to project information directly onto the windshield, such as speed, GPS information etc. Medical technology companies have already shown an interest: this technology could be used to beam information related to an operation directly onto the patient, and would avoid the surgeon having to lift his head to look at a screen. The improved brightness and contrast will enable it to replace LCD screens. The Lemoptix team is already envisioning the creation of an interactive version; this would allow you to touch the projected image to zoom or change screen.\n Contacts:\tNicolas Abelé, Technical Director, Lemoptix,  – 021 550 61 13\n Maher Kayal, Professor at l’EPFL,  – 021 693 39 81", "summary": "The projector of the future, 1 cm3 of technology that can be integrated into a portable computer or mobile telephone, is about to take the market by storm. , a spin-off of EPFL, working together with the , completed its development at the beginning of September.

He was at the heart of discussions with Google and Apple to have them adopt the \"DP3T\" protocol led by the two Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology. Alfredo Sanchez, project manager, notes that \"this gives a great responsibility to the Swiss testers, as many other countries intend to adopt the same protocol later on.\" \nThis pilot phase will last a few weeks until the Swiss parliament decides on the revision of the law on epidemics. \nThe purpose of the application is to signal to a user that he or she has been in prolonged contact with one or more people who subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. With this information, the user can be tested and take additional precaution in order to prevent the spread of the disease. \"This digital tracing will not replace protective measures, but it is the best way to control the evolution of the epidemic,\" said Alain Berset, Federal Councillor in charge of the Department of the Interior, a few weeks ago.\n\"Privacy by design\"\nThe effectiveness of the app depends on its widespread adoption by the public. To achieve maximum uptake, the protocol designers chose to minimize the collection and sharing of information. \"Our goal is to offer a solution that can be adopted in Europe and around the world,\" explains Professor Carmela Troncoso, head of the Security & Privacy Engineering Laboratory at EPFL, the originator of the DP3T protocol. \"There are millions of users and we owe it to them to be transparent.\"\nSwissCovid operates in a \"decentralized\" way, which means that the operations that are essential from a privacy point of view are not carried out on a centralized server, but on each phone. The app uses Bluetooth to exchange and record the ephemeral proximity identifiers of other phones in the vicinity. These identifiers are kept on the phone unless a person is tested positive for COVID-19. In that case, their doctor will give them a single-use code that allows them to voluntarily share the ephemeral keys on their own phone that correspond to the days when the person was contagious. These keys are sent to a server managed by the Swiss administration.\nIf the application concludes that there is prolonged (more than 15 minutes) and close (less than 2 meter) contact with COVID-positive people, it will generate a notification to the phone’s user indicating the day of exposure to the risk and the procedure to follow.\nAlmost all countries, especially in Europe, are following Switzerland's lead in launching their own digital tracing application based on this decentralized protocol. This should facilitate the interoperability of the systems when traveling abroad. \nA targeted but real pilot phase\nFor the time being, \"pilot populations\" designated by the Federal Council are being asked to download the SwissCovid application.

{"id": 1686, "text": "You move, he moves. You smile, he smiles. You get angry, he gets angry. “He” is the avator you chose. Faceshift, from EPFL’s Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory, now offers a software program that could save time for the designers of animation or video games. Thibaut Weise, founder of the start-up, smiles and nods. On the screen his avatar, a fantasy creature, directly reproduces his gestures. This system could enhance the future of video games or even make video chats more fun.\nOne tool required: a camera that has motion and depth sensors in the style of Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion, well known to gamers. During its first use, the software needs only ten minutes to recognize the user’s face. The user reproduces several basic expressions requested by the program: smile, raise eyebrows, etc. “The more movement is incorporated into the program’s 50 positions, the more realistic are the results,” explains Thibaut Weise, creator of the start-up currently based at the Technopark in Zurich. Then you can get into the skin of your character and animate by moving yourself. “It’s almost like leaving your body to enter that of your avatar,” jokes the young entrepreneur.\nSaving time for animated films\nThe challenge for the research team in the laboratory of Computer Graphics and Geometry was to find an algorithm to superimpose the depth data from the camera with the color of the image and avatar in one step. They demonstrated that 3D facial movements could be reconstructed in real time without using facial markers or complex scanning hardware.\nIn an animated film or a video game, the facial expressions of characters are defined with a program that permits the movement of different parts of the face, step by step. To simulate anger, for example, it’s necessary to knit each eyebrow in two or three clicks, then stretch the mouth down, and so on. With the Faceshift software, mimicry and “emotions” of the avatar follow those of the actor, rendering the work more fun and certainly faster. “This new tool can reduce the time to make a film by up to 30%,” asserts Weise.\nOne imagines the purpose is to directly animate the face of one’s avatar in a video game. Already in contact with the major designers of video games, Thibaut Weise believes that the next generation of 3D cameras will enable his company to take off.

{"id": 1689, "text": "More than a quarter of all breast implants must be removed within four years, because neighboring tissues develop a rigid envelope of fibrous tissue to protect themselves from the foreign body. Labseed, a start-up company based in the Science Park in Ecublens, has developed a protective covering made up of a nanostructured surface and a layer of collagen that will prevent the body from rejecting the implant.\nOur bodies treat all medical or plastic surgery devices- things like breast implants, knee and hip replacements, pacemakers and insulin pumps - as foreign invaders. We’re equipped with a complex surveillance system for recognizing and then eliminating them. In the empty intracellular space between the device and neighboring tissues, special cells that are in charge of this reaction, called fibroblasts, assemble to deal with the intruder. In certain cases, sometimes even several years after the implant is placed, they surround it and cover it in a very hard capsule. In addition to its unattractive appearance, particularly in breast implants, this reaction can also prevent the implant from functioning properly, such that in a quarter of patients, implants must be removed within four years after implantation.\nLabseed co-founders Hicham Majd and Giorgio Pietramaggiori have developed a technique that eliminates this problem, and in vivo results have demonstrated the effectiveness of their new approach. The major advance of their technique is that it renders foreign bodies virtually “invisible” to cells that are watching out for invaders. This new surface treatment technology, called “MYcoat,” was developed from research done in EPFL’s Laboratory of Cell Biophysics and improved in the Laboratory of of Biomechanical Orthopedics in the frame of a CTI discovery project. It combines nano/microtechnology and biochemistry.\nMycoat structures the surface of a medical device or implant at a nanometer-level precision. The implant is then coated with collagen. In this way, neighboring cells are no longer in direct contact with the foreign body but with the nanometer-structured, collagen-coated surface. To the cells, this protective coating looks like just a new extracellular matrix, which they see as normal tissue. The fibroblasts will thus adhere quite naturally to the object, as if it was an integral part of the patient’s body.\nThe procedure has been finalized for silicon implants, but is also applicable for titanium elements. “Collagen, which makes up 80% of our bodies, is particularly well tolerated,” says Pietramaggiori.\nThis technique improves the interaction between the medical implant and the human body. Its simplicity of application makes it particularly attractive for major medical prosthesis and implant manufacturers. “Discussions are underway with major breast implant manufacturers,” the co-founder adds. This new technique will require an additional step at the end of the manufacturing process, and could be integrated as early as 2013.", "summary": "A technology developed by labseed, an EPFL spin-off, could prevent most breast implant rejections.

{"id": 1702, "text": "Despite the pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout, your company managed to raise CHF 92 million in funding – CHF 56 million in 2019 and the rest very recently. What's your secret?\nIt was precisely because of the pandemic that we decided to streamline our fundraising efforts by continuing a third round rather than starting a new one. So we signed up the same set of investors, mainly Swiss, as well as a few others they had brought on board. This eliminated the need to make lots of presentations to attract new investors, which would have been difficult in light of the public-health situation.\nIn 2011, when you were a professor at EPFL, your lab developed an algorithm that transforms how computer buses transfer data. This breakthrough technology was the subject of your first patent. Is that when you came up with the idea for a start-up, with the anticipation that it would take off?\nWithin an hour of our system working for the first time, we thought it would be a good idea to create a start-up. It was immediately clear that, while our technology could give rise to some outstanding research papers, the best way to spotlight it would be through a company. However, Kandou Bus grew much more slowly than we had anticipated in our original business plan, which called for a few months’ R&D work at EPFL, a prototype in under a year, and funding rounds the following year to turn the system into a marketable product. We were hoping to get where we are now in just four years. But when the applications for your invention are in brand-new territory, as was the case for us, then the process is like skiing down a treacherous slope at night with only a flashlight. You have limited visibility, you have to react with lightning speed and, if necessary, change course without falling over. Under such circumstances, finding your way takes time.\nWhat were the key development steps for your business?\nWe're lucky that our technology is a horizontal one – that is, it concerns all segments of the computer-component market instead of just one narrow application. The downside of this was how to gauge the market early on to determine which segment to target first. During this phase, which lasted three years, we were in stealth mode; we didn't share what we were working on. Fortunately, the CEO of a US start-up, which had become a multinational some years earlier, believed in our technology. He loaned us CHF 10 million in 2012 so that we could keep our head above water. Then in 2014, after delivering a paper at a high-profile industry conference, someone from Marvell, a semiconductor company, expressed real interest in our system. It took two more years to secure this first contract, which really set us on our way.\nSuccessful IT start-ups are rare in Switzerland. What are the advantages of being based at EPFL?\nFirst of all, I live here and I love this region – that's important. Also, because there's not much ICT here, it's easier to blaze your own trail. At a place like Silicon Valley with so many successful high-tech firms, newcomers have a tendency to imitate them in order to get backing, even though that might not be the best course for their business. Finally, being positioned outside the microcosm, and its attendant discussions, lends us an air of mystery, which is an advantage during negotiations. Locating our company at EPFL was a strategic choice at the beginning. I was a professor there and needed to be able to shuttle quickly between the company and my office. Now, however, it gives us a clear advantage in hiring talented young engineers and keeping abreast of research developments.\nWhat advice would you give to entrepreneurs want to create a fast-growing start-up?\nBeing an entrepreneur is a lot like being a scientist – you have to be passionate about what you do from the outset. You can't invent it later on. Without that kind of enthusiasm, it's extremely difficult to succeed because your personal investment is crucial: developing ideas takes up a lot of time and you don’t get much vacation or weekends off. This kind of commitment is also what allows you to weather the storm when nothing goes according to plan. Afterwards, the fast growth comes on its own. There's no big mystery about the early funding period. You have to cultivate your network, but if an investor doesn't latch on, there's no point spending huge amounts of time trying to convince them. You can see right away if someone's interested.\nWhat are your plans after this substantial funding round?\nNow our main goal is to market our first chip for all USB-C connections by spring 2021. This chip allows for faster, lower-power data transfer between all types of devices: smartphones, computers, external hard drives, and so on. We’re currently in the final development phase for the high-end version. Over the next year, we’ll roll out other chips aimed at a much larger market. This will be our first widely-distributed product.\nWhere do you see your company in ten years or so – is an IPO in the cards? Will Kandou be the next Logitech?\nIn terms of success, I think Kandou Bus will follow in Logitech's footsteps. My goal is to supply chips for all the devices people use to communicate. Today, systems are built using components, and we’re designing those components. But we’re planning to fabricate finished products based on our technology within a decade. Our technology will likely be used in satellites. With regards to our business model, we want to remain an independent company.

But existing monitoring systems typically rely on bulky sensors and an array of cables that prevent patients from being able to move comfortably. Smartcardia, an EPFL spin-off, has developed a small patch that contains a fusion of wireless sensors on a single unit, thereby eliminating the need for cables to connect the data collection devices with data storage and display equipment. An internet connection is all doctors need to be able to view and track patients’ vital signs remotely and in real time, such as on a smartphone or smartwatch.\nThe patch can be applied easily to patients’ chests. It has been tested successfully on hundreds of patients at several hospitals and has proven to be just as reliable as existing cable-intensive systems. It recently obtained the European Union’s CE marking for medical devices; large-scale production has already started and the device will be launched on the Swiss and EU markets in the coming days. “Patients and medical staff alike really appreciate this new wireless system,” says Tiziano Cassina, head of intensive care at Fondazione Cardiocentro Ticino, a cardiac surgery center in Lugano and one of the facilities where the patch was tested.\nResearchers in both the private and public sector have long been trying to develop wireless sensors reliable enough to be used on critical-care patients. According to Smartcardia CEO Srinivasan Murali, this patch is the first that performs well enough to replace conventional monitoring systems. Murali and his team spent several years at EPFL developing their device and the complicated algorithms needed to effectively screen out interference signals from things like patients’ movements and deliver extremely accurate results.\nMonitoring patients at home in real-time \nThe patch is around 20 cm² and can be worn under patients’ clothes as they go about their daily activities. Which means the startup’s next step is to deploy the system to monitor patients’ symptoms while they are at home – preventing them from having to make frequent trips to the hospital. “This kind of system could be used for patients with chronic cardiac or pulmonary diseases, or people with sleep disorders,” says Francisco Rincón, Smartcardia CTO. That could help prevent complications and reassure patients living under the sword of Damocles. “ Home monitoring of patients is one of the major new frontiers in healthcare, because the remote data collection from patients suffering from chronic diseases would allow to timely diagnose a worsening of the illness and a prompt management could prevent hospital readmission. The continuous stream of vital clinical signs, with the acquisition of relevant physiological signals from a single point-of-care device could encompass out-patient monitoring with in-hospital backup by on-site physician evaluation ” says Cassina.\nSpotting potential health problems early with artificial intelligence \nSmartcardia is also working on a system that can spot health problems early on and alert care givers. The system uses artificial intelligence and big data to provide important information about a patient’s condition before it gets serious. For example, it can detect slight changes in a patient’s vital signs and link them together – such as a small increase in blood pressure at the same time as a decrease in blood oxygen level or respiratory rate – in order to compare them with existing models. “There is currently no preventive system out there that looks at key vital signs and is so complete,” says Murali. Large-scale clinical trials of the system on over 2,000 patients is under way.", "summary": "A small, wireless patch developed by EPFL spin-off Smartcardia can measure emergency-room patients’ vital signs with the same reliability as existing systems involving cumbersome cables.

{"id": 1715, "text": "What do marching soldiers, a children’s playground and a paper clip have in common? The answer came in a lively presentation by Margaux Larcher, a PhD student at the Laboratory of Thermomechanical Metallurgy (LMTM), at the finals of EPFL’s My Thesis in 180 Seconds (MT180) competition. Using just the right words, carefully chosen metaphors and a dash of humor, she explained how the seemingly random movement of atoms in the shape memory material she is studying is, in fact, synchronized. Larcher’s presentation won over the jury and wowed the audience. Under normal circumstances, it would have drawn thunderous applause. But these are unusual times, and the 600-seater Rolex Forum was almost empty, with fewer than 50 audience members in attendance because of measures against the coronavirus. The event was live-streamed on  to allow spectators to cast their vote for the audience award (voting closes at 6pm tonight).\nMaterials were the star of the show last night as Rita Drissi Daoudi, another PhD student from the same lab as Larcher, took second place for her presentation on a system that detects manufacturing defects by “listening” to 3D-printed parts as they’re being made. Her audio detection method could one day be used to fix imperfections on the fly and stop defective components such as aircraft parts and hip implants from rolling off the production line. This year is the first time that EPFL will send two women to the national final, which will take place at the Rolex Forum on 26 May.\nThird place went to Sébastien Le Fouest for his presentation on vertical-axis wind turbines, which are smaller and more versatile than conventional horizontal-axis versions but have the disadvantage of being more fragile. Le Fouest is a PhD student at the Unsteady Flow Diagnostics Laboratory (UNFOLD), where he is investigating ways to overcome this fragility by studying the formation of vortices. In his presentation, for which he’d already picked up an audience award, he used his body to show how the wind acts on the blades. The other audience winner was Alice Gillen from the Laboratory of Nanobiotechnology (LNB) for her research into sensors that could deliver a steady dose of dopamine, in just the right amount, to patients with Parkinson’s disease.\nHigh-caliber presentations\nThe jury was chaired by Professor Marilyne Andersen from the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). She was particularly impressed with the caliber of this year’s entries. “The presentations were of such a high standard that we thought each one was going to be the winner – until the next one came along and made us reconsider,” says Prof. Andersen. The 14 PhD students who competed last night were able to successfully distill several years’ worth of research into just three minutes. The audience, watching in person and online, was treated to a whirlwind tour that included cell transport mechanisms for Alzheimer’s disease drugs, a magnetic probe for a nuclear fusion reactor, and a system for cooling hydrogen fuel cells. The students’ hard work and public-speaking skills turned these otherwise dry subjects into clear and engaging presentations.", "summary": "The fifth annual My Thesis in 180 Seconds competition was held behind closed doors last night because of the coronavirus.

During the day and at night.\nLast weekend, eight fearless students headed to Crans-Montana, high in the Swiss Alps, for the dive at Lake Moubra. The exercise was just one of several grueling activities at a boot camp organized by EPFL association  as part of the  space mission analog.\nA week in isolation\n “We came up with the idea for the Asclepios mission in August 2019,” says Chloé Carrière, who runs the association. “We wanted to simulate a manned space mission to another celestial body, and to make it as realistic as possible.” The young team called in specialists to help, including Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier, French explorer Alban Michon and experts from the European Space Agency (ESA).\nThe simulated mission will take place in April this year, at an as yet undisclosed location in the Jura Mountains in Switzerland. Six budding astronauts will spend seven days isolated in a module that replicates the exact conditions inside a lunar or Martian habitat. As part of the mission, the team will carry out scientific experiments devised with input from EPFL, ETH Zurich, MIT and other leading universities.\nEveryday life inside the module will be based on real-life NASA and ESA missions. The recruitment process was similarly realistic. “We never expected to get so many applications, and from so far away,” adds Chloé Carrière, who says she even received interest from Australia. One of the would-be astronauts who made it into the final team is from Chile.\nLearning to improvise\nThe applicants underwent a series of knowledge, physical condition and mental toughness tests to space-agency standards. Of the 200 hopefuls who applied, just eight made the grade: six astronauts plus two reserves. At the camp in Crans-Montana, they were given a series of challenges that tested their ability to improvise in a complex environment, from building shelters and producing water to conducting blind rescues and living in a polar camp. The organizing team built a number of surprises into the schedule to see how well they could think on their feet – even after three days surviving on a diet of freeze-dried food. “Polar environments aren’t identical to the conditions you’d find in space, but there’s a lot of overlap,” says Michon. “Diving into a frozen lake was a chance for them to experience microgravity and the constraints of a full-body suit.”\nFor all the careful thought and planning that has gone into Asclepios, it’s still not a real-life mission, and there’s no guarantee that any of the hopefuls will one day end up in space. “They’re all still too young to apply to become ESA astronauts,” says Chloé. “But what they learn on this mission will undoubtedly serve them well in their future careers.”", "summary": "A hand-picked group of students, including several from EPFL, spent a grueling weekend at a space boot camp in Crans-Montana in the Swiss Alps.

{"id": 1721, "text": "Two boats out of the ordinary and four crew members selected among champions: Hydros, the company that, with support from Lombard Odier private bank, operates and develops among others “l’Hydroptère.ch”, has unleashed its best assets at . Trials began yesterday in Falmouth, England.\nEight countries will compete aboard catamarans with dimensions not exceeding 7.62 x 4.20 m in size and 27.8 m2 in sail area. The two teams representing Switzerland have been training since early September aboard their vessels mounted on \"hydrofoils\", where they are capable to rise above the waves given specific wind conditions.\nHydros is very ambitious about this race. Florent Gaillard, head of communications, said openly: \"We have what it takes to win!\" And his optimism is not unfounded. Both catamarans have accumulated a substantial know-how in the course of countless practice sessions aboard the “Hydroptère.ch” on Lake Leman.\nExceptional partnership\nThe technology used also results from industrial and academic partnerships in the Leman area that have managed to establish a genuine \"cluster of excellence\" in the field of composite materials. Firstly, the boats are assembled in the Décision S.A. shipyard in Ecublens. Their construction puts great emphasis in the use of revolutionary materials whose development has been made possible by the involvement of several EPFL units such as the Laboratory of Applied Mechanics and Reliability Analysis (LMAF) and the Laboratory of Polymer and Composite technology (LTC). Finally, the raw material used to build the boats’ structure and wings is manufactured by North TPT, in Penthalaz.\nThe specialty of this quest, which makes it stand out at an international level, is the use of carbon fiber and thin film glass composites. Developed from the outset for sailing related applications, these materials became known in 2007 thanks to the famous Alinghi \"black sails\". At present, the same constituents allow the production of particularly light and strong rigid structures. Thus, the North TPT material is also used in some of the most important parts of the second Solar Impulse airplane.\nJoel Cugnoni from LMAF keeps regular contact with this company. \"We characterize these materials by accurately studying their behavior in extreme situations, he said. For example, we have found that the assembly of thin films is incredibly resistant to fatigue and able to preserve all its features intact up to its breaking point.\"\nThe specialists who have combined their efforts to create these two exceptional boats are gathered in a relatively small geographic area. They already prepare the future by launching last summer an international student's competition, called HydroContest, in which participants will have one year to enhance the performances of a given boat ().\nBut for the time being, the will all have their eyes on England.

{"id": 1726, "text": "“Any records that were kept before 2000 basically don’t exist, because we have no means of viewing them,” says Frédéric Kaplan, head of EPFL’s Digital Humanities Laboratory. This radical statement reflects Kaplan’s concern that in the not-too-distant future, only information recorded in electronic form will be accessible – meaning information in all other formats will fall by the wayside. “We urgently need to bring our archives into the digital age. We mustn’t lose contact with the past.”\nBringing the past into the digital age is exactly what the Venice Time Machine (VTM) project sets out to do. It aims to build a multidimensional model of the city that spans the past millennium, using millions of historical documents stored in a variety of formats. Launched in 2012, the project is now reaching its halfway point in a year that will include two major steps forward.\nMapping 5,000 years of European history\n The first is a drive to expand it to cities across Europe under a broader Time Machine initiative. In a manifesto published in 2016, Kaplan called for universities across the continent to join forces to share the region’s cultural heritage. His paper received widespread acclaim, prompting several EU commissioners to champion his idea. Kaplan’s manifesto became the cornerstone of a proposal for the Time Machine project to become part of the EU’s FET Flagship program, which provides €1 billion in funding over ten years to large-scale research initiatives.\nTime Machine aims to create a large-scale simulator for mapping 5,000 years of history. 165 partner institutions from 32 countries have formed a consortium to develop new technology for digitizing, analyzing, accessing, preserving and sharing historical and cultural documents. The FET Flagship application was sent in this month with a response expected next year.\nSeveral Time Machine projects already under way\nSome cities decided not to wait for the EU’s green light to launch their Time Machines. \nAmsterdam\n (pictured above), Nuremberg, Paris, Jerusalem, Budapest and Naples have all decided to dig through their archives and create a huge database linking their history on a national and European level. Why? We spoke with Julia Noordegraaf, Professor of Heritage and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam, and Sander Münster, who heads the Department of Media Design at \nDresden \n(pictured on the right) Technical University, to find out.\nWith the application submitted, the next step will be to create the online interfaces that will allow people to browse the over two million documents that have already been scanned. In the five years since the project began – or two since the researchers started digitizing documents – they have scanned 190,000 records from the Venice State Archive, 720,000 photographs from Fondazione Giorgio Cini, and 3,000 books on Venice’s history held in the city’s main libraries. “That’s less than 1% of everything that’s out there. It’s enormous!” says Kaplan. It also led to the discovery of an art trafficking ring between the Netherlands and Italy.\nTens of thousands of annotations\n To scan this unprecedented volume of documents, the researchers first had to develop \ntechnology that could quickly digitize kilometers of archives, some dating back 500 years. The devices they built include a semi-automated scanner for fragile manuscripts and documents in large formats, a robotic arm to turn the pages of books and journals, and a high-speed scanner, developed in conjunction with Adam Lowe at Factum Arte, that can digitize a photographic record front-and-back in just 4 seconds.\nIn addition to the digitization effort, historians, paleographers and archivists hand-wrote over 160,000 notes on the documents indicating names, places and keywords. Their annotations were used to create an automatic handwriting recognition system that could extract information from the documents. “Our system had to be able to handle many different types of writing and abbreviations, since they weren’t standardized at the time. We showed the computer an array of examples so it could learn how to learn,” says Sofia Ares Oliveira, a researcher at the Digital Humanities Laboratory. The system she and her colleagues developed can transcribe unannotated words with an error rate of 4% per character. “It’s like when you enter a word with a typo into a search engine. Our system is smart enough to come up with fairly accurate results and give you a good idea of what the text is about,” she adds.\nThree programs for delving into digital data\n The project team will launch their search engine, called Canvas, by this summer. It will let people view original versions of scanned records from the State Archives and search the entire database of digitized documents by keyword, such as a name, place or date. It works like Wikipedia in that authorized users can correct scanning errors they find in the files, and thereby continually improve the service.\nA second task was to digitize the vast photo library owned by Fondazione Giorgio Cini. Some 370,000 of the Foundation’s million photographs have been scanned so far. And here again, researchers added thousands of notes by hand to train the computer. That resulted in a search engine called Replica that can search not only text, but also images by establishing connections between them. “The machine learned to form links between the photographs’ composition, the position of the people in them, and any other items or patterns. That allows the machine to spot similarities among the images – paving the way for art historians to flesh out their history,” says Benoît Seguin, the EPFL student who developed Replica as part of his thesis, which he will defend this summer.\nAnd a third task was to tackle the scientific books and journals stored away in Venice’s main libraries. This collection includes nearly 3,000 books from the 19\nth\n to 21\nst\n centuries and over 100 years of scientific publications, all on Venice. They were digitized under the Linked Books project – a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and spearheaded by researchers Giovanni Colavizza and Matteo Romanello working in association with Kaplan. An ad hoc program called Venice Scholar was also developed to automatically extract and search citations, making it easier for historians to use them as they navigate through the city’s history. This is an open system, like the other two, and new entries can be easily added to the database. These secondary sources are also linked to the primary sources in Canvas.\nPress kit:\nContacts :\nAnne-Muriel Brouet \nPress Service EPFL\n +41 21 69 32442\nSandy Evangelista \nPress Service EPFL\n +41 21 69 32185\n +41 79 502 81 06\nFrederic Kaplan \nDigital Humanities Laboratory EPFL\n +41 21 69 30253\n +41 21 69 31901", "summary": "2018 will be a pivotal year for the Venice Time Machine project.

{"id": 1728, "text": "The ranking was published yesterday evening: L.E.S.S. came in first place this year after finishing second last year. The competition, which looks at companies set up in the past five years, is judged by a panel of 100 startup experts: venture capitalists, business angels and heads of startup funds.\nWinning this competition does not translate into an immediate financial payoff, but it does guarantee visibility in Switzerland and abroad. “For many Swiss and foreign venture capitalists and business angels, this ranking is becoming something of a benchmark,” said Jordi Montserrat, one of the competition's organizers. For the international audience, this five-year-old event also says something about the quality and diversity of Swiss startups in general.\nSo what nudged L.E.S.S. to the top of the list? \"Just like Abionic and Flyability, it is now better known and has greater credibility,” said Montserrat. These startups raised money and won various prizes and awards, all of which brought them notice. Some criteria are objective: a quality product, a team of driven entrepreneurs and a substantial target market. But the success of innovative new companies depends largely on the founder’s personality, team-building skills and public presence. The experts drew on their own experience and intuition in making their selections. The top 20 finishers include other EPFL offshoots: Lunaphore, Faceshift (rumored to have been recently acquired by Apple), Scantrust, Actlight and Gamaya.\nThe top three finishers: \nTechnical lighting of the future\n L.E.S.S. developed the nano-active fiber – as thin as a human hair – which greatly reduces power consumption in displays, high-speed manufacturing inspection systems and automotive lighting. According to its designers, it could soon replace LED technology for technical lighting solutions as well. This EPFL spinoff was formed in 2012 and was able to raise three million francs this year. These funds will allow the company to begin ramping up production volumes in response to growing demand from key clients, mainly in Japan, Germany and Switzerland.\nDetect allergies in minutes\n Abionic created an allergy-testing device that’s now ready for the doctor’s offices. A few drops of the patient’s blood are mixed with a special fluid and placed in small capsules containing allergens. Arranged on a CD-sized disc, these samples are then analyzed by a laser in under ten minutes. The device also indicates the severity of the allergy. Abionic's system, created in 2011, is already being marketed.

{"id": 1735, "text": "A machine that allows highly skilled surgeons to effectively lengthen their fingers has been designed in the Robotics System Laboratory. Ricardo Beira elaborated this idea in his thesis, and subsequently created the start-up, DistalMotion, to further develop it:. The device is controlled by small joysticks which allow the operation of surgical tools fixed to the end of a metal arm. The goal? To facilitate minimally invasive operations without opening the abdominal wall.\nTwo to three bodily orifices allow for the passage of a small camera and long surgical instruments. This technique, known as endoscopy, is used more and more in urology, gynecology and visceral surgery.While this technique has many benefits, the main problem is the lack of precision in the surgeon’s movements, which is linked to the rigidity of the tools. Moreover, the surgeon must work with a mirror as, for example, a movement to the surgeon’s left results in the tool moving to the right; hence, a particularly intense training is necessary. Ricardo Beira’s system solves these problems.\nCompletely Mechanical\n The small joysticks are able to exactly replicate the surgeon’s movements,. As a result, pliers, scissors, needles and other tools move as if a practitioner was directly holding them. The research completed at the robotics laboratory has allowed for the elimination of a problem inherent to such mechanisms, the exaggeration of movements. When a small movement outside of the patient’s body is translated into a larger one inside the patient, operations become even more. delicate and painstaking. Thanks to this device, seven degrees of freedom are permitted in the reproduction of movement, including, for example, the rotation of the wrist.\nIn the era of robotics crammed with electronics, detectors and sensors, this mechanical engine developed by Ricardo Beira is quite remarkable. It should permit a considerable expansion of the variety of coelioscopic procedures, which present numerous advantages in relation to traditional surgery, notably with regard to safety, aesthetics and cost. The post-operative pain and risk of infection are lesser, the scars are smaller, and the stay at the hospital shorter.\nThe device requires craftsmanship of the highest and most detailed order, but the horizon is bright due to the numerous foreseen advantages . “The future cost of production will lie outside a common measure with the only devices capable of this much mobility in this type of operation, the DaVinci robots. These enormous devices, which equip only a few hospitals in the world, cost millions and necessitate huge spaces,”explains Ricardo Beira.\nSecond Prototype and Pre-Clinical Trials\n Pre-clinical trials at the CHUV and the Inselspital in Bern will take place this year with simulations of prostate operations.

{"id": 1740, "text": "What if everyone had their own medical avatar – a virtual replica of themselves featuring their own personal data – that could improve the way their health is managed and the way they are treated if they fall ill? That is the bold proposal put forward by the Health EU project, whose tagline is “Human avatars to prevent and cure diseases”. This international project, led by a consortium* headed by EPFL in collaboration with the Institute for Human Organ and Disease Model Technologies based in the Netherlands, recently applied to become a FET Flagship. FET Flagship is a prestigious multi-disciplinary research program run by the European Union that offers €1 billion in funding over ten years.\n“What we are proposing is a totally revolutionary way of handling health issues,” explains Adrian Ionescu, a professor of nanoelectronics at EPFL and one of the project’s originators. With its avatar-based system, Health EU aims to achieve improved disease prevention, early diagnosis, more accurate monitoring and customized, targeted administration of medicines and treatments, especially for increasingly common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular, chronic and neurodegenerative disorders.\n“We are offering a possible solution to problems faced by the current healthcare model, which is not economically sustainable because of the extremely high costs it entails,” adds Professor Ionescu.\nThe project’s core idea is to combine customized medicine with digital technology, using the latest technological developments such as connected objects, artificial intelligence and the concept of “digital twins”. In principle, a digital twin is a digital replica of an object that can be used to test and measure the effect of variables, processes and scenarios that would be impossible to apply in the real world. The approach is already being used in aerospace and astrophysics and in the automotive industry. However, it has not yet been applied to human beings. «Health EU’s vision combining digital and physical human avatars is taking digital twins to an unprecedented level» remarks Chris Van Hoof, senior director of Connected Health Solutions & IMEC Fellow.\nA whole range of technologies \n“Avatars are not simple digital models,” continues Professor Ionescu. “They will be developed and calibrated continuously on the basis of a large amount of customized data, collected experimentally during our day-to-day lives. Advanced models will be developed using artificial intelligence. Behind the scenes, we will create the infrastructure for the future Internet of Healthcare in order to manage the data in the form of genuine human avatars.” The Health EU project plans to develop a whole technological platform around patients and their virtual twins, capable of generating “big and deep data”. The platform will take into account and connect genomic and biological data, but also environmental and behavioral data, for example information about people’s habits and lifestyles. To collect that data, the project plans to use a whole range of leading-edge technologies: portable sensors, implants, nanomedicine techniques and medical imaging.\nIt will also use “organ-on-chip” technology – one of the project’s key features. This technology involves transferring cells onto a microchip to observe how they act and react. It will be the most physical, concrete aspect of the avatars. The method offers the possibility of testing the biological functions of an organ or interactions between several organs, but outside the human body. For example, the effect of a medicine could be measured at an early stage, avoiding side effects that can sometimes be extremely harmful, and allowing treatments to be tailored as closely as possible to the patient’s needs.\nReducing animal testing\nBetter anticipation of risks, personalized advice, more accurate medical monitoring, more suitable treatments and faster analysis: these are some of the main benefits that Health EU intends to deliver. More generally, the project aims to reduce costs and give a major boost to innovation in the medtech sector. “We shouldn’t forget that the solutions we are proposing would also replace a large proportion of testing currently carried out on animals,” stresses Albert van den Berg from the University of Twente, one of the coordinators of the Organs on Chip platform.\nHowever, there are many challenges ahead in terms of developing and refining the technologies, arranging collaborations between experts from many different disciplines and countries, and protecting the data collected from individuals. “Europe must maintain its data sovereignty,” says Patrick Boisseau, VP Healthcare at CEA Tech and Chairman of the board of the European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine. Information will be stored on servers located in Europe. We are also working on MPEG-type compression standards that will be specifically customized for the Health EU program. This secure infrastructure will become the future Internet of Healthcare, developed with the world’s leading cybersecurity experts. \"Health EU will be a kind of Netflix for genomic and sensory data! At the end of the day, however, it will always be up to patients to decide what they want doctors to see, and which doctors they want to see it”, says Adrian Ionescu.\nMore than 90 scientists from 47 leading-edge research groups at universities, institutes, clinics and companies in 16 European countries are directly involved in Health EU. Around 60 other scientists are project partners. The Health EU proposal has just been submitted to the European Union, and the final decision on whether it obtains FET Flagship status is likely to be made in early 2020.\nTo find out more about the Health EU project, visit \n* \nAs part of the Health EU project, EPFL and ETH Zurich are collaborating closely, with the involvement of more than 25 laboratories. Elsewhere in Europe, major technology hubs in France (CEA-LETI and Genopôle), Belgium and the Netherlands (IMEC, University of Twente and HDMT), and Germany (Fraunhofer and Max Planck Societies) are also taking part in the project.

{"id": 1743, "text": "It’s time to rethink our conception of robots. No longer the clunky machines of past, today a whole new breed of soft robots is emerging thanks to research being carried out at Paik’s . Paik – a spirited engineer with unfailing energy – is developing folding robots that could assist us not only with everyday tasks, but also with difficult physical maneuvers if placed on our arms and legs. Her soft, flexible and versatile devices are light years away from the machines we see on production lines and in science-fiction movies.\n“The rigid, powerful robots used in manufacturing are perfect for the preprogrammed environments of production plants – such as to make smartphones or computers,” says Paik. “But if we want devices that can assist us in our everyday lives, they need to be flexible, responsive to change and able to interact with us safely.” For instance, such robots could be used at home for doing the chores, or they could be integrated into our clothing.\nTechnology that moves with us\nPaik’s futuristic vision and insightful work have attracted the attention of  organizers. “One of the organizers attended a talk I gave and then invited me to speak at TED2019, whose topic is ‘Bigger than us.’ I didn’t think twice before accepting – it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!” says Paik.\nThis year’s TED conference will take a critical look at the technologies that are changing the world. Former TED speakers include Nobel prize winners and such prominent figures as Steve Jobs and Michelle Obama.\nIn her talk, Paik will outline her vision of a world where robots are as commonplace as smartphones. “The difference is that the new technology won’t be passive. It will move with us, but we won’t even notice it’s there. The robots will seem invisible,” she says.\nLarge-scale robot production\nSo what will these robots actually look like? Paik’s team of researchers is developing a couple of types. The first are robogamis, or folding robots inspired by origami. Equipped with several joints and actuators, they are initially flat, like a credit card, but can be folded into a variety of 3D shapes. Some robogamis, called tribots, can communicate with each other and move by jumping or climbing. And because robogamis can be manufactured in 2D, large-scale production is possible. “These robots have so many joints that even though their individual components may be rigid, they can bend in myriad ways and are completely flexible, like a mesh of yarn,” says Paik.\nPaik’s team is also developing “rubber” robots of all shapes and sizes that move using pneumatic actuators. They can mimic human muscles and be connected together to move objects or climb walls. “If we integrate the actuators into clothing, they can receive tactile signals and transmit those signals to a motion device. The system could thus help patients during physical therapy, for example,” says Paik.\nIn the future, Paik’s robots could handle repetitive, mundane tasks related to housework or gardening – but their potential doesn’t stop there. She is working with the European Space Agency and the Swiss Space Center to study applications for her soft robots in space. “Astronauts often end up wasting time on routine tasks. And since every gram counts when you’re sending a vessel up in space, these soft robots could be an interesting alternative,” she says.\nA talk for her grandmother \nAt her  talk in Vancouver, Paik will present a miniature haptic joystick that provides realistic tactile feedback – a promising technological development for virtual reality applications. The joystick, made of carbon fiber, is also inspired by origami and can be folded up when not in use to become just as flat as a piece of cardboard. The joystick is being marketed by a spin-off of her EPFL lab, .\nHowever, preparing for the TED talk is no child’s game. “I’m practicing with a coach who is helping me choose each word carefully. It’s a lot of stress, but it’s also highly stimulating,” she says. And speaking in Vancouver has special meaning for the Canadian-born engineer. “My grandmother, who is 94, lives in Vancouver and will come hear me speak. It’ll be the first time she will see me working. She’s always been my biggest supporter,” says Paik. “She used to say to me: there is nothing boys can do that girls cannot do. And you can do better than anybody. I hope she was right as always.”\nMore videos: \nBio\n Paik was born in Canada and grew up in Seoul, Tokyo and Vancouver. Her father is a scientist and her mother is a painter. After obtaining Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in engineering from the University of British Columbia, she went on to earn a PhD at Seoul National University. She conducted her PhD research in association with Samsung Electronics, designing the mechanical arm of a humanoid robot that weighed just 3.7 kg – a record at the time. She then completed a post-doc at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, where she developed a simple, intuitive device for endoscopic surgery, called JAiMY. The device assists surgeons with suturing during laparoscopies and was launched on the market in 2011. Paik completed a second post-doc at the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory where she became familiar with soft robotics.

I also warmly thank EPFL and the Catalyst Fund’s Scientific Committee for their superb work with this important programme.”\nThe scientists will use the proceeds to kick off their research and make rapid progress towards clinical applications.\nMore about the projects\nUsing cell grafts to repair brain damage \nOne of the biggest challenges in neuroscience today is developing safe, effective methods for repairing adult nerve-cell damage caused by neurological disorders. In this project, a team of scientists led by Jocelyne Bloch and Nicole Déglon from CHUV and Grégoire Courtine from EPFL has come up with a cell therapy-based method that involves grafts of autologous adult brain cells. The cells can be harvested from cortical biopsies, cultivated to produce autologous neural cell ecosystems (ANCEs) and reimplanted into the brain to repair damage. Bloch’s team has already found that such grafts can mediate functional recovery in nonhuman primates suffering from Parkinson’s disease or the consequences of a stroke. The next steps will be to conduct clinical trials on stroke victims and to further study the molecular profile of ANCEs and how this profile evolves following the reimplantation of ANCEs.\nMeasuring and preventing chronic pain\nChronic pain is a complex phenomenon shaped by a variety of factors going beyond mere body damage. In order to assess, characterize and predict chronic pain, Bigna Lenggenhager from the University of Zurich, Olaf Blanke from EPFL and Tristan Bekinschtein from the University of Cambridge developed a method that can be conducted entirely from home. Patients use a portable telemedical tool to take brain and behavioral measurements and perform self-reports. Because pain is largely influenced by attention, the scientists are studying how fluctuations in attention – whether spontaneous or experimentally induced – modulate pain changes in patients. These measurements provide key information about the time maps of chronic pain and the underlying brain signatures. The team’s findings may eventually be used to facilitate the prediction of pain levels and thereby improve chronic pain management and understanding.\nImproving brain-image resolution through ultrasound \nThe conventional ultrasound examination of brain activity, commonly known as transcranial color-coded duplex or transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCCD/TCD), has limited use for neurological applications and cerebral vascular imaging in human adults. That’s because adult skull bones act as a barrier to the propagation of ultrasound, thereby degrading imaging resolution. In this project, a team of scientists led by Fabienne Perren from the University of Geneva is developing a new technique for ultrafast ultrasound transcranial neuroimaging. By combining this type of neuroimaging procedure with a contrast agent, they were able to obtain super-resolved maps of brain vessels down to the capillary level. The team will work with Philippe Ryvlin from the University of Lausanne and Olaf Blanke from EPFL to perform a clinical validation of the technique on healthy volunteers and conduct clinical confrontation trials on patients suffering from epilepsy and cerebrovascular pathologies.\nHearing music better by feeling its vibrations\nOver 5% of the world’s population suffers from hearing impairments preventing them from fully experiencing the joy of listening to music. Although standard hearing aids can help, they do not cover the full auditory spectrum. In this project, Daniel Huber from the University of Geneva and Mario Prsa from the University of Fribourg will examine new ways for transforming the wide frequency spectrum of audible sounds into the range of vibrations perceptible by the somatosensory system. This research will go hand in hand with the design and development of a novel type of portable vibrotactile stimulation device that enhances the range of information perceived by hearing impaired and deaf individuals during musical performances.\nObserving Parkinson’s inside the brain \nParkinson’s disease is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, a lack of motivation and hallucinations. In this project, Paul Krack from the University of Bern, Vanessa Fleury from Geneva University Hospitals (HUG), and Olaf Blanke and Dimitri Van De Ville from EPFL will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on resting-state patients to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of these symptoms and better understand the effects of dopaminergic medication on these patients’ brain activity. The team’s findings could pave the way to improved diagnoses and better targeted treatment strategies.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms behind dry eyes\nIn this project, Denise Zysset-Burri and Martin Zinkernagel from the University of Bern are studying dry eye disease – an ocular surface condition that affects some 34% of the world’s population. Their goal is to assess the associations of patients’ local immune systems and ocular microbiomes, and the role they play in disease development. The results could give doctors a better understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms and eventually lead to a broader range of treatment options. This research could also have important implications for the prevention of dry eye disease and other immune-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.", "summary": "The Catalyst Fund – supported by the Bertarelli Foundation – has selected six research projects to fund this year.

{"id": 1749, "text": "Will artificial intelligence (AI) change the nature of work? For EPFL theoretical biologist Marcel Salathé, the answer is invariably yes. To him, a more fundamental question that needs to be addressed is \nwho owns that artificial intelligence\n?\n“We have to hold AI accountable, and the only way to do this is to verify it for biases and make sure there is no deliberate misinformation,” says Salathé. “This is not possible if the AI is privatized.”\nAI is both the algorithm and the data\nSo what exactly is AI? It is generally regarded as “intelligence exhibited by machines”. Today, it is highly task specific, specially designed to beat humans at strategic games like Chess and Go, or diagnose skin disease on par with doctors’ skills. \nOn a practical level, AI is implemented through what scientists call “machine learning”, which means using a computer to run specifically designed software that can be “trained”, i.e. process data with the help of algorithms and to correctly identify certain features from that data set. Like human cognition, AI learns by trial and error. Unlike humans, however, AI can process and recall large quantities of data, giving it a tremendous advantage over us.\nCrucial to AI learning, therefore, is the underlying data. For Salathé, AI is defined by both the algorithm and the data, and as such, both should be publicly available.\nDeep learning algorithms can be perturbed\nLast year, Salathé created an algorithm to recognize plant diseases. With more than 50,000 photos of healthy and diseased plants in the database, the algorithm uses artificial intelligence to diagnose plant diseases with the help of your smartphone. As for human disease, a recent study by a Stanford Group on cancer showed that AI can be trained to recognize skin cancer slightly better than a group of doctors. The consequences are far-reaching: AI may one day diagnose our diseases instead of doctors. If so, will we really be able to trust its diagnosis?\nThese diagnostic tools use data sets of images to train and learn. But visual data sets can be perturbed that prevent deep learning algorithms from correctly classifying images. Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to visual perturbations that are practically impossible to detect with the naked eye, yet causing the AI to misclassify images.\nIn future implementations of AI-assisted medical diagnostic tools, these perturbations pose a serious threat. More generally, the perturbations are real and may already be affecting the filtered information that reaches us every day. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of certifying AI technology and monitoring its reliability.", "summary": "In the quest for reliable artificial intelligence, EPFL scientist Marcel Salathé argues that AI technology should be openly available.

Indeed, new admission criteria, which took effect starting this academic year, require at least a grade of 80% for European students with a scientific high school diploma, which is equivalent to 16/20 for French applicants. Such conditions are in line with current practices in French and English universities. In contrast, the number of students that graduated from Swiss high schools joining preparatory courses remained stable as they are admitted without stricter criteria.\n The most popular fields this year are computer science and micro-technology, with increasing student numbers despite the overall decline in enrollment.

Thus, the jacket inflation/deflation system controlling the underwater explorer’s buoyancy works automatically in the case of a problem. This ingenious device was developed by David Bonzon, micro technology student at EPFL, and will be released for sale from the month of April.\n About 450 diving accidents are annually recorded in France, of which three quarters are due to decompression blunders, according to a survey carried out by the medical and national prevention commission of the Fédération Française d'Etude et des Sports Sous-Marins. This results in an average accident rate of one per 755 divers. At first, the distribution of this novel equipment will be targeting diving schools so that instructors can monitor and reassure beginners. \"If someone panics, she or he is not capable of deciding whether to inject air into or to expel it out of the jacket, which is the moment when the device detects the irregularity and automatically takes care of managing the diver’s decompression stops,\" David explains. It also allows to pre-set parameters such as the duration or depth level of diving.\n David, just enrolled at EPFL, developed the system connecting the jacket to the device with his cousin Guillaume Raudel, automation engineer. It consists of an electromechanical system integrating solenoid valves and a control board.

The projects range from developing a treatment or vaccine to deploying rapid responses to attenuate the crisis’s impact on people. In the past two weeks, EPFL researchers have put forth around 40 coronavirus-related project ideas.\nThe School has already chosen  These studies were selected because they can deliver direct responses to the pandemic. “Some labs are drawing on existing research or on systems that they have already developed, while others have proposed completely new ideas that came out of an intense brainstorming process,” says Paul Sunderland, the deputy to the Vice President for Research. The research must be completed in the short- to medium-term with tangible results ideally in the next six to nine months. Each study selected for the program will be given tens of thousands of francs in additional funding. EPFL staff taking part in the projects will be given special authorization to work on the otherwise-closed campus.\nSome projects bring together researchers from different EPFL schools or involve collaborations with other Swiss research institutes. Below are descriptions of the projects selected so far.\nCures and vaccines\n • \nStructure-based design of protein-based anti-virals and vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2.\n(STI). This study aims to develop immunogenic compounds and proteins that could inhibit viral invasion, in order to help speed the discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n • \nDevelopment of non-toxic virucidal pan-coronavirus antivirals\n. Prof. Caroline Tapparel (UNIGE) in collaboration with (STI). The researchers will conduct extensive further testing of a new broad-spectrum antiviral that has already shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2.\nDiagnostics and testing\n • \nDevelopment of simple, low-cost molecular diagnostic tests using cell-free systems.\n(STI). This lab will repurpose a high-throughput microfluidic diagnostics platform that it developed, so it can be used in SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. The platform will allow more tests to be conducted with significantly reduced reagent consumption.\n • \nHost genetics of life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously healthy patients\n.  (SV). This study will examine the genetic factors predisposing patients to develop COVID-19 in order to inform drug and vaccine development.

In this study, citizens will be asked to participate in a survey. The aim is to come up with coping strategies for the new living and working conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak and to improve the understanding of how such crises can be better managed in the future.\nAn app that can tell if you’ve come into contact with the virus\nThe PEPP-PT – or \nPan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing\n– initiative brings together 130 research organizations in eight different countries to develop a tracking app for smartphones. Installing the app will be entirely voluntary and all data will be anonymized.\nThe app will use Bluetooth technology to identify the people that someone who tested positive for the new coronavirus has had contact with, and then notify those people. Similar apps already exist in Singapore, South Korea and China, but they can’t be used in their current format in Europe for data privacy reasons. Development work on the app should be finished by Easter, then it will be made available for free to the general public. Professors Marcel Salathé, Jean-Pierre Hubaux and James Larus as well EPFL Vice President for Information Systems, Edouard Bugnion, and assistant professors Carmela Troncoso and Mathias Payer are heading up EPFL’s work on this initiative.\nHackathons for developing anti-coronavirus technology \nEPFL researchers can also initiate new studies with the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation, or take part in one of the many hackathons that are being held in response to the pandemic.

{"id": 1768, "text": "Two years on from its launch, Tech4Impact is tackling some of the major societal challenges of our time. EPFL’s social impact and sustainability initiative has set up Bachelor’s, Master’s and research grants so that students and researchers can turn today’s groundbreaking ideas into tomorrow’s solutions. The platform is also giving a helping hand to innovative and sustainable startups.\nThree researchers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Sustainable and Catalytic Processing (LPDC) have gone into business together with Tech4Impact’s support, leveraging technology they developed at the lab to convert waste plant matter – or biomass – into valuable molecules for the flavor and fragrance industry. The researchers published their findings in the prestigious journal \nScience\n and have even filed a patent application. “Our cost-effective technology uses every part of the wood,” explains Florent Héroguel, a scientist at the LPDC. “We can extract lignin, an organic polymer found in wood, and break it down into individual aromatic compounds to make artificial flavorings and fragrances such as vanilla and smoky barbecue sauce.”\nThe next step was to take the research and turn it into a viable business. “We learned about Tech4Impact when we were looking for support and coaching,” adds Héroguel. The researchers secured 50,000 francs in PlayGrant funding, which they used to found their own spin-off, Bloom Biorenewables, in 2019. “The grant gave us a chance to rub shoulders with the business community at EPFL’s Innovation Park.” Through the Tech4Impact corporate partners program, the team held meetings with potential clients, who told them about some of the problems they face. “Most flavorings are made from petroleum, which consumers are increasingly shunning. That’s good news for our technology.”\nYunus Social Business Center at EPFL\nInnovative and sustainable technology can be used as a way to resolve major societal challenges and improve the lives of millions of people around the globe. Recognizing that potential, EPFL signed a partnership agreement in 2017 to host Switzerland’s first Yunus Social Business Center on the School’s campus. The signing took place at the Global Social Business Summit in Paris, in the presence of Dr. Muhammad Yunus – a Bangladeshi economist who has been at the forefront of resolving global problems in healthcare, education, poverty, technology and the environment for 50 years. He invented the concept of “social business” in the 1970s and won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding Grameen Bank, which provides interest-free microloans. Tech4Impact is aiming to keep that momentum going by addressing the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “With 350 laboratories, 25 established businesses and 120 startups on campus, we have a wealth of creative talent and innovation at our disposal,” says Tech4Impact project leader Julia Binder. The platform is also welcoming NGOs into the fold for the first time, putting them in touch with members of the School’s business and research community and running an inter-NGO program.\nStepping up collaboration\nCollaboration is an important part of EPFL’s work. “We’re using new information and communication technologies to help us solve the operational challenges we face,” explains Thierry Agagliate, Head of Disruptive Innovation at children’s rights organization Terre des Hommes. “Our collaborative partnership with EPFL began five years ago when we signed a framework agreement with CODEV and EssentialTech .” The School is also involved in a major child health project run by Terre des Hommes in West Africa, developing a smartphone app that uses a World Health Organization clinical protocol to detect and monitor the malnutrition status of some two million children. “Tech4Impact contacted us in 2018, and we recognized the platform’s potential right away,” adds Agagliate. “Being part of the initiative will give us access to partners from EPFL’s ecosystem who would otherwise be beyond our reach, while the inter-NGO program means we can share technology and step up collaboration with other organizations like ours.” Although the partnership is still in its early stages, EPFL’s Innovation Park will be sending a delegation this fall to Terre des Homme’s Innovation Boot Camp – an annual event that brings together people from within\n and outside that organization.\nUsing science diplomacy to protect coral reefs\nUN global goal 14 focuses on protecting the oceans. Some coral reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures and could one day be used to re-seed parts of the Red Sea where reefs are dying. Anders Meibom, who researched coral reef restoration at the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, sees the Tech4Impact platform as a unique opportunity to unite scientists working on environmental conservation issues under one roof. EPFL, with the backing of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), has founded the Transnational Red Sea Research Center to help address some of the sensitivities around multilateral collaboration in the region. “The complex geopolitical situation in the Red Sea area means researchers have to proceed with a healthy dose of diplomacy,” says Meibom. “Because science is a neutral discipline, it can open doors and bring people together.” Tech4Impact provided development support and helped put the team in touch with key public and private stakeholders.\nTech4Impact carried out a survey on research and innovation activities across EPFL. The resulting report underscores how, by pursuing ambitious sustainability objectives, the School and its spin-offs have the potential to advance the 17 goals of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A special event planned by Tech4Impact at the Rolex Learning Center on 10 April is timed to coincide with the report’s release. Eight EPFL professors will present their pioneering sustainability research projects, and there will be an interactive exhibition showcasing 12 of the School’s spin-offs working on sustainable innovations.

{"id": 1779, "text": "Al-Badri’s EPFL residency officially began in July, and is being hosted by the CDH Laboratory for Experimental Museology (), led by Sarah Kenderdine. It will culminate in an exhibition, the “Neuronal Ancestral Sculptures Series”, at ArtLab next summer.\nWhen she’s not at the EM+ lab in St Sulpice, Al-Badri lives and works in Berlin. She holds a degree political science from Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main, and her groundbreaking work has been featured by The New York Times, the BBC, Wired, The Financial Times, The Boston Globe, Gizmodo, and New Scientist, among many others.\nEPFL: Can you describe your background as an artist?\nNora Al-Badri:\n I am a multidisciplinary artist, and for many years, my medium has been technology – from robotics to 3D data and AI-based software.\nI am also a trained political scientist, and everything I create is based on deconstructing power structures as we know them, and using the emancipatory potential of technology. I like to quote Frantz Fanon when introducing my artistic practice: “Struggles for decolonization are first and foremost about self-ownership. They are struggles to repossess, to take back – if necessary, by force – that which is ours unconditionally and, as such, belongs to us.”\nFor example, one of my pieces, done in collaboration with , is known as the “”. We clandestinely scanned the bust of Nefertiti in Berlin’s Neues Museum, and then exhibited and buried a 3D print of the bust, as a form of techno-heritage, in Egypt.\nEPFL: What motivates you as an artist?\nNAB:\n I use and see the emancipatory and subversive potential of technology. I believe that questions of representation ethics and bias need to be negotiated in the arts and digital humanities. I also believe that this should happen not only within the academy or museum, because these are places of privilege, which are unfortunately inaccessible to most people.\nVirality and the internet are another public sphere where the discourse needs to happen. This also has limitations, because almost half the world is still not online. But as an artist, I can reach out to the world, and support a re-centering of knowledge towards the Global South.\nEPFL: Tell us more about this Neuronal Ancestral Sculptures Series\nNAB:\n My research in the EM+ lab expands on AI and museum practices as a form of techno-heritage, and as a decolonial practice. The Neuronal Ancestral Sculptures Series focuses on Iraq and its archaeological artifacts. I am interested in reflecting on the moment of image creation as a mimetic practice by applying GANs (generative adversarial networks) to images of these artifacts.\nGANs are a new and exciting technology, more widely known as “deepfakes“; images can be photorealistic, yet they are not photos, because each one is made up by the neural network. This confronts us with questions of originality and authenticity, and invites us to explore the neural net itself as an artistic tool.\nFurthermore, the generated images are potentially transcendental: in the Islamic discourse, geometry for example has its own spiritual agency, without any semiotic structure, and is based on mixed elements from math and art. It is not intended to be decorative, but rather mimetically and spiritually referring to infinity, and this is what we are exploring through diverse datasets of Mesopotamian artifacts.\nTo me, the AI-driven emergence of new images based on past or ancestral ones could also lead to new narratives in contemporary Iraq, where one is confronted with human and cultural losses every day. With this project, I want to contribute to a future in that region that is characterized by creation rather than destruction.\nEPFL: Do you plan to collaborate with other labs at EPFL?\nNAB:\n I am in conversation and exchange with other labs at the campus, including the Visual Representation Lab (), Signal Processing Lab (), and the Machine Learning and Optimization Lab ().

{"id": 1781, "text": "“Research in the 21st century is essentially collaborative. The SwissTech Convention Center is a world-class tool for the exchange of knowledge through which our school can make critical contributions to solving major societal challenges,” explains André Schneider, Vice President of Planning and Logistics at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. He wants the new EPFL Convention Center to be far more than simply one of the most modern in the world. “As one of the few convention centers in Europe to be established on a university campus, it will also serve as smart conferencing lab – a place to experiment with the most innovative technologies for improving the flow of ideas in scientific conferences and making these exchanges more fruitful.”\nThe SwissTech Convention Center (STCC), inaugurated today, already offers delegates the very best in technical equipment. It is characterized in particular by extreme modularity. Its large auditorium can be automatically transformed, at will, from a 3,000-seat amphitheater to a banquet hall of more than 1800 square meters, thanks to the Canadian technology, “Gala Systems,” which ensures the metamorphosis in about 15 minutes. Multiple intermediate configurations offer event organizers unsurpassed flexibility. The ground floor offers the possibility of countless workroom configurations across an area of nearly 1500 square meters.\nAs evidence that it meets a clear demand not only from scientists but also many businesses, as well as local and international institutions, the Center is already almost completely booked through its first year of operation. “The interest of the business world is also of prime importance to us, because that will lead to greater technology transfer,” says André Schneider.\nNovel equipment and architecture\nIn addition to multimedia art facilities in each of its rooms, STCC is also equipped with smart displays whose content automatically adapts depending on location. These same screens can communicate with the mobile phones of participants in events, for example, by sending them papers for discussion.\nDesigned by Richter Dahl Rocha & Associés of Lausanne, STCC also uses several pioneering technologies. It is based primarily on posts, some of which operate simultaneously as geothermal heat pumps. Packed with sensors, they are developing this technology to save large amounts of energy. One of its facades is also covered with 300 square meters of transparent and colored photovoltaic solar collectors, which are based on the principle developed by EPFL professor Michael Grätzel. Financed entirely by Romande Energie, this innovative solar installation is a world first for a public building and a new realization in the partnership between EPFL and Romande Energie to develop a large-scale solar power plant and conduct research and development. The chromatic organization of the panels is the work of artist Catherine Bolle of Lausanne.\nAn innovative financing model\nThe financing of STCC is also pioneering. As part of a public-private partnership, two real estate funds, Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund LivingPlus (CS REF LivingPlus) and Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund Hospitality (CS REF Hospitality) assumed the entirety of the business contract – to the tune of 225 million Swiss francs. This amount also includes the construction of the Northern Quarter, a complex which brings together businesses, services, 516 student dorm rooms and the SwissTech Hotel, which adds to the Starling Hotel to complete the accommodations on offer in the campus’ immediate vicinity. EPFL is the sole tenant of the buildings, constructed on a plot that belongs to the Swiss Confederation with surface rights granted for a period of 99 years. The HRS Real Estate SA company completely handled the planning and implementation of the entire quarter. \nThe inauguration of the SwissTech Convention Center was followed, on April 5th and 6th 2014, by a weekend of “open houses” in which the inhabitants of the area were invited to discover the world of research at EPFL through the theme of “Science & Illusions.” A little bit short of 30'000 visitors came, making the event a great success.\nMore information on SwissTech Convention Center : \n A complete press pack and can be downloaded at :  Hi-resolution pictures are available at : \nWatch the SwissTech Convention Center introduction film (in French)!", "summary": "The SwissTech Convention Center, which opened on April 3rd, is one of the most modern and best equipped conference centers in the world.

{"id": 1784, "text": "On December 4, 1971 the Montreux Casino got literally on fire during a Frank Zappa concert – inspiring one of the most famous riffs in rock history, \nSmoke on the wate\nr\n’s, by Deep Purple.\nThis incident deprived the festival of its main site, but it did not stop it from growing and attracting the biggest names in jazz and rock year after year. Today, major concerts are held in the Auditorium Stravinsky, a beautiful hall. However, some believe its acoustics are better suited to classical music.\nDuring the 2014 edition, which has just begun, Montreux Jazz Festival visitors can be part of an extraordinary experience. An installation consisting of a screen and several speakers will allow them to get back into the soundscape and visual environment of the festival’s early years. Codename: , for \"Immersive Archives of the Montreux Jazz\". \nThe creator behind this sensory journey is a post-doctoral researcher at EPFL’s Audiovisual Communications Laboratory: Dirk Schröder. He patiently rebuilt the old concert hall virtually. \"We only had a part of the architectural plans. We reconstructed the rest based on photographs and videos taken during the early years of the festival as well as testimonies,\" he said.\nThis authentic Benedictine endeavor led to the creation of a 3D model of the venue which also incorporates materials, furniture and even spectators. \"I used a piece of software developed as part of my thesis that can recreate soundscapes by taking all parameters into account: size and shape of the room, speakers and visitors’ distributions, etc… \".\nTo transform this reconstruction into a real experience for the spectators, Dirk Schröder used the festival’s archives, held at EPFL, to conduct a \"live simulation\". Nine spectators are placed in a small room, surrounded by 16 speakers and two subwoofers broadcasting 17 different music tracks and are invited to listen to a hit straight out of the seventies: \nGive me the night\n by George Benson. There is also a \"bonus\" track, a more modern surprise. They listen to the music as they could have at the old Casino. On the screen, the camera moves from the back of the room to the front of the stage, leading the audience with it. The sound participants could hear is based on recordings made last year in Montreux and corresponds exactly to their virtual position in the disappeared hall.\nThe software developed by Dirk Schröder is characterized by its ease of use. Moreover, it works in real time and seamlessly integrates with standard software tools for architects who, for the first time, will be able to carry out the acoustical planning of their works. Its creator is in the process of developing a start-up and already imagines many applications, for example the generation of specific soundscapes for cinema, virtual and augmented reality and music production.

{"id": 1785, "text": "Researchers at EPFL have built a matchbox-sized device that can test for the presence of bacteria in a couple of minutes, instead of up to several weeks. A nano-lever vibrates in the presence of bacterial activity, while a laser reads the vibration and translates it into an electrical signal that can be easily read—the absence of a signal signifies the absence of bacteria. Thanks to this method, it is quick and easy to determine if a bacteria has been effectively treated by an antibiotic, a crucial medical tool especially for resistant strains. Easily used in clinics, it could also prove useful for testing chemotherapy treatment. The research is published in the latest issue of Nature Nanotechnology.\n “This method is fast and accurate. And it can be a precious tool for both doctors looking for the right dosage of antibiotics and for researchers to determine which treatments are the most effective,” explains Giovanni Dietler.\nLaser and nanotechnology read the bacteria’s metabolic activity\n It currently takes a long time to measure a bacterial infection’s response to antibiotic treatment. Clinicians must culture the bacteria and then observe its growth, sometimes for almost a month, as is the case with tuberculosis, in order to determine if the treatment has been effective. \n Thanks to advances in laser and optical technology, the EPFL team of physicists has reduced this time to a couple of minutes. To do so, Giovanni Dietler, Sandor Kasas and Giovanni Longo have exploited the microscopic movements of a bacterium’s metabolism. \n These vital signs are almost unperceivable. In order to test for them, the researchers place the bacteria on an extremely sensitive measuring device that vibrates a small lever—only slightly thicker than a strand of hair—in the presence of certain activity. The lever then vibrates under the metabolic activity of the germs. These infinitely small oscillations, on the order of one millionth of a millimeter, determine the presence or absence of the bacteria.\n To measure these vibrations, the researchers project a laser onto the lever. The light is then reflected back and the signal is converted into an electrical current to be interpreted by the clinician or researcher. When the electrical current is a flat line, one knows that the bacteria are all dead; it is as easy to read as an electrocardiogram.\nA promising method for cancer treatment\n The researchers have miniaturized the tool—it is currently the size of a matchbox. “By joining our tool with a piezoelectric device instead of a laser, we could further reduce its size to the size of a microchip,” says Giovanni Dietler. They could then be combined together to test a series of antibiotics on one strain in only a couple of minutes. \n The researchers are currently evaluating the tool’s potential in other fields, notably oncology. They are looking into measuring the metabolism of tumor cells that have been exposed to cancer treatment to evaluate the efficiency of the treatment. “If our method also works in this field, we really have a precious tool on our hands that can allow us to develop new treatments and also test both quickly and simply how the patient is reacting to the cancer treatment,” says Sandor Kasas.", "summary": "Nano and laser technology packed into small device tests antibiotic treatment in minutes", "claim": "Nano and laser technology packed into small device tests antibiotic treatment in up to several weeks", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 15], "noise": false}
{"id": 1793, "text": "During the lockdown in spring 2020, EPFL teachers had to give their classes in front of a computer – with their reflection in the screen as the only visible audience. That became standard procedure once again when classes were moved back online in late October. “Teaching is more than just transmitting knowledge. Human interaction plays a key role, and you lose a lot of that online. When you speak to a Zoom screen and most of your students have their cameras turned off, you don’t know if they are really following what you’re saying. You have to find another way to get their feedback,” says Andreas Osterwalder, a senior scientist in chemistry and chemical engineering and a member of the EPFL Teachers’ Council (CCE).\nStudents also feel that the lack of face-to-face contact is a problem. “It’s hard to speak on Zoom without interrupting someone. Discussions aren’t fluid, and that doesn’t encourage you to participate,” says Léandre Pitre-Tarpin, a class delegate for the civil engineering section and a member of AGEPolytique. “It’s also easier to lose concentration online or switch to another window.”\nMain challenges\nA study carried out by the  on how EPFL teachers adapted to the lockdown confirms that the lack of interaction and feedback is the biggest challenge to online teaching. The study involved interviews with around a dozen EPFL teachers in April and the first half of May 2020. “When you teach online, without being able to interact with your students, it’s impossible to pick up on signs that they may not have understood,” says Roland Tormey, head of EPFL’s Teaching Support Center (CAPE). “You can use clickers, mini-surveys and Q&A sessions as ways to find out. We also suggest conducting assessments like midterms more frequently, because online you don’t have the social aspect that boosts motivation.”\nThis situation increased the sense of solidarity among faculty members – we’ve got to help each other out.\nSamuel Dubuis, teacher for the CMS\nAccording to an  carried out in November 2020, 68% of Bachelor’s students (excluding those in the first year) and Master’s students said they had fallen behind in their classes. “When professors pre-record videos of their classes, we tend to watch them when we have time – or even at the end of the semester just before our exams, unless we have a midterm exam,” says Pitre-Tarpin. He adds: “Taking classes at home makes you feel like you’re studying all the time. It’s hard to stick to a routine with time for studying as well as free time. We also miss the social life and atmosphere on campus – it feels like this semester just keeps dragging on.” The AGEPoly survey found that 73% of students are experiencing a decline in motivation.\nLive classes and helping out colleagues \nSo how can teachers keep students motivated and involved? This spring CAPE tripled the number of workshops it offers, covering topics such as teaching online interactively, producing videos and implementing a flipped classroom format. In a flipped classroom, students learn the theory at home and spend the time in class working on exercises and asking questions. “This situation leads to more exchanges between teachers. And that’s helpful because it’s important for them to share their experience and best practices,” says Tormey.\nSamuel Dubuis, who teaches an analysis class for the preparatory mathematics course (CMS), interacts regularly with his colleagues in the mathematics section. This spring he became an “expert” on Zoom in just a few days, and wrote a guide for other teachers on how to use the program. “I got a lot of positive feedback, and even teachers outside my section started using my guide. That increased the sense of solidarity among faculty members – we’ve got to help each other out.”\nWe shouldn’t lose sight of the positive things that came out of this period – for example, it showed us the benefits of flipped classrooms.\nPierre Dillenbourg, the associate vice president for education\nDubuis initially gave his online classes through prerecorded videos, but found that students prefer live classes. He co-teaches one of his classes with two other instructors: one person creates dynamic slides; the other writes up additional lecture notes; and Dubuis gives the class on a tablet. “I give my lectures in almost the same way as if I were standing in front a chalkboard. Once the semester is over, we’ll assess how things went. Our goal is to keep the online classes appealing. We’ve gotten used to the technology, but we still need the face-to-face contact. The human interaction is one of the reasons why I decided to become a teacher,” says Dubuis.\nStaying in contact with students\nFrancesco Mondada, the academic director of LEARN and a professor at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory, has realized that it’s important to maintain a routine and speak frequently with your students. “I prerecorded my classes during the lockdown, but gave ‘live introductions’ at 8:15 am so that students would get up and keep a regular schedule. For the practical sessions where students work in pairs on robots, I set up a collaborative system that they could use for programming. Their final exams consisted of presenting their projects, and that went really well. This semester I’m giving a class that was already partly in a flipped classroom format, so it was easier to adapt. I tend to stay in regular contact with my students, and they can give me anonymous feedback on Moodle. For instance, at first I wasn’t very enthusiastic about the breakout room feature on Zoom [where teachers can divide students up into small groups and switch from one group to another], but I soon saw that students liked it.”\nEncouraging groupwork \nMondada conducted a survey among students in his Basics of Mobile Robotics class three weeks into the semester, and found that students who were not working in groups for the online exercise sessions were generally less motivated. The importance of groupwork – especially for first-year students – was also revealed in the AGEPoly survey carried out in November. However, 40% of those students said they weren’t able to find someone to work with. That’s why AGEPoly, with the support of schools and Vice Presidency for Education, set up a  for all first-year students; the goal is to “reduce the risk of them dropping out and improve their chances of success.” Dubuis notes that “technology often isolates us. Online, it’s hard to recreate the atmosphere of an exercise session.”\nWith regards to exercise sessions, Mondada developed a system that his students find very useful. He created a Google form where they can enter a brief summary of their question and indicate how they prefer to be contacted; the student assistants then reply to the questions in the order that they are sent. Mondada also set up two Discord servers: one for students and one for student assistants. After being contacted by several other teachers who had heard about his systems from their students, he created a user guide and video explaining how to install and use them.\nA blended future\nThis particularly challenging year has disrupted normal teaching practices and laid the foundations for what will eventually become a blended teaching model, according to Pierre Dillenbourg, an EPFL professor specialized in educational technology and the associate vice president for education. “Teachers were forced to adopt digital technology in a very abrupt manner. We’ve seen that moving everything online is very tiring and stressful, but it provides greater flexibility for students. Classes where students attend some lectures in person and others remotely, like the system EPFL had in place at the start of the semester, are not easy for teachers to manage. But we shouldn’t lose sight of the positive things that came out of this period – for example, it showed us the benefits of flipped classrooms. In the future, teachers will probably use a blended approach combining in-person and online instruction. But the exact ‘recipe’ for each class will be different depending on the subject matter, the number of students and the teacher’s personality.”\nOnline platform compiles studies of Covid-19’s impact on Swiss education\nSeveral studies have been carried out in Switzerland to evaluate the impact that Covid-19 – and more specifically, the spring 2020 lockdown and the shift to online classes – has had on students’ education. A  was set up in November to compile the findings of the various studies, allow them to be searched and viewed, and encourage coordination and collaboration among researchers. The platform is an initiative of the LEARN Center, and was developed in association with the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) and the Swiss Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education (EDK).\n “Studies have popped up like mushrooms during these unprecedented times,” says Jessica Dehler Zufferey, the operational director of LEARN. “To the point where many researchers are using data-collection methods that have not been tested, pushing aside conventional theories and sharing little of their data. That’s what gave me the idea for this platform – to provide a forum for coordinating research efforts and extracting more value from their findings for decision-makers.”\n The platform already houses over 50 studies examining Covid-19’s impact on the Swiss educational system. And some 110 researchers took part in an online event held jointly by the LEARN Center, SERI and EDK on 1 December, where researchers discussed the projects they have underway. A survey carried out at the end of the event showed that participants would like to see more events of this type and thought the platform was a good idea.", "summary": "Since spring 2020, EPFL teachers have had to make remote teaching a part of their daily job.

{"id": 1799, "text": "Eight years ago, the Euler Course was started, giving schoolchildren with a knack for math the chance to take special math classes at EPFL. In April of this year, some 300 of them – a new record – from all over French-speaking Switzerland signed up for the entrance exam. The 28 students selected include a little girl who is barely 10 years old. She knows she’s giving up her Wednesday afternoons for the next six years. Quite a commitment for someone so young.\nEach student is unique\n “We meet with each of the students who pass the entrance exam, together with their parents, to be sure they know what they’re getting into,” said Jérôme Scherer, who’s in charge of the program. “They need to anticipate potential problems, like the length of the commute.” That particular concern did not deter the participants completing the Course this year, as they include a student from Neuchâtel, one from Valais, one from Geneva and two from Vaud.\nThe classes are no walk in the park: they require a significant and long-term personal investment. Apart from the class time, the students must also put in up to ten hours of homework per week. After six years, half the students had left the program. “There’s no point in forcing them to continue if their passion for math is no longer there. Giving up on the Euler Course is not a failure.”\nHigh-potential students\n The high-potential students who make it in want more than to just be fed information. They need a specialized approach to teaching that includes logic and reasoning, as this will help them discover and use all their skills. The program also teaches them organization and time-planning skills.\nGauzelin Vidovic, 17 years old, is pleased to have made it through. When he passed the entrance exam, he was only 11 years old and did not really know what he was in for. “I had gone with my sister to EPFL's \"math for girls\" open house, which I found really good,” he said. “But my first Euler class was a total surprise, it was not what I expected.” He realized he was going to have to give it his all: “I had never worked so hard in my life, both at school and at home, it was a bit of a shock to have to sit down and do my series at home for hours and hours, even on weekends.”\nGauzelin had to buckle down, change his schedule, and make some choices and sacrifices, including stopping piano and some sports. “I hung in, not for the math itself but because it taught me how to work, because I wasn’t bored in class and because the EPFL team is nice.” Certificate in hand, he has enrolled in microengineering: “I want to keep going in the sciences but I have no idea what I want to do. In microengineering you do a little bit of everything, so it’ll definitely give me some ideas.”\nWhat will they do after Euler?\n Now that they have finished the program, some of these math aficionados will continue studying this subject, while the rest will go into other technical fields also taught at EPFL or different fields like medicine.\nA lot of things will change for Xingjian Huang when the 2016-2017 school year begins. For starters, he will have to find an apartment in Lausanne and get used to his new classes. He’s enrolled in math at EPFL but is already considering whether he’ll do pure or applied math, because if all goes well he’ll start directly in on the second year of studies. “It all depends on my grade on my last exam at the end of June. I’m not totally confident, but it should go well.”\nXingjian, 18 years old, prefers to play things safe. It’s better to be prepared than overly confident – that’s what he keeps reminding himself, every step of the way. “I’m not really sure of myself, I don’t know what I can do until I try.” He didn’t think he could explain math to his classmates, for example, but then his German teacher asked him to give his daughter some help. She’s two years older, and she ended up getting a very good grade on her exam.\nHe’s the official Euler program assistant. He takes the series, corrects them, adds comments and helps the new batch of Euler students with anything they didn’t understand. “It brings back memories, which is cool, you can see that they are driven and I like the idea of being part of this process that helps people get ahead in math.”\nStudents who earned their certificate in 2016:\n After 5 years: Benjamin Gates, from Neuchâtel\n After 6 years: Xingjian Huang, from Geneva, and Mathieu Rochat and Gauzelin Vidovic, from Vaud.

So, it felt really natural for me to work on that archive, because nothing like it really exists online for this kind of music,” explains Clavel.\nIn addition to his master’s studies in the CDH Laboratory for Experimental Museology (), led by Professor Sarah Kenderdine, Clavel regularly works as a concert organizer and musical tour guide in Iran. He is fluent in several instruments including the rubab – a stringed instrument similar to the lute that features prominently in many of Ustad Sarahang’s recordings.\nBringing intangible heritage to life\nClavel has assembled a large digital archive of some 750 recordings of Ustad Sarahang singing , one of the forms of classical Persian poetry. Now, he is in the process of augmenting each recording with metadata about the song’s technical and musical properties, and developing a website for users to browse the curated recordings.\n“I am trying to identify the lyrics and musical mode of each piece, which takes a lot of time, so when the website is up I am hoping to use a crowdsourcing approach,” he says.\nHe has also developed a unique concept for immersive visual experiences of these recordings, using representations of the lyrics in Persian calligraphy. The broader goal is to see if a virtual reality headset or a fulldome video projection environment (such as one might see in a planetarium) could be an effective way for the public to engage with this or other kinds of music.\nClavel developed a proof-of-concept in the form of a 3.5-minute immersive experience, using a head-mounted virtual reality display, of one of Ustad Sarahang’s recordings. He now plans to adapt this proof-of-concept to a fulldome context, to bring another dimension to the curation and exhibition of the archive.\nFor Clavel, these digitization and visualization technologies are a crucial opportunity to bring to life intangible cultural heritage that people may otherwise never discover.\n“It’s more difficult to deal with intangible heritage because by definition it is not set in stone, and can easily disappear,” he says. “If you want this art form to live on, you must expand the audience for it. This project is about creating this kind of engagement, and creating a visual experience that goes beyond just an old MP3 recording. Hopefully, it will be a gateway into this music and this universe.”\nA digital humanities showcase\nClavel will demonstrate his project, using the head-mounted virtual reality experience, at the  on September 14th and 15th. The event will also feature several other activities and exhibits for the public featuring research in the digital humanities – a field in which data science methods and digital technologies are used to study art, history, and culture.\n“The digital humanities are a way to reconcile two parts of my own life, with engineering and scientific studies on one side, and the arts and cultural studies on the other,” Clavel says. “For me, the digital humanities are important, because they allow us to use tools from science and engineering in the service of art and culture.”\nWho was \nUstad Mohammad Hussein Sarahang ?\n Ustad (Master) Mohammad Hussain Sarahang was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1924. He was the country’s most famous musician of his generation in the traditional music form of ghazal, and recorded many radio programs during his prolific career. He passed away in Kabul in 1983, leaving many recordings which together provide a unique source of musical heritage.", "summary": "(Summer Series): Mathieu Clavel, a master’s student in the College of Humanities (CDH) Digital Humanities Institute, is bringing musical heritage from Afghanistan to life using tools from data science and virtual reality.", "claim": "(1983): Mathieu Clavel, a master’s student in the College of Humanities (CDH) Digital Humanities Institute, is bringing musical heritage from Afghanistan to life using tools from data science and virtual reality.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 1], "noise": false}
{"id": 1805, "text": "This unusual project – a wooden house fully designed and built by first-year architecture students – was launched in 2016 by architect and EPFL professor Dieter Dietz. Professor Dietz pushes the budding architects to stretch their imagination to the limits, while meeting the standards and constraints related to this type of building.\nHOUSE 2 follows on the heels of HOUSE 1. For this second round of the project, Dietz – who also heads EPFL’s ALICE laboratory – divided his students into groups of 15 and asked them to design the dozen or so rooms in the house. The catch this year was that all the wooden pieces had to fit together into a container. This is because the project is headed for Zurich: HOUSE 2 will be on display in the western part of the city, under a railway bridge near the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), from 30 May to 15 June. This marks an unprecedented collaboration between the city and EPFL; the wooden home will be open to the public throughout the exhibition.\nFacing a critical evaluation\nThe student’s dozen projects – ranging from a kitchen and tea bar to an artistic projection room, urban training turret, high-tech conference room, and rest area – have just passed their critical evaluation. Dietz and his team called on Rémy Meylan, an engineer specialized in wood construction, to carry out the assessment.\nMeylan had the difficult task of reminding the students who came up with the most daring designs of certain construction standards and technical constraints.\nMeanwhile, Dietz used the evaluation to encourage the students to improve their designs, pointing out their strengths but also their weaknesses and shortcomings. “You should see the constraints you face as opportunities, not problems,” Dietz said as his class was faced with a tricky structural problem related to building a staircase. The students set up 1:10 and 1:5 wooden models in the Rolex Forum to help them visualize the magnitude of the house, which will be some 50 meters long, and the various challenges they will need to overcome.\nAn educational project \nLike HOUSE 1, HOUSE 2 is above all an educational project. It requires students to first work in a group on one part of the house, then to collaborate with neighboring groups to ensure feasibility and coherence. The future architects also link theory to practice, acquiring first-hand experience by actually building the structure themselves. Finally, their projects need to account for real-world conditions, including the experience of passersby.\nHOUSE 2 will be partly pre-assembled on the EPFL campus between mid-April and mid-May.

What criteria should one use to circumscribe the disease? It is to summarize these issues that in 2000 Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg published the famous Hallmarks of Cancer. Earlier this year, they updated this flagship publication, one of the most referenced to date in the history of oncology. Hanahan has now taken over as Director of the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC). Logically, the ISREC 2011 Symposium logically revolves around these hallmarks, and speakers include top worldwide experts, including three medicine Nobel Prize winners.\n There are 6 hallmarks, to which Hanahan and Weinberg have added two “emerging” candidates in their recent update. Hallmarks include enabling replicative immortality, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death or activating metastasis. Each Symposium session is specifically dedicated to one of these aspects. This is the first international meeting to date to be fully devoted to the hallmarks and to take each of these into account.\n Since they were published, the Hallmarks of Cancer have become a definite interpretation grid for oncology research. “They provide a functional classification as well as a conceptual tool”, Douglas Hanahan explains. “To become cancerous, cells must acquire these hallmark traits. However, they use many strategies to achieve this – various forms of mutations or alterations”.\n Debiopharm, a partner in the event, will present its Life Science Award 2011 on Friday 9 September to three young European scientists. Rolland-Yves Mauvernay, Founder and President of Debiopharm Group, said: “The concept of hallmarks of cancer, first proposed by Doug Hanahan and Robert A.

Doctors, engineers and researchers will join forces to develop “electroceuticals” – a type of neurotherapy that uses electrical stimulation to help restore motor function in paraplegic and quadriplegic patients, as well as in people suffering from Parkinson’s or the after effects of a stroke. The NeuroRestore team will trial innovative, personalized treatments that, once proven, will be made available to hospitals and patients. The center will also train a new generation of health-care practitioners and engineers in the use of these breakthrough therapies.\nAccelerating research\nOn 1 November 2018, EPFL neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine and CHUV neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch published the findings of the STImulation Movement Overground (STIMO) study in the journal Nature. The research established a revolutionary new therapeutic framework to improve recovery from spinal cord injury, combining targeted electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (controlled by a pacemaker) and an intelligent bodyweight-support system. After undergoing the groundbreaking therapy, eight paraplegic patients were able to take a few steps unassisted.\nThe Defitech Foundation has partnered with EPFL, CHUV and UNIL to found NeuroRestore, a center that will build on the findings of the STIMO study and fast-track the development of these innovative therapies to make them widely available as soon as possible.

The finished article, called \nOrion\n, unveiled at a special event on Tuesday, 9 April, will take part in Formula Student Electric – one of three event classes alongside internal combustion-engine and driverless cars. “It was a hugely challenging endeavor, but we recognize the importance of sustainable engineering,” says Pierre Georges, the president and a Master’s student in mechanical engineering. “We’ve gained valuable experience in a sector of the automotive industry that’s only going to grow in the future.”\n is the European arm of Formula SAE, a competition launched by the US-based Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in 1981 in which students are tasked with designing and building a prototype single-seater racing car. Once the technology-packed vehicles are ready, teams put them to the test in a series of track demonstrations, including an endurance race.\nAsking the right questions\nThe EPFL team is supervised by Mario Paolone, a motorsports fan and professor in electrical engineering, and Anders Meibom, a professor in environmental sciences and engineering. “Formula Student is an exercise in cutting-edge engineering,” says Paolone. “It’s a chance for students to gain new technical skills, and to think and work as a team. For my part, solving engineering problems with students is an immensely rewarding experience. They always bring a range of interesting ideas to the table.”\nLausanne Racing Team’s electric car, measuring 2.5 meters long by 1.6 meters wide, features a single, rear-mounted electric engine along with a composite body made from linen fiber, a natural and mechanically robust material. The students bought the engine, but decided to design their own battery management and cooling system – a formidable task that the team is still grappling with. “The real challenge is asking the right people the right questions,” says Pierre Dussaux, the team’s technical director and a Master’s student in mechanical engineering. Last fall, for instance, the team spent two days at Ferrari’s headquarters in Maranello, Italy, and they are still in touch with engineers there from time to time.\nStudent drivers\nLausanne Racing Team is an interdisciplinary project supported by EPFL’s Vice Presidency for Education. Aside from premises and help to develop their prototype, the students also received support from EPFL professional workshops. “It’s not simply a question of designing a track car,” explains Meibom. “It’s about using cutting-edge technologies and materials to make a vehicle that can outpace the competition – and keep the driver safe, too. When I see how enthusiastic the students are, and how hard they’re working on this project, I have no doubt they’ll rise to the challenge.”\nFor its debut year, Lausanne Racing Team will take part in two races: the first at the  (5-11 August), and the second (20-25 August). The students have until August to put the finishing touches to the car and test it on the track. Six drivers, all members of the team, will put the vehicle through its paces. “We chose drivers who’d been involved in building the car because they’re best placed to tell us where things need improving,” explains Georges. Sponsored among others by Saint-Sulpice and Lausanne Porsche Center, the team is also looking for sponsors to help cover the design and development costs, which so far stand at between 90,000 and 100,000 francs. “At the start, Formula Student seemed like an impossible dream, but we’ve done it – and we want to keep showing we’ve got what it takes,” says Dussaux.", "summary": "EPFL is set to make its debut in Formula Student this year, pitting a brand-new electric racing car developed by Lausanne Racing Team – and unveiled at an event at the Rolex Learning Center on Tuesday, 9 April – against other universities in races held across Europe.", "claim": "EPFL is set to make its debut in Formula Student Tuesday, pitting a brand-new electric racing car developed by Lausanne Racing Team – and unveiled at an event at the Rolex Learning Center on Tuesday, 9 April – against other universities in races held across Europe.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}
{"id": 1816, "text": "First came the switch. Then the transistor. Now another innovation stands to revolutionize the way we control the flow of electrons through a circuit: vanadium dioxide (VO\n2\n). A key characteristic of this compound is that it behaves as an insulator at room temperature but as a conductor at temperatures above 68°C. This behavior – also known as metal-insulator transition – is being studied in an ambitious EU Horizon 2020 project called Phase-Change Switch. EPFL was chosen to coordinate the project following a challenging selection process.\nThe project will last until 2020 and has been granted €3.9 million of EU funding. Due to the array of high-potential applications that could come out of this new technology, the project has attracted two major companies – Thales of France and the Swiss branch of IBM Research – as well as other universities, including Max-Planck-Gesellschaft in Germany and Cambridge University in the UK. Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mikro- und Optoelektronik (AMO GmbH), a spin-off of Aachen University in Germany, is also taking part in the research.\nScientists have long known about the electronic properties of VO\n2\n but haven’t been able to explain them until know. It turns out that its atomic structure changes as the temperature rises, transitioning from a crystalline structure at room temperature to a metallic one at temperatures above 68°C. And this transition happens in less than a nanosecond – a real advantage for electronics applications. “VO\n2 \nis also sensitive to other factors that could cause it to change phases, such as by injecting electrical power, optically, or by applying a THz radiation pulse,” says Adrian Ionescu, the EPFL professor who heads the school’s Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab) and also serves as the Phase-Change Switch project coordinator.\nReaching higher temperatures\nHowever, unlocking the full potential of VO\n2\n has always been tricky because its transition temperature of 68°C is too low for modern electronic devices, where circuits must be able to run flawlessly at 100°C. But two EPFL researchers – Ionescu from the School of Engineering (STI) and Andreas Schüler from the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) – may have found a solution to this problem, according to their joint research published in \nin July 2017. They found that adding germanium to VO\n2\n film can lift the material’s phase change temperature to over 100°C.\nEven more interesting findings from the Nanolab – especially for radiofrequency applications – were published in \nIEEE Access\n on 2 February 2018. For the first time ever, scientists were able to make ultra-compact, modulable frequency filters. Their technology also uses VO\n2 \nand phase-change switches, and is particularly effective in the frequency range crucial for space communication systems (the K\na\n band, with programmable frequency modulation between 28.2 and 35 GHz).\nNeuromorphic processors and autonomous vehicles\n These promising discoveries are likely to spur further research into applications for VO\n2\n in ultra-low-power electronic devices.

{"id": 1819, "text": "Imagine yourself on a plane the evening before a symposium sifting through hundreds of presentation abstracts to decide which presentations to attend. How can you be sure that you won’t miss a talk relating to your field of research? Three students at the EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences have invented a software application called TrailHead, which uses a visualization system to sort through this information. With their software application, Jonas Arnfred, Amine Mansour and Yannik Messerli have found a way to target presentations according to specific scientific interests. Already used at symposiums, the TrailHead web interface received 1,472 visits in 2012.\nAn algorithm as a magical formula\n In order to sort through a large group of presentations, the students developed an algorithm based on text recognition and semantic analysis. Jonas Arnfred, the student who initiated the project, enthusiastically explains: “One of the exciting aspects of TrailHead is that we had to combine several methods from different disciplines – such as automatic text extraction, automatic learning or graphic design – to produce a very concrete tool.” The first step was to gather the various articles on individual presentations to be given at the same symposium. The next step was to automatically convert these articles into raw data that could be recognized by the future software application.\nAmine Mansour, who later joined the project, continues: “It was not an easy matter to find an algorithm that could calculate similarities between articles and therefore link the presented subjects to specific research fields.” He first tested an algorithm that could detect word similarities and calculate the number of occurrences of the same terms in these texts. It later became apparent that an additional algorithm was needed to assess lexical fields so that groups of words associated with the same research field could be identified.\nA well-designed and practical visualization system\n Instead of producing a copious list of dozens of presentation abstracts, the application proposes a map of the various presentations linked according to subject matter. “The difficulty of this method of visualization was to make it both intuitive and fluid,” explains Yannik Messerli, who set about creating a web interface that would be compatible with the greatest possible array of peripherals. “An algorithm graphically outputs the conference presentations to make closely related subjects appear grouped together.”\nTrailHead generates a personalized symposium schedule\n Once you have selected the desired research field(s) and have clicked on the presentations that the software application suggests that you attend (based on the criteria selected), TrailHead allows you to generate a personalized symposium schedule and choose from among various options (e.g. add presentation abstracts to schedule). It also has a feature that lets you synchronize your schedule with your electronic agenda.\n“We have continuously worked to improve this software application by introducing more powerful search filters as well as other features. The project has been quite an undertaking – 2 years – and has enabled us to earn a living during most of our studies. We are very thankful to our Professor, , for having guided and supported the project,” explains Yannik. Amine adds: “The interesting aspect is that we were given the opportunity to create a specific tool from start to finish and now this tool is being used by the scientific community.”\nIndeed, TrailHead was used for the first time in 2012 at the International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), which included 700 presentations and over 1,000 participants. The TrailHead web interface received 1,472 visits, with a peak in traffic of 563 hits five days before the start of the symposium. TrailHead was also used by participants in the Information Theory and Applications (ITA) 2013 symposium as well as in the ISIT 2013 symposium.\nIn the future, TrailHead could also prove useful to participants at festivals, enabling them to choose from among the various cultural events, concerts or open-air films over the summer.

That’s where it all started.”\nA novel approach\nGupta wanted to see if he could take a photograph of a moving subject in still-life quality. The SwissSPAD imaging device was just the piece of equipment he needed for his experiment. The camera, which generates two-dimensional binary images at a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels, is able to capture single photons – the smallest measurable unit of light. For Charbon, it was a novel approach. “I didn’t think our camera was capable of what Gupta was proposing,” he says. “But the science proved otherwise.”\nAdding depth and color\nThe camera’s high pixel resolution and ultra-fast frame rate allowed the scientists to build a still image of their moving subject. “SwissSPAD captures 100,000 binary images – while detecting photons or not – per second,” explains Charbon. “We can use an algorithm to correct for variations.” Using this technique, they were able to build a high-definition image of their moving subject. “We took thousands of photographs and combined them to create just one image.”\nThe team’s next challenge is to run the experiment again with the MegaX camera. “MegaX is similar to SwissSPAD in many ways; it’s also a depth-sensing camera, thus it can generate 3D images,” says Charbon, who also plans to introduce color at pixel level very soon.\nThis August the scientists will present their findings at SIGGRAPH, a highly respected annual conference on computer graphics.

In the context of a partnership with the company, researchers from Professor Alfred Rufer’s Industrial Electronics Laboratory (LEI) at EPFL have developed a prototype for a quick-stop recharge station that can fill up a tank of compressed air the same amount of time it takes to fill up a regular gas tank, for an autonomy of about 70 km.\nTransferring air in stages\n The new recharge process is done in two stages (see schematic below): first the air is compressed in a high-performance compression station and transferred to an intermediate storage station. Because it’s continually being refilled from the compression station, the intermediate storage station is able to maintain quasi-constant pressure conditions.\n In the second stage, the compressed air is transferred from the intermediate storage station to the car’s tank, this time very rapidly, using a flow-limiting process in which very little energy is dissipated. The only problem is that during this accelerated compression, the air heats up in the vehicle’s tank. When it cools down, it contracts, reducing the pressure in the reservoir and, consequently, decreasing the vehicle’s autonomy.\t\nThe solution: recirculating the air\n In order to fill the tank in an optimal manner, Rufer’s team designed a system that recirculates the air during fill-up, which instantly cools the reservoir. The air that’s warmed up by pressurization is sent back to the storage station, then replaced by cooler air, all under constant pressure conditions. The fill-up is thus done in two stages, allowing the density of the air in the tank to be increased and the temperature to be stabilized. “Using this method, the yield from the transfer is theoretically close to 95%,” notes Rufer.\nLonger version of the article: \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; _fcksavedurl=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Cliquer ici pour installer le lecteur&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\"Car of the Future\", from , the World Economic Forum at Davos\nPlus d'informations:", "summary": "As part of a partnership with a French company that develops compressed air vehicles, EPFL scientists have solved the main drawback of this technology: vehicle recharge time.

{"id": 1845, "text": "How can we understand the biological basis of mental illness? How can we leverage clinical studies in genuinely innovative ways? And how can we create new forms of therapy and above all new medical training methods at the interface between the neurosciences and psychiatry that would enable an appropriate response to the dramatic increase in mental illnesses such as depression.\nThese questions are driving the research of the new Swiss national research center (NCCR) entitled “\nSYNAPSY\n – Synaptic Mechanisms of Mental Illness”, officially launched on 1 October 2010, whose objectives have been welcomed by international experts in this field. This project – which was announced by the Federal Department of the Interior of Federal Counsellor Didier Burkhalter – has been financed for a duration of four years by the Swiss National Science Foundation, with a total budget of 17.4 million Swiss francs. NCCR Synapsy comprises four significant research programs to be conducted at EPFL (NCCR leading house), at the University of Lausanne (UNIL), at the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the University of Basel, and also four cooperating clinics in close cooperation with the cantonal hospitals of Lausanne (CHUV) and Geneva (HUG).\nThe concept of the plasticity of the synapses, discovered in the 1970s and extended to the rest of the brain over the last 10 years, has obliged researchers and clinicians to take a totally fresh look at the causes of mental illness. Daily experience, various therapies, and even the use of speech fundamentally modify the brain to the point where it is increasingly inappropriate to speak about a given mental illness without considering the state of that illness at a given moment. And this is one of the results of the convergence of neuroscience and psychiatry. By referring back to the genetic bases of a mental illness, and by identifying the biological markers of these pathologies (endophenotypes), it becomes easier for clinical researchers to categorize the illnesses, to identify them earlier, and to understand the mechanisms of their evolution. The approach from clinical to biological – for example, through the analysis of significant numbers of patients – confronted in turn with neuroscientific studies performed on animals, spark off a continuous toing and froing between theory and practice. These iterations constitute the originality and unique nature of the project. To achieve this, NCCR Synapsy will therefore base its work on state-of-the-art genetic sequencing and medical imaging (CIBM) technology platforms. Schizophrenia, autism, anxiety and depression will be the focus of these studies.\nThe project thus represents an important turning point within the medical and neuroscientific community. As a result, the actual categorization of these illnesses could be reviewed and corrected. Obviously, new therapeutic initiatives could be identified, but above all new teaching courses – currently being discussed – and new psychiatric profiles could emerge.\nFor Pierre Magistretti, Director of NCCR Synapsy and author recently of a publication * with the psychiatrist François Ansermet of the University of Geneva: “The choice of this research program by the Department of the Interior represents for us a clear indication of the importance that Switzerland attaches to the research and treatment of mental illness, which has grown in importance in our daily lives, and also of course in terms of healthcare costs\".\n* Les énigmes du plaisir, Odile Jacob, Paris", "summary": "NCCR Synapsy, the new national research center, was launched on 1 October 2010.", "claim": "NCCR Synapsy, the new national research center, was launched on four years.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 13], "noise": false}
{"id": 1847, "text": "The first year of undergraduate studies at EPFL is often a shock for students. Many fail, not because they do not work hard or are not smart enough, but simply because the study strategies they used in high school are ill-suited for the complex exercises they now face. This was the conclusion drawn from several studies carried out by EPFL's  in close collaboration with professors, to determine the keys to successful studies. The Center’s findings have been published in the book  which is now in stores.\nOptimizing the way you work \nApprendre à étudier\n encourages students to take a closer look at how they solve problems, manage their time, take notes and study for exams. And the fact that students are more autonomous at this point in their studies means they must find an approach that works for them, so that they can master crucial skills, such as applying what they learn in different situations. “At EPFL, students need to quickly adopt more effective study methods given the complexity of the subject matter and the unique way in which science and engineering are taught,” said Roland Tormey, who co-authored the book with Cécile Hardebolle.\nInnovative teaching methods\nThe book is unique in that it is based on concrete evidence from in-class research conducted over several years, in close collaboration with EPFL’s professors. The results have already helped the school develop new, innovative teaching methods: there are now more professors using flipped classroom teaching, clickers and in-class apps. For the Teaching Support Center, this type of applied research plays an extremely important role in improving pedagogical methods and will drive EPFL’s continued excellence in providing quality teaching. “We must change how the sciences and engineering are taught and learned, not because innovation is the current fad, but because we have the data that shows us what works,” said Tormey.\nApprendre à étudier\n - \nGuide à l’usage des étudiants en sciences et ingénierie\n, by Roland Tormey and Cécile Hardebolle, Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes.

{"id": 1848, "text": "Three EPFL labs were involved in developing the model in partnership with the University of Bucharest in Romania. Researchers from the Wind Engineering and Renewable Energy Laboratory (WIRE), the Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS) and the Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG) pooled their data and models with those of experts from the University of Bucharest's Centre of Landscape–Territory–Information Systems (CeLTIS) as part of a ground-breaking initiative in wind energy.\nTheir aim is to provide the local authorities with a model they can use to simulate in a given landscape the wind energy potential in the long term, taking into account the evolution of the landscape and its biodiversity: the model allows to integrate for instance the role of agricultural land use. This is important for striking the right balance between arable land and pastureland, which can help to generate strong winds, and natural woodland, where the trees tend to reduce the performance of wind farms.\nThis study was part of the WindLand project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, through a scientific partnership involving SCCER-FURIES, InnoSuisse and Romania. The case study simulated the impact of land use policy on wind energy potential and biodiversity in the Southern Carpathians, even though no such project is in the pipeline for the moment.\nDon't shoot for maximum production\nFor authorities interested in building a wind farm, the model provides data on how much wind energy can be produced and how heterogeneous the landscape has to be in order to preserve local biodiversity. According to the study, if the surrounding area is predominantly woodland, the wind farm will produce only 60% of its maximum capacity and biodiversity will be moderate. On the other hand, if the area is totally cleared for pasture and intensive farming, the wind farm will be at full production but biodiversity will be considerably reduced owing to the mundane landscape.\nWhen the right balance is struck between agricultural land and forest, the wind farm can maintain 70–80% of its production capacity, and biodiversity remains high because of the heterogeneous landscape and diverse habitats. Another advantage of this multidisciplinary coupled model is that it quantifies the wind farm's energy production throughout its useful life.\nThe topography and landscape of the Carpathian Mountains are similar to those of Switzerland's Jura region, with mountains – ranging from 930 to 1,400 meters – dotted with forests, fields and pastures, as well as isolated tress. The model could therefore be applied in Switzerland as well.\nFinding a compromise\n\"Our findings show that it's possible to reach a compromise between biodiversity and wind-energy production and that trying to achieve maximum energy output straightaway is an error,\" explains Jiannong Fang, a researcher at the WIRE Lab and lead author of the study, which was published in the June issue of Science of the Total Environment, in partnership with Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL).\nA physicist by training, Fang learned to speak the language of his ecology and geography colleagues in the ECOS and LASIG labs in order to integrate economic, agronomic, social, environmental and topographic data into his model. \"Thanks to the models from those labs, I was able to improve my wind energy predictions and extend them over the long term,” says Fang. “I was also able to look at how the landscape and surrounding forest could be developed and how this would impact wind energy potential.\"\nSince the fall of communism, large patches of wooded pastureland, which covered half of the Carpathian region, have been left abandoned. These areas used to be very biodiverse, and the strong winds would have made them an ideal spot for a wind farm. But today the forest is claiming back its territory. The simulator developed by EPFL aims to determine how the landscape can be used effectively for wind production while also preserving the region’s current biodiversity.\nJiannong Fang is looking to further hone his model: \"Climate change may have a slight impact on our findings. Adding various climate scenarios relating, for instance, to changes in humidity and vegetation would make our model's predictions even more reliable and could be the topic of a future work.\"", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a simulator that can calculate the performance of wind farms over 30 years while also factoring in the need to preserve local biodiversity.

You’ll be able to touch and move real-world objects just like their virtual counterparts. And if you look down, you’ll see your fingers; your virtual hands will reproduce even the slightest movement. This kind of unparalleled immersive experience is exactly what Hugo Hueber, a Bachelor’s student in computer science at EPFL, is aiming to create through an enhanced VR video game he is working on as part of his project.\n“My goal was to develop a video game that combines the latest technology with the 3D interactive research we’re carrying out at the lab. That will let video gamers interact physically with a virtual environment that can be transferred to any location – a living room, office or even classroom – instantly,” says Hueber.\nThat requires first measuring real-world objects like a chair and then modeling and calibrating them in the video game, which can be done in just a few clicks. Once this is done, players can use the object in the game at the same time as they physically touch it with their fingers. Achieving this was a formidable technical challenge for the Master’s student, but it seriously enhances the immersive experience for users.\nSeeing your fingers in 3D\nAnother feature of Hueber’s technology is that it improves users’ perception of their fingers, further blurring the line between virtual and reality. His system doesn’t require a joystick – a piece of equipment that lessens the sense of reality. Rather, users can see each of their fingers and move them with a great deal of precision, for instance tapping them together or picking up an object with ease. And that’s not all – by placing sensors on their bodies, users can see themselves move inside a video game. “The system tracks the sensors’ movements and generates real-time images of those movements as they affect different parts of the body. That means users will have the impression of being fully immersed in a video game, since their physical movements will be synchronized directly in the game,” adds Hueber.\nVideo games are useful for research, too \nHueber’s project is just one application of the research carried out over the past few years by the, headed by Ronan Boulic.

{"id": 1853, "text": "As our society becomes increasingly connected, cyber threats – whether in the form of stolen data, attacks on key infrastructure or large-scale hacking – represent a growing risk. Countering these threats requires specific expertise, and the need for well-trained experts is surging. This need was identified in the “National strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks (NCS) 2018-2022”. To help address this critical issue and promote the training of IT security specialists and research in the area of cyber security, EPFL and ETH Zurich, with the support of the Swiss government, are teaming up to offer a new joint Master’s degree in Cyber Security starting in the 2019-20 school year.\n\"Switzerland has been long recognized for its strengths in terms of reliability and trust. We have an outstanding education system, with two federal institutes of technology, ETH Zurich and EPFL, which are among the best in the world. Our universities and institutes of higher education are also at the forefront in many domains. It is in the light of these attributes that Switzerland can, and must, play a leading role in cyber security\", says Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin, Head of the Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research.\nThis new Master’s program was presented on Tuesday 19 March at a press conference attended by Federal Councilor Guy Parmelin, EPFL President Martin Vetterli and ETH Zurich President Joël Mesot. “Through this joint program, we are combining our two schools’ strengths in what is a vital industry for our country. We can build upon a strong track record in cyber security going back to 2003 when the Zurich Information Security and Privacy Center was installed at ETH,” says Joël Mesot.\nEPFL President Martin Vetterli shares Mr. Mesot’s assessment: “EPFL has been investing in cyber security research for over ten years, drawing on highly qualified professors in cryptography, privacy and personal-data protection. By joining forces, we will equip engineers with cutting-edge skills in this important discipline and establish Switzerland as a leader in digital trust.”\nThis will be Switzerland’s first university-level degree program in Cyber Security – a booming field with excellent job prospects. “Soon every company above a certain size will need to hire a cyber security manager. And they aren’t the only ones that will have to protect themselves – countries are also vulnerable. As digitalization takes hold, critical infrastructure like power generation and distribution will be increasingly targeted by cyberattacks,” says Professor Mark Pauly, who heads up the program at EPFL.\nThe program will start in the fall of 2019. The topics covered will include cryptography; hardware, software and network security; and methods for ensuring system security and earning user trust. The courses will incorporate practical components and address not just the technical aspects of cyber security, but also the ethical, legal and business challenges of a field that affects just about every aspect of our lives. The goal will be to equip IT security engineers with the full range of fundamental and applied skills they need to remain at the forefront of their profession. “Students will be able to choose from a wide range of courses at both ETH Zurich and EPFL. And once they graduate, they will have excellent career opportunities, whether in industry, the public sector or research,” says Professor Peter Müller, who is in charge of the program at ETH Zurich.\nCourses will be given in English. Students can select whether to follow the program at EPFL or ETH Zurich – the two schools’ admission processes will be coordinated – but they must complete one semester at the other school. The program will be structured slightly differently at the two schools, but the skills taught and the number of credits (120) will be the same. The diploma will bear the logos of both schools.\nThe program is intended primarily for students with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology or communication systems. But students with Bachelor’s degrees in other disciplines can also apply provided they have the necessary prerequisites.

In the summer, the heat generated by people packed into unairconditioned cars spills out into the platforms, and in the winter, the railcar heating system ends up warming the tunnels, too. Margaux Peltier, a scientific assistant at EPFL’s Laboratory of Soil Mechanics (LMS), came up with an idea for recovering this excess heat with geothermal panels, and then using it to heat water in the summer or nearby buildings in the winter. Her invention was selected to represent Switzerland in the finals of the ClimateLaunchPad competition, which will be held in Amsterdam on 14–15 November.\nSoon to be tested in a Lausanne parking garage\nThe geothermic panels were developed by Enerdrape, a startup that Peltier founded in 2018. They consist of layers of a heat-absorbing material and a system of tubes that run behind the panels and contain a heat transfer fluid. For the past year, Peltier has been enhancing the design of her panels through research conducted under the supervision of Lyesse Laloui at the LMS. “We were able to achieve yields of 70–100 Watts per square meter in our initial lab tests, which is excellent,” she says. Another benefit to her panels is that they appear to generate a fairly constant amount of energy, which makes them practical for real-world applications. The second prototype, built specifically for pilot runs, should be tested in a Lausanne parking garage soon. Because Peltier’s panels are modular, they can be installed on any type of wall configuration, including those found in parking garages, subway stations, train tunnels and more.\nCompeting against 50 other countries\nThe innovative geothermal panels were selected this past September as Switzerland’s entry in the international ClimateLaunchPad competition.

Their idea was simple: invent a computer that could be controlled remotely using hand gestures, without needing a keyboard or mouse. “We started working on it in 2006, when this was a novel concept. That was before Kinect. A small number of engineers were experimenting with technology that enabled users to see environments in 3D, but nothing had been invented yet,” says Kaplan.\nTheir first machine, QB1, consists of a screen and a 3D camera in a neck-like structure. It can be controlled remotely with gestures, and it tracks users visually by surrounding them with an interactive halo. Samsung and Logitech purchased early versions of the QB1, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York included the machine in one of its exhibitions.\nIn 2010, OZWE shifted its focus and decided to apply its interface expertise to the brand new iPad tablet market by developing eBook reader apps for iPads and iPhones. The company partners with BBStudio, a design and publishing agency and develops interactive books under the Bookapp.com brand. “We wanted to become a leading player in the transition from printed documents to electronic interfaces,” says Kaplan. “We contacted several publishing houses and quickly ramped up our expertise in this area. We eventually became the market leader in Switzerland and established a foothold in the French market.” That’s when Intissar joined the team. Kaplan recalls: “We hired Stéphane because we needed a video-games specialist, since some of ’s programs – like children’s books and virtual museum tours – had immersive, 3D environments.”\nIn 2014, OZWE became OZWE Games and Intissar replaced Kaplan as the company’s CEO. “I’d just been appointed an assistant professor at EPFL and didn’t have as much time to devote to the company,” says Kaplan. “This also led OZWE to re-focus on games.”\nThe European Business Awards\nThe European Business Awards were established in 2007 to recognize the best businesses in Europe in terms of innovation and ethical practices. In this year’s edition, 363 companies are competing for awards in 18 different categories. The finals will be held in Warsaw on 3–4 December.

{"id": 1862, "text": "Dominique Pioletti’s first visit to EPFL came at the age of three when he accompanied his father, an Italian immigrant truck driver. At the time, the campus was still a building site. Fast forward to today and Pioletti, whose mother is Swiss, goes to the School every day in his role as an associate professor. On sunny days, he likes to make the journey in his red 1960s Fiat 500 – a car he’d long dreamed of owning before he finally got his hands on one. “Every time I get behind the wheel, it’s like a new adventure,” he says. “I can never be sure it’s going to start.”\nPioletti, whose background is in physics, enrolled as a student at EPFL in 1987. A self-confessed risk-taker, he enjoys the thrill of teaching. “I thrive on pressure,” he explains. “The students are demanding and you get instant feedback. As a researcher, it’s important to remain grounded.” Pioletti spends a lot of his time teaching. Last year, he , giving students a chance to work directly on clinical problems encountered by doctors. Pioletti has received the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching 2019 in recognition of his project-based model, the implementation of new lab sessions, and of the overall standard of his teaching.\nPutting knowledge into practice\nConvincing busy surgeons in Lausanne, Geneva, Bern and Zurich to give some of their time to students was no easy task. But as luck would have it, Pioletti has built up an extensive network of contacts over the years. He even considered a career in medicine at one stage, but decided to opt for engineering after realizing that dealing with patients wasn’t his thing. Despite his change of heart, he’s never lost his interest in devising new ways to “take better care of people.” In his own words, Pioletti has long been “immersed in the world of medicine” – ever since he wrote his thesis on the mechanical behavior of cruciate knee ligament tissue. He’d even torn his own cruciate ligaments twice before completing his PhD: once playing soccer and a second time while skiing.\nThe students enrolled in his Master’s class last year enjoyed the full benefits of Pioletti’s interdisciplinary expertise. They spent 14 weeks, in groups of four or five, dealing firsthand with real-life problems encountered by the doctors who agreed to take part. “The students were much more motivated than I could have hoped for,” says Pioletti. “The projects force them to apply their knowledge while taking into account real-world constraints, and to interact with people from different disciplines. It helps get them ready for working life.”\nFor Pioletti, who heads up EPFL’s Laboratory of Biomechanical Orthopedics (LBO), there’s no substitute for the hands-on application of classroom learning. That is why he reworked his experimental methods in biomechanics course, a Bachelor’s-level mechanical engineering class, along these lines. Pioletti gives the students six open-ended questions inspired by research at LBO. For instance, he recently asked students what biomechanical tests they would recommend to a surgeon working with an artificial tendon. After a brief introduction to the theory behind each question, the students are divided into pairs and have six hours to design a protocol and draw conclusions from their experiments. “The exercise teaches students how to conduct scientific experiments and how to keep a laboratory notebook,” explains Pioletti. “Ultimately, the process matters more than the end result.”\nPioletti says that he’s “rediscovered the joy of teaching” since introducing these new approaches, and that he “no longer gets frustrated by seeing students listen passively without applying what they’ve learned.” He also admits that the new class formats have forced him to “step outside his comfort zone”. For the proud owner of a 1960s Fiat 500, uncertainty comes with the territory.", "summary": "Dominique Pioletti, an associate professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering, has won the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching 2019.

Innovation Park is an ideal base for us, given our desire for long-term collaboration with our partners,” says Tobias Kober, Head of the Lausanne branch of Siemens.\nFor a decade now, a Siemens’ research team has been working on the facilities of CIBM and CHUV. The close collaboration began with the CHUV radiology department jointly developing, along with clinicians, new methods of brain and heart imaging to improve both diagnosis and patient comfort. In particular, this has resulted in the ability to automatically quantify the volumes of key structures in the brain, which helps in the diagnosis of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Results have already been implemented on commercial devices. “Since 2010, thousands of patients have benefited from these new techniques,” says Reto Meuli, Chair of the Radiology Department at the CHUV.\nIn addition, research in connection with EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS5, led by Jean-Philippe Thiran) and the research center CVMR (CardioVascular Magnetic Resonance, led by Matthias Stuber) has now resulted in a method that has already significantly improved image contrast. The goal now is to expand the range of conditions for MRI diagnosis by enhancing the quality and speed of acquisition. “MRI is a growing field,” affirms Tobias Kober.\n A dozen researchers, including two doctoral students supervised by Jean-Philippe Thiran, Professor at EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory and the Radiology Department of the CHUV, are working at this new center in Lausanne. On the hospital grounds of the CHUV, a group of 18 researchers supervised by Professor Matthias Stuber are developing new quantitative methods for MRI.\nOpened in 2010, EPFL Innovation Park encourages collaborations between industry and academia by hosting researchers and engineers from major corporations.

{"id": 1864, "text": "Some Swiss health insurance companies offer incentives to encourage people to walk 10,000 steps a day. This works out to about seven kilometers and over an hour of walking a day, in addition to any steps taken indoors. For most people, their already busy schedules mean it is not easy to find extra time to go walking, even if the steps do not have to be taken all in one go and can be broken down into 10- to 30-minute bouts. For his thesis, Derek Christie, a researcher in EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, spoke to over 70 of these frequent walkers in the Lake Geneva region. He looked at how these men and women organize their time, what they get out of so much walking, why they do it, and whether their behaviour might herald a change towards more sustainable mobility practices.\nFirst of all, Derek Christie’s thesis, which he presented on 20 April 2018, shows that regular walking is achievable for most people without a disability. To get started, you just need to be organized and highly motivated. From there, it’s possible get into a routine in which walking becomes part of your daily life. Most of the people he spoke to had begun frequent walking because of a particular event or in the context of a change in lifestyle – similar to what has been observed in people who give up smoking. The use of a pedometer, either mechanical or on a smartphone, often played a decisive role. Other triggers included Nordic walking, health problems (particularly cardiovascular issues) and the desire to lose weight.\nA simple way of improving one's well-being\nOnce they had made the change, most of the frequent walkers found it easy to keep up their routine over several months without being put off by inconveniences such as the weather. For the most part, they kept up their routine simply because of the pleasure they got out of it. Another key motivation was personal health, usually described as a general sense of well-being. \nA total of 74 volunteers took part in the study; 41 semi-directive recorded interviews were held, and 48 people were equipped with an offline GPS tracker that they carried in their pocket. Some people took part in both the interviews and the GPS monitoring, while others were involved in just one of the two phases of the study. A third phase, which comprised medical tests conducted in collaboration with the Geneva University Hospitals Health Bus (Bus Santé), involved 27 volunteers. This partnership with the Unit of Population Epidemiology in Geneva will form the basis of a more ambitious study planned for a later date. The aim will be to determine the relationship between regular walking and glycemia, total cholesterol, blood pressure, resting heart rate, body mass index and the waist-hip ratio.\nFacilitators and obstacles to walking\nA cross-analysis showed that time-management strategies like getting up earlier or changing the route on the way out or back were common. Walking was also facilitated – but not decisively – by parks and other green spaces. Some of the obstacles encountered included road traffic, narrow or missing sidewalks, slow traffic lights, and exposure to traffic noise, air pollution or tobacco smoke. Environmental motivations were rarely mentioned, and the researcher found no evidence of an informal community of frequent walkers, who usually do not know each other and tend to switch off while walking, keeping themselves rather closed off socially. Individual rather than collective motivations clearly emerged from the analysis.\nFinally, the thesis looked at whether these frequent walkers could be viewed as a pioneer group that might herald a shift towards a healthier model of walking-based mobility. Dr Christie found that most of these people like to keep to themselves while walking and are therefore unlikely to start a frequent walkers’ revolution. But the researcher concluded that: “public authorities, as well as the private sector and civil society organizations, can learn a lot from these pioneering walkers. It would be worthwhile to look in greater depth at what prompts people to take up this activity and what needs to be put in place in public spaces so that they can keep up their routine over the long term. This would be beneficial for both the walkers’ health and for mobility and the environment in general.”", "summary": "For his thesis, Derek Christie studied people who walk outdoors for more than one hour per day.

{"id": 1869, "text": "Internet users probably won’t even notice. But on June 6, 2012, a new Internet Protocol, IPv6, will be released, easing the worldwide shortage of IP addresses, identification numbers that are assigned to every device connected to the Internet. Along with Internet giants such as Google, Facebook, and Yahoo!, EPFL is participating in this migration, as are thousands of other public and private institutions and companies around the world. “This will allow EPFL to set the example and look towards the future, in anticipation of this unavoidable evolution,” explains Jean-Claude Berney, EPFL’s director of Information Technology.\nThe pioneers of the Internet never dreamed that one day all available IP addresses would be exhausted – in fact, the current Internet Protocol, IPv4, theoretically has 4,294,967,296 addresses. But their planning didn’t take into account the increasing and massive usage of the Internet in countries like China and India. Add to this the exponential growth in smartphones and tablets, each of which also needs an IP address, and the problem becomes evident. The IPv6 protocol is the solution that has been globally adopted for dealing with this situation, and it will allow an inexhaustible number of IP addresses (3.4 x 1038).\nThe web’s rapid growth and the concomitant IP address situation is going to effect everyone involved – operators, content providers, and companies involved in e-commerce – because the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will be irreversible. This means that both protocols will have to continue to operate in parallel until IPv6 is fully adopted. However, even though this massive migration will take several years to accomplish, it is already well underway. In Switzerland, SWITCH has for many years already enabled public institutions like EPFL to take the necessary steps to stay up to date. And several private companies can likewise take advantage of offers from their Internet Service Providers.\nEPFL’s IT department will deploy IPv6 on the School’s network, which will enable it to respond to the requests of several laboratories who already need it for their research activities. “The transition from one protocol to another should be transparent to the user,” says Soumaya Lanouar, who as part of EPFL’s network services team is participating in the IPv6 migration. “We’re offering a flexible solution in which both IPv4 and IPv6 can function in parallel on every platform. The two protocols will remain in place independently of each other and we are focused on maintaining the level of quality of existing service.”\nEPFL also participated the IPv6 World Launch Day on June 8, 2011, during which a portion of the Internet became an experimental zone for testing the new protocol. The IT team is thus ready to make this necessary and inevitable transition; to train those involved and to deal with any security issues that emerge as the new technology is adopted.", "summary": "On June 6, 2012, EPFL will participate in launching the new Internet protocol IPv6.", "claim": "On 3.4 x 1038, EPFL will participate in launching the new Internet protocol IPv6.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 3], "noise": false}

{"id": 1875, "text": "To overcome the many problems posed by kerosene lamps used by 1.6 billion people across the globe, LEDsafari has developed an ingenious system for a do it yourself lamp made from equipment available on site, such as electrical wire, a mobile phone battery and empty bottles. More than 200 people in India, Kenya and Tanzania who attended the workshop are already receiving the economic and health benefits of this ingenious system and are enjoying daily light through this process.\nUsing kerosene poses many problems. Financial problems are first: the $2–$3 per week spent on fuel often represents 20% of a family’s budget. Health is of equal concern: kerosene is extremely toxic when burned, and daily use equals the inhalation of smoke from 40 cigarettes, often increasing the risk of serious lung diseases, according to a recent study by the University of Berkeley. At the global level, this releases 265 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Added to this is the danger of the device itself, which causes severe burns on millions of people each year.\nThe development of a new light source for third world countries faces two recurring problems: cost and long-term integration into everyday life. Govinda Upadhyay, PhD student in the Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory, had the bright idea to develop this bare-bones but effective lamp. Designed to be made by anyone, these lamps require nothing more than locally-found equipment. Only the solar panels are ordered from abroad. Five to six hours of charging in the sun is enough to give four to five hours of light.\nThere is no patent to impede the widespread use of the system developed by the researcher. Only an electric cable, mobile phone battery, an on / off switch and LED are needed. The shade can be customized, made with empty bottles or boxes of various shapes. The design has already been field tested since the founder of the start-up and his team – Elisa Wepfer, Vincenzo Capogna, Naomi Savioz and Parag Rastogi – have already visited several regions in India, Tanzania and Kenya to disseminate their knowledge. The young doctoral candidate relies on these globetrotters to spread the word.\nThe materials needed for making 100 lamps weighs 1kg – easy to fit in a carry-on. “Globetrotters who like to mix business with pleasure can attend a day of training with the start-up in Switzerland,” he says. “They then go share this new knowledge with a village in a developing country for three days before going on vacation. It adds a humanitarian touch that fans of traveling off the beaten track appreciate.”\nTo best address the concept of sustainable development among beneficiaries and thereby foster their understanding of the importance of solar energy, Govinda has developed a lesson plan centered on the lamp. Using concrete examples, it starts by creating an awareness of the negative affects of the kerosene lamp on health and the environment, so that people understand why it is important to change this part of daily life. It also addresses the recycling of waste related to lamps. The second day of the workshop is devoted to learning lamp assembly. Each person will then be able to teach this new method to other members of the community. “It is important that the know-how also comes from the people themselves, that they take ownership of the system so that it is not simply an element imported from rich countries that they soon forget.

{"id": 1877, "text": "EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR), located within the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), has been breaking new ground in sociological research for a decade and a half. Lab head Vincent Kaufmann spoke with us about the benefits that this type of research has already brought to EPFL and the new areas he is exploring.\nWhat goals did you have for LaSUR when you set it up in 2003?\nWe wanted to go beyond the strict definition of urban sociology put forth by the Chicago school in the 1920s, which was to study “the man endowed with locomotion”. We used that definition as a starting point, then looked at how sociology can be incorporated into the fields of engineering and architecture. This vision, coupled with the work done by Luca Pattaroni and Yves Pedrazzini – both senior scientists at LaSUR – enabled us to come up with an entirely new discipline called “polytechnic sociology”. Unlike traditional sociology, our new approach also draws on engineering methods like modeling and architectural concepts like how a space is used. The idea is to look at problems from the perspective of city residents – the individuals who live there day in and day out – to better understand what a neighborhood needs to best serve its inhabitants.\nWhat purpose do the social sciences serve in an engineering school? \nEngineering is fundamentally a human science; it can’t exist apart from society. Within an engineering school, the social sciences serve to put the focus of technological development back on the humans using the technology. Buildings and other structures – whether designed by architects or civil engineers – are rarely perceived by their users in the same way as they were conceived and “created” by their designers. As humans, we have an excellent capacity to see things differently and to critique them. Our discipline of engineering sociology aims to discover how architects and engineers can use that capacity to construct more livable cities that are at once equitable and respectful of differences.\nWhat’s it like teaching sociology to engineers? \nI had to quickly learn to tone down the sociological academic jargon if I wanted to be understood. That wasn’t easy! But I came to realize that the jargon really isn’t that important – concepts can be explained perfectly well in layman’s terms. In return, I learned more about architecture and engineering and have drawn on those concepts in my teaching. At our lab we have seen that sociology can serve as a link among the various fields taught in ENAC’s interdisciplinary programs, which bring together students from architecture and engineering.\nWhat’s your impression looking back at these 15 years of research at EPFL?\nI think the social sciences have played an important role in research innovation at our school. We have published some 600 articles in trade journals for engineering, architecture and sociology. Some of our articles are cited frequently, such as those exploring the concept of “motility.” For instance, Pattaroni’s new ways of conceptualizing lifestyles show that people are influenced not only by socio-economic factors but also by the built space around them. One of our former PhD students even created her own consulting firm based on this idea. And some EPFL architects such as Inès Lamunière and Emmanuel Rey have incorporated our findings into their practice. The EPFL Transportation Center we opened with Michel Bierlaire in 2009, and with the help of Michaël Thémans, is doing well; researchers there are looking at how the social sciences can be used to develop mobility solutions for the future. Companies including Toyota, Renault, EDF and SNCF have commissioned joint research projects with the center. However, what we’re most proud of is that many of our former PhD students now work as professors in universities around the world.\nDo engineering schools often incorporate sociology into their teaching and research? \nNNot really. At MIT, 10% of research funding are dedicated to the social sciences, which is a large percentage. Berkeley also allocates a considerable sum, as do a few engineering schools in the UK. But EPFL is the only engineering school in continental Europe to take a close look at the field – and we are starting to make a name for ourselves. Researchers from other schools have been visiting us regularly over the past few years to learn more about our approach. In 2017, French transportation minister Élisabeth Borne asked us to give her a presentation of our key findings when she first took office. And in December we gave a presentation to Tongji University, since they would like to open a similar lab in Shanghai.\nWhat will LaSUR be working on in the coming years?\nWe are currently addressing three new research topics. The first aims to develop software that can help architects promote energy-efficient lifestyles. The software is intended to be used in the planning phase of a project. The second looks at “the urban pace of life,” factoring in concepts from transportation engineering. The goal is to help us understand why the pace of life has accelerated so much since the 1980s and what we can do to calm things down. The third relates more closely to sociology, and involves studying the different kinds of urban hospitality we have here in Switzerland. That is, how our country’s cities accommodate expatriates, refugees and cross-border workers. This third topic is being sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).\nSociology at EPFL\n1969\n: The Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) was created.\n1971\n: EPFL appointed its first sociology professor, within its Institute of architecture, and created the \nInstitute of Building Research (IREC)\n bringing together political scientists, economists, urban planners, geographers, architects and sociologists.\n2001\n: IREC became \nINTER, \na research institute within the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC).

This was the first Open Doors at EPFL in six years, and it brought in around 35,000 visitors. 23,000 of them, many of them families, came on Sunday alone. This weekend-long event also included Scientastic, EPFL’s annual science festival.\nA school with so many fields of interest \n EPFL’s many labs and teams worked extremely hard, as they developed 247 wide-ranging activities suitable for young and old alike. “We achieved what we set out to do during these two days,” said Madeleine von Holzen, EPFL’s spokesperson. “Visitors discovered the real breadth of the school and saw that science is both accessible and fun.” Over 1,500 staff members took part in informing the public about science in layman’s terms.\nThe weekend’s unifying theme – the passing of time – was explored through seven different topics: the campus, the elements, space-time, humans of tomorrow, virtual worlds, perceptions, and everyday life of the future. This provided visitors with plenty of ways to further explore their personal interests.\nArtLab was a main attraction\n The new ArtLab, inaugurated two days previously, pulled in visitors like a magnet. This long, iconic building will be open to the public throughout the year. It comprises three distinct spaces: the Montreux Jazz Café, where visitors can immerse themselves in the archives of the famous jazz festival; the \nDatasquare\n, which introduces visitors to some of EPFL’s most important research projects; and an experimental space that highlights the intersection of new technologies and art. This space is currently hosting a ground-breaking exhibition devoted to French artist Pierre Soulages, which was developed together with the Fondation Gandur pour l’Art.

{"id": 1880, "text": "This is the first time the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research has published a report on research and innovation in Switzerland. What is the purpose of such a report?\nDominique Foray:\n The report was written in response to a request by the parliament. Switzerland’s high standing in terms of innovation is well-known thanks to several international rankings. What has been lacking until now is a scientific foundation to underpin this assessment. The numbers are revised every two years, and the full report is updated every four years so that we can detect trends.\nYou highlight a number of strengths, such as the quality of the educational system and the country’s international openness. But are precisely these conditions not deteriorating?\nOf course, there are tensions and uncertainties related to budgetary cuts and in the wake of the initiative to curb mass immigration. The risks associated to the latter go well beyond losing access to European research funding; they also threaten the job market and the creation of new companies, which are often founded by foreigners. Nonetheless, we emphasize that within Switzerland, there is still unexploited potential to promote research and innovation, starting with hiring more women in scientific fields.\nWe are seeing a number of startups move abroad. Could we not do more to support them?\nIt is true that comparisons with countries like Sweden and Israel can be perplexing. In the case of Israel, the state plays a particularly active role in directing investments; a position that would not be well received here in Switzerland. Despite that, the idea of a “fund for the future” financed by one percent of the turnover of pension funds has been making headway. It would be an excellent way to stimulate the development of startups, especially in fields related to computer science, that are struggling to convince investors despite their tremendous potential.", "summary": "Dominique Foray, a professor at EPFL’s College of Management, is one of the authors of the first Federal Report on Research and Innovation in Switzerland, presented today in Bern.

{"id": 1882, "text": "While the technology for recycling PET already exists, the systems currently out there have a number of limitations. For example, there is no way to create plastic bottles made entirely of recycled PET – at least some of the raw materials must be new. “That means purchasing them from refineries, which convert oil into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, the two compounds needed to make PET,” says Samantha Anderson, founder & CEO of DePoly and a PhD student at the Laboratory of Molecular Simulation (LSMO) at EPFL’s Valais-Wallis campus. In addition, many PET containers can’t be recycled because they contain chemical and food contaminants, additives or dyes – most of these containers end up being incinerated.\nRecycling through depolymerization\nDePoly has developed an innovative method that can recycle just about any PET container using a chemical process that breaks down the plastic into its base compounds. “It doesn’t matter if the container held water, peanut butter or soap, or if it’s crystal clear or pitch black,” says Anderson. With the new method, PET containers don’t have to be sorted by color, meaning they can all be processed in one batch. The method also works with fabrics like polyester, breaking down old t-shirts, for example, into cotton and PET fibers.\nThe chemical process involves depolymerizing the PET – hence the name DePoly. “We combine the plastic with various compounds in a reactor and then apply light to the mixture to trigger a series of chemical reactions. These reactions break the bonds between the ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, freeing up the compounds for further use,” says Anderson. The process results in ethylene glycol in clear liquid form and terephthalic acid as a white powder, which are then easily separable. The process also generates a small amount of dyes, additives and other waste. Anderson will not reveal any more details, since a patent for the technology is pending.\nSamantha Anderson, founder of DePoly, at the awards ceremony >>venture>>> © Alessandro Della Bella \nAn award-winning innovation\nThis year DePoly competed in the 2019 >>venture>> competition, in the Hardware category, and took home the grand prize. >>venture>> is a Swiss entrepreneurship competition held every year by EPFL, ETH Zurich, McKinsey & Company, Knecht Holding and Innosuisse. Winners receive 150,000 francs and a package of business consulting services. They also join the >>venture>> network to make contacts and boost their visibility.\nTo develop the method, Anderson teamed up with two LSMO colleagues: postdoc Christopher Ireland and PhD student Bardiya Valizadeh. “DePoly had already received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation and an Innogrant before winning >>venture>>,” says Professor Berend Smit, head of LSMO, the lab that supported the research. “I’m very proud of the team’s success.”\nMembers of the start-up DePoly: Bardiya Valizadeh, Samantha Anderson and Christopher Ireland © Patrick Favre\nTests on an industrial scale\nThe next step for DePoly will be to scale up its technology from the lab to industry. “In November, we will begin building a pilot unit with more capacity than the lab,” says Anderson. The unit, located at the Central Valais Waste Treatment Plant in Uvrier, will allow the startup to test and refine its method so that it performs well under industrial conditions. “The testing phase will probably last a year,” says Anderson. “I’m sure chemical recycling methods for PET will eventually hit the market – if not our method, then someone else’s. We aren’t the only ones working on this approach.”\nFor now Anderson is dividing her time between managing DePoly and writing her thesis. But after she graduates in November, she will devote herself fully to her project, which promises to help clean up the plastic polluting our environment.\nDePoly has also received support from local business incubator The Ark.", "summary": "DePoly, a startup based at EPFL’s Valais-Wallis campus, has developed a chemical-based method for recycling PET containers.

Building A was officially opened in 1993 and has since been joined by 12 others. That building is today being renamed to honor the memory of Claudine and Bernard Vittoz, who founded EPFL Science Park and were generous benefactors.\nEPFL Innovation Park (EIP) currently houses more than 2,250 employees, 26 large companies, 116 start-ups and more than 75 entrepreneurial projects at the incubator stage – all this on the edge of a campus containing some 340 laboratories. These are impressive figures given that the science park's first seed was planted only 25 years ago.\nIn 1991, when EPFL President Bernard Vittoz launched the Science Park Foundation, he was a pioneer. His ambition was to create a space that would stimulate innovation and the transfer of technology by bringing start-ups and companies close to the university campus, its researchers and students. In 1993, there was the official opening of Building A, the first in a blossoming complex that now features 13 buildings. That marked the creation of Switzerland's first science park, which was renamed EPFL Innovation Park in 2014.\nA new name\nOver its 25-year history, Building A has housed more than 100 start-ups. Today, after an impressive refurbishment, it is celebrating its anniversary by adopting a new name. As a tribute to Bernard Vittoz, as well as his wife Claudine who recently left part of her estate to the Foundation, the building now bears their names. “Professor Vittoz was a visionary who understood very early on the importance of physical proximity between researchers and entrepreneurs,” remembers Jean-Philippe Lallement, CEO of the EPFL Innovation Park Foundation. “His drive and charisma allowed the plan to take shape and develop. Mrs. Vittoz also gave the plan her wholehearted support.”\nThe anniversary is also an opportunity for EIP to continue its development, in order to maintain its appeal and address the needs of its various user communities as effectively as possible. “EPFL Innovation Park is now almost full, so it’s important that we foster the innovative spirit of the companies we have here. A key part of our efforts is to create spaces that encourage interaction and provide opportunities to meet,” explains Marc Gruber, chairman of the EPFL Innovation Park Foundation.\nThe aim is to foster contact between entrepreneurs and researchers, both formally and informally, by creating meeting areas and organizing events. The Foundation plans to create a walkway that shows how scientific ideas born in EPFL’s laboratories have made their way to market. It also wants to encourage members of EIP and the broader campus, as well as visitors, to spend time in the park’s green spaces by installing innovative and attractive furniture there.", "summary": "EPFL Innovation Park is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and its track record speaks for itself.

{"id": 1885, "text": "The computer giants have their heads in the cloud. More and more frequently, massive data processing and storage operations are handled in vast “data centers” constructed by the big Internet companies. Yahoo!, for example, is building a huge center in Avenches (Canton de Vaud). Demand has grown steadily, to the point where computers, and particularly networked computing, have become an absolutely essential part of our culture. The data and programs that underlie all this no longer reside on individual machines, but must now be made accessible from anywhere, without the user needing to know where they’re located. Industry has coined a poetic phrase for this system of organizing data and programs: “cloud computing.”\nBut there’s a storm brewing in this cloud. The amount of data that Internet service providers must absorb and handle is growing at an exponential rate. The energy they consume is likewise increasing – it’s currently estimated that the carbon footprint of the world’s data centers is equivalent to that of the entire global aviation industry!\nAt EPFL, twelve laboratories are joining their expertise to form the ecocloud consortium, launched today in a special event at the Rolex Learning Center. Its objective is to work on reducing the amount of energy these centers consume.\nRunning out of options\nThe pressure to reduce energy consumption is not just environmental; in the U.S. last year, data processing centers consumed 1.5% of the total electricity consumption of the entire country! If this electricity appetite could be curbed, the potential savings would be enormous. “We are observing that in material terms, technological progress is running up against two limitations,” explains professor Babak Falsafi, head of EPFL’s Parallel Systems Architecture Laboratory (PARSA). “We can no longer reduce the current used in microchips, which has up to now made it possible to keep energy consumption from increasing at the same pace as processing power. In addition, the sheer amount of data is increasing way faster than the technology with which to handle it.”\nThe ecocloud center’s ambition can be illustrated on a graph: the increase in data centers’ electricity consumption should not rise exponentially, but linearly. If it doesn’t, the viability of the IT sector will be in jeopardy. “I’m not expecting there to be a real revolution in the next ten years,” emphasizes the professor. “But we are exploring several avenues that may lead to a gradual increase in processor and memory efficiency, by a factor of 100 within ten years.”\nStrong industry support\nEcocloud’s research is organized around three axes: data, energy and intelligence. Promising ideas are already being explored; for example, research into directly cooling processors as a function of the jobs they are doing at a given time; and constructing a “vertical” system in which the memory sits above the processor, in order to increase and optimize the flow of information between them.\nAs evidence of the economic potential of its research, ecocloud already has several industry partners: Credit Suisse, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Nokia, Oracle, Swisscom and Intel. The consortium has secured additional funding from programs in Switzerland (nano-tera) and Europe. “Thanks to the support and expertise of our scientists, we are in a position to become a recognized center of excellence at the European level in the domain of Cloud Computing,” says Falsafi.", "summary": "Launched today, the ecocloud consortium brings several EPFL laboratories together to tackle the skyrocketing electricity demands of Internet data processing centers.", "claim": "Launched last year, the ecocloud consortium brings several EPFL laboratories together to tackle the skyrocketing electricity demands of Internet data processing centers.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 2], "noise": false}

This center will develop interactive “helper” robots, a new generation of intelligent machines that perform tasks for people in their everyday environments and safely co-exist with them. And while most of today’s robots are designed according to engineering concepts used for manufacturing plants, they are not optimal for building robots that have to perform in a home environment. To achieve the grand goal of developing helper robots, fundamental breakthroughs in technology, materials, and control methods will be required. An NCCR constitutes an ideal and timely platform for creating the desired synergies bearing the potential of a quantum leap in robotic technology and further strengthening Switzerland’s already strong international position and visibility in human-oriented robotics. The NCCR will capitalize on the Swiss tradition in micro-engineering, precise manufacturing, and human-friendly technology, creating tremendous opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer at a point in history when developing robots with a human orientation is in a situation strategically similar to that of the nascent personal-computer industry 30 years ago.\nNCCR “Synaptic bases of mental diseases”\n This NCCR targets an open dialogue between researchers in neuroscience and psychiatry through common projects. By creating a platform for cutting edge technology in brain imaging, genetics, and behavior studies, the center will explore the molecular and cellular origins of mental illness.

Contrary to traditional biochemistry, where researchers work on extracted cells, the scientist working at this NCCR will explore living cells in their environment thanks to recent developments in diagnostic tools. One of their goals will be to concentrate on cell signaling, a field of research that promises to discover the early mechanisms that lead to certain diseases. The study of cell membranes will also be an important field of study within the new center—such studies should increase understanding of the receptivity of therapeutic molecules in patients.

On 5 February 2018, he will go to South Korea with a group of around ten researchers from other countries to collect meteorological data in the mountains, close to the Winter Olympics venues of Pyeongchang, Gangneung and Jeongseon. His two-month stay will allow him to follow the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in their entirety. He is writing about the experience on the EPFL Out There blog, on which EPFL scientists post entries from all over the world.\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in environmental science and engineering at EPFL, Josué went to ETH Zurich to complete a master’s degree in atmospheric science. He came back to EPFL in 2017 and is currently a doctoral student in the Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (LTE) led by Alexis Berne.\nFor his PhD, Josué is looking at the meteorological conditions associated with intense riming in mountainous regions. The aim of his work is to achieve a better understanding of what causes major snowfalls and to characterize them more effectively. The ultimate goal is to improve weather forecasting in mountain areas.\nNew data\n In pursuit of the same goal, EPFL has collected a large volume of meteorological data in the last few years, particularly in the Valais region of Switzerland and the Antarctic. Those data have formed the basis of several scientific articles (see  and ). In South Korea, the proximity of mountains to the ocean produces different weather conditions from those seen in the Alps. By comparing data collected in these two regions, EPFL researchers will be able to gain a better understanding of the underlying dynamics.\nFour measurement devices\n Josué Gehring has already installed four measurement devices in the South Korean mountains with Alexis Berne, Christophe Praz (another LTE PhD student) and Jacques Grandjean, from MétéoSuisse: a precipitation radar, a cloud radar, a disdrometer (to measure the size of raindrops and snowflakes) and a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). The MASC, on loan from MétéoSuisse, takes millions of high-resolution photos of snowflakes from various angles, helping researchers to understand their structure.
