{"id": 0, "text": "Even though silicon is one of the most abundant elements, the energy required to make silicon from sand is immense. It is for this reason, but also to reduce manufacturing costs, that Professor Christophe Ballif and his team from the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory at the EPFL have been working for several years on thin-film silicon solar cells that are a thousand times thinner than conventional cells.\nThere’s just one catch: the thinner the cells, the less they absorb the rays of the sun and the less electricity they produce. So researchers are trying to trap light in the thin silicon layers to increase their absorption. Traditionally, thin layers of zinc oxide—a material that is very abundant, completely non-toxic, and that grows in the form of small pyramid-shaped crystals—are used for this purpose. These crystals scatter light efficiently into the underlying silicon layer. With such zinc oxide layers, even a new world record cell efficiency was achieved.\nReducing costs\nBut scientists are attempting to beat this record. “It is difficult to modify the natural pyramidal shape of these crystals in order to obtain even better light scattering,” explains researcher Corsin Battaglia, “so we had the idea to force the crystals to grow on a different support, an inverted mould with the desired structure.” The idea is as ingenious as it is simple. Once the thin layer of zinc oxide is deposited on the mould all that needs to be done is to “demould” it—as you would a tarte tatin, for example—to obtain a film with the desired structure.\nThis procedure, described in the September edition of the journal Nature Photonics, not only increases the amount of light that is trapped, thereby increasing output, but it also has the potential to reduce the cost of the cells because of its compatibility with mass production. These are interesting arguments at a time when photovoltaics is seeking to produce electricity at a lower price than the current grid price.", "summary": "Do better with less.

{"id": 5, "text": "Many areas of fundamental research are interested in graphene owing to its exceptional characteristics. It is made of one layer of carbon atoms, which makes it light and sturdy, and it is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Despite its apparently limitless potential, however, few applications have been demonstrated to date. Scientists at EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory (BIOS) together with researchers from the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO, Spain) have now added another one. They have harnessed graphene’s unique optical and electronic properties to develop a reconfigurable highly sensitive molecule sensor. The results are described in an article appearing in the latest edition of the journal \nScience\n. \n Focussing light to improve sensing \n The researchers used graphene to improve on a well-­‐known molecule-­‐detection method: infrared absorption spectroscopy. In the standard method, light is used to excite the molecules, which vibrate differently depending on their nature. It can be compared to a guitar string, which makes different sounds depending on its length. By virtue of this vibration, the molecules reveal their presence and even their identity. This “signature” can be “read” in the reflected light. \n This method is not effective, however, in detecting nanometrically-­‐sized molecules. The wavelength of the infrared photon directed at a molecule is around 6 microns (6,000 nanometres – 0.006 millimeters), while the target measures only a few nanometres (about 0.000001 mm). It is very challenging to detect the vibration of such a small molecule in reflected light. \n There is where graphene comes in. If given the correct geometry, the graphene is able to focus the light on a precise spot on its surface and “hear” the vibration of a nanometric molecule that is attached to it. “We first pattern nanostructures on the graphene surface by bombarding it with electron beams and etching it with oxygen ions,” said Daniel Rodrigo, co‐author of the publication. “When the light arrives, the electrons in graphene nanostructures begin to oscillate. This phenomenon, known as ‘localized surface plasmon resonance,’ serves to concentrate light into tiny spots, which are comparable with the dimensions of the target molecules. It is then possible to detect nanometric structures.”\nReconfiguring graphene in real time to see the molecule’s structure\n There is more to it. In addition to identifying the presence of nanometric molecules, this process can also reveal the nature of the bonds connecting the atoms that the molecule is composed of.\nWhen a molecule vibrates, it does not give off only one type of \"sound.\" It produces a whole range of vibrations, which are generated by the bonds connecting the different atoms. Returning to the example of the guitar: each string vibrates differently and together they form one musical instrument. These nuances provide information on the nature of each bond and on the health of the entire molecule. “These vibrations act as a fingerprint that allow us to identify the molecule; such as proteins, and can even tell their health status” said Odeta Limaj, another co-­author of the publication.\nIn order to pick up the sound given off by each of the strings, it has to be possible to identify a whole range of frequencies. And that is something graphene can do. The researchers “tuned” the graphene to different frequencies by applying voltage, which is not possible with current sensors. Making graphene's electrons oscillate in different ways makes it possible to “read” all the vibrations of the molecule on its surface. “We tested this method on proteins that we attached to the graphene. It gave us a full picture of the molecule,” said Hatice Altug.\nA big step closer to using graphene for molecule sensing\n The new graphene-­‐based process represents a major step forward for the researchers, for several reasons. First, this simple method shows that it is possible to conduct a complex analysis using only one device, while it normally requires many different ones. And all this without stressing or modifying the biological sample. Second, it shows graphene’s incredible potential in the area of detection. “There are many possible applications,” said Altug. “We focussed on biomolecules, but the method should also work for polymers, and many other substances,” she added.\n Source :\nDaniel Rodrigo et al.

{"id": 6, "text": "Is there life on a distant planet? One way astronomers are trying to find out is by analyzing the light that is scattered off a planet’s atmosphere. Some of that light, which originates from the stars it orbits, has interacted with its atmosphere, and provides important clues to the gases it contains. If gases like oxygen, methane or ozone are detected, that could indicate the presence of living organisms. Such gases are known as biosignatures. A team of scientists from EPFL and Tor Vergata University of Rome has developed a statistical model that can help astronomers interpret the results of the search for these “signs of life”. Their research has just been published in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nSince the first exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun – was discovered 25 years ago, over 4,300 more have been identified. And the list is still growing: a new one is discovered every two or three days. Around 200 of the exoplanets found so far are telluric, meaning they consist mainly of rocks, like the Earth. While that’s not the only requirement for a planet to be able to host life – it also needs to have water and be a certain distance from its sun – it is one criterion that astronomers are using to focus their search.\nIn the coming years, the use of gas spectroscopy to detect biosignatures in planets’ atmospheres will become an increasingly important element of astronomy. Many research programs are already under way in this area, such as for the CHEOPS exoplanet-hunting satellite, which went into orbit in December 2019, and the James-Webb optical telescope, scheduled to be launched in October 2021.\nStarting with an unknown\nWhile much progress has been made on detecting exoplanetary biosignatures, several question marks remain. What are the implications of this kind of research? And how should we interpret the results? What if just one biosignature is detected on a planet? Or what if no biosignatures are detected – what should we conclude? Those kinds of questions are what the EPFL-Tor Vergata scientists set out to answer with their new model.\nTheir work tackles the problem from a new angle. Traditionally, astronomers have looked for life on another planet based on what we know about life and biological evolution on Earth. But with their new method, the scientists started with an unknown: how many other planets in our galaxy have some form of life. Their model incorporates factors like the estimated number of other stars in the galaxy similar to the Sun and how many telluric planets might be orbiting within a habitable distance from those stars. It uses Bayesian statistics – particularly well suited to small sample sizes – to calculate the probability of life in our galaxy based on how many biosignatures are detected: one, several or none at all.\n“Intuitively it makes sense that if we find life on one other planet, there are probably many others in the galaxy with some type of living organism. But how many?” says Amedeo Balbi, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics in Tor Vergata’s Physics Department. “Our model turns that intuitive assumption into a statistical calculation, and lets us determine exactly what the numbers mean in terms of quantity and frequency.”\n“Astronomers already use various assumptions to evaluate how credible life is on a given planet,” says Claudio Grimaldi, a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPMC) who is also affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Rome. “One of our research goals was thus to develop a method for weighing and comparing those assumptions in light of the new data that will be collected over the coming years.”\nSpreading from one planet to another\nGiven the small number of planets that will likely be examined in the near future, and assuming that life will emerge independently on any one planet, the EPFL-Tor Vergata study found that if even just one biosignature is detected, we can conclude with a greater than 95% probability that there are over 100,000 inhabited planets in the galaxy – more than the number of pulsars, which are objects created when a massive star explodes at the end of its life. On the other hand, if no biosignatures are detected, we cannot necessarily conclude that other forms of life do not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.\nThe scientists also looked at the theory of panspermia, which states that instead of emerging independently on a given planet, life forms could be carried over from another planet – such as through organic matter or microscopic organisms being carried on comets or spreading between neighboring planets. This implies that the probability of life on a planet also depends on how far it is from other planets and how easily various life forms – whose physical characteristics could be extremely different from those we are familiar with – are able to resist the extreme conditions of space travel and adapt to the new planet. Factoring in panspermia alters the inferred number of inhabited planets elsewhere in the galaxy.", "summary": "One way to determine whether there is life on another planet is to look for biosignatures in the light that is scattered off its atmosphere.

{"id": 8, "text": "Before cell division, the long strings of the cell’s DNA are wrapped tightly into the structures we know as chromosomes. This protects the cell’s genetic material from physical and chemical damage.\nThe ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. These are specialized structures that have to be replicated with each cell division cycle. But the complete replication of telomeres up to the very ends of chromosomes also requires specialized mechanisms, and these are limited. Telomeres are also very sensitive to oxidative damage, which affects their ability to replicate.\nBecause of this, telomeres shrink over time, limiting the lifespan of cells. Telomere shortening is essentially the cause of cell aging.\nNow,  and Wareed Ahmed at EPFL have discovered two antioxidant enzymes that work together to prevent oxidation of telomeric DNA at chromosome ends. The scientists disrupted both the enzymes, called PRDX1 and MTH1, in cancer cells, and found that the cells’ telomeres shrunk with every round of cell division, eventually disappearing altogether.\nOne of the promising targets in cancer therapy is the enzyme telomerase. Normally, telomerase prevents telomeres from shortening in germ and stem cells, which helps with development. But telomerase is also highly active in cancer cells, keeping their telomeres intact and making the cells virtually immortal. The new work shows that disrupting PRDX1 and MTH1 prevents telomerase from counteracting telomere shortening.\nSo far, attempts to efficiently block telomerase in cancer have not been fruitful in the clinic. The discovery of the co-operating enzymes opens up a new opportunity to indirectly block telomerase. “Instead of inhibiting the enzyme itself, we target its substrate – the chromosome end – making it un-extendable by telomerase,” says Lingner.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have identified two enzymes that protect chromosomes from oxidative damage and shortening.

The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nThe School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.\nThe font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge. The School profoundly affects the lives of those who study or teach there. As a hub of research and knowledge, EPFL is a source of personal and professional fulfillment. We wanted to reflect all of that in the new design,” says Caroline Moser, CEO of Moser Design.\nThe new visual identity consists of more than just the logo, as it covers the full range of graphic elements that convey the School’s brand. The logo itself figures prominently on campus, in the form of a 2.6-meter-high metal sculpture next to the Rolex Learning Center.\nModern-day agora pays tribute to the past\nThe symbolic launch of the School’s 50th anniversary celebration would not have been complete without paying tribute to Maurice Cosandey, the visionary who in 1969 turned what was then a local engineering school into a Swiss federal institute of technology.\nThe Lombard Odier Agora was therefore inaugurated today in Place Maurice Cosandey – the square named after EPFL’s first president – in a ceremony attended by the Cosandey family.\nPlace Maurice Cosandey sits at the southern entrance of the campus, between the Rolex Learning Center and ArtLab. It was chosen for the Agora as part of an initiative originating with the ArtLab project to revamp this area. The redevelopment project was led by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE), which is headed by architecture professor Dieter Dietz. “Our goal for this project was clear: to get the entire EPFL community – especially students – involved in order to breathe life into a neglected part of campus,” says Dietz.

High-precision technology is used in numerous space instruments, EPFL’s CleanSpace One satellite project is aimed at one day cleaning up space debris, and Swiss chocolate has now been sent into space. Each of the six astronauts* currently serving on the International Space Station (ISS) has received a box with six brand-name chocolate bars. They were included in the latest resupply mission, which was carried by a SpaceX rocket launched on 8 April. The special delivery, sponsored by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), was carefully prepared by the Swiss Space Center (SSC), at EPFL. As a thank you, the British astronaut Tim Peake sent a picture yesterday.\n“This initiative was undertaken as part of Switzerland’s co-presidency of the European Space Agency Ministerial Council,” said Volker Gass, the director of the SSC. “The aim is to encourage and support the astronauts in their work in a symbolic way that reflects our country’s spirit and culture.”\nBut sending food into space is no cakewalk. As for any object or person preparing to leave Earth’s atmosphere, strict conditions must be met. In the end, it took six months for the chocolates, which were packaged last September, to finally get off the ground. While the launch was delayed several times since the start of the year, the chocolates also had to undergo the full gamut of checks and tests.\nRecipe revealed\nFirst, the proposal had to be approved by the European Space Agency (ESA).

The weight of the boxes had to be minimized as well, which was done by removing all unnecessary paper and cardboard. And the manufacturer had to provide a full and detailed list of ingredients, thus revealing part of its trade secret.\nNo sharp corners\nThe boxes were then sent to the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), in the Netherlands, whose work includes testing satellites and their sub-systems by simulating the conditions they will experience when launched and once in space.\n“All objects going to the ISS have to undergo testing to ensure they are not flammable, do not produce fragments that could spread around the cabin, and cannot injure the astronauts,” said Bernd Rattenbacher, from the Center of Competence in Aerospace Biomedical Science & Technology at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\nESTEC’s main task was to ensure that the boxes did not have any sharp corners or edges presenting a risk of injury. Once approved, the boxes were sent to the Aerospace Logistics Technology Engineering Company (ALTEC), another ESA center, in Italy. There, the contents of the package were verified and the customs documentation was completed. The package was finally sent to NASA, which delivered it to the ISS from the Cape Canaveral launch site in Florida.\nThe latest word was that it took 10 days after launch for the chocolates to reach the hands of the astronauts, who were busy unpacking three tons of food, equipment and scientific experiments included in the latest resupply mission.

{"id": 34, "text": "“Ouay, ask the nurse what time she’s coming.” “Ouay, tell John to go run errands.” Or “Ouay, I don’t feel well, call the nurse.” The round smart speaker developed by the student team acts on the sound of a user’s voice. And it can connect users with people outside the home – caregivers, friends or family members can send text or voice messages to Ouay through a special app and Ouay reads the messages out loud. By providing a constant connection, the system allows elderly patients to remain independent while at the same time reassuring everyone involved that help is never far away. It has already been tested by several organizations that provide home-care services to the elderly.\nToday there is a host of new systems for helping the elderly or handicapped live on their own, as well as a growing number of specially equipped apartment buildings. These developments are often motivated by the dual goals of improving patients’ lives and keeping costs down. And recent technological advancements, such as in sensors and alert systems, are supporting this trend. But the two people behind the idea for Ouay – Sven Borden, a first-year Master’s student in microengineering at EPFL, and Loïc Rochat, a student in mechanical engineering – found that there was one key element missing, based on their personal experience with elderly people. “We needed a reliable device that patients can use to easily communicate with people outside the home. That would help them feel more independent,” says Borden. They fleshed out their idea at the Zurich hackathon, a weekend-long brainstorming marathon where would-be entrepreneurs come with a business idea and draft a business plan. Once the hackathon was over, the duo took their business plan and decided to run with it.\nA reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit at EPFL \nBorden and Rochat teamed up with other students from EPFL, HEC and HE-ARC, and then spoke with local caregivers and patients in order to pinpoint their needs. “I think Ouay is a good reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit we have here at EPFL,” says Borden. The students initially set up an association to build up their network and pool their funds. Since this initial investment, Ouay has expanded its reach considerably; the student team received an XGrant (financial support that EPFL provides to student startups) as well as a CHF 20,000 FIT Digital grant from Vaud’s Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). The proceeds were used to create the prototypes that are currently being tested by home-care providers.\nHelping people fall asleep with remote hypnosis \nFor elderly patients, even minor inconveniences – like not being able to find something in their apartment or a nurse showing up late – can cause a great deal of stress. And caring for elderly patients can also cause stress for friends and family. To help alleviate these factors, Ouay has a number of useful features including alerts for taking medication, reminders for doctor’s appointments and messages that can reassure someone feeling anxious. These features work through the mobile telephone network. Jean-Luc Tuma, who heads up the local home-care group Uniquecare santé et soins à domicile, sees the clear benefits of the device, which his staff tested: “It’s an excellent way to help patients live autonomously, independently and safely.” And his staff discovered new uses for Ouay as they tried it out in real-life situations. “The most remarkable thing we’ve done so far is having a hypnotherapist use the device to help a patient fall asleep through remote hypnosis,” says Tuma. He believes Ouay will eventually become a standard tool for caregivers.\nThe students officially launched their company and want to bring in more people. They plan to seek out “motivated students aiming to become professional developers, prototype builders or electronic device designers, and give them another opportunity to work on concrete problems,” says Rochat.", "summary": "Two students from EPFL have developed a smart speaker with voice-activation technology that connects patients directly to their loved ones as well as caregivers and emergency services.

And magnetically adhesive robots have been getting larger and more complicated to rise to more difficult challenges. But Rochat’s solution goes against this trend. Its novel magnetic arrangement in the wheel creates sufficient holding force to keep it attached to surfaces even while going around corners upside-down. At the same time, this magnetic force maintains system balance by keeping the motor in place. He thus radically reduced the robot to a match-book size while making it more agile at the same time.\n Technology transfer to industry\n “It is a design solution that did not seem possible,” explains Rochat, “but now future possibilities have opened up that could save millions in costly shut-downs.”\nThe novel design is already being augmented in the laboratory.

Their top spun for longer than their opponents’, who used a drill to get theirs going.\nForty-five teams came from all over French-speaking Switzerland to compete in one of three age groups. The teams comprised three or four kids from the same age group, together with a coach. Three months before the competition, the teams were all given the same experimental challenge. This year, it was to build a top that would spin for as long as possible. “We used really basic materials,” said ten-year-old Eline. “We took a ten-centimeter-long piece of ash wood, sharpened the end with a pencil sharpener, and hammered it into a piece of fiberboard that we had cut into a round shape using a hole saw.” Good explanation from this extremely enthusiastic team, which was competing in the middle age group.\nPresenting the results of their research project\n In the second round of the competition, the kids had to present the results of a scientific project that they had completed before the competition, along with their conclusions.

Eight-year-old Clément, backed by a diagram projected onto a screen, used his hands to illustrate the direction in which the earth rotates. Matias, also eight years old, then continued: “I asked my brother, who’s in Australia, to check whether vortexes really do turn the other way down there.” His brother also participated in this competition once. “This interest in science runs in the family,” said his dad, who was the team’s coach that day.\nThat’s just what this competition is designed to bring out: the goal is to get kids interested in science and research. “They may not yet have the mathematical tools to understand and model a scientific problem,” said Andrea Fabian Montabert, who was in charge of organizing the competition. “But they can still come up with hypotheses, set up an experiment and improve their results through trial and error. And they can make observations and draw conclusions.” The competition lets kids try their hand at scientific and technical experiments in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\nTeamwork and cooperation\n After taking a short quiz designed to test their general science knowledge, the competitors played a fun game that required solid teamwork.

The Delta robot made light work of hundreds of packets of Smarties at the Triennial Interpack Exhibition in Düsseldorf. The inventor of the concept, Reymond Clavel, was presenting in Germany the most recent version of the Delta robot, resulting of a collaboration with Bosch. The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. \nIncreasing speed and maintaining precision\n The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot. Scientists have now been able to take advantage of the progress made in motorization – in both power and cost – and this avoids the use of any such linking components. Thus, they have really gone up a gear. Reymond Clavel reveals: “The idea of direct drive had been tucked away in a drawer for ages, but then again, twenty years ago the cost of such motors would have been much too high.”\nA success story\nFrom chocolates to neurosurgery\nOriginally conceived to manipulate small, light objects such as chocolates, over time the Delta has been used for many other applications.

Working together with neurosurgeons at the University Hospital Center of the canton of Vaud, a tactile feedback device has been developed to enable the surgeon to perform his hand movements.

{"id": 61, "text": "Rising temperatures, increasingly intense rainfall and extended periods of drought are some of the known effects of climate change. But how are trees reacting to them? To find out, a team of researchers from EPFL and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) studied two of the most common plant species found in Switzerland and the rest of Europe: beech and spruce trees. The study,* which was recently published in \nGlobal Change Biology\n, revealed that each species reacts differently, with the amount of moisture in the air playing a greater role than was previously thought.\n\"To find out what forests may look like in the future, we have to understand how each plant species will respond to climate change,\" explains Constant Signarbieux, the scientist in charge of the study, which was carried out at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS).\nThe researchers observed five-to-seven-year-old saplings of the two species for four years, from 2012 to 2015. The saplings were collected at the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura mountains during the colder months, and then replanted in three locations at different altitudes: in the small village of St-Georges (at 1,010 meters), in the Vallon Arboretum in Aubonne (at 570 meters), and in the grounds of the EPFL-run Fondation des Bois Chamblard on the shores of Lake Geneva (395 meters). A fourth group of saplings was kept at its original altitude of 1,350 meters and used as a control group.\nYoung trees at the Aubonne's site, and one reference tree at Marchairuz. (c)ECOS\n\"Transplanting these young trees at lower altitudes meant we could simulate the impact of an average temperature increase of between 1 and 6\n°\nC, in keeping with what is forecast to occur between now and 2100 based on a number of climate-change scenarios,” explains Signarbieux.\nTo beech or not to beech? \nBy regularly measuring each tree's trunk and four main branches, the researchers were able to estimate the trees’ biomass. They noticed that the rise in temperature prolonged the growing season – the period from when the first new leaves or needles appear in the spring until they turn yellow in the autumn – in a similar way for each species. However, the two species demonstrated very different biomass growth. The beech trees did well from the rising temperatures, flourishing quickly and becoming more easily acclimatized to the warmer temperatures than the spruce trees. \"Spruces are a more conservative species and perhaps adapt more slowly,\" says the researcher. \"This could have an immediate impact on our forests, as beech trees are more likely to be predominant going forward.\"\nThe researchers didn't stop there. They wanted to learn more about why the two species grew at different rates – and the reason came as quite a surprise. Their analyses revealed that it had nothing to do with either photosynthesis or the amount of water in the ground. Instead, it was all down to the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) – the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can potentially hold at a given temperature. This gives an indication of how dry the air is and how much pressure the plant's water system is under as a result.\nIt’s all about suction\nA plant's leaves contain microscopic pores, called stomata, which regulate how gases move between the leaves and the atmosphere. \"Plants use these stomata to absorb CO\n2\n from the air through diffusion,\" explains Signarbieux. \"When the pores open to let the gas in, water escapes from the leaves at the same time. This process is known as transpiration and occurs because there is always more moisture in the plant than in the air. It is what creates the suction that pulls water and sap from the soil through the roots, up the stalk and into the leaves.\"\nThe drier the air, the higher the VPD and the greater the suction effect will be. When there are several consecutive days with a high VPD – an ever more regular occurrence due to climate change – plants are put under increasing strain. But different plants react in different ways, as shown by the two species studied. Even before there is no water left in the ground, spruce trees close their stomata to prevent any more hydric stress. Beech trees, however, are more tolerant of this type of stress and wait longer before closing their stomata, which enables them to continue absorbing CO\n2\n and therefore keep growing. This gives them a competitive advantage over the spruces.\nIn the past, average seasonal or annual temperatures and rainfall were used to analyze plants' responses to their environment. But those factors alone don’t explain why the beech and spruce trees grow at such different rates. What makes this study truly original and groundbreaking is that the researchers took account of another variable that is often overlooked: the number of hours during which the VPD was above a certain critical level, indicating that the plant was experiencing exceptionally dry conditions. The biologists now intend to expand their research to other species, in the hope of creating a graphic representation of what Europe’s forests will look like in the future – and to help ensure that they are managed and used sustainably.\n*\nConducted as part of the doctoral thesis by Paula Sanginés, a researcher in the ECOS lab.", "summary": "How do trees adjust to the effects of global warming?

{"id": 62, "text": "“Tutu” by Miles Davis and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple have already made their mark on music history. Now they have entered the annals of science, for eternity. Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA! I've been a part of this festival for decades and it truly is a magnificent representation of what happens when different cultures unite for the sake of music. Absolute magic. And I'm proud to know that the memory of this special place will never be lost.”", "summary": "Thanks to an innovative technology for encoding data in DNA strands, two items of world heritage – songs recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival and digitized by EPFL – have been safeguarded for eternity.

Mr. Jendly is currently manager of the engineering sector of a startup and Vice President of the Neuchâtel arm of Swiss Engineering, a professional network of Swiss engineers and architects that has more than 13,500 members. We caught up with him for a short interview. \nIn a globalized market where competition is extremely fierce, is Swiss manufacturing still profitable in the area of microengineering?\n When it comes to mass-producing basic parts, such as engine parts for example, we can't compete with countries like China and India due to our higher labor costs. However, we do have an advantage when in comes to high-value-added products, or in other words sophisticated and innovative products. This is the case for medical and electronic devices, as well as everything related to watch-making. Generally speaking, Swiss know-how and training guarantee a certain quality that is very much appreciated by clients and partners. They also guarantee profitable production.\nYet several companies have recently left Switzerland, causing a wave of redundancies. Is there a crisis in Swiss manufacturing?\n No, this is not the case for high-value-added products. Some Swiss companies have moved production offshore to Asia or Eastern Europe only to change their minds and come back to Switzerland due to problems of quality. Having to regularly send engineers abroad to resolve such problems is just too expensive in the end. It's also easier if the production site and the R&D site are not too far apart.\nBut some multinationals are quick to relocate...\n Multinationals are different because the decision-makers are not necessarily in Switzerland anyway. Company management just looks at whether one site is more expensive than another. Everything should therefore be done to ensure that Swiss sites are better than those elsewhere in the world. \nAnd how can competitiveness be increased? \nFabrice Jendly is speaking at 11am on Friday 24 August.\n Micro12: from 23 to 25 August 2012\t\n Aula des Jeunes-Rives, Neuchâtel", "summary": "Does Swiss manufacturing have a future in microengineering?

{"id": 67, "text": "Neurons communicate with each other at synapses through complex mechanisms. The synapses establish contact between the neurons and convert their electrical signals into chemical signals, the release of neurotransmitters. Study of these phenomena is one of the essential keys to understanding the brain. The team from the EPFL’s Laboratory of Synaptic Mechanisms, headed by Ralf Schneggenburger, has shed some light on previously unknown functions of proteins in the release of neurotransmitters.\n In the first paper (1), the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to deactivate a protein selectively in the calyx of Held, the brain’s largest synapse. This novel method enabled them to discover a direct, unexpected role for the protein RIM (Rab3 interacting molecule), which increases the density of calcium ion (Ca2+) channels, a type of ion channel that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release.\n In the second article (2), the scientists used mice that had been genetically modified so they would not produce a specific protein, synaptotagmin. This Ca2+-sensing protein is known to bind calcium ions (Ca2+), thus initiating neurotransmitter release. The researchers used a virus to reintroduce the missing gene in the nerve terminal and reestablish the gene function at the calyx of Held.\nA Protein’s Double Life\n Subsequently, the scientists used viruses expressing slightly modified versions of the gene coding for the protein. Careful comparison enabled them to reveal a double role of this protein. The function of synaptotagmin is in fact not limited to initiating neurotransmitter release; it also inhibits other Ca2+- sensing proteins present in the nerve terminal. In doing so, it increases the amplitude of the release signal while suppressing background release events. In other words it optimizes the signal quality, similarly to what occurs in an electronic circuit.\n The approaches developed by Ralf Schneggenburger’s team are promising. They should also help us gain more insight into the function of other proteins that are active in the synapses. Since synaptic transmission is the basis of all fast communication between neurons in the brain, misfunction at synapses can underlie several neurodegenerative- and psychiatric disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's Disease. \"Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular bases of synapse function will contribute to the development of treatment strategies of these disorders in the future,” the researcher explained.\n (1)Neuron, January 27, 2011, “”\n (2)Neuron, February 24, 2011, “”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have made a step forward in understanding signal transmission in neuronal networks, thanks to new methods to molecularly influence the nerve terminal.

{"id": 81, "text": "Most modern buildings are composed of several layers of materials, each with its own important function: the concrete core supports its weight; the insulation regulates its heat exchange; the facade contributes to its aesthetics. Now, engineers at EPFL are developing a single building block that does all of that, and produces electricity. This new component will provide a sleek alternative to traditional construction materials, and will be lighter, safer, and more energy efficient.\n“We use a composite sandwich construction to make this multi-functional building element,” explains Thomas Keller of the Composite Construction Laboratory (CCLab). The sandwich comprises a dense foam interior encased between layers of glass-fibre reinforced polymer. “We started working on these composite materials over 10 years ago and used them in 2009 for the roof of the Main Entrance Building at the Novartis Campus in Basel, Switzerland,” he says.\nAnd now, with funding from, they are trying to add electricity generation to the mix. “Now our goal is to encapsulate a thin flexible sheet of photovoltaic cells beneath a translucent layer of glass fiber reinforced polymer,” he continues. If they succeed, this material could contribute to making solar panels more attractive to architects by offering them more flexibility than traditional construction materials based on reinforced concrete, rigid solar panels, and glass.\nThe solar cell technology comes from Flexcell, a startup from IMT Neuchâtel (since 2009 part of EPFL), that became famous for its flexible sheets of photovoltaic cells. Despite lower efficiencies than conventional photovoltaic cells, their light weight, small volume, and low production costs make them ideal for encapsulation into building elements. And the ease of fitting curved surfaces with them will open new avenues in sustainable architectural design.\nOn top of that there are the other, already demonstrated advantages of these lightweight sandwich components. Prefabrication means that they can be assembled in a factory under ideal conditions before being transported to the construction site, increasing the quality and the safety of the buildings and shortening construction times. And since they are modular, individual elements are easy to repair or to replace if they fail.\nPerfecting the ingredients\n The glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) plays a double role in this sandwich. A layer of GFRP a few millimeters thick encases the foam core, giving the building block its remarkable stability. Another layer of it encapsulates and protects the solar cells, drawing on an interesting optical property of the GFRP: when applied thinly, it is almost as transparent as glass, with an optical transmittance only four percent lower. Currently, a PhD student at the CCLab is perfecting this layer’s thickness to find the best compromise between structural stability and optical translucence.\n“Besides the optical issues,” says Keller, “we are dealing with temperature related issues. Heating the resin leads to a loss of efficiency in light transmission. Beyond a certain critical temperature, the material could degrade and fail to recover its original state when it cools down.” But so far it has withstood temperatures beyond those expected even in the hotter parts of the world, without showing signs of degradation.\nNot yet two years in to the project, the scientists involved are optimistic. Solar electricity generation is here to stay, and considering the widespread use of curved concrete surfaces in contemporary architecture, there could be great potential for this new solar sandwich.", "summary": "All in one: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at EPFL", "claim": "All in only four percent: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at EPFL", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 4], "noise": false}
{"id": 83, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process.

The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.\nEPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).\nEPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.\nHowever, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants.

This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

{"id": 91, "text": "Vincent Kaufmann, a sociologist who specializes in mobility studies, decided to expand his usual focus on urban areas to include Switzerland and the European Union (EU). Kaufmann, who is also the head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, teamed up with Spanish researcher Ander Audikana to write an essay on mobility and the free movement of people in the EU and in Switzerland. The authors’ starting point was the “Stop mass immigration\" initiative, which was approved by voters on 9 February 2014.\nTheir essay provides a Swiss perspective that people concerned about a borderless EU and its unintended consequences might do well to consider. Clive H. Church, researcher at the University of Kent,\nalso draws an interesting parallel between Switzerland and post-Brexit UK in the book’s preface. Vincent Kaufmann tells us why this essay is important.\nWhat gave rise to this essay?\nSwitzerland has been dealing with mobility-related issues for decades: the introduction of the Erasmus program, truck traffic crossing the Alps, limiting trucks to 40 tons, the AlpTransit initiative, the free movement of people, the modal shift from road to rail, and so on. All these issues have one thing in common: mobility. And yet, they are never analyzed together. On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people voted on two separate questions that, in reality, were both rooted in mobility. On that day, the people approved the “Stop mass immigration” initiative, which called for immigration quotas. They also gave the go-ahead for a fund to upgrade the country’s rail infrastructure. In a way, Swiss people paradoxically voted for “less mobility” and “more mobility” at the same time. Since then, there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric but very little sociological analysis of what really happened in that vote. Seeing this, Ander Audikana and I wanted to show how important it is to look at all these mobility issues together, in Switzerland but also in the EU, in order to get a better idea of what the consequences will be.\nWhat are your main conclusions?\nIn the first part of our essay, we look at the EU’s founding documents. It’s clear that the free movement of people – much more than economic interests – was at the core of the European project. These documents show that mobility was considered the only way of unifying the member states and erasing the differences in their political and welfare systems. The Erasmus program, for example, clearly states this goal in its founding texts. But there are two sides to mobility: movement and “moorings”. Moorings refer to the connections a person makes once they have moved to a new place: building meaningful social relationships, absorbing the culture, learning the language, making use of public spaces, coming to identify with the place and building an emotional bond with it etc. Unfortunately, EU policies largely overlook this, and instead demand that people move from place to place while failing to assess the consequences of widespread geographical mobility on regional development, the ability of diverse groups of people to live alongside each other, and wage dumping. These problems are left to the individual member countries, and we think this is a major shortcoming.\nHow does this shortcoming affect Switzerland?\nIn theory, an EU company could win a contract to plant trees in a small Swiss town, and no local landscaping companies would be able to compete on price. This is a good example of mobility without moorings: the cross-border deal is encouraged without first looking at whether this scenario is fair. While people consider these types of situations totally unfair, the EU has created a legal apparatus that is simply oblivious to this. It’s this type of mechanism that Europeans are now rallying against, as we see in the rise in populism. The mobility demanded by the EU creates as many problems as it solves.\nYou interviewed the leaders of the six main political parties in Switzerland about this issue. Yet they are cited anonymously in your essay. Why did you do this?\nWe wanted to get away from partisan politics and take an anthropological approach. Rereading these interviews, we saw that mobility-related questions did not fit neatly into the left-right paradigm. We see, for example, very liberal views on both sides: the idea that the world will be a better place the more people move around. At the same time, there’s a need for the state to be more assertive and get a better grip on the flow of money, people and goods. We think that where these two positions meet is where we can find compromises and solutions. In Switzerland, local identity is important and is currently seen as being under threat. The people want the government to do something about this.\nIs this what the EU could learn from the Swiss experience when it comes to rethinking mobility and the elimination of borders? \nSwitzerland is seeking a better balance between mobility and moorings. The fact that the EU is so dogmatic about being borderless is a problem for Switzerland, since this country doesn’t work that way. The Swiss don't subscribe to dogmas – they reach compromises through discussion and direct democracy. For EU countries, Switzerland is an interesting laboratory. Debates that do not happen elsewhere take place here. We feel that the way in which the Swiss achieve compromises on questions of mobility and the free movement of people could help the EU overcome some of the hurdles it faces. Our analysis shows, for example, that the EU should not have focused so much on a policy of \nmobility\n in its founding documents but rather on a policy of \naccessibility\n: access to services, to infrastructure and to other countries. The EU’s overriding goal should not be to make sure that people move from here to there at all costs. It should be to guarantee a certain level of fairness when people, goods, and services move across borders. Returning to the example of EU companies competing in Switzerland: in order to gain access to the Swiss market, these companies should apply Swiss prices.\nIn your essay, you foresee a return to medieval, walled-in cities in Europe. Is the situation that dire? \nThe current border situation will require a strong political response by the EU. Failing that, we believe there’s a good chance that walls, watchtowers and barbed wire could indeed pop up all over Europe, transforming the continent into a gated community.\nVincent Kaufmann, Ander Audikana, \nMobilité et Libre circulation en Europe: un regard suisse\n, Fondation Jean Monnet, Economica - Les Cahiers rouges, Paris, 2017.", "summary": "Vincent Kaufmann, an EPFL researcher, has co-authored an essay on Switzerland’s recent referendums on mobility and the free movement of people.

{"id": 94, "text": "Concrete has been around since the 19\nth\n century. Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

{"id": 96, "text": "Photovoltaics can be used directly in building and renovation projects and serve as a construction material in their own right. Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

{"id": 97, "text": "How can the challenges presented by the ever-growing number of wireless mobile devices and the demand for increasingly high data be met without increasing energy consumption and emission power? Currently MIMO (\nmultiple-input, multiple outputs\n) uses several antennas to transmit and receive signals. This technique is progressively being implemented in devices such as wireless modems and is to be used for the next generation of mobile phones. However, it poses problems because it is costly and difficult to integrate into hardware. \n At EPFL, Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s group has demonstrated that a single antenna can simultaneously transmit two separate signals that have the same throughput as a MIMO solution. The results were published at the beginning of the year, and part of the new findings will be presented by Julien Perruisseau-Carrier, at the IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation in Chicago, at the beginning of July.\t\n In a MIMO system, antennas generally have to be placed at a certain distance from each other, which makes inserting them into mobile and miniature devices a complicated process. An even greater problem with this technique is that each separate transmitting antenna must have its own encoding and amplifying signal device, which is costly and energy-consuming.\nOne antenna, two signals \nAs part of collaboration with researchers from Athens Information Technology (AIT), Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s team developed an antenna capable of emitting simultaneously two information flows, transmitting two independent signals with the same throughput, just as two antennas would do in a MIMO system. This technique called \"Beamspace MIMO\" allows to significantly reduce the number of physical antennas.\n Contrary to what one might think, an antenna does not emit signals in a homogeneous and circular manner. Instead, the repartition of the antenna's radiation is called \"radiation pattern.\" Scientists have managed to decompose this pattern in two, allowing simultaneous emission of two distinct information flows.\n Another advantage of this technique is that only one coding and amplifying device is required to treat the first information flow. The second signal is treated only upstream and then used to make the radiation pattern decomposable. The latter signal acts therefore both as an information carrier and as a mean to decompose the principal pattern. \"This technique allows us to get rid of part of the usual hardware,\" says Julien Perruisseau-Carrier. The process is however difficult and complex. \"One of the biggest challenges is to ensure that each pattern is really independent, to allow an efficient treatment of the information.”\nSuccess thanks to a global approach\t\n The results were obtained through a cross-disciplinary approach. \"This work required us to look at both antennas, particularly reconfigurable ones, and radio coding. Although they are closely linked, these two disciplines are unfortunately often considered separately, which hinders this kind of innovative work,\" explains the scientist.\nJulien Perruisseau-Carrier and his doctoral student Moshen Yousefbeiki are now focusing on a new antenna prototype that will be much more compact and adapted to small mobile devices, such as cell phones and miniature antennas that can be implanted for medical purposes.\nPublication:", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have developed a single antenna that is capable of transmitting the same data as a two-antenna system.

You’re lost for words when it dawns on you that your journey has taken you under the waters of Lake Geneva. Another elevator is waiting for you as you get off the train. It takes you back up to the surface into the familiar bustle of Lausanne’s train station.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Swissmetro\nElia Notari has just obtained his Master’s in civil engineering from EPFL.

Those with a sharp eye will no doubt notice some similarities with the Swissmetro project, an idea for a futuristic metro system developed at EPFL in the 1990s. Swissmetro was intended to link the main towns in Switzerland at a speed of 500 km/h. Notari’s Master’s project is in fact a variation of the Swissmetro design, which put the trains in underground tunnels rather than through Lake Geneva.\nBut is it really possible to build a metro through Lake Geneva? What some consider sacrilegious is a fascinating technical challenge for others – one that draws on multiple disciplines, covering everything from structural design and hydraulics to geotechnics and the environmental impact.\nA submerged bridge\nNotari focused on designing and calculating the dimensions of a double-track tunnel made out of reinforced concrete: an ‘underwater bridge’ – or to be more specific, a ‘floating underwater tunnel.’ Covering a distance of around 55 kilometers, the tracks would use magnetic levitation – or maglev – to get the train to travel at high speed. With this type of system, one set of magnets is placed on the tracks; a second set on the bottom of the train is repelled by the first, which pushes the train up off the track. In some cases, the repulsive force of the magnet is controlled by a current running along the track.\nFig.1: The double-track tunnel and its compartments containing ballast. © EPFL 2018 / E. Notari\nThis kind of system is not yet used in transportation, but several countries are now testing prototypes and plan to start building soon. In 2015, the Shinkansen Maglev prototype developed by Japanese company JR Central set the world record when it reached a speed of 603 km/h. For his work, Notari drew on policy guidelines developed in Germany, which are better suited to short distances, like that between Geneva and Lausanne.\nSeveral options to choose from\nThere are several options available to an engineer looking to build a train that can run under water. The tunnel can, for example, be set under the ground, as is the case with Eurostar, which was opened in 1994 across the Channel and connects London with several cities in mainland Europe.\nNorway is looking into another option to link its fjords with its cities – an underwater tunnel suspended at a series of floats that can be seen on the surface. Yet another solution involves putting metal rods in the ground to anchor down the tunnel. However, this will only work if the tunnel itself is buoyant enough.\nYet none of these options was quite right for Lake Geneva. This was mainly because its clear waters make it popular among sports enthusiasts and esthetes, which meant the student had to design a tunnel that was at least 20 meters deep and not visible from the surface.\n30 meters underwater\nNotari therefore went with a bridge located 30 meters below the surface and supported by piers made of reinforced concrete. This solution was the most rigid, which is a crucial factor for a high-speed train. It was also the most secure in the event of internal flooding. Other advantages also guided his choice. With this solution, the temperature would be constant throughout the entire structure, which would prevent any thermal deformation as a result of the changing seasons. Waves are also at their weakest at that kind of depth, and the bridge would not get in the way of any existing structures.\nWhat’s more, the hydrostatic pressure would be a bonus in terms of the solidity of the 199 modules making up the concrete tunnels. The engineer’s tunnel measures 14.5 meters in diameter and is designed to withstand earthquakes, internal and external explosions, flooding, tsunamis and landslides. The structure would include compartments containing ballast to make it possible to stabilize the tunnel at any time based on Archimedes’ principle. To adjust to the lake’s varying depth, the height of the pillars, which are 6 meters in diameter, would range from 7.5 to 45 meters. The bridge’s route would follow the lakeshore (see Fig.2. on the left). And the two ends of the line would be connected to the Geneva and Lausanne train stations via elevators.\nToo technically feasible to be utopian\nThe idea of an underwater bridge in Lake Geneva doesn’t seem so utopian to the freshly graduated engineer. “The concept of an underwater bridge has been around for a century,” says Notari. “Our know-how has advanced significantly thanks to projects like oil platforms and offshore wind farms. What’s missing is a pioneering investor who’s ready to put up the money to fund the construction of a prototype.”\nFor Aurelio Muttoni, high-speed transportation projects have great potential: “The solution that Elia studied is technically realistic. I myself came up with a similar solution in the 1990s when studying the feasibility of crossing Lake Lugano as part of the southern extension of the Gotthard high-speed train line.” Muttoni adds that he was inspired by Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s ultra-fast train, when suggesting the topic to his student. (See the .)\nBut given the complexity of the situation, the environmental challenges and the high costs of this kind of project, Muttoni is convinced that it will be many years before Lake Geneva gets an underwater tunnel.", "summary": "Summer series.

{"id": 103, "text": "They are a group of 30-odd architecture students from EPFL, ETH Zurich, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW, Basel) and Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany), and they are preparing to don hardhats and work boots. Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.\nThis Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”\nThe structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.\nBetween tradition and modernity\nYannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction. So while the base of the pavilion can be constructed with conventional rammed earth – erected and dried on the building’s foundations – the upper floor of the pavilion will be composed by earthen blocks that will be used as prefabricated components. This approach will help cut down the building time. The earth needed for the columns of the mock-up will be taken from local construction sites and tested by experts.\nThe two students continue to marvel at the wonders of rammed earth: “We think that the sensible thing to do is to use materials available to us, and that includes earth – which is 100% recyclable,” says Claessens. “In our project, the earth walls – and not the concrete – are load-bearing. We are turning normal building codes on their head.” Pretolani is equally enthusiastic: “We felt we had a free hand in terms of project design because there is so much potential in rammed earth, which is not a contemporary material in terms of its aesthetics and does not have well-developed building standards.”\nPilot project\nThe mock-up could also serve as a pilot project for a new technique – prestressed rammed earth – in which steel cables, linked together to meet seismic standards, will run through the building’s earthen columns from top to bottom. For that reason, the engineers backstopping the students will monitor the project once it’s completed, making up for the lack of building standards.\nMany architects steer clear of earth as a building material, since they feel it slows the speed of construction and leads to higher costs. The St. Gallen pavilion could upend such conventional thinking, according to Boltshauser, since it will only take a month to build: “By combining prefabricated earth blocks with other prefabricated concrete components, the pavilion is a glimpse at what could be the future of rammed-earth construction. It will also allow us to calculate the associated savings in terms of costs and gray energy.”\nTextiles and rammed earth go way back \nThe Sittertal valley was a manufacturing region, specializing in dyeing textiles, until the 19th century. The buildings, located between the Sitter river and a canal, have been maintained and renovated and are now dedicated to the visual arts and artisanal crafts. They play host to artist residences, a library, material archives and exhibitions. “Expertise in earth building spread from France to Switzerland through the linen trade, starting in the 17th century. Using the rammed-earth technique for a building on a site that was once devoted to textiles is our way of acknowledging that history,” adds Boltshauser.\nOne week after the construction work begins, an exhibition describing the history of this building technique, called “Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” will open. This exhibition was first shown at EPFL’s Archizoom space in the spring of 2017. In St. Gallen, it will be set up in the Sitterwerk library, just opposite the students’ pavilion project.\n“Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” Sittertal, from 21 August to 15 October 2017.

{"id": 104, "text": "A flock of birds suddenly taking off and flying in formation, acting like one entity, is a stunning and complex communication effort. But can flying robots imitate birds when flying in a flocking formation? Today, a demonstration of EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems technology will be presented at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2011) by Sabine Hauert. She shows how up to ten fixed-wing robots can fly in flock-like formation patterns by communicating with their neighbors.\n Hauert, who achieved this result within her PhD studies in Professor Dario Floreano’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, adapted an algorithm developed in 1986 by Craig Reynolds that simulates individual birds communicating with their flying neighbors in order to stay in a close formation. The robots, developed by EPFL spin-off senseFly, communicate by creating a one-to-one wireless network in the sky—each one can then tell the distance and direction of its closest neighbors, keeping the flock together without regard for all of the robots as a group.\n “Flocking requires three things. You need to move with the same speed and direction as your neighbors, you need to avoid hitting them and you need to stay close,” Hauert, now a post-doctoral student at MIT recently told Wired.com.\n Computer simulations at Floreano’s laboratory show that it is possible to flock up to 100 Micro-Air Vehicles or MAVs with this novel control algorithm. For the moment, Hauert’s achievement of 10 flocking MAVs in Lausanne’s blue sky, the largest grouping so far, once again shows the potential of taking principles from Nature to develop collaboration between “intelligent” robots.", "summary": "Up to ten autonomous flying robots flock like birds in a real-sky experiment.", "claim": "Up to three autonomous flying robots flock like birds in a real-sky experiment.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 2], "noise": false}

Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples. Her results showed that people are exposed to a number of pesticides, and that this is not due solely to their work. The farmers are affected the most, but the village's inhabitants were also exposed to pesticides through other vectors, like food and water.", "summary": "Summer series on student projects – For her Master’s project in environmental sciences, Christelle Oltramare collected 110 hair samples in Burkina Faso and came up with a process for identifying several types of pesticides.", "claim": "Summer series on student projects – For her Master’s project in environmental sciences, Christelle Oltramare collected no more than 100 square meters hair samples in Burkina Faso and came up with a process for identifying several types of pesticides.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [18, 23], "noise": false}

This year’s contest is more specifically called HydroContest-X, because it is being organized jointly by three universities in French-speaking Switzerland: EPFL, the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture (HEIA-FR) and the Vaud School of Management and Engineering (HEIG-VD). The contest, which is supported every year by the Hydros Foundation, challenges students to design, build and race the most energy-efficient boats possible. The event is free of charge and open to the public.\nEach team designs and builds miniature, remote-controlled boats to compete in two contest categories. The two categories are complementary, like Laurel and Hardy – one for thin and light boats, where the aim is to sail fast and far; the other for bigger and heavier ones, which must haul 200 kg of cargo to simulate a freight vessel. Boats in both categories run on batteries provided by the organizer. The event aims to not only enhance students’ education, but also build awareness about the need for cleaner, more energy-efficient shipping vessels and spark ideas for technology in this area.\nAn asymmetric boat\nEPFL students have participated in the contest every year since it was launched. And this year’s team will show up in Yverdon-les-Bains with not two, but three boats. Two of them are from last year’s HydroContest. The first one, which competed in the Mass Transport category, is a hybrid between a catamaran and an airboat that sails on a thin cushion of air. It won the innovation prize last year but was eliminated during the quarterfinals. The second boat, which competed in the Private Boats category, is a twin-foil vessel designed in 2016. This boat proved to be fast but fairly unstable; it came in second place last year behind HEIA-FR.\nThe third boat – new this year – is designed after a prao, a traditional Indonesian sailboat. It has only one hull and one lateral float, making it asymmetric. “We designed it over the past year, it works, and we’ve tested it several times, yet it still needs to be tweaked,” says Sébastien Jaffaux, head of EPFL’s HydroContest team. “So at this point it’s too early to enter it in the race. But if we get the new foils in time, we’ll run demos on the lake.”\nBut the students have big plans for next year, when, as part of the Swiss Solar Boat project, they will use their prototypes as test platforms for the 2020 Monaco Solar & Energy Boat Challenge.

{"id": 110, "text": "At  – educational facilities designed to promote cross-disciplinary research – a groundbreaking new device is in the works. Eight Master’s students in microengineering, bioengineering and life sciences () developed a portable biosensor for the  competition, which was held at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands on 7–8 September 2018. Their device can provide precise measurements of the amount of vancomycin, an antibiotic used as a last-resort treatment, in a patient’s blood plasma. This information will help doctors deliver exactly the amount of drug needed and therefore reduce the occurrence of harmful side effects. For instance, vancomycin is known to cause damage to the kidneys and to hearing.\n“We started working on the biosensor last fall alongside our coursework, and this summer have been working on it full-time. Being able to use the DLL has made our research a lot easier, since they have all the equipment we need,” says Alix Faillétaz, a Master’s student in bioengineering. This is the second year in a row that EPFL is participating in SensUs, where its team will be up against students from 12 other universities from around the world. “The competition was launched three years ago. It’s really demanding and is a huge challenge for the students. They must overcome a series of problems and learn to work together, trust each other and delegate tasks based on each individual’s specific skills,” says Professor Philippe Renaud, who is coaching the team.\nPolarization-based measurements\nSensUs aims to encourage the development of biosensors, targeting a different application each year – although the objective always relates to measuring a biomarker with an impact on public health. The objective is chosen by a panel of experts that includes Professor Renaud. Existing tests to measure vancomycin require a great deal of time, a considerable amount of blood and a special machine that costs tens of thousands of Swiss francs. But the EPFL team’s portable biosensor can take measurements in less than five minutes with just a few drops of blood, and costs under 5,000 francs. Their device shines polarized light on a sample containing a homogeneous mixture of the patient’s blood plasma and a synthetized peptide (an amino-acid sequence) solution.\nHow does it work? “We first created a peptide that bonds specifically to vancomycin, and then we added a fluorescent compound,” says Faillétaz. “As the vancomycin bonds to the fluorescent peptide, the peptide’s movement slows and the light it emits becomes more and more polarized. By measuring the degree of light polarization, we can calculate the vancomycin concentration in a patient’s blood.” According to Professor Renaud, this method already exists but has never been used to make a portable biosensor.\nAt the competition, the EPFL team will have to not only prove their biosensor’s efficacy by analyzing various samples, but also demonstrate its benefits for the healthcare industry and its market potential. “By changing the synthesis compound, our biosensor could be used to detect other antibiotics and biomarkers,” says David Vilela, a Master’s student in life sciences.\nEPFL on the first step of the podium\n The SenSwiss team won the most awards in the SensUs international competition. They won the technical award, and placed second for the awards related to creativity and entrepreneurship. Their biosensor has proven to be the most effective in accurately measuring the amount of vancomycin in blood plasma samples. This can be done in less than five minutes, with only a few drops of blood and innovative technology. The team also demonstrated the commercialization potential of his invention, its usefulness to medical personnel and the possibility of adapting the test to other antibiotics.\nThe SenSwiss team: \nMatthieu Pinto (microengineering student) optical detection part, Victor Steininger (bioengineering student) electrical and mechanical parts, Mathieu Jeckelmann (bioengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Jacopo Oswald (microengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Paul Philipp (life sciences student) biological part, Aly Makhlouf (bioengineering student) biological part, David Vilela (life sciences student) biological part, Alix Faillétaz (bioengineering student) electrical part.", "summary": "A team of eight EPFL students won the technical prize in the SensUs international competition, designing a portable biosensor that can measure the amount of vancomycin in a patient’s blood stream, enabling doctors to better control the dosage and reduce harmful side effects.

The objective of this grant program is to ensure that there is a new supply of graduate scientists, to encourage mobility, and to support women’s careers. “The number of grants is limited, while the number of doctoral students with the required level to aspire to these grants has largely increased”, observes Caroline Vandevyver, responsible for the preparation of the application forms. “This is the result of the strict selection of doctoral students performed by the Doctoral School. Only 15% of them applied in 2005, compared to 27% in 2010.” In a market which is becoming more and more competitive, doctoral students are increasingly aware of the value of doing research abroad. While not all of them become professors, many find interesting opportunities in universities, as well as in industry.\n An FNS grant constitutes a first-rate opportunity, since it enables the doctoral student who has completed his/her thesis to continue his/her education in the university and the topic of his/her choice. The grant is awarded for a period of 18 months, and includes an allowance for personal expenses, an amount for travel expenses, and possibly also a contribution towards research and symposium costs. The amount granted depends on marital status, family-related responsibilities, and the cost of living in the country of residence. They are awarded independently of nationality, sex or family situation. Only the applicants’ competencies are taken into account. The researchers are thus able to devote their entire attention to their research work. The only condition for applying is to have obtained a doctoral degree at EPFL. “All those who received one of these grants said that it had been a springboard for their professional career”, adds Caroline Vandevyver.\n EPFL and its teachers strongly encourage these research periods abroad. They constitute an almost inevitable step in a scientific career, are practically essential in becoming a professor, and a major asset in being selected for important positions. The likelihood of becoming a professor is greater for someone who has benefited from a grant. In a recent study, the EPFL Research Commission has observed that 17% of post-doctoral scholarship students began an academic career, but that only 23% of them came back to Switzerland to pursue it. We might therefore wonder: what is the benefit for a university such as EPFL to see its best people leave? This question of brain drain versus brain gain has been assessed in depth both at EPFL and the FNS, and the two institutions have reached the conclusion that the benefits of this type of sponsorship is extremely positive, and contributes to increasing the visibility of Switzerland internationally. FNS scholarship students are ambassadors for EPFL worldwide: they increase the institutions renown, and stimulate other researchers to come to study or work in Switzerland.

Under the supervision of professors Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran, Vincent Etter and Julien Herzen, PhD students in the Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory, explored these data to reveal a number of interesting facts. They are currently continuing their research by creating a platform, Predikon.ch, that will be able to predict the results of a federal vote based on initial results coming in from municipalities and past data.\nYes, the “Röstigraben” exists! “And it was a bit of a surprise,” admits Etter. They performed a dimensionality reduction on the municipal results for all votes since 1981. This is a standard tool used by statisticians who specialize in data analysis to produce a graphical representation of data. Two groups emerged: one French-speaking and one of German-speaking. (You can see it at ). “The municipalities closest to the intersection of the groups on the graph are also those that are geographically closest to the linguistic border,” notes Herzen.\nWhile the linguistic divide is easy to see on this representation, it’s a bit more difficult to make sense of the graph’s axes, obtained by the dimensionality reduction. “It’s not the traditional left-right and conservative-liberal divisions,” explains Etter. Over time, the Italian-speaking regions seem to move away from the French-speaking districts to join their German-speaking compatriots. In a future version of their interactive graphic, the scientists plan to add a temporal cursor that will highlight this.\nRight and Left are alive and well \nAlthough the Röstigraben can’t be explained by either the left-right or conservative-liberal divide, these classical political categories are alive and well when it comes to politicians, as the duo found when they applied the same data visualization tools to information from the 2011 Federal elections obtained from the voter recommendation website smartvote.ch.\nWith the same data analysis approach, the researchers explored whether the political parties were really all that different from one another. They showed that the positions of 25.8% of the socialist candidates were closer to the median of the green party positions than to their own party’s position. Inversely, the proportion was 18.8%. But the overlap was greatest in the PBD, with more than half of its politicians closer to the median of another party (most often the PDC, 33.1%) than aligned with their own.\nEtter and Herzen also showed that it would be easy for a candidate who filled in his or her own smartvote profile to choose responses that would optimize the number of times they would be recommended to voters that trusted the site. However, this was evidently not exploited in 2011, since the difference between the voting records of parliamentary politicians and their smartvote profile was very small.\nEbikon, a small town that has it right\nThe next step for the two computer scientists is to predict the result of an vote by combining the initial votes coming in from a small number of municipalities with the database of past results. The platform they are developing with Victor Kristof, a student in Communication systems, is called Predikon.ch, a combination of the words “Prediction” and “Ebikon.” This small town near Lucerne (population 12,000) appeared in their preparatory studies to be the one whose results most reliably predicted the federal result. “By doing the exercise with past votes, in 96% of the cases, the result in Ebikon gave us the correct result at the federal level,” explains Herzen.\nThe project’s development is hampered by the fact that each of Switzerland’s 26 cantons has a different system for presenting its data, and that often these platforms are only online for a few hours the day the vote is held, while ballots are still being counted; but nonetheless there’s a good chance that the Predikon index will soon be mentioned in the news updates on these Sundays.\nThe Predikon project, along with all of Etter and Herzen’s research, will be presented at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences Open House, Saturday November 22 at 3:30 pm in room BC420, during a seminar entitled “La démocratie suisse vue par les données.” Throughout the Open House, a Predikon demo will be held on the fourth floor of the BC building.

{"id": 135, "text": "The “Métropole Lémanique” is experiencing a unique surge in the field of neuroscience. This area has large international teams of researchers, dedicated to the economic and industrial development of the region. How best to take advantage of this unique opportunity and offer researchers a place to work, while increasing the visibility of this promising scientific momentum? It is in response to these global issues that NEUROPOLIS was conceived. The project meets a major challenge of the 21st century: understanding the human brain while creating a unique space in which researchers can interact with the public.\nOne Project, Two Sites\n To achieve this, the NEUROPOLIS project will construct two entities:\n —A research infrastructure in Lausanne constructed on the grounds of the institutions of higher learning, UNIL-EPFL. This spot will also have a public space dedicated to the brain;\n —A Geneva-located infrastructure near the University Hospital will house a new Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging. \n The construction of these two sites is estimated to cost 110 million Swiss Francs. They would be able to accommodate as many as 1,000 scientific and technological collaborators.\nPublic-Private Partnership (Canton of Vaud :: Swiss Confederation :: Rolex)\n The realization of this ambition wouldn’t have seen the light of day without the outstanding contribution of several actors from both the public and private sectors. The Canton of Vaud provided an essential piece in the foundation of this project through a financial contribution of 35 million Swiss Francs for the construction of the building in Lausanne – and if necessary, offering a site on the university campus. Neuropolis will be launched thanks to the renewed support of the Rolex Group. The brand seeks to encourage research and a pioneering spirit in a leading sector that concerns all of humanity. “A strong historical connection exists between Rolex and EPFL, with the Rolex Learning Center as one of the most iconic examples of that relationship. With NEUROPOLIS, Rolex reiterates its strong sense of social responsibility on the local and global levels, and is pleased to assist in a world-class project that represents a fundamental advance in the field of neuroscience. The participation of Rolex in such a visionary project, such a decisive human and scientific adventure, echoes the brand’s perpetual quest for innovation and excellence,” said Bertrand Gros, President of Rolex, SA.\n The Swiss Confederation and EPFL, through both their usual building program and a private funding campaign, will be responsible for the remainder of the investment.\nLausanne – The Nerve Center of the Blue Brain (EPFL) and the Human Brain Project (EU)\n NEUROPOLIS hosts the simulation platform of the Blue Brain Project and will manage the supercomputer’s resources remotely. The platform will host the huge databases necessary for neuroscience and other fields, as well as the simulation cockpit coordinated by teams of computer scientists and neuroscientists. Scientists worldwide will be able to use the computing power and software developed there; laboratories and workspaces for top international visitors will be installed. If selected by the European Union, the center will also host the “flagship” Human Brain Project (EU), a project that now has about 120 teams in 90 scientific institutions from 22 countries, including those in the partner hospital CHUV in Lausanne. The application has been submitted for a decision expected in early 2013.\nLausanne – A Bridge Between Science and the Public\n NEUROPOLIS is also for the general public. For the first time in Europe, an open and interactive space will be dedicated to neuroscience and the conquest of the brain. The Center for Scientific Simulation will provide the entertainment and the multiple mechanisms of thought will be illuminated there for everyone to enjoy and discover.\nLausanne – A New Research Platform with UNIL\n UNIL has begun refocusing its campus toward skills of basic neuroscience and is already home to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). NEUROPOLIS will help accelerate the development strategy of simulation-based science, such as evolutionary biology and oncology, and continue the trajectory of Computational Science (involving significant resources for integrating large amounts of data) in other fields which require the prediction and analysis of interactions between many sub-systems: environmental and earth sciences (continental drift or natural disasters), economics, as well as finance and the human and social sciences.\nGeneva – A New Institute of Molecular Imaging (UNIGE)\n Taking advantage of the expertise developed in the Geneva area and of existing infrastructure in the field of Neuroscience, The University of Geneva and the Canton Hospital, in collaboration with EPFL, will construct an Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging in Geneva. These activities, involving several parallel imaging techniques and built-in analysis, will focus on neuro-imaging, chronic diseases, neurological degeneration, and aging. The new institute is part of Geneva’s development plan of Translational Molecular Imaging, which will be articulated around four axes: animal imaging, nanotechnology, radiation chemistry, and modeling. Research conducted in conjunction with existing clinical programs will consider medical applications in the treatment of cancer as well as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. These projects will extend the cognitive and behavioral research aspects of Geneva’s “Nouvelle Jonction. Art, Neurosciences, Cité” project.\nComing Deadlines\n This project will establish an institute of international stature. Like CERN in the field of physics, NEUROPOLIS unites neuroscientists and biologists from around the world. This fall an international architecture competition will be launched.

{"id": 140, "text": "In 2017, startups around the world raised some 4.6 billion dollars by issuing virtual tokens that can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies or services. And much of this activity is taking place in Switzerland, where ICOs brought in 850 million dollars last year according to figures published by IFZ (Institut für Finanzdienstleistungen). But so far, few manufacturers have gotten in on the act.\nLakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that develops customized, highly pure diamonds, is an exception. It is set to launch its own ICO, selling machine-hours in the form of virtual tokens. Over two million tokens – worth a total of 60 million francs – will be issued. The company plans to use this money to significantly ramp up its production capacity. Once the ICO has been completed, buyers will be able to sell their tokens or exchange them for diamonds, thereby creating the first-ever crowd-funded diamond “mine.”\nThe smaller the more expensive\n“With natural diamonds, prices go up as the stones get bigger. But with us it’s the opposite,” says Pascal Gallo, the startup’s founder and CEO. The diamonds produced by LakeDiamond are much purer than natural diamonds. The company’s manufacturing process, in which layers of carbon atoms – the sole ingredient of diamonds – are built up through vapor deposition, eliminates nearly all impurities. These industrial diamonds allow for much greater precision thanks to their hardness, thermal and electrical conductivity, and optical properties.\nThe carefully calibrated size of the diamonds – down to the micron – and the high tech processing they undergo are what set these diamonds apart. The method used to customize the diamonds was developed in conjunction with Niels Quack’s lab at EPFL. The carefully sized diamonds can be set in complex mechanical systems such as watch movements and used in high powered lasers, transistors and photonic platforms.\nThe vast majority of companies that have launched ICOs also use blockchain technology. Their main motivation is simplicity: the companies can deal directly with their investors, and this reduces paperwork and saves time. For LakeDiamond, there’s also the question of independence. “We tried traditional fundraising methods, but most potential investors were in the military sector,” says Gallo. “And we don’t want to take the company in that direction.”\nA smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain\nThe “user,” in the company’s parlance, buys a certain number of tokens secured by an Ethereum smart contract. Ethereum is one of several types of blockchain, which are used to record and share information without any external oversight. Blockchains are so safe because all transactions are verifiable and transparent. A white paper describes the project in detail and includes the transaction clauses and the code used to create the tokens (“ether”) that are issued against the cryptocurrency.\n“Our project is unique: we connect diamond growth reactors to the Ethereum blockchain, which lets token holders produce their own diamonds,” says Romain Braud, the company’s blockchain specialist. LakeDiamond’s tokens are referred to as Time-based Machine Tokens (TMT) because they represent hours of use of the reactors. They also give holders a preferential right to “mine” the diamonds ordered by the company’s industrial clients. This means that token holders can support a client project by trading in their tokens for that project – and ultimately benefiting from the value of the client’s order. Tokens can also be sold on secondary markets, just like traditional cryptocurrencies.\nThe first phase of LakeDiamond’s ICO is meant for professional investors (“token users”). The ICO will be opened to the public this fall once the company has obtained authorization from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).", "summary": "LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that produces and customizes ultra-pure diamonds for industrial use, is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) today.

{"id": 146, "text": "Hepatoblastoma is a rare pediatric liver cancer, usually diagnosed in the first three years of life. Histological methods are used to distinguish between the different subtypes of hepatoblastoma. EPFL scientists have now found metabolic differences between hepatoblastoma subtypes, and identified several biomarkers that can help obtain more accurate subtyping of the disease. The work is .\nThere are many subtypes of hepatoblastoma, the two major ones being fetal and embryonal. Clinically, pure fetal cases have the best prognosis. The way oncologists distinguish between the different subtypes is by staining biopsies and observing the tumor architecture. However, this is not satisfactory.\n“When we compare tumors on the microscope, we know almost nothing about their differences,” says Etienne Meylan, whose led this study. “It’s a little like comparing cars: only when we look inside at the engine we begin to understand what makes them so fundamentally different to each other. Our study shows that different types of hepatoblastoma use different nutrients, or fuels, to grow. Some use glucose, others might rely on fatty acids. In the era of personalized medicine this is important, as we want to be sure we block the right fuel for the right tumor.”\nMeylan’s lab built on the genetics of hepatoblastoma, which involves frequent mutations in the gene CTNNB1. This gene produces the protein beta-catenin, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription. Because of its dual function, mutations of the CTNNB1 gene can have diverse and far-reaching consequences, including in cancers like hepatoblastoma. Beta-catenin is a component of a signaling pathway called Wnt/beta-catenin, which is responsible for regulating the expression of multiple genes. What is of interest is that many components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are affected and overactive in various tumors.\nSomething that is becoming increasingly significant in oncology is that different types of cancers show characteristic metabolic profiles, e.g. in the way they produce, store, and use glucose, glutamine, fatty acids etc. Based on this, the EPFL researchers looked at the relationship of the CTNNB1 gene and the cell’s metabolism.\nThe researchers first showed that beta-catenin, as part of the Wnt signaling pathway directly regulates the expression of a gene that produces a glucose transporter protein (GLUT3).\nNext, they used RNA sequencing to identify molecular and metabolic features that are specific to hepatoblastoma. This approach revealed that several enzymes involved in the metabolism of glucose are overexpressed in embryonal hepatoblastoma cells as compared to fetal hepatoblastoma cells. \nFinally, the scientists found that embryonal hepatoblastoma cells show high levels of glucose uptake. In addition, they also found that these cells are very sensitive to the perturbation of an enzyme involved in the cell’s use of glucose, which might hint to a metabolically driven therapy in the future.\nWorking off their discoveries, the researchers used immunohistochemistry of three metabolic biomarkers to better distinguish embryonal from fetal components out of a large panel of human hepatoblastoma biopsies, collected from French and Swiss university hospitals.\nThe study shows that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is crucial for reprograming the energy management of tumor cells. It also provides a new, metabolic classification of human hepatoblastoma that can help oncologists develop novel diagnostic methods and even treatments.\n\"This paper is a milestone of upmost importance for our children with hepatoblastoma,” says , Surgical Director of the Swiss Reference Centre for Liver Diseases in Children (Hospital University of Geneva), who was not involved in the study. “As a further step towards personalized medicine, these discovered biomarkers allow for individual characterization of the children' liver tumor, helping us in risk stratification, and eventually allowing for an adjusted, personalized treatment.”\nContributors \nSIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics\nGeneva University Hospitals\nFaculté de Médecine Université Paris Sud\nLudwig Center for Cancer Research and Department of Oncology\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nFondation Recherche sur le Cancer de l’Enfant ()\nReference \nStefania Crippa, Pierre-Benoit Ancey, Jessica Vazquez, Paolo Angelino, Anne-Laure Rougemont, Catherine Guettier, Vincent Zoete, Mauro Delorenzi, Olivier Michielin, Etienne Meylan. \nMutant CTNNB1 and histological heterogeneity define metabolic subtypes of hepatoblastoma. \nEMBO Molecular Medicine \n18 September 2017.

{"id": 147, "text": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a major player in nutrition today. Studies have shown that NAD+ concentrations decrease during aging and that recovering the body’s levels of NAD+ can prolong both health span and even life span, making it the focus of much research in nutritional science, medicine, and even pharmaceutics.\nIn terms of biology, NAD+ is what is known as a “co-enzyme” – a necessary molecule that helps an enzyme carry out its respective reaction in the cell. NAD+ is a common co-enzyme for multiple metabolic enzymes across all living cells, meaning that it is heavily involved in producing energy and keeping cells alive and healthy.\nPublishing in \nNature\n, scientists lead by  in collaboration with TES Pharma have found a new way of increasing NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme competing with its production.\nThe \nde novo\n synthesis of NAD+ in the cell begins with the amino acid tryptophan. One of the key enzymes involved in this process is ACMSD, which limits the amount of NAD+ produced by the \nde novo\n synthesis pathway.\nThe scientists were able to show that ACMSD controls the levels of NAD+ in the cell through a mechanism that doesn’t seem to have changed during evolution: case-in-point, the researchers found that, in both the earthworm \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n and mice, blocking the enzyme resulted in higher NAD+ levels and enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe inactivation of ACMSD also increased the activity of Sirtuin 1, an enzyme that NAD+ works with in its role as co-enzyme. Sirtuin 1 is known to play major roles in mitochondrial well-being, and as a result, the boost of NAD+ levels ultimately enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe team then used two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD, developed by . “Since the enzyme is mostly found in the kidney and liver, we wanted to test the capacity of the ACMSD inhibitors to protect these organs from injury,” explains Elena Katsyuba, first author of the paper.\nBoth inhibitors were shown to preserve kidney and liver function in animal models of acute kidney injury and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, offering much promise for their future therapeutic potential in humans. “The fact that ACMSD is exclusively present only in the liver and kidneys reduces the risk of negative repercussions of its loss on other organs,” says Katsyuba. “Put simply, the enzyme will not be missed by an organ that does not have it anyway.”\n“Given the beneficial health effects of boosting NAD+ levels that we have seen in worm and mouse models of disease, we are looking forward to bringing these compounds soon to the clinic to the benefit of patients suffering from liver and kidney diseases, two areas with a large unmet clinical need,” says Johan Auwerx.\nOther contributors\nTES Pharma\nUniversity of Lausanne\nPolytechnic University of Marche\nEPFL Histology Core Facility\nUniversity Hospital of Geneva\nPolish Academy of Sciences", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have found a new way to boost the famous anti-aging molecule NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme that limits its production.

People need to know the basics if they want to ride that wave confidently and have trust in it,” says Martin Vetterli, President of the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). Vetterli intends to help anchor that trust, which is essential for an open, democratic society, economic prosperity, and personal freedom, and to that end has announced a new \nCenter for Digital Trust\n based at EPFL. The statement was made during the 2017 Cybersecurity day (), held at EPFL in the presence of Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin.\nIndividual citizens and major multinationals alike must adapt to the changes being imposed by digitalization – whether that involves learning how to use new software or adapting to new working methods. Such technological progress is paving the way to Industry 4.0, a new paradigm where companies must rethink their entire business models. These challenges are at the top of the agenda for business leaders and policymakers alike; Switzerland alone counts over 80 recent parliamentary actions on the issue.\nSwitzerland is in key position to catch the opportunities\n The digital revolution is nothing less than a goldmine of opportunity for Switzerland. The country’s long tradition of neutrality, together with its world-caliber expertise recognized by research institutions across the globe, make it ideally placed to lay the groundwork for the new concept of digital trust. “Digital trust will be at the core of our strategy,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, the Center’s academic director. “We want to become a center of excellence in the field, where all of our partners – regardless of how they are using digital services – can find answers to their questions and support for their goals.”\nThe Center will address the three critical challenges of this digital era: cybersecurity, which involves making sure that data transferred across networks cannot be hacked; transparency, which means making it clear how data is processed, sent and stored; and personal data protection, so that sensitive information, such as bank account details and medical records, stays out of malevolent hands. Engineers at the Center will work in parallel to develop new systems and methods in all three areas.\nHigh-level partners in close relationship to the citizens and the industry\n The Center will combine EPFL’s renowned expertise in cybersecurity, sensitive data protection and blockchain and smart-contracting technology with the advanced capabilities of institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), as well as companies including ELCA, SICPA, Swisscom, Swissquote, SGS and SwissRe, who have already stated their strong interest in joining the Center.\nThese partner organizations are in direct contact with individuals and businesses, and will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution. The organizations will also contribute their own experts to the research being done at EPFL in order to develop solutions to concrete problems, and will help to fund the Center.\nTwo new EPFL chairs and 24 labs involved\n EPFL has created two new teaching and research chairs in digital trust, and the search for candidates is already under way. The School also has 24 research labs in this field, mostly within the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, the School of Life Sciences and the College of Management of Technology. “It’s a genuine ecosystem that addresses the needs of the entire population. The challenges are so great that there’s no way we could overcome them without a cross-disciplinary approach,” says Hubaux. The first step will be to develop trust technologies and systems that can form a bedrock of trust between users and service providers – thereby encouraging the adoption and effective use of new technology.\nDesigned with ambitious goals in mind, the Center got an additional boost from the Swiss Federal Parliament’s decision to cap budget cuts in the areas of education, research and innovation.

A team of researchers at the Defitech Foundation Chair in Brain-Machine Interface (CNBI), headed by José del R. Millán, has however been working on a revolutionary brain-machine approach in order to restore a sense of independence to the disabled. The idea is to remotely control a robot from home with one's thoughts. The research, involving numerous subjects located in different countries, produced excellent results in both human and technical terms. The conclusions are discussed in the June special edition of Proceedings of the IEEE, dedicated to brain-machine interfaces.\n19 people tested, 100% success rate\n Nine disabled people and ten healthy people in Italy, Germany and Switzerland took part in the task of piloting a robot with their thoughts. For several weeks, each of the subjects put on an electrode-studded hat capable of analysing their brain signals. They then instructed the robot to move, transmitting their instructions in real time via internet from their home country. By virtue of its video camera, screen and wheels, the robot, located in an EPFL laboratory, was able to film itself as it moved while displaying the face of the remote pilot via Skype. The person at the controls, as if moving in place of the robot, was able to interact with whoever the robot crossed paths with. “Each of the 9 subjects with disabilities managed to remotely control the robot with ease after less than 10 days of training,” said Professor Millán.\nShared control between human and machine\n The brain-machine interface developed by the researchers goes even further. The robot is able to avoid obstacles by itself, even when it is not told to. To avoid getting overly tired, the pilot can also take a break from giving indications. If it doesn’t receive more indications, the robot will continue on the indicated path until it receives the order to stop. In this way, control over the robot is shared between the human and the computer, allowing the pilot to rest while navigating.\nNo difference between healthy and disabled subjects\n In the end, the tests revealed no difference in piloting ability between healthy and disabled subjects. In the second part of the tests, the disabled people with residual mobility were asked to pilot the robot with the movements they were still capable of doing, for example by simply pressing the side of their head on buttons placed nearby. They piloted the robot just as if they were uniquely using their thoughts, further proof of the effectiveness of the system.\nMature technology available \n The positive results of this research bring to a close the European project called TOBI (Tools for Brain-Computer Interaction), which began in 2008.

{"id": 157, "text": "Manufacturing consumer goods requires vast quantities of water, heat and electricity. The firms that make these items produce large amounts of CO\n2\n emissions and have a huge impact on the environment. At the COP21 climate conference in Paris, world leaders highlighted the prominent role that manufacturers could play in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nMaziar Kermani, a researcher at EPFL’s  group, which is headed by Professor François Maréchal, has come up with a pioneering mathematical model that could cut the amount of water and energy used in industrial processes. He has developed a way to recycle lost heat and energy and to employ biorefinery technologies – combining turbines and organic fluids – to boost power production.\nKermani applied his model to a Canadian paper mill. He found that, in theory, it could cut the amount of water the firm used from 820 kg to 230-300 kg per second (a drop of around 60%). It could also allow the mill to produce more than six times as much electricity (from 3 MW to around 20 MW). His findings have been published in \nEnergies\n.\nContinuous recycling of water and heat\nKermani tested out his theory on kraft pulping – by far the most popular paper-making method in the industry.\nWood chips are wetted, cooked (in digesters), washed, dried and bleached to make pulp. All of this produces vast amounts of steam which, in addition to being used in the process itself, generates more than enough electricity to power the plant. The surplus energy can then be sold.\nAccording to Kermani, however, the current system is far from optimal. “Huge amounts of water and energy go to waste because the stages of the process aren’t connected,” he explains. “For instance, the mill uses cold water to wash and cool the pulp. But that water, which contains valuable heat, is then discarded. Likewise, high-pressure steam is produced by burning black liquor at extremely high temperatures – around 1,200°C. The steam powers turbines to generate electricity and provides a heat source for other processes, but it’s too energy intensive to produce.”\nOrganic fluids\n In his paper, Kermani outlines several ways in which the heated water could be reused. He also recommends introducing organic Rankine cycles, which rely on a special property of organic fluids: the fact that they turn into high-pressure steam at relatively low temperatures (250°C). “Using organic fluids would allow the mill to produce the steam it needs using recovered hot water at low-to-medium temperatures,” he explains.\nThe Canadian firm has expressed interest in Kermani’s model. “As compared to strictly mathematical and limited methods, the proposed approach provides insightful information for the preliminary design of industrial heat exchanger networks involved in pulp and paper,” says Canadian industrial process expert Marzouk Benali, who is tasked with optimizing that company’s processes. “Its flexibility offers opportunities to assess the direct impacts of integrating emerging biorefinery technologies within existing large facilities.”\nKermani’s model has potential applications in other sectors and industries as well.\nCollaborations:\nThis research was conducted as part of a collaboration between EPFL and CanmetENERGY, a Natural Resources Canada research center.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher has developed a mathematical model for optimizing heat transfer in factories and dramatically reducing water and energy consumption.

{"id": 159, "text": "How did vertebrates walk 300 million years ago? Could they already stand upright on their legs? Did they move in a balanced, energy-efficient way? Scientists at EPFL’s  and the  at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin set out to answer these questions. Using the fossilized skeleton and footprints of \nOrobates pabsti \n– a vertebrate that, on the evolutionary tree, comes between amphibians on one hand and reptiles and mammals on the other – the scientists created computer simulations and a robot. Drawing on experimental studies of four living amphibian and reptile species, they used these tools to gauge how plausible different ways of walking were for the fossilized animal.\n“\nOrobates \nis an ideal candidate for understanding how land vertebrates evolved because it is in the lineage leading to modern amniotes. These animals formed in eggs laid on land and became largely independent of water,” says John Nyakatura, a professor at Humboldt-Universität. What’s more, \nOrobates \nis the oldest-known vertebrate for which scientists have been able to link a fossil with its fossilized footprints. “This combination is what enabled us to carry out our unique quantitative study, which paves the way to replicating the walk of other fossilized animals,” says Auke Ijspeert, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. The researchers’ findings appear in .\nA motion-based model and then a robotic one\nTo better understand how \nOrobates \nwalked and pinpoint just how advanced its locomotion was, the scientists at Humboldt-Universität developed a digital model of its skeleton based on the animal’s fossil and the biomechanics of modern animals with sprawling postures. They used this model to carry out the first kinematic computer simulation of \nOrobates’ \ngait as it walks on its digitalized footprints. This simulation focuses on movements (rather than forces) and identifies gaits where the animal’s bones do not collide or come out of their joints.\nIn parallel, two scientists at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory – post-doctoral researcher Kamilo Melo and PhD student Tomislav Horvat – used the fossilized animal anatomy to build a robot called OroBOT. Designed and scaled to match the shape and movements of the extinct animal, OroBOT was used to calculate the physics of how \nOrobates \nwalked. “We tested our hypotheses about the animal’s locomotion dynamics with our robotic model, which factors in the real-world physics of the animal’s gait,” says Melo.\nTesting hundreds of different gaits, based on contemporary animals\nThe interdisciplinary team of scientists tested hundreds of different gaits with their robot in order to determine which ones \nOrobates \ncould have used – and those that it clearly did not. The gaits they tested were based on biomechanical principles extracted from similar modern-day animals such as caimans, salamanders, iguanas and skinks, which they analyzed through X-ray videos and force measurements. “We studied the biomechanics of their movements and determined which mechanical principles they all followed,” says Nyakatura. The research team looked at three features in particular: how erect the animal stood on its legs; how its backbone bent; and how much its elbow or shoulder joints bent as it walked. These three features determine what the researchers call the animal’s “sprawling gait space.” They created  where fellow scientists – and the wider public – can explore the universe of movements that \nOrobates \ncould have used.\nWith these results, they came up with the most likely ways that \nOrobates \nmay have walked. They scored the gaits based on how much energy was required, how stable the movements were, how the leg forces compared with those of other sprawling animals, and how closely the movements aligned with the fossilized footprints. The gaits with good scores appear quite athletic and most closely resemble the movements of caimans. This suggests that \nOrobates \nprobably already held itself a little upright on its legs – unlike salamanders and skinks. Its locomotion was thus more advanced than had been previously thought. \nThe study concludes that advanced — more upright, balanced and mechanically power-saving —locomotion, as in \nOrobates\n, may have evolved before the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals lived. The novel approach developed for this study can be applied by other scientists in their work, and it could be modified to study other evolutionary transitions, such as the origins of flight or galloping gaits in mammals.\nContacts\nFor inquiries about robotics, in English or Spanish:\nKamilo Melo (robotics engineer, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)\nEmail: \nFor inquiries about robotics, in French:\nAuke J.

{"id": 164, "text": "At 5:01 pm Wednesday evening, the Philae lander touched down on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko – Chury, for short – seven hours after taking leave of its mothership, the Rosetta orbiter. Although there are still concerns about its anchoring and the resulting feasibility of some operations, the washing-machine sized robot has already gotten to work, sending data and spectacular images of its new surroundings.\nLaunched in 2004 by the European Space Agency, the probe made a 10-year voyage, traveling 500 million kilometers from Earth, to wind up somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In March, Rosetta’s systems were rebooted successfully as it approached the comet, and in August it began to orbit. The first photos of the comet revealed a fascinating shape, seemingly the result of an agglomeration of two rocky cores. The images sent yesterday by Philae indicate that the comet seems to be made up primarily of rock, and not ice. Grégoire Bourban space engineer and Deputy Director of the EPFL Swiss Space Center, gives us his engineer’s viewpoint on this exceptional event.\n-\tWhy was this operation such a huge challenge, from a space engineering point of view? \nIn the heat of the operation, Wednesday, someone dared to compare this adventure with the first human moon landing. And I share that opinion. Because this operation is very different from others that have involved a lander. For the missions on Venus or Mars, for example, we were dealing with bodies that had been studied for a long time, and we understood the precise nature of the ground we’d be landing on. In addition, they were much larger targets, with many appropriate landing spots. What is unique about Chury is that we knew next to nothing about it in August 2014; but we had to choose a landing site, then make millions of descent calculations, studying various trajectories. Managing to do this successfully, from 500 million miles away, is quite simply incredible!\n-\tWhat will Philae allow us to study, and how will it operate? \nThe Philae mission is a true success, even if the lander has experienced some anchoring issues and only two of its three feet appear to be stable. We still don’t know what the consequences of this will be on the analysis operations. If all goes as planned, the lander and orbiter will remain for an entire year in this configuration, accompanying a comet for the first time ever in its trip around the Sun. As it approaches the sun, its core will begin to melt, and thus it will release gases that will react with others already in suspension. Comets are considered to be a possible origin of the presence of water on Earth, and studying this comet’s composition could thus give us valuable information about our origins.\nTo carry out these tasks, Philae is equipped with various instruments for analyzing particles, electromagnetic radiation, various gases, soil properties and even the sounds that the comet emits. It can bore up to 20 centimeters beneath the surface and remove samples. It’s these soil-sampling operations that are in question due to the failure of the harpoons to anchor the lander. And given the weak gravity, even a very small perturbation could eject the robot from the surface.\n-\n\tSome elements or instruments on board Philae and Rosetta were made in Switzerland. Which ones are they and what do they do?\nThere was a significant Swiss involvement in this project. The most well known instrument is Rosina; developed at the University of Bern, it’s what we call a mass spectrometer. Its objective is to analyze the composition of the comet’s atmosphere, the temperature and density of the gases, and their evolution as the comet approaches the Sun. Several companies, including APCO and Clemessy, also developed ground-based support systems, that is, everything used to test the electrical and mechanical properties of the instruments before they’re launched into space. Certain components, most notably the mechanisms for pointing the communications antenna and the solar panel supports, were built by Mecanex in Nyon, which is now part of the company RUAG Space. Finally, some of Philae’s micro-cameras were developed at the CSEM in Neuchâtel. The first images sent from the surface of the comet, made public yesterday morning, came from these instruments!\n-\tWhat lessons can we learn from this for future space operations and exploration?\nMissions like this are very rare, because they are terribly costly in terms of both money and time – more than €1.5 billion and 20 years of work went into Rosetta. The concrete results that she will provide and the public enthusiasm we’re seeing are extremely positive signals for us, because they will encourage decision makers in European countries to continue to invest in space projects and fund the ESA. One of the most significant interests of this mission, in engineering terms, is in robotics and automation. In the space sector, we’re usually dealing with telecoms satellites or observational satellites orbiting Earth, and thus primarily sensor technology. Rosetta is a spectacular demonstration that these technologies [robotics and automation, ed.] operate well in space, and could thus encourage an increase in launching more robotics-type projects.\nImage: first picture taken by Philae once on the comet's surface.

{"id": 170, "text": "The “classical” role for a gene is to produce proteins, which are essential for the functioning of cells. However, our genomes also encode genes that produce long non-coding RNAs, whose functions are more mysterious. Yet, since four or five years ago we know that thousands of these still poorly understood genes are present in the human and mouse genomes. How and in which organs are they activated? Is this biological “dark matter” much ado about nothing or is there something more interesting to it?\nA team led by Professor Henrik Kaessmann at UNIL’s Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) compiled an authentic catalog of long non-coding RNAs in eleven species. By adopting an evolutionary approach, they discovered that about 2500 long non-coding RNAs first appeared at least 90 million years ago in the common ancestor of most placental mammals. From a functional point of view, these “ancient” genes turned out to be particularly interesting.\nFirst author of the \nNature\n article, Anamaria Necsulea, scientist at the Laboratory of developmental genomics of EPFL, expanded the scope of the investigation on these long non-coding RNAs to six primate species (man, macaque, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan), and to mouse, opossum (a marsupial mammal), platypus (a monotreme mammal that lays eggs and nurses its young with milk), as well as to an \"external group\" composed by a bird (chicken) and an amphibian (frog). The common ancestor of all these species goes back over 350 million years.\nGenes maintained during evolution\nThe biologists used the CIG genomics platform and the Vital-IT computing center at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to identify long non-coding RNAs in several major organs of the 11 species under scrutiny. \"Thanks to bioinformatics, we discovered RNA sequences produced from genome locations where no genes had been previously mapped,\" she said. \"We then analyzed these genes to find out whether or not they encoded proteins. Thus, we could identify between 3000 and 15000 long non-coding RNA genes, depending on the species.\"\nIn the second phase of the research, a comparison among the different species allowed the scientists to pinpoint the emergence of these genes in the evolutionary history. While 11,000 long non-coding RNAs are shared by all primates, 2,500 go back to an ancestor common to man and mouse, about 90 million years ago. Only a hundred genes of this kind stem from an ancestor common to all eleven species considered, including birds and amphibians. \"One of our main findings is that the activity of these non-coding genes is controlled by the same transcription factors that regulate protein-coding gene activity. Even more strikingly, we found that the 2,500 oldest long noncoding RNA genes are regulated by factors that are important for embryonic development. This suggests that, among the 2500 long non-coding RNAs conserved during the evolution of placental mammals, a large percentage may function specifically in embryonic development.\"\nNew network of interactions\nThe third phase of the research allowed the scientists to highlight a network of interactions (specifically, co-expression interactions, that is: genes are activated in the same organs or cell types) involving both long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. For instance, they found that some non-coding genes are strongly associated to protein coding genes involved in brain function or in spermatogenesis, which suggests similar functions for these long non-coding RNA genes.\n In the case of the H19X gene - one of the most ancient long noncoding RNA genes identified in this study - its association to the placental mammals’ H19 gene (which was the first long non-coding RNA identified years ago) helped to uncover its functioning: \"The H19 prevents the placenta from excessively growing inside the mother's womb,\" said Anamaria Necsulea. \"We can assume that H19X also contributes to this function. We now plan to disable this gene in mice to test its functions in the placenta.\"\nAmong the subcategories of RNA producing genes, are these long RNA genes more useful than it originally seemed? By tracking them in 11 different species, this new study of unprecedented scale suggests that some of our genomes’ \"dark matter\" may play a role in the development and functioning of the most vital organs of our bodies.

{"id": 171, "text": "For humans, it comes perfectly naturally. But walking on two legs is actually a complicated task, requiring several muscles to perform delicate balancing acts. That’s why, in spite of years of major technological advancements in the field, humanoid robots are still far from being able to get around easily and reliably. Engineers at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory are testing new walking algoritms on a plateform called COMAN, short for COmpliant HuMANoid. This 95-cm-tall humanoid is designed specifically for studying walking – which is why it has no head.\nCOMAN was developed under the EU AMARSi project and is being used by several research teams. The EPFL team is looking specifically at the “brains” of the machine. “We developed algorithms that can improve the robot’s balance while it’s walking,” says Hamed Razavi, a researcher scientist at the Biorobotics Lab.\nIn harmony with symmetries\nOne of COMAN’s distinguishing features is its joints, which are integrated with elastic elements that give it greater flexibility when performing different tasks. The EPFL team came up with a novel control algorithm for the robot, based on the existing symmetries in the structure and dynamics of the robot’ as well as the mathematical equations representing the robot dynamics. “You could say we’re working in harmony with these symmetries rather than against them. As a result, we obtain a more natural and robust walking gait,” says Razavi.\nThe control algorithm uses sophisticated computer programs to carefully analyze the date received from the robot – including its position, velocity, joint angles, etc. – and sends appropriate commands to the motors, telling them what to do in order to maintain the robot's balance. “For example, if someone pushes COMAN, for example, our algorithms will calculate exactly where its foot should land in order to counteract the perturbation,” says Razavi.\nClimbing stairs and opening doors\nThe algorithms are geared towards three types of realworld applications. The first is carrying out rescue missions in disastrous scenarios. “In environments designed by humans - like a nuclear power plant where there are stairs to climb and doors to open – humanoid robots can get around more easily than robots with wheels,” says Razavi. The second is helping with tasks like carrying heavy boxes or moving objects (see box). And the third is creating exoskeletons for the disabled.\n“Making the robots more stable is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Razavi. The next step is refining the algorithms so that the humanoids have a wider range of movement and can overcome obstacles and walk on irregular or sloped surfaces.\nHumanoids helping humans\nAs part of this project, Jessica Lanini and Hamed Razavi studied how two people carrying an object together are able to walk, turn and speed up in a coordinated manner – without communicating with each other. Their findings, recently published in , indicate that the two people automatically synchronize their steps, like a quadruped. Now the researchers plan to apply their results to humanoid robots.\n“Whether for manufacturing or natural disasters, we need robots that can interact with humans and help us carry heavy objects,” says Lanini. “But such robots don’t exist. That’s because, in order to operate safely and effectively, the robots would need to be able to make decisions and respond to unexpected circumstances.”\nThe researchers decided to observe humans, who do things better and more naturally than robots. They analyzed the way humans move and found that some factors like speed, force and hand position play a pivotal role in understanding “commands” like speeding up or stopping. The next step is modeling these observations in order to program the robots. “What is exactly that makes us realize to slow down or turn? The applied force? A combination of force and speed? The boundary is not yet clear,” says Razavi. \nClara Marc", "summary": "Walking on two legs isn’t as easy as it seems. For robots and their designers, it is an even bigger challenge!

{"id": 172, "text": "The “deep artificial composer”, or “DAC” for short, generates brand-new melodies that imitate traditional folk music of Irish or Klezmer origin. It does so without plagiarising already existing ones, since melodies it writes are as original as those produced by a human composer. The results were presented in April at this year’s edition of the .\nThe DAC actually produces musical scores of melodies, symbolic music written using notation, and does not generate audio files. “The deep artificial composer can produce complete melodies, with a beginning and an end, that are completely novel and that share features that we relate to style,” says EPFL scientists Florian Colombo who developed the artificial intelligence under the guidance of Wulfram Gerstner, director of the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory.\nColombo continues, “To my knowledge, this is the first time that an artificial neural network model has produced entire and convincing melodies. We also provide a new tool to evaluate the originality of a piece.”\nAlgorithmic music composition was first suggested in the literature by English mathematician Ada Lovelace in the 19\nth\n century, requiring an “Analytical Machine” which could be programmed to solve even the most complex problems, like writing music. The computational power of modern computers and the sheer amount of digitized musical scores are now making automatic music composition a reality.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is already capable of composing symbolic music and is often based on implementing music theory. What’s new with the DAC is that the AI learns to compose complete melodies without any music theory from start to finish, solely based on a large database of existing music. No human postproduction is necessary.\nExtracting music style with probabilities\nEPFL’s deep artificial composer avoids traditional music theory altogether. Each style of music has its own set of rules, and existing AI generated music often uses the Western musical language of harmony and counterpoint. In fact, the EPFL algorithm determines its own composition rules by extracting probability distributions from existing melodies using neural networks, requiring only the computation power of graphic cards that can speed up calculations by a factor of ten compared to standard computers.\nThe DAC extracts the style of the music by learning how a given piece of music transitions from one note to the next, and calculates the probability of the next note’s pitch and duration. The algorithm then trains on multiple scores of music, of any given style, in order to improve its ability to correctly predict the pitch and duration of the upcoming note.\nOnce the training is complete, which means that the predictive performance of the deep artificial composer has reached its target value, set at 50% successful pitches and 80% successful durations, it no longer needs to be trained and can be used to generate new melodies, one note at a time. The deep artificial composer builds a string of notes from beginning to end, including the very first note and the length of the composition, that resembles melodies of the dataset that was used for the training. Listen to a  based on Irish and Klezmer melodies and interpreted by Colombo on the cello.\nOf course, the DAC can compose melodies before the training process is complete, but this leads to , even to the untrained ear. It can also be trained beyond the target value, but the generated pieces tend to resemble existing compositions. The DAC can also determine itself if the composition is original enough by comparing phrases of notes with existing patterns in its database of melodies. Similarly, the algorithm can determine the musical genre – Irish or Klezmer folk in this case – of the generated scores.\nThe generated music is not limited to Irish or Klezmer traditional folk music: any style of music could be used. It just so happens that many Irish and Klezmer melodies are already digitized and easily accessible.\nInsight into the human brain\nThe computing power behind the artificial intelligence is an artificial neural network, known as “long short-term memory” and invented twenty years ago at the IDSIA in Lugano. It has already proven useful for speech recognition and is widely used by the largest software companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.\n“The success of the deep artificial composer provides insight into how the human brain works,” says Gerstner. “Neural networks with memory spanning different time scales are needed to successfully create music, implying that the ability of the human brain to retain information, even after a long period of time, is key to composing music.”\nFor Colombo and Gerstner, the work is preliminary since the DAC is limited to single voice compositions. In the long-run, Colombo hopes to generate a score for an entire orchestra.", "summary": "A deep-learning algorithm developed by EPFL scientists can generate melodies that imitate a given style of music.

{"id": 174, "text": "Bees and fish don’t often have the occasion to meet, nor would they have much to say to each other if they did. However, under the ASSISIbf project, engineers from EPFL and four other European universities* were able to get groups of bees and fish to communicate with each other. The bees were located in Austria and the fish in Switzerland. Through robots, the two species transmitted signals back and forth to each other and gradually began coordinating their decisions. The study was published today in \nScience Robotics.\n“We created an unprecedented bridge between the two animal communities, enabling them to exchange some of their dynamics,” says Frank Bonnet, a researcher at EPFL’s Mobile Robots Group (MOBOTS), which is now part of the school’s Biorobotics Laboratory (BioRob). Researchers at MOBOTS have designed robots that can blend into groups of animals and influence their behavior. They have tested their robots on communities of cockroaches, chicks and, more recently, fish – one of these  was able to infiltrate a school of fish in a circular aquarium and get them to swim in a given direction.\nFor this study, engineers took the fish experiment and went one step further, connecting the robot and school of fish with a colony of bees in a laboratory at the Karl-Franzens-University of Graz, Austria. There the bees live on a platform with robot terminals on each side which they naturally tend to swarm around.\nActing as a go-between \nThe robots within each group of animals emitted signals specific to that species. The robot in the school of fish emitted both visual signals – in terms of different shapes, colors and stripes – and behavioral signals – like accelerations, vibrations and tail movements. The robots in the bee colony emitted signals mainly in the form of vibrations, temperature variations and air movements. Both groups of animals responded to the signals; the fish started swimming in a given direction and the bees started swarming around just one of the terminals. The robots in the two groups recorded the dynamics of each group, exchanged that information with each other, and then translated the information received into signals appropriate for the corresponding species.\n“The robots acted as if they were negotiators and interpreters in an international conference. Through the various information exchanges, the two groups of animals gradually came to a shared decision,” says Francesco Mondada, a professor at BioRob.\nDuring the experiment, the two animal species “talked” to each other even though they were some 700 kilometers apart. The conversation was chaotic in the beginning, but eventually led to a certain amount of coordination. After 25 minutes, the animal groups were synchronized – all the fish swam in a counterclockwise direction and all the bees had swarmed around one of the terminals.\nSwapping certain characteristics \n“The species even started adopting some of each other’s characteristics. The bees became a little more restless and less likely to swarm together than usual, and the fish started to group together more than they usually would,” says Bonnet.\nThe study’s findings could help robotics engineers develop an effective way for machines to capture and translate biological signals. And for biologists, the study could enable them to better understand animal behavior and how individuals within an ecosystem interact. Further out, the research could be used to develop methods for monitoring natural habitats by using animals’ exceptional sensory capabilities. For instance, scientists could encourage birds to avoid airports and the related dangers or direct pollinators toward organic crops and away from crops with pesticides.\n*University of Lisbon, Portugal; Karl-Franzens-University Graz, Austria; University of Paris Diderot, France; and University of Zagreb, Croatia", "summary": "Through an imaginative experiment, researchers were able to get two extremely different animal species located far apart to interact with each other and reach a shared decision with the help of robots.", "claim": "Through an imaginative experiment, researchers were able to get one extremely different animal species located far apart to interact with each other and reach a shared decision with the help of robots.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}

{"id": 179, "text": "A group of spintronics researchers at EPFL is using new materials to reveal more of the many capabilities of electrons. The field of spintronics seeks to tap the quantum properties of “spin,” the term often used to describe one of the fundamental properties of elementary particles – in this case, electrons. This is among the most cutting-edge areas of research in electronics today.\nResearchers working in the Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES), which is run by Professor Andras Kis, were able to quantify these quantum properties for a category of two-dimensional semiconductors called transition metal dichalcogenides, or TMDCs. Their research projects, which were published recently in \nACS Nano\n and today in \nNature Communications\n, confirm that materials like graphene (C), molybdenite (MoS\n2\n) and tungsten diselenide (WSe\n2\n) offer, either alone or by combining some of their characteristics, new perspectives for the field of electronics – perspectives that could ultimately lead to smaller chips that generate less heat.\n“With the methods we’ve recently developed, we’ve shown that it is possible to access the spin in these TMDC materials, quantify it and use it to introduce new functionalities,” says Kis.\nThe device developed at the LANES is composed of monolayer MoS2 is the active channel, encapsulated between atomically flat h-BN layers and contacted to multilayer graphene.\nThis all takes place at an extremely small scale. In order to access these quantum properties, the researchers must work with high quality materials. “If we want to examine certain characteristics of electrons, including their energy, we need to be able to watch them move over relatively long distances without there being too much dispersion or disruption,” explains Kis.\nIn the form of waves\nThe researchers’ method allows them to obtain samples of sufficient quality both to observe how electrons move around in the form of waves and to quantify their energy.\nBut the LANES team was also able to access another quantum property. Spins of electrons and holes in this type of a 2D semiconductor can be in one of two states, which are conventionally described as being oriented upward – spin up – or downward – spin down. Their energy will be slightly different in each of these two states. That’s called spin splitting, and the EPFL researchers have measured it for the first time for electrons in TMDC materials.\nIn the second publication, the researchers wrote about how they used the spin splitting in a TMDC in order to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene without using a magnetic field.\nSpin splitting used in a TMDC to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene.\nThese discoveries are a step forward for the emerging field of spintronics and make it increasingly likely that a different property of charge carriers – i.e. spin, in addition to the electrical charge – will play a role in tomorrow’s electronic devices.\nThe work was performed in collaboration with Takashi Taniguchi and Kenji Watanabe from NIMS Japan (ACS Nano and Nature Comm. papers) and Barbaros Özyilmaz from National University of Singapore (ACS Nano paper).", "summary": "EPFL researchers have successfully measured some of the quantum properties of electrons in two-dimensional semiconductors.

{"id": 182, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.

Equipped with an autopilot and a miniature high-definition camera, it is used by hundreds of professionals worldwide. This start-up installed at the gates of EPFL hopes to increase its sales tenfold in the next years and create dozens of new jobs in the field of airborne drones. It does so thanks to an investment of 5 million Swiss Francs from the publicly traded French company Parrot, making them a majority shareholder in senseFly.\nsenseFly drones demonstrate the full extent of their capabilities when combined with software developed by Pix4D, a spin-off of EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB). The algorithms developed by Pix4D make it possible to assemble hundreds of aerial pictures and, within minutes, to get an extremely accurate 3D and geo-referenced image of the observed terrain. This young company based at EPFL’s Science Park is also of interest to Parrot, which invested 2.4 million Swiss Francs for a minority share in Pix4D. “In the 1980’s the algorithms were really unreliable, and I was convinced it would take well over thirty years to become the basis of fully-automated, reliable and useful commercial products. This is a wonderful example of how curiosity-driven research, for example the ability of a human to make sense of the world around him through what he sees, eventually led to useful results,” said Pascal Fua, director of the CVLAB.\nLike an Insect\nUsing one of senseFly’s small high-performance drones is a breeze. The course can be programmed with software pre-flight and still be modified throughout the flight’s duration. No runway necessary: three movements back-and-forth are enough to start the engine, and the 500-gram wing takes off. The drone reaches a cruising speed of 40 km/h to autonomously map areas ranging from a few hectares to several square kilometers in one flight, with a resolution ranging from 3 to 30 cm/pixel depending on the distance above ground. Within a maximum of thirty minutes, the drone returns to its starting point without further assistance. All that is necessary for the next mission is to change the battery.\nThe technology on which these devices are based was created in 2001, when a team of robotics researchers in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) at EPFL began to investigate the strategies of control and navigation in flying insects. Early research led to the development of an integrated autopilot using intelligent control strategies similar to that of flies and bees. “By 2008 it was included in an ultra-light flying wing, which incorporated all the advantages of insects: efficient, elegant, light, elemental and intelligent,” recalls Jean-Christophe Zufferey, founder and CEO of senseFly. “I am very pleased that our robotic flying insect has not only helped to elucidate biological issues, but has also been able to promote the socio-economic development of our region by creating dozens of new high-value jobs. In collaboration with the newly created National Competence Center in Robotics, senseFly contributes to making EPFL and the surrounding region an important center for artificial intelligence and robotics,” says Dario Floreano, director of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and of the National Competence Center in Robotics.\nWhile the legislation for the usage of drones is being discussed in most countries, the low mass and speed of these ultra-light drones gives them a unique advantage by limiting the potential damage they could cause and thereby favored for civilian use.\nEPFL’s Pole of Expertise in Civilian Drones\nParrot, a global leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones, has recently invested in drones for the consumer market. It has released a Wi-Fi controllable quadricopter, of which it has sold more than 300,000 since its launch in 2010. The collaboration with the French group will create synergies for both EPFL start-ups.\nThe increasing need of data for Geographical Information Systems (GIS), such as Google Earth & Street View, should drive the market of ultra-light professional civilian drones to one billion dollars by 2020. The combination of senseFly trouble-free hardware, Pix4D’s unique mapping software and Parrot high volume manufacturing expertise provide the key elements to address this fast emerging market. Furthermore, the collaborations with the National Competence Centers (www.nccr-robotics.ch & www.MICS.org), both managed by EPFL, provide a heart to this internationally recognized center of expertise in civilian UAV technologies.\nSenseFly, founded in 2009 in “Le Garage”, EPFL’s incubator, will remain in the region and its management team will stay at the helm. “We can benefit from the technological expertise of Parrot, from its externalized industrial organization and its financial strength to accelerate our worldwide distribution,” said Jean-Christophe Zufferey, senseFly CEO. This strategic investment will give the French company access to the expertise and the technology for specialized drones.\nAs for Pix4D, created in 2011, Parrot’s investment enables the exploration of new business horizons. “This reinforces our position as a leader in software for professional drones,” adds Christoph Strecha, the company’s CEO.", "summary": "The French company Parrot, world leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones and already in the market for consumer drones, acquired for 5 million Swiss Francs a majority share in senseFly, a start-up from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL.

The current tendency is to use carriers in higher frequency bands, especially with looming bandwidth bottlenecks due to demands for e.g. 5G and the “Internet of Things”. “Microwave photonics”, a combination of microwave engineering and optoelectronics, might offer a solution.\nA key building block of microwave photonics is optical frequency combs, which provide hundreds of equidistant and mutually coherent laser lines. They are ultrashort optical pulses emitted with a stable repetition rate that corresponds precisely to the frequency spacing of comb lines. The photodetection of the pulses produces a microwave carrier.\nIn recent years there has been significant progress on chip-scale frequency combs generated from nonlinear microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers. These frequency combs rely on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons, which are ultrashort coherent light pulses circulating inside optical microresonators. Because of this, these frequency combs are commonly called “soliton microcombs”.\nGenerating soliton microcombs needs nonlinear microresonators, and these can be directly built on-chip using CMOS nanofabrication technology. The co-integration with electronic circuitry and integrated lasers paves the path to comb miniaturization, allowing a host of applications in metrology, spectroscopy and communications.\nPublishing in \nNature Photonics\n, an EPFL research team led by Tobias J.

This was achieved by significantly lowering the optical losses of integrated photonic waveguides based on silicon nitride, a material already used in CMOS micro-electronic circuits, and which has also been used in the last decade to build photonic integrated circuits that guide laser light on-chip.\nThe scientists were able to manufacture silicon nitride waveguides with the lowest loss in any photonic integrated circuit. Using this technology, the generated coherent soliton pulses have repetition rates in both the microwave K- (~20 GHz, used in 5G) and X-band (~10 GHz, used in radars).\nThe resulting microwave signals feature phase noise properties on par with or even lower than commercial electronic microwave synthesizers. The demonstration of integrated soliton microcombs at microwave repetition rates bridges the fields of integrated photonics, nonlinear optics and microwave photonics.\nThe EPFL team achieved a level of optical losses low enough to allow light to propagate nearly 1 meter in a waveguide that is only 1 micrometer in diameter –100 times smaller than that a human hair. This loss level is still more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value in optical fibers, but represents the lowest loss in any tightly confining waveguide for integrated nonlinear photonics to date.\nSuch low loss is the result of a new manufacturing process developed by EPFL scientists – the “silicon nitride photonic Damascene process”. “This process, when carried out using deep-ultraviolet stepper lithography, gives truly spectacular performance in terms of low loss, which is not attainable using conventional nanofabrication techniques,” says Junqiu Liu, the paper’s first author who also lead the fabrication of silicon nitride nanophotonic chips at EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi). “These microcombs, and their microwave signals, could be critical elements for building fully integrated low-noise microwave oscillators for future architectures of radars and information networks.”\nThe EPFL team is already working with collaborators in US to develop hybrid-integrated soliton microcomb modules that combine chip-scale semiconductor lasers. These highly compact microcombs can impact many applications, e.g. transceivers in datacenters, LiDAR, compact optical atomic clocks, optical coherence tomography, microwave photonics, and spectroscopy.", "summary": "Using integrated photonic chips fabricated at EPFL, scientists have demonstrated laser-based microwave generators.

It uses them simultaneously, then aggregates the data obtained to deliver the final content to each unit. As a result the download speed can be doubled when two devices work together. “Videos represent 60% of the traffic on mobile networks, and the demand is growing faster than the ability of the network to provide bandwidth,” says Christina Fragouli, co-founder of the start-up. This results in increasing interruptions while viewing a video.\nThis ingenious system comes with many constraints. “To accomplish this, we must solve the problem of resource allocation, all the while accounting for variabilities in the wireless network,” explains Lorenzo Keller, the other co-founder of this spin-off from EPFL and University of California Irvine (UCI). The algorithms behind this system provide for any wireless device which transmits, via any network, at any time. Moreover, it necessarily does this effeciently: devices are carefully coordinated so that the overall coordination does not interfere with the benefits. Several applications are being developed. The bandwidth can be shared either when it is not in use by one of the users, or when a group of users simultaneously attempts to access the same content.\nVideobee, designed for Android smartphones, will be launched any day now. This application facilitates video viewing from websites like YouTube or DailyMotion by reducing both the waiting time at the beginning of the video as well as interruptions. The download speed is doubled. The bandwidth of another device nearby is used, albeit with the agreement of the owner.\nStarting in September a specific version for MOOCs (massive open online course) in Africa becomes available. On a continent where network quality is often poor, bandwidth sharing facilitates taking online courses. Students can then follow the courses at home.

This is an absolute record, even though the previous year also proved to be excellent, with an injection of capital exceeding 110 million. Since 2010, roughly one-half billion francs have been invested by the private sector, who are betting on the potential of these young companies.\nEPFL spin-offs – companies that develop a discovery or invention within EPFL laboratories – claim the lion’s share. They account for 185 of the 220 million francs invested in 2014. The remaining 35 million are for start-ups that, although they may not have developed technologies at EPFL, have moved to the campus’ Innovation Park to enjoy its dynamism and to work more closely with the school’s scientists.\nSome companies have achieved a high increase in their capital, such as Mitokyne or Anokion. However, nearly 15% of the funds went to very young start-ups who are just beginning.

{"id": 204, "text": "Do you speak Scala? Many big companies active on the Web now reply in the affirmative. Twitter, Foursquare , LinkedIn and the internet site of the British newspaper The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) have adopted this programming language, developed at EPFL by Martin Odersky, Professor in the computer science section of the school.\nLast week, its creator announced the launch of a new company, with its offices at the Science Park at Ecublens. It’s called Typesafe, has just raised three million dollars, and will give a serious boost to the Scala language. The main investor in this round of financing – Greylock, based in Boston and in Silicon Valley – is not just any old investor. The company supported Facebook at the time when the social networking site was opening to a mass audience, and had also invested in LinkedIn, from 2004.\nScala is becoming more and more popular with programmers, especially for internet applications. But what’s behind this success? “This language is concise, and enables reductions of on average 50% of the lines of code”, Martin Odersky begins by explaining. What’s more, being very close to Java and completely compatible, it’s very easy to adopt for programmers who are familiar with Java, which has become a true standard on the Internet. Finally, it’s open source, which means that the people who contribute to its development exist in their hundreds, spread across the whole world – although EPFL remains the owner of the copyright.\nLeveraging the multiplication of “cores”\n One of the strengths of Scala is to combine two approaches that are popular in the programming world. One is “object-oriented” – which has always up to now been preferred by industry – and the other “functional programming”, which has been used mainly in academia. The advantage of the latter is that it’s very efficient when it comes to distribute tasks to several processors working in parallel. “Today, progress in IT is exemplified by the multiplication of the number of ‘cores’ in the processors, and no longer in terms of increases in speed”, explains the Professor. “Creating new applications that take advantage of this aspect of the processors is a natural development in programming.” Another advantage is that this approach is perfectly suited to distributed computing, or “cloud computing”, which is becoming more popular with big companies that are active on the Internet. This approach –concentrating on the distribution of tasks to multiple processors – gives Scala its name (from “scaling”).\nWith his new company, Martin Odersky is paving the way for the future of computing. Typesafe provides free-of-charge downloading of a pack of software including Scala, a development tool, and also the Akka platform, created in Sweden, whose inventor Jonas Bonér is also a co-founder of Typesafe. Complementary to Scala, Akka is a middleware designed for the distribution of tasks in large computing centers.\nIn parallel, Typesafe is putting in place a technical support service for its clients. “From around 15 employees today, our team will increase to 25 by the end of the year”, continues Martin Odersky. Most of the employees are developers, working in the EPFL Science Park, Cambridge, Boston – where the company is headquarted – and Uppsala. In just over a couple of weeks, Typesafe will be in the limelight during the second annual « Scala days » event – a meeting of programmers – whose initial occurrence last year at EPFL attracted many specialists.\nTypesafe should thus give a real boost to the Scala language. With a smile on his lips, Martin Odersky expresses his confidence that the “really big players” in this domain will soon be joining in. But as for their names, we’ll just have to be patient . . .", "summary": "Thanks to the raising of three million dollars, Martin Odersky has just created the company Typesafe.

{"id": 205, "text": "How can we constantly monitor the stability of a bridge or detect a leak in a gas pipeline in real time? A method based on optical fibers has become the norm in recent years. By carefully measuring the path of light in fibers up to 100 kilometers long, we can glean information on the temperature, pressure and intensity of magnetic fields along the entire length of the fiber. It’s similar to a nerve, which tells us the intensity and location of a stimulus.\nBut this method is nearing its limits. Depending on the planned use, it’s necessary to sacrifice length, accept a lower resolution or add more equipment – a costly undertaking.\nOne hair, a million measurements\nThanks to the work done by EPFL’s Group for Fibre Optics (GFO), it will now be possible to maintain an extremely fine resolution even when the fiber gets longer. “We have no trouble getting a million measurement points from one optical fiber the width of a hair, for a resolution of one centimeter over 10 kilometers,” said Luc Thévenaz, the director of GFO. That’s 100 times more precise than current techniques.\nMeasurements made with this type of instrument have to be processed, because they include ‘parasites’. But the ratio between useful signals and noise cannot go below a certain threshold, otherwise the measurements will not be reliable.\nGraphic arts to the rescue\nThe EPFL researchers were able to boost this ratio significantly by borrowing a technology from an entirely different field: graphic arts. “The values collected from these measurement points on the fiber can be represented as a matrix of pixels – a two-dimensional image,” said Dr. Thévenaz. \"By applying standard graphic filters to this image, like those found in Photoshop, we were able to reduce the noise inherent in this measurement technique very effectively and identify the desired values more precisely.”\nPursuing this logic further, his teams also transformed more complex measurements, which take into account several parameters simultaneously, into video sequences. Here again, the magic of ‘standard’ video filters was at work.\nIn Dr. Thévenaz’s view, these advances, which are described in articles appearing in \nLight: Science & Applications – Nature\n and \nNature Communications\n, bring the field of distributed optical fiber sensors into a new era simply by using software techniques. This approach is, by definition, less expensive than adding more measuring devices.", "summary": "Image processing tools can improve our ability to monitor the soundness of infrastructure like bridges and gas pipelines.

{"id": 212, "text": "For many poor farmers in India and Africa, finger millet is a major staple food. The crop species is not only a rich source of minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and zinc, and it contains many vitamins and essential amino acids. The plant is also characterized by its resistance to drought and heat. As it is very healthy and gluten-free, it is finding increased use as a food in industrial countries as well. Despite its importance, finger millet has been given very little scientific attention until now.\nLarge and complex genome due to fusion of two plant species\nFinger millet arose through the hybridization of two different plant species. The plant is therefore polyploid, which means it has a four-fold set of chromosomes and almost twice as many genes as its original species. The size and complexity of the genome are thought to have conferred the broad environmental tolerance of finger millet, while making genome research extremely difficult. For the first time, an international team of researchers from the University of Zurich has now managed to decode the complex genome of finger millet in great detail. It comprises about 2.6 million base pairs and has more than 62,300 genes – about twice as many as rice, for example.\nNew strategy for genome sequencing and mapping\nA good 57,900 finger millet genes – over 90 percent – occur in more than two copies. As their DNA sequences are very similar, it was difficult to correctly allocate the numerous, decoded DNA sections within the entire genome. In cooperation with Ralph Schlapbach and Sirisha Aluri from the Functional Genomics Center at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, the team headed up by Kentaro Shimizu, professor at the UZH Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, has managed to overcome these difficulties. For this purpose, the scientists combined a sophisticated bioinformatics strategy developed by Masaomi Hatakeyama that uses state-of-the-art sequencing methods with a new technology that can optically map the long, individual DNA molecules in the genome. “Our newly developed strategy will help sequence the genome of other polyploid cultivated plants that have not been able to be determined until now,” Shimizu says.\nImproving the supply of nutrients and drought resistance\nAn interdisciplinary team of researchers from Zurich and Bangalore, India, worked together on this project. The work was supported by Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (ISCB), a bilateral research and development program financed by the Swiss and Indian governments, as well as by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The objective is to improve food security and to develop the capacity of biotechnological research in India. “The newly available genome data of finger millet opens up numerous possibilities for modern plant breeding,” Shimizu emphasizes. “On the one hand, to help people with mineral deficiencies in India and in industrialized countries and, on the other hand, to make important crop plants more resistant to drought and aridness.”\nLiterature\n:\nMasaomi Hatakeyama, Sirisha Aluri, Mathi Thumilan Balachadran, Sajeevan Radha Sivarajan, Andrea Patrignani, Simon Grüter, Lucy Poveda, Rie Shimizu-Inatsugi, John Baeten, Kees-Jan Francoijs, Karaba N.

{"id": 213, "text": "Katie Bouman was one of 200 scientists who helped create the first-ever image of a black hole, released this past April. The 30-year old researcher, who was recently named an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), came to speak at EPFL’s Open Science Day. Martin Vetterli took advantage of that opportunity to sit down with her and ask her a few questions about their field of shared interest.\nMV: “It’s pretty unusual for someone to become a star researcher at such a young age. How did you get into science?\nKB: I was very interested in science as a kid. When I was in third grade, I remember looking under rocks all the time. And as I got older, I was constantly drawn to the different science topics covered in class. In sixth grade, I first got involved in science fair projects, and I continued doing that on and off through high school. Then, when I tried out research for the first time, I was thrilled: it was so different from a homework set, where you know there’s a solution even if it’s difficult to find. Research was a new way of thinking and problem-solving for me, and I found that very exciting.\nHow did you get into computer science?\nIt wasn’t until high school, when a friend convinced me to take a computer science class. At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago. Initially, they didn’t believe their results and reran the experiment several times. Some things have changed since then, but we’re still dealing with noisy data, right?\nYes, when we first created the black-hole image, or at least the day we got the data, we entered it into an imaging script and a ring appeared. I actually went from being really excited to being mad at the colleagues who gave us the data – which I was convinced were fake. It just seemed too good to be true! Nothing ever works like that the first time. It was just so much more beautiful than any synthetic data we had created. It actually took weeks before I believed the data were real, and that our colleagues weren’t trying to trick us or test us.", "summary": "The first-ever image of a black hole was unveiled to the public this past April.

{"id": 216, "text": "Could you explain the concept of Routerank in a few words?\nJochen Mundinger\n: Basically, it’s a software for planning your travel itinerary. A version is available for everyone at . It’s most interesting feature is that it takes into account all the forms of transport – road, rail and air. It enables you to plan a complete journey, practically door-to-door. Imagine that I’d like to go from Ecublens to Cambridge in the UK: there are hundreds of combinations of ways to get there. I can take the metro to Lausanne and then the train to Geneva, where I can fly to London Luton and finish my journey by taxi. Or I could drive to Basel, then fly to London Stansted, where I could take a train to Cambridge. Routerank allows you to categorize all your itineraries according to different criteria, such as travel time, cost, and even CO2 emissions.\nCould this recognition from the USA herald a phase of international expansion for the company?\n To be frank, I rather underestimated its importance to begin with. Then I began to receive lots of congratulatory messages from around the world. The award has really helped us to bridge the Atlantic! We’ve received numerous European awards, but the recognition from Technology Review shows how relevant our work is at international level, and we’re very proud of that.\nThe whole of Europe is now covered by Routerank. What about the rest of the world?\n Flights are already covered at international level, and European and North American roads have been integrated. Rail networks and public transport are included for Europe, and increasingly for the U.S. and Canada.\nThat must mean compiling hundreds of data sources!\n We have an enormous variety of sources. We use the data of Via Michelin, companies like the Swiss and German Federal Railways, and more than 700 airlines. These data sources are all very different, as are the underlying technologies. That’s a real challenge, not to mention the necessity of developing a complex algorithm.\nHow is Routerank financed?\n We develop and sell customized solutions to companies like the WWF, Nokia, and the Swiss Confederation. For example, we’ve adapted the data sources in line with special rates offered to the Swiss Confederation and some airline companies, and also implemented selection criteria that take account of time available for work during the journey.

{"id": 221, "text": "For his master thesis, Fränz Zeimetz considered several trajectories for building a canal between Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Geneva. He finally chose a segment between Préverenges and Grandson. Such waterway would offer, in his opinion, environmental advantages as well as economic transportation costs. It would also constitute a major touristic attraction. The 38 km long work of art’s estimated cost is 2.5 billion francs...\nRemembering the Entreroches canal\n The student from the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) has, in a way, revisited the original concept behind the Entreroches canal. Currently disused, some of its course is still visible in some places between Cossonay and Morges.\n The Entreroches canal was the answer to the old European dream of a waterway linking the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The arrival of the railway combined with the lack of money during the 19th century ended this dream abruptly.\nNavigation path\n Departure takes place on the harbor of Grandson, on Lake Neuchâtel. A first tunnel takes you into the Orbe plain which is crossed in the open. Then another tunnel allows you to slide unnoticed under the Mormont hill between Yverdon-les-Bains and Lausanne. In Daillens, the boat gets into a lift and continues its way underground. 6 hours later, you arrive at Lake Geneva in Préverenges.\nA 78 meters lift\nThe Venoge River’s protected course\n Out of the 38 km of the canal, three-quarters pass through tunnels. This is partially caused by the presence of architectural barriers – since there are several towns along its way and it is not always possible to get round them, not to mention too costly. Environmental protection laws forced Fränz Zeimetz to reconsider some of his choices: \"Take the Venoge River for instance: a law dating from 1997 states that it is forbidden to change its natural course, to touch its watershed and to transform its tributaries. Therefore, the best way to get there was underground. \"\nInteractive Tunnels\n Since the canal is designed to transport leisure boats as well as cargo, the student decided to trade his engineering skills for architectural creativity. He thus devised an original way to animate this long underground journey. \"We could project images on the tunnels’ walls showing the outdoor landscapes we are going through or we could even tell the story of the Entreroches canal… why not?\" An engineer has the right to dream.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES - Student projects (5): An EPFL civil engineering student has envisioned a 38 km long navigation canal between Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Geneva.

{"id": 224, "text": "Soon all it will take is a single step for manufacturers to set the properties of construction materials during preparation and improve their properties once hardened. Nanogence, an EPFL spin-off, has developed a lone additive that stands to replace the plethora of additives currently used to obtain an ideal concrete, mortar or cement. It can even prevent reinforcing bars from deteriorating, thereby extending the lifetimes of buildings. A magic potion? Almost.\nSimplifying concrete preparation\nTo the uninitiated, concrete seems to be both singular and immutable. So pedestrian that you’d think it’s fairly straightforward with no hidden secrets. But in reality, making it requires juggling a slew of parameters that can differ not only from one company to the next, but also from one batch to the next. For instance, clinker, the basic ingredient in concrete, can vary depending on the natural surroundings of the rock it’s produced from. The temperature to which clinker should be heated can also vary, as can the residence time inside a kiln, cooling conditions, and cement-mixture composition.\nManufacturers tailor the cement they make to the building it’s intended for and the journey it will take to get there. “For example, if it’ll be used for a building in the middle of a large city, it needs to harden slowly so that builders can still work with it despite the time it will take to get it to the construction site,” said Kumar Abhishek, CEO of Nanogence. That means cement is typically enhanced with varying amounts of different additives until the ideal texture is found. The lone additive developed by the spin-off thus constitutes a mini-revolution for the industry. Manufacturers will just need to tweak the proportion to get the right consistency.\nBecause the additive is inorganic – that is, carbon-free – it also eliminates the porosity problem that leads to carbonatation and deterioration of the concrete. This problem stems from the carbon links and the moisture that can seep into the tiny cracks between the metallic structures that reinforce the building and the debris in the cement. But Kumar’s inorganic compound can get rid of that problem, thereby making buildings last longer.\nThe additive also boosts the hardness of construction materials. That means builders can make thinner walls, thus using less concrete. The ensuing savings are significant, given that concrete accounts for 5–10% of carbon emissions but is still one of the world’s cheapest and most widely-used construction materials.\nThe secret: a thesis on concrete’s nanoscopic structure\nSo how does this “miracle” additive work? The basic idea behind the new process came from the in-depth knowledge of concrete’s nanoscopic structure that Kumar acquired during his thesis. He then used nanotechnologies to develop chemical substances that can improve concrete’s properties. The recipes of those substances must, of course, remain secret.\nThis summer – two patents later – Kumar launched his startup. He’s currently in talks with two major European concrete producers and has kicked off production of a compound specifically for white concrete. This niche market is particularly targeted to high-end interior decoration. But Kumar doesn’t intend to rest on his laurels. He is also developing an additive that can improve concrete’s thermal insulation. “The idea is to eventually develop prefabricated elements that combine longevity with good thermal insulation,” said Kumar, who takes a big-picture view. “Over 40% of energy worldwide is used for construction. Rethinking construction materials will hopefully enable us to reduce this usage.”\nNanogence has won startup awards from the European Venture Program (EVP) and the Academia-Industry Training program sponsored by EPFL, Swissnex, and Venture Lab. It has also received an Innogrant and an Enable grant (an EPFL program to help laboratory researchers get new products quickly to market).", "summary": "Whether it’s for drying time, hardness, or uniformity, a new additive developed at EPFL can give concrete, mortar, and cement the desired consistency, all in one shot.

The models offer the prospect of a new understanding of the human brain and its diseases and of completely new computing and robotic technologies. On January 28, the European Commission supported this vision, announcing that it has selected the HBP as one of two projects to be funded through the new FET Flagship Program.\nFederating more than 80 European and international research institutions, the Human Brain Project is planned to last ten years (2013-2023). The cost is estimated at 1.19 billion euros. The project will also associate some important North American and Japanese partners. It will be coordinated at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, by neuroscientist Henry Markram with co-directors Karlheinz Meier of Heidelberg University, Germany, and Richard Frackowiak of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL).\nThe Swiss Contribution \nSwitzerland plays a vital role in the Human Brain Project. Henry Markram and his team at EPFL will coordinate the project and will also be responsible for the development and operation of the project’s Brain Simulation Platform. Richard Frackowiak and his team will be in charge of the project’s medical informatics platform; the Swiss Supercomputing Centre in Lugano will provide essential supercomputing facilities. Many other Swiss groups are also contributing to the project. Through the ETH Board, the Swiss Federal Government has allocated 75 million CHF (approximately 60 million Euros) for the period 2013-2017, to support the efforts of both Henry Markram’s laboratory at EPFL and the Swiss Supercomputing Center in Lugano. The Canton of Vaud will give 35 million CHF (28 million Euros) to build a new facility called Neuropolis for in silico life science, and centered around the Human Brain Project. This building will also be supported by the Swiss Confederation, the Rolex Group and third-party sponsors.\nThe selection of the Human Brain Project as a FET Flagship is the result of more than three years of preparation and a rigorous and severe evaluation by a large panel of independent, high profile scientists, chosen by the European Commission. In the coming months, the partners will negotiate a detailed agreement with the Community for the initial first two and a half year ramp-up phase (2013-mid 2016). The project will begin work in the closing months of 2013.\n---\nA scientific portrait of the Human Brain Project \nThe Human Brain Project will provide new tools to help understand the brain and its fundamental mechanisms and to apply this knowledge in future medicine and computing.\nCentral to the Human Brain Project is Information and Computing Technology (ICT). The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior.\nA novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and to speed up the search for new treatments.\nFinally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems.\nThe HBP will fund independent scientists to use the new platforms for their own research, reserving a substantial part of its budget for this purpose.

{"id": 230, "text": "EPFL’s Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI) has developed a method for reducing the power requirement of computer chips by mapping out their logic flows in an entirely new way. By using a different set of logic functions for the gates on the billions of transistors on electronic circuits, this system shortens the circuits’ calculation steps. That means chip designers can make their chips either smaller, faster or more energy efficient. Industry leader Synopsys has just acquired the rights to use the technology through a non-exclusive license agreement.\nStreamed logic structures for more powerful chips \nToday most engineers use electronic design automation software to design circuits. This software programs translate complex computational models into a labyrinth of billions of microscopic transistors. The LSI laboratory, directed by Giovanni De Micheli, has a longtime and worldwide renowned experience in design automation. There are only few companies and commercial products in use that sustain the entire semiconductor industry effort. Luca Amarù – while he was a PhD student at LSI – set out to radically change how design automation software generates logic diagrams in order to produce better designs.\nLuca Amarù, who holds a doctoral degree in computer science, came up with a method that uses only two logic primitives: majority and inverter. These functions are displayed in majority-inverter graphs (MIGs). Initial studies indicated that his approach could cut the number of logic steps needed to execute a given task. Later experiments confirmed this, finding that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18% on average relative to standard programs. That frees up transistor capacity for other tasks; engineers could also use these gains to make their chips faster or their devices smaller.\nAmarù, now a senior R&D manager at Synopsys, took his findings even further. He also developed a new Boolean algebra for representing the logic functions, which resulted in additional efficiency gains for his system.\nChips that are smaller and faster than ever before \nLab tests have shown that Amarù’s method also works exceptionally well with components already in the market, such as adders and dividers. According to Mauro Lattuada, the technology-transfer manager at EPFL who arranged the license agreement, the method constitutes an important revolution: “This new way of diagraming integrated circuits not only reduces the amount of power, computing time or space needed by nearly 20%, but also gives us a new logic paradigm that can be used in other applications, such as designing and improving FPGAs [field-programmable gate arrays] or searching and analyzing data sets.”", "summary": "An EPFL lab, has come up with a new type of logic diagram and related optimization methods, that can be used to design computer chips with a nearly 20% gain in energy efficiency, speed or size.

No human postproduction is necessary.\n19.07.17 - Scientists from NCCR Robotics at EPFL and at the Lausanne University Hospital developed an algorithm that adjusts how a mobile harness, suspended from the ceiling, assists patients suffering from spinal cord injury or stroke. In a clinical study with over 30 patients, the scientists showed that the patients wearing the smart walking assist immediately improved their locomotor abilities, enabling them to perform activities of daily living that would not be possible without the support.\n31.07.17 - Scientists at the Lab of Andrea Ablasser have now discovered that a DNA-sensing mechanism of the innate immune system — which is pivotal for the immediate defense against pathogens — controls cellular senescence. The work highlights potential novel anti-tumor and perhaps anti-ageing strategies.\n23.08.17 - A researcher at the Ecological Systems Laboratory discovered a sustainable method for improving the slash-and-burn farming practices traditionally used in Madagascar, whereby a wooded area is burned to create a field for growing crops. Slash-and-burn farming also plays a role in the island’s deforestation. The environmental engineering student spent two years conducting tests in two villages in the southwest of the country. The fruit of her labors is a socially responsible and environmentally friendly system that involves generating compost and refurbishing water wells.\n04.09.17 - More than 5,000 visitors came on EPFL's campus for three days to attend the EPFL Drone Days. Drones races certainly, but research and innovation were also in the spotlight with booths presenting the drones of the future, an exhibition of robotics, conferences, demonstrations and workshops for young and old. Switzerland’s fastest drone pilot was crowned following a spectacular race.\n12.09.17 - A new drone, developed at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems with funding of NCCR Robotics, uses cutting-edge technology to deliver parcels weighing up to 500 grams. The device will never get stuck in traffic, it’s programmed to avoid obstacles, and it can reach destinations on steep or uneven terrain. Its protective cage and foldable design mean that it can be carried around in a backpack and used in total safety.\n13.09.17 - Many cancers are known to metastasize and spread by expanding nearby lymphatic vessels. This process, lymphangiogenesis, also helps the tumor evade the patient’s own immune system, and it would be expected that inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, which are only effective in a minority of patients. But scientists from EPFL and the US found the opposite: lymphangiogenesis actually enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy against melanoma. The study has significant implications for new types of cancer therapies.\n15.10.17 - The Swiss team and their solar house, the NeighborHub, has won the prestigious Solar Decathlon 2017 competition in the Unites States. The Swiss Living Challenge and its multidisciplinary team - 4 schools, 250 students (44 in Denver), 150 supervisors from the professional and academic sectors, and close to 50 sponsors - received the highest award. This unique experience is not only an important victory, but also an unforgettable and educational human adventure. The Swiss team made the audacious bet of coming up with a different concept, proposing a house at the service of a community, rather than a family home. \n17.10.17 - Given the growing number of users and the widening range of devices, streaming is no longer viable in its current form owing to the substantial amount of power and storage capacity it requires.

The patient feels pain originating from the legs, even though nothing else can be felt below the lesion. Now, virtual reality may be the key to providing pain relief for this type of pain, and the solution comes from restoring a sense of touch. In breakthrough research the scientists of the Foundation Bertarelli Chair in Cognitive Neuroprosthetics show that phantom body pain can be reduced in paraplegics by creating a bodily illusion with the help of virtual reality. \n08.11.17 - Researchers at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory have developed a miniature robot that can integrate perfectly into schools of zebrafish. It can swim with fish, learn how they communicate with each other and make them change direction or come together. Their work was carried out as part of an EU research program among six partner institutions\n.\n15.11.17 - The EPFL Extension School is offering people with no prior university degree the chance to get an EPFL qualification. The EPFL Extension School is particularly well suited to professionals looking to study in an innovative field without having to give up their day job. It offers courses on concrete topics that are directly linked to the job market. The school's first continuing education course, Applied Data Science – Machine Learning, offers students who successfully complete the course a Certificate of Open Studies, a new type of academic qualification for the moment offered only by EPFL.\n29.11.17 - Professor Xile Hu, an expert in catalysis, has been awarded the 2017 National Latsis Prize. Hu, who was born in China and came to Switzerland in 2007, founded the Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Catalysis at EPFL. He is known for his innovative approach, which consists of combining the concepts and methods associated with three different types of catalysis (homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic), which traditionally have remained separate. This approach has led to unprecedented understanding of fundamental catalysis and enabled the discovery of new catalysts with properties superior to those of previous materials.\n01.12.17 - In artificial intelligence (AI), machines carry out specific actions, observe the outcome, adapt their behavior accordingly, observe the new outcome, adapt their behavior once again, and so on, learning from this iterative process. But could this process spin out of control? Possibly. AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped. EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots. Their work makes a major contribution to the development of autonomous vehicles and drones, for example, so that they will be able to operate safely in numbers.\n12.12.17 - Thanks to a donation from the Werner Siemens-Foundation, EPFL will set up a Center for Artificial Muscles, collaborating initially with the University Hospital of Bern (Inselspital) and then with the University Hospital of Zurich. The first project, slated to span the next four years, will focus on developing a less invasive cardiac assistance system for treating heart failure. This prosthetic device – a ring around the aorta – will avoid the complications of hemorrhaging and thrombosis because it will not be in contact with blood. A facial-reconstruction project aimed at restoring patients’ ability to create facial expressions will follow.\n19.12.17 - EPFL President Martin Vetterli has unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust.

{"id": 234, "text": "Will there be lots of gadgets under the family Christmas tree this year? By the back door, robotic vacuums are bringing cyberstuff into daily life; they’re among the first autonomous devices that can be easily used by ordinary households.\nThat’s all the impetus scientists needed to seize the opportunity and do a study. Understanding to what extent robots will influence daily life in the future is in fact one of the central issues being studied in the EPFL-based National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Robotics.\n In 2011, a team from EPFL’s Pedagogical Research and Support team (CRAFT) conducted a qualitative study on household robots. Nine compositionally diverse families (young, older, with and without children) were given a machine from one of the most common brands. “We interviewed the families before they got the robot, and then we followed them for six months, starting with their first contact with the device,” explains anthropologist and study co-author Valérie Bauwens.\nRapid and irrevocable decisions\n Seven criteria of varying importance – practical, but also emotional - were developed to judge the degree to which the families adopted the robots. Put to the test and further refined by this first field study, these criteria will be useful to engineers at EPFL and elsewhere who are thinking about the domestic robots of the future.\nIn the end only three of the nine families liked the automatic vacuum cleaners. “It was interesting to observe that the decision whether or not to abandon them was made really fast, after about only two weeks,” Bauwens says. “Our robots had very little time to prove themselves!”\nAmong the elements that the users didn’t like, the researchers listed the need to modify the setup of an apartment so that the robot could do its work correctly. In addition, they didn’t like having to change certain behaviors, such as leaving things on the floor, which compromised the machine’s performance. “We even had one user who was careful to put the coffee table up on the couch to make room for the robot to work,” says second author Julia Fink.\nKids are quickly bored\n The scientists also looked at the influence that these new “companions” might have on the family ecosystem. “Overall, we didn’t see many changes,” Bauwens says. “The mother is still generally in control of household organization, even with this tool.” Two of the study subjects, however, appropriated the device, giving it a name or talking to it. The children were at first very excited by the arrival of the new toy, but the older ones quickly lost interest. “It’s just a vacuum cleaner!” said one of them.\n The first robot to get a foothold in apartments is thus a kind of guinea pig. Its successors - such as “Ranger,” a robotic box under development at EPFL that encourages kids to put away their toys by amusing interactions such as speaking and moving its eyes - can benefit from the problems it encountered. As for the robotic vacuums, resellers will certainly have a good idea by mid-January, high season for returns, whether or not their statistics confirm the result of the qualitative study.\nSwiss TV TSR1 consumers' show A Bon Entendeur will talk about vacuum robots and this EPFL research in its January 10 edition.", "summary": "Are robots welcome in our homes?
