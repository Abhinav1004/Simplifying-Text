{"id": 4, "text": "17 hours, 19 minutes – that’s the record set last year by a Ticino-based team for visiting each and every Swiss canton while travelling exclusively by public transport. The Swiss Train Challenge was launched by Swiss broadcast journalist Nicolas Rossé in 2015, who made the journey that year in 19 hours, 46 minutes. But that was before the Gotthard tunnel was open. This Friday, a team of EPFL students including two PhD researchers will aim for the record-breaking time of 16 hours, 54 minutes. And in a first, their itinerary was calculated by an algorithm rather than by hand.\nTo develop the algorithm, the students first had to download the exact locations of Switzerland’s 22,080 train stations and bus stops as well as the geographical borders of each canton and the full train timetable. They then whittled down the number of train stations to the 110 “significant” ones, i.e., with potentially useful train connections. The next step was to download lists of all trains that go through these stations and their schedules, and see what other stations they go to in order to maximize their utility. This final step is what the students set their algorithm to work on – which it did for no less than ten days before coming up with the optimal itinerary.\nThe devil is in the detail\n“The first (positive) surprise we got from the algorithm’s itinerary was the travel time: 16 hours, 54 minutes. That means we can technically beat last year’s record. Not by much, due to the previous teams’ hard work and the redundancies in the Swiss train network, but by enough,” says Emmanuel Clédat, a PhD student at EPFL’s Geodetic Engineering Laboratory. “The second surprise was how prominently Ticino – the canton in the south that borders Italy – features in the itinerary. We thought it would be the end point of our journey or a separate out-and-back side trip of its own. But instead, it’s a stop on the way to the Canton of Graubünden. That shows that Ticino lies along one of the main routes crossing the country.”\nThe team will leave from St. Maurice, in the Canton of Valais, at 5:24am and end their journey at Jakobsbad, in the Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, at 10:18pm. The itinerary takes advantage of Switzerland’s many cantonal enclaves to shorten travel distances as much as possible. However, the route is strewn with obstacles; for instance, at the Alpnachstad train station, in the Half-canton of Obwalden, the students will have zero minutes to change trains. “The previous winners had to make the journey twice to set their record. We might also have to make a few trial runs before we reach our goal,” says Dirk Lauinger, a PhD student at EPFL’s Risk Analytics and Optimization Chair.\nThe pleasure of train travel\nLauinger’s thesis is on optimizing interactions between electric vehicles and power grids, while Clédat – his roommate with whom he decided to take part in the Challenge – is studying computer-assisted vision. So neither one of them is performing research related directly to the Challenge. Rather, they are motivated by their appreciation of train travel, as are the other students who will join them in their attempt to set a new record.\nFollow the challenge live on:\n Contact:", "summary": "A team of EPFL students will take part in the Swiss Train Challenge this Friday.

{"id": 6, "text": "Building efficient homes and buildings is engrained in Switzerland’s tradition. What does the Minergie label add to this tradition?\n Today, Minergie is more than a label; it is now part of Switzerland’s building code to build energy efficient buildings. EPFL former PhD student Ruedi Kriesi, back in 1994, created the label that combines several building technologies to reduce energy consumption. Not only does a Minergie building have to consume no more than 3 liters of fuel for every square meter—which means 5 times less than a traditional construction—it must also have a controlled ventilation, selective double glazed windows, external shading and appropriate thermal insulation. Moreover, Minergie buildings are simply more comfortable to live in.\n And you are working with EPFL Middle East to bring this to the UAE?\n We have seen, through extensive computer dynamic simulations, that similar techniques work in a desert climate. The same principles that are used to reduce heating loads in Switzerland can be adapted to reduce cooling loads, all the while improving thermal comfort. Working with EPFL Middle East Dean Franco Vigliotti, who heads the project, we even hope that the future EPFL research center will include several Minergie buildings. An exchange student from Politecnico di Milano is working in our labs, using a urban simulation program developed at EPFL (CitySim) to extend the Minergie concept to encompass an entire neighborhood or research hub.\nWhat are the obstacles?\n The major obstacles will be cultural ones, not technical. In Switzerland, it took many years and careful coordination between the professional associations of the building sector and the federal and cantonal governments to make such rewarding progress. In the UAE it will surely need a top-down decision to implement such standards. Only then will the construction sector follow.\nWhy is this important for a country like the UAE?\nIt is important for the whole world. Switzerland is currently a 6.5 Kilowatt per person society (average power used per capita on a 24/7 basis). We have to reduce this to 2 Kw in the upcoming years. But the UAE is currently a 12 kW society. If we are serious about mitigating climate change, we need to transfer our knowledge about building envelops to regions that have high energy consumption or even potential high consumption, as with India and Asia.\nWhat is the next step?\nThe next step is critical. Not only are we building on what we have learned in building science over the past 30 to 40 years, we are also taking advantage of our experience in terms of policy changing. We hope, like was done in Switzerland, to build pilot and demonstration buildings where decision makers can visit and feel the difference.

These challenges are just what students from 13 universities in nine different European countries have been working on since the start of the academic year. They are members of a pioneering project called IGLUNA that is being run by the EPFL-based Swiss Space Center under the European Space Agency’s ESA_Lab pilot project.\nIn mid-January – halfway through the project – the participants met up at CERN. All 19 teams, including four from EPFL, attended. In addition to providing progress reports, they were able to fine-tune their work thanks to discussions with the other teams. Their goal is to have a seamless fit among the systems they are developing, as they work together towards a common goal: to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a habitat in the ice of the moon’s poles where astronauts could be housed for short- or long-term missions. The results of their year-long collaborative effort will be put on public display in June, in one of the cavities of the ice palace in the Petit Cervin glacier in Zermatt.\n“This initiative is very inspiring,” says Bernard Foing, the IGLUNA project supervisor. “Not only is it teaching people about space-related issues, it is also a platform for developing innovative technologies and solutions while laying the groundwork for a Europe-wide scientific collaboration. And it’s really capturing the imagination of young people.” In addition to his work on IGLUNA, Foing serves as an adviser to the ESA and is a professor at VU University in Amsterdam. \nAll aspects of human life\nCreating a long-term habitat on the moon is fraught with challenges. “That’s why this particular goal was selected,” says Tatiana Benavides, project coordinator at the Swiss Space Center. “If you want to build a livable environment – especially one that’s far from earth – you need to take into account all aspects of human life. This includes producing food, energy and oxygen, building shelter, providing tools and enabling communications.”\nAt EPFL, a PhD student in materials science is exploring the possibility of printing 3D objects – such as an ice saw – within the habitat. A team of environmental engineering students from EPFL and UNIL are putting their heads together to come up with a long-lasting and self-operating greenhouse for growing vegetables. And students from EPFL’s architecture and civil engineering program either have a hand in designing the habitat’s structure – a vault made from carefully assembled blocks – or are part of a virtual reality team whose goal is to create an interactive virtual environment with indoor surroundings.\nTeams at other universities are hard at work on their own tasks. They are developing oxygen and electricity production processes; a mechanism to grow algae; a system to use urine to fertilize plants; exercise facilities; a laboratory; a communications and control system; inflatable living modules; a robot to dig paths into the ice – and more.\n“We have architects, biologists, computer scientists, geologists and engineers from all over Europe: it’s an extraordinarily multidisciplinary and multicultural project,” adds Benavides. “With this initiative, ESA’s goal is to encourage these young people to work together even though they live in different countries and study at different schools.”", "summary": "Students from 13 European universities, including EPFL, have joined forces to design a lunar habitat as part of IGLUNA, a project sponsored by the European Space Agency (ESA) and headed by the Swiss Space Center.

{"id": 14, "text": "By 2017, quantum physics will help reduce the energy consumption of our computers and cellular phones by up to a factor of 100. For research and industry, the power consumption of transistors is a key issue. The next revolution will likely come from tunnel-FET, a technology that takes advantage of a phenomenon referred to as “quantum tunneling.” At the EPFL, but also in the laboratories of IBM Zurich and the CEA-Leti in France, research is well underway. As part of a special issue of Nature devoted to silicon, Adrian Ionescu, an EPFL researcher, has written an article on the topic.\nTransistors that exploit a quantum quirk\n Today's computers have no less than a billion transistors in the CPU alone. These small switches that turn on and off provide the famous binary instructions, the 0s and 1s that let us send emails, watch videos, move the mouse pointer… and much more. The technology used in today’s transistors is called “field effect;” whereby voltage induces an electron channel that activates the transistor. But field effect technology is approaching its limits, particularly in terms of power consumption.\n Tunnel-FET technology is based on a fundamentally different principle. In the transistor, two chambers are separated by an energy barrier. In the first, a horde of electrons awaits while the transistor is deactivated. When voltage is applied, they cross the energy barrier and move into the second chamber, activating the transistor in so doing. \n In the past, the tunnel effect was known to disrupt the operation of transistors. According to quantum theory, some electrons cross the barrier, even if they apparently don't have enough energy to do so. By reducing the width of this barrier, it becomes possible to amplify and take advantage of the quantum effect – the energy needed for the electrons to cross the barrier is drastically reduced, as is power consumption in standby mode. \nMass production is imminent\n “By replacing the principle of the conventional field effect transistor by the tunnel effect, one can reduce the voltage of transistors from 1 volt to 0.2 volts,” explains Ionescu. In practical terms, this decrease in electrical tension will reduce power consumption by up to a factor of 100. The new generation microchips will combine conventional and tunnel-FET technology. “The current prototypes by IBM and the CEA-Leti have been developed in a pre-industrial setting. We can reasonably expect to see mass production by around 2017.”\nAn essential technology for a major European project\n For Ionescu, who heads the Guardian Angels project (a project vetted for a billion Euro grant from the EU), tunnel-FET technology is without a doubt the next big technological leap in the field of microprocessors. “In the Guardian Angels project, one of our objectives is to find solutions to reduce the power consumption of processors. Tunnel-FET is the next revolution that will help us achieve this goal.” The aim: design ultra-miniaturized, zero-power electronic personal assistants. Tunnel-FET technology is one of the first major stages in the project’s roadmap.

Developed by EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory (Biorob), the “cheetah-cub robot,” a small-size quadruped prototype robot, is described in an article appearing today in the International Journal of Robotics Research. The purpose of the platform is to encourage research in biomechanics; its particularity is the design of its legs, which make it very fast and stable. Robots developed from this concept could eventually be used in search and rescue missions or for exploration.\nThis robot is the fastest in its category, namely in normalized speed for small quadruped robots under 30Kg. During tests, it demonstrated its ability to run nearly seven times its body length in one second. Although not as agile as a real cat, it still has excellent auto-stabilization characteristics when running at full speed or over a course that included disturbances such as small steps. In addition, the robot is extremely light, compact, and robust and can be easily assembled from materials that are inexpensive and readily available.\nFaithful reproduction\nThe machine’s strengths all reside in the design of its legs. The researchers developed a new model with this robot, one that is based on the meticulous observation and faithful reproduction of the feline leg. The number of segments – three on each leg – and their proportions are the same as they are on a cat.

{"id": 21, "text": "Pierre Dessemontet recently published an article in the journal Urban Studies, co-authored with Vincent Kaufmann and Christophe Jemelin, on the dynamics of the metropolis, studied from the point of view of commuter traffic flow. It is clearly the commuters, thru their journeys, who provide the most interesting data concerning towns and cities, and the suburbs. As a result of his research, the geographer describes the changes taking place and so enables us to lay the foundations of solutions in response to tomorrow’s realities.\nFirst of all, what exactly is a metropolis?\nPierre Dessemontet\n – A metropolis is the main town or city in a given geographic region which plans and manages the functioning of the economic and cultural activities of a urban area that it dominates, organizes and regulates. In Switzerland, urban geography has only recently begun to acknowledge the notion of the metropolis, with a center and interconnected suburbs. Our aim is to show the extent of the metropolis and to understand its dynamics. Thus, Geneva cannot think of itself without neighboring France, with which it makes up a single entity. In the same way, Tessin must take into account Milan, as Chiasso is only 60 kilometers away. We noticed that commuters, thru their journeys by train or car, make it possible to establish how towns and suburbs are connected. Commuters from the Nyon-Morges area, who are stuck in traffic jams or have to stand in trains, provide concrete evidence of the problem, and show that these areas are connected and can no longer be considered in isolation.\nSo the role of the urban geographer is to help re-think the metropolis?\nPierre Dessemontet \n– Our work enables us to evaluate the new dimensions of towns, to recognize their new features, and to adapt our point of view to realities which evolve much faster than the opinions we have developed about them. Switzerland is in full growth, and if we don’t manage to adapt to this evolution, we will not be able to take the necessary measures, in particular with regard to transportation. For example, between Geneva and Lausanne, we observe that the road structure is good, but that the surrounding infrastructure is inadequate. The secondary network is not sufficiently developed, as a road-user from the Morges area can testify, sometimes spending as much time in joining the highway as he will on the highway itself. To face up to this and find the appropriate responses, it is vital to realize that Switzerland is becoming more and more urban; that it is no longer an Alpine republic; and nor is it just a large region to be merged. The geographer’s mission is to highlight these developments and to propose suitable solutions.\nYou predict no fewer than 10 million inhabitants in Switzerland in 2050?\nPierre Dessemontet \n– Yes, it is highly likely, as we are already forecasting 9 million inhabitants in 2035. Our message is a growth message: “Look we are increasing in size!” The relations between towns and suburbs are intensifying; therefore let’s not wait. And let’s ensure that we don’t become like California, for example, which didn’t monitor its development and which, behind the image of Silicon Valley and idyllic beaches, hides an appalling transport network. We have noticed that the 1970s crisis has durably cooled the politicians, who are afraid go forward too much into this area. But the signs are there, and growth is a reality. We forecast an increase of 30% in traffic in the Lake Geneva region in 2030.\nIf we sum up the situation in the Lake Geneva region, it’s difficult to see what solutions can be found.\nPierre Dessemontet \n– There is no need to be fatalistic, as long as we take into account population growth and adapt to it. In this respect Zurich is a model, and recognized as the city having the best public transport system in the world. It’s possible to live in one suburb and to work in another without having to use your car. And it’s worth mentioning that the inhabitants of Zurich did not wait to be subsidized by the Confederation to improve their infrastructures. It’s a rich canton which was able to undertake the work first and then ask for the subsidies. This could be quite conceivable in the Lake Geneva area, if Geneva and Lausanne tackled this project jointly. Together, they have more or less the same population as the canton of Zurich. But it is only recently that we have begun to consider the status of Geneva and Lausanne as two bipolar centers. So the first solution that a geographer can offer is to provide the necessary explanations so that mentalities can adapt.", "summary": "The Lake Geneva region is experiencing considerable demographic and economic growth, as those who travel by car or train every day will have noticed.

{"id": 36, "text": "Nanometric-sized water drops are everywhere - in the air as droplets or aerosols, in our bodies as medication, and in the earth, within rocks and oil fields. To understand the behavior of these drops, it is necessary to know how they interact with their hydrophobic environment. This interaction takes places at the curved droplet interface, a sub-nanometric region that surrounds the small pocket of water. Researchers from EPFL, in collaboration with the institute AMOLF in the Netherlands, were able to observe what was going on in this particular region. They discovered that molecules on the surface of the drops were much more ordered than expected. Their surprising results have been published in \nNature Communications\n. They pave the way to a better understanding of atmospheric, biological and geological processes.\nUnique perspective on miniscule droplets\n At EPFL, Sylvie Roke, director of the , has developed a unique method for examining the surface of these droplets that are as thick as one thousandth of a hair, with a volume of an attoliter (18 zeros after the decimal point). \"The method involves overlapping ultrashort laser pulses in a mixture of water droplets in liquid oil and detecting photons that are scattered only from the interface\", explains Roke. \"These photons have the sum frequency of the incoming photons and are thus of a different color. With this newly generated color we can know the structure of the only the interface.\"\nHydrogen bonding as strong as in ice\n The surface of the water droplets turns out to be much more ordered than that of normal water and is comparable to super cooled (liquid < 0 °C water) water in which the water molecules have very strong hydrogen bond interactions. In ice, these interactions lead to a stable tetrahedral surrounding of each water molecule. Surprisingly, this type of structure was found on the surface of the droplets even at the room temperature - 50 °C above were it would normally appear.\nChemical processes\n This research provides valuable insight into the properties of nanometric water drops. \"The chemical properties of these drops depend on how the water molecules are organized on the surface, so it's really important to understand what's going on there,\" explained Roke. Further research could target the surface properties of water droplets by adding salt, a more realistic model of marine aerosols that consist of salty water surrounded by a hydrophobic environment.

For this, I am very grateful to my predecessor,” said Simone Amorosi right off the bat. He became deputy director of TRACE on 1 May 2015, taking over for Michaël Thémans, the driving force behind the Center since it was founded. In January 2015, Thémans was named deputy to the Vice President for Innovation and Technology Transfer, Adrienne Corboud Fumagalli, a post he has since taken up. The director of TRACE is Professor Michel Bierlaire, head of the Transport and Mobility Laboratory (TRANSP-OR).\nIn creating the Center in 2009, EPFL positioned itself to play an important role on this issue. TRACE is attached to the Vice Presidency for Innovation and Technology Transfer and serves as an interface between EPFL and the external world. It is meant to be the nexus between academic expertise and the interests of industry. More than 75 projects have been started, and they involve some forty laboratories most of which are part of the School of Engineering or the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering.\n“I started out tightening nuts at CERN”\n Transportation and mobility projects harness a wide range of expertise, from mathematical modelling to sociology, without forgetting robotics, information and communication technologies and land-use planning. The new deputy director intends to expand this range as much as possible. Mathematics have a role in transportation, but optics and acoustics do too. Simone wants to find new applications for the laboratories’ work. “Automobile manufacturers are currently working on laser headlights. This is an interesting opportunity for our optics laboratories, which is a field far removed from transportation. Materials departments also have a greater role to play.”\nSimone’s openness is a product of his prior career experience. After his initial training in materials, this native of Italy “tightened nuts on the LHC” at CERN as part of his thesis. “I learned a lot from this experience, which got me started in research and helped acquaint me with Switzerland.”\nHe earned a PhD at EPFL in laser welding and then worked in the fields of optics and solar energy, helping launch two start-ups along the way. His next foray was into the railway sector, where he worked at MATISA, a company that makes rolling stock. He found this to be a “fascinating field” combining tradition and modernity. “The rail sector is one of the keys to the future of transportation, where it has a fundamental role to play.” Looking beyond simplistic and expensive solutions based on further expanding infrastructures, Simone prefers to optimise what currently exists through modelling.\nA role in decision making\n TRACE’s mission is also to find industrial and public partners to finance research projects. In the same multidisciplinary spirit, Simone seeks an ongoing interaction with companies at several levels. He has in mind both long-term framework contracts and assignments lasting only several months. Railways, automobiles, the sociology of mobility, aeronautics: he clearly aims to branch out into other fields of work and enter into more collaborative arrangements.\nTopping things off, the new deputy director feels that TRACE should play a greater role on the advisory boards of major public and private institutions, as is the case already with the Swiss Federal Railways. “It’s an opportunity to provide input and to influence decisions before they are taken. This is particularly important given the fact that decisions in the area of transportation are implemented over the very long term. This will allow us to involve our laboratories and to expand our collaborative undertakings. It’s a virtuous circle.”", "summary": "In the five years since its founding, EPFL’s Transportation Center (TRACE) has already begun more than 75 research projects with partners in the public and private sectors.

Previously, there could be 30 to 50 students in the same classroom, with only a few assistants to help them with the exercises. This meant that anyone who was having difficulty would sometimes have to wait a long time before being able to put his or her questions. “The outcome of the evaluations we performed shows that the students are very satisfied with the format of this tutoring”, explains Nadine Stainier of CRAFT. In 2010, 11 teaching programs used this approach, and no fewer than 1250 students benefited from the support of the pool of 220 tutors. The medium-term objective of CRAFT will be to allow each student to follow at least one course of analysis or physics in this format, whatever section he or she is in.\nThe Vice-Presidency for Academic Affairs at EPFL, responsible for training, has decided to support the concept of tutoring, and to double the budget in 2011. This is because it sees the potential of offering first-year students a high-quality learning framework that also emphasizes the human and relational aspects. The students thus acquire the necessary methodology to manage to complete the exercises in analysis and physics, while at the same time successfully integrating within the campus, where they will need to find their feet and develop new relationships. They will also benefit from the group dynamics: “We’ve even noticed that some groups have continued to work together outside the tutoring program, in disciplines other than analysis and physics”, points out Jean-Louis Ricci, also of CRAFT.\n Participation in the exercise sessions remains high throughout the term, and the students appreciate the possibility of sharing and pooling problems to be solved. This enables them to better understand the problems and assimilate them. “If you have understood a problem and then you explain it to others, you understand it even better!” remarks one of them. Both the more advanced student, and the one who doesn’t feel so comfortable, thus find their feet.

{"id": 68, "text": "All rooftop solar panels look pretty much the same from the outside: same size, same thickness and even the same installation system. But on the inside, the solar panels developed by EPFL spin-off Insolight stand apart. They deliver yields of 29% – nearly twice as much as the others currently on the market (which have yields of 17–19% ). Insolight’s panels, which were recently tested by an independent lab, use a patented optical system that concentrates sunlight on a kind of miniature photovoltaic cell normally used in satellites\nBoosting efficiency while keeping a lid on costs \nStudies have shown that the average yield on commercial solar panels has increased by just 3.5 percentage points since the 2000s and seemed to be reaching a plateau. But Insolight’s three founders – Mathieu Ackermann, Laurent Coulot and Florian Gerlich – wanted to push yields further and decided to try \nsomething radically different: build residential solar panels that employ the same kinds of cells used in satellites, which are very efficient but also very expensive. To keep costs down for the retail market, they developed a protective glass on which optical lenses can be placed that concentrate sunlight by some 100x and direct it to the tiny surface of the high-performance cells. That means the cells need to take up less than 0.5% of the solar panel surface. The founders also designed a mechanism that can move the cells horizontally by a few millimeters each way in order to follow sunlight throughout the day.\nBecause the cells occupy just a tiny fraction of the solar panel surface, Insolight’s system can even be installed on top of conventional solar panels to boost their yields. “This hybrid approach is particularly effective when it’s cloudy and the sunlight is less concentrated, since it can keep generating power even under diffuse light rays,” says Ackermann, Insolight’s CTO.\nThe ultra-thin system has the same look and shape as regular rooftop panels and can be installed in the same way. “The real challenge for the retail market is to increase yields without pushing costs too high, while keeping the equipment both robust and easy to install,” says Coulot, the firm’s CEO.\nInsolight’s technology first set a record in lab tests two years ago, when it achieved a yield of 36%. The system has since been standardized for mass production with a 29% yield – far ahead of competitors’ 17–19% yield – as confirmed in tests by the Institute of Solar Energy at the Technical University of Madrid (IES-UPM).\nThe system was also tested for a full year on rooftops at an EPFL pilot site. “Our panels were hooked up to the grid and monitored continually. They kept working without a hitch through heat waves, storms and winter weather,” says Ackermann proudly.\nCutting energy bills by 30%\nAccording to the founders, Insolight’s solar panels offer a better return on investment than competing solutions. “Our technology can cut household energy bills by up to 30% in sunny regions,” says Coulot. This calculation – performed according to standard industry practice – factors in the panels’ cost, useful life and yield, as well as local power costs, weather conditions, borrowing costs, and maintenance and cleaning costs.\nThe firm’s three founders met at EPFL and established their company at the school’s Innovation Park. Today they are in talks with several solar panel manufacturers to license their technology. “Making our panels entails a few additional steps during the assembly stage. These steps could be tacked on to the end of standard production processes,” says Coulot.

It affects our everyday lives, and is a fundamental part of our existence on the planet. An asteroid might have wiped out the dinosaurs, the Earth’s crust continues to fracture via tectonic plates, and glaciers are also breaking apart,” says Sarah Lévy, who has just defended her PhD thesis on the phenomenon and is particularly interested in how cracks propagate. “In dynamics, there are two main kinds of fragmentation: those caused by impacts – a car crashes, you fall down the stairs and break your arm; and those caused by explosions – like what happened with the Quantas A380 when some sections of the turbine disk detached. I’m interested in this latter case.”\nHow do materials react in a blast and to what extent will they deform before they ultimately break? These are critical issues to consider when building a nuclear reactor or a pipeline. To answer these questions, Lévy, who has been working for three years in EPFL’s Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory , has harnessed the power of the school’s most powerful supercomputers, such as the IBM Blue Gene and the Pleiade cluster. “Thanks to this number-crunching power, we can go much farther than we could with the standard analytical model that was developed about 30 years ago.\n It predicted that all the pieces would be the same size, which is incorrect.” Many other parameters have been added to the model, such as elastic wave interactions and defects in the microstructure, which make the calculations even more complicated. “I kept several computers at work simultaneously, doing calculations in parallel,” she admits.\nBut this kind of number-crunching is necessary in order to accurately reproduce the microfractures of a material in three dimensions. LSMS is the first laboratory to obtain convergent results (in other words, results that are independent of the level of precision of the calculations) in three dimensions. “The numerical model allows us to visualize the fragments - their shape, size, and weight – and to understand the physics that is taking place.” Lévy’s work will stop there, because she is leaving for a job in Paris at Electricité de France (EDF).

{"id": 74, "text": "It was an unforgettable sight, when in summer of 2011 the two Russian submersibles MIR 1 and MIR 2 embarked on their first dive into the depths of Lake Geneva. The submersibles were part of elemo, an international effort to study the dynamics and the health of Europe’s largest alpine lake, which is under constant pressure from over one million residents living nearby. Ever since the three-month field campaign came to an end, scientists have been working in the lab to analyze the collected data and samples, generating a bounty of results. A selection of eight research articles reporting the results from the campaign has now been compiled into a special issue of the journal Aquatic Sciences, published June 2014. This extraordinary research campaign was made possible thanks to the support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals, and the Honorary Consulate of the Russian Federation through the FEEL Foundation.\nThe eight articles cover two main themes: gaining a better understanding of the lake’s geology, and evaluating the impact of pollutants on water quality. Among other topics, dives carried out close to the mouth of the Rhône River near Villeneuve focused on the formation and evolution of the spectacular underwater canyons formed by the river. And near the outlet of the wastewater treatment plant of the City of Lausanne, researchers used the submersibles to gain insight into the presence and persistence of micro-pollutants and their spreading within the lake.\nCanyons and contamination\nThe submersibles gave some of the research teams a unique opportunity to probe Lake Geneva’s underwater canyons, providing new insight into how they built up and are destabilized through the deposition and erosion of sediments from the Rhône River. Working on a sediment core extracted from the river delta, another group of researchers developed a novel approach to assess the impact of agricultural pollutants on the health of the lake ecosystem, which involves studying the diversity bacterial populations trapped in the sediment.\nOff the shore of Lausanne, the submersibles helped demonstrate that micro-pollutants – invisibly small compounds mainly from medical and cosmetic products that enter the lake with treated wastewater from the City of Lausanne – could be traced within an area of at least one square kilometer, reaching deep into the lake, and sometimes spreading in the direction of the drinking water intake for St. Sulpice. In a parallel study in the same area, another group of researchers established a link between certain types of bacteria and the transport and deposition of trace metals in sediments.\nA once in a lifetime opportunity\nThe special issue of Aquatic Sciences recognizes the importance of the elemo field campaign, which has already led to a total of fourteen research papers and is likely to give rise to many more. “It was a once in a lifetime opportunity for us all to use manned submersibles to study the lake in our backyard,” says Alfred Wüest, the director of EPFL’s Margareta Kamprad Chair for Lake Science.

{"id": 77, "text": "A luminous flux equivalent to 20,000 suns? The energy received over the course of one day in the desert? The exhaust of a rocket engine? The luminous intensity that occurs in space, close to the sun? An EPFL laboratory has managed to replicate the heat and light of the sun’s radiation with unparalleled precision and power. This system can be used to test solar power equipment and analyze materials in extreme temperature and heat conditions, providing a full picture in just a few hours without the vagaries of the weather. Detailed information on the system is contained in an article appearing today in Optics Express.\nThe intensity of 21,700 suns\nThe system, which was developed in collaboration with the Australian National University and the company Kinoton Digital Solutions, was designed to produce the most intense light possible that can be adjusted precisely and does not create unnecessary heat, as that could damage the materials being tested. To achieve this, 18 light sources are placed in two concentric circles around a virtual half-sphere nearly two meters in diameter. Each of these lamps consists of a reflector – a sort of cup-shaped mirror – that is lit by a Xenon bulb. The light waves given off in all directions by the bulb are thus reflected and focused on a specific point. At the spot where the light beams from the different lamps meet, the maximum intensity reaches 21,700 suns (21.7 MW m\n-2\n). This is the spot where materials and devices can be tested.\nThis system, which fills an entire room at the Laboratory of Renewable Energy Science and Engineering (LRESE), can be used to run many types of tests under stable and controlled experimental conditions. The research group headed by Sophia Haussener uses it mainly for the group’s work on new processes for converting and storing solar energy. For example, they test heat transfer between various materials, which could improve the output from commercial concentrating solar power plants (the tower or cylindro-parabolic forms, both of which are in fast-growing use in the United States and Spain) or demonstrate the viability of new approaches to harnessing, transferring and converting light energy. Other collaborative efforts are under way as well, such as for characterizing space materials.\nA versatile current that changes everything\nThe system’s unprecedented performance was achieved thanks in large part to a new type of reflector, which is produced through electroforming. “This is a method for the electrolytic deposition of metal, and it can replicate a model with unparalleled exactness,” said Gaël Levêque, a scientist at LRESE. “The precision of reflection is much better.”\nThere are more modules than in existing solar simulators and the current can be adjusted, which means the amount of power can be precisely controlled. The current provided to the lamps can be dialed anywhere from 70% to 120% of the 90 injected amps: this makes it possible to control the amount of luminous power delivered. For a given level of power or flux, the researcher has several choices: “To get 5.4 KW in power, for example, we can use six lamps – in other words just the first circle of lamps – at 120%, or nine lamps at 70%,” said Levêque. Using fewer lamps “closes” the angle of incidence of the radiation, which means that the total light beam is narrower and more powerful. Increasing the number of lamps, on the other hand, means the light beam will be wider and less concentrated, which is practical for lighting a surface more uniformly.\nA twin in Australia and an open-source method\nThis system has a twin in Canberra, Australia, which was built at the same time as EPFL’s. But it’s more than just a system, in fact: it’s an open-source method that the researchers developed in collaboration with their colleagues at the Australian National University and the company Kinoton Digital Solutions GmbH. Other systems can thus be built on the basis of these calculations, using more or fewer lamps and different dimensions. Stronger radiative fluxes could also be achieved by using more powerful lamps or adjusting several other parameters.", "summary": "Eighteen light sources arranged in a half-sphere can mimic the equivalent of several thousand times the sun’s radiation received on earth, with unparalleled power and precision.

That’s the challenge that 15 students took on for a semester as part of the first-ever China Hardware Innovation Camp (CHIC), which was organized by EPFL’s College of Humanities together with Swissnex China.\nCHIC participants worked on interdisciplinary teams made up of students from EPFL, ECAL and HEC Lausanne. “The goal,” said Marc Laperrouza, head of the program, “was to encourage learning through experimentation, from the core idea in Switzerland through to completion of the project in China where the students spent 12 days this past summer.”\nA smart baby bottle\nThe three prototypes that came out of CHIC have just been unveiled. Clearly the most surprising one, looking like a polished product, was Fimi, the smart baby bottle. It has a base equipped with sensors to measure the milk’s temperature and provide statistics on the baby’s consumption. Bullseye, it would seem: “We hadn’t expected to end up with a marketable result, but we are already in talks with financial partners to see where we can go with this,” said Florian Maushart, an EPFL student and co-designer of this futuristic baby bottle.\nAnother project is Dory, a water analysis kit dressed up as a game console. It is meant to make science fun, encouraging children to find the coldest spot in a stream, for example. Then there is Vesta, a clever prototype designed to put older people back in touch with the younger generation by virtue of a simplified tablet. It’s like a device for virtual postcards: with one click it can receive photos and messages sent by a smartphone.\nIn view of the success of this year’s inaugural event, the CHIC organizers want to encourage students interested in joining the 2015-2016 group to develop their ideas without using open-source hardware and software, so that their inventions can be patent-protected.\nRegistration for the 2015-2016 China Hardware Innovation Camp is open until 10 October.

These are high hopes, but she is taking concrete steps to get there. Through her Master’s project, she is developing ways to not only recycle a wider variety of plastic, but also use recycled plastic in 3D printers to make inexpensive prosthetics for Colombia war victims. Her research is being carried out jointly by EPFL’s Laboratory for Processing of Advanced Composites and Universidad de los Andes in Colombia.\n© 2019 EPFL Alain Herzog / reuse plastics from our trash cans\nCurrently PET is the only kind of household plastic that is recycled in Switzerland, but it is actually just one of seven varieties. “What I found really interesting in this project was being able to test several different types of plastic and study each one’s behavior. I initially chose five but ended up working with only three. Unfortunately my time was limited, otherwise I would’ve tested them all!” says Jaquier. She dug through garbage bins on the EPFL campus and collected various types of everyday plastic waste – empty water bottles, bottle caps, cafe latte cups, yogurt containers, milk bottles and cling wrap, for example – which she then used to make plastic threads that could be fed into a 3D printer. She made threads of polypropylene, polystyrene and high- and low-density polyethylene, a task that required delving into a new field. “I have a background in mechanical engineering, so designing prosthetics wasn’t really a problem. What was hard was the materials-science aspect of the project. I took some classes but also learned a lot as I went along,” she says.\n© 2019 EPFL Alain Herzog / The melting temperature changes according to the plastics\nOne of the materials-science challenges she faced was juggling the plastics’ different melting points: 260°C for PET but just 130°C for the polyethylene used in bottle caps, for instance. “The plastics should be kept separate, especially if we want to recycle them several times – which would make sense if our goal is to reduce waste. We also need to make sure that the plastics don’t break down after being melted several times,” says Jaquier. Another factor to keep an eye on is the threads’ diameter. “The ideal diameter for a 3D printer is 1.75 mm, but the actual diameter can vary depending on how the thread has been pulled.” And of course, enough used plastic must be collected to create the right amount thread. “Even with 140 bottle caps, I only had enough material to fill a quarter of the spool.”\nTwo weeks in Colombia\nThanks to the collaboration with the\n, the support of the the work with the \nand the contacts made with \n, by Felipe Betancur, Jaquier was able to spend a couple of weeks doing field research in Colombia.

The company, which specializes in rapid allergy testing, brought in a total of 11.3 million francs in earlier funding rounds. It will use this latest cash injection to run a clinical study on diagnosing sepsis, a dangerous form of bacterial infection in humans.\nAbionic's biomedical diagnostic platform, based on microfluidics, delivers test results using a single drop of blood in a matter of minutes, while existing methods require several hours. The startup was created in 2010 and now operates out of the Biopôle complex in Lausanne. It already sells a device to test several respiratory allergies and an iron-deficiency test.\nDetecting septicemia in five minutes\nThe fresh money will mainly be used to launch a clinical study in April for the company’s sepsis test, which delivers preliminary results in a mere five minutes. “It’s the fastest in the world,” says Nicolas Durand, Abionic’s CEO and cofounder. Every year, hospital emergency rooms in Switzerland handle several hundred cases of septicemia, which proves fatal for around 15% of these patients. The new device will be tested on more than 300 patients in 14 intensive-care units in Switzerland, Italy, France and the UK.

{"id": 94, "text": "Amélie, Elvira, Léonie and Nicolas, four students passionate about neuroscience, recently returned from a one-year stay in Boston, where they completed their masters projects at Harvard Medical School. Their work was sponsored by the Bertarelli Foundation, whose goal is to advance neuroscience by combining the skills of engineers and medical experts. Most of these young travelers are now doctoral assistants. They tell us about their experiences in America.\nImproving auditory implants with lasers \nAmélie Guex\nAge:\n 25 years old\nPerformed her research at:\n Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Department of Otology and Laryngology\nMaster title:\n \"Characterization of the Auditory System Responses to Infrared Neural Stimulation of the Cochlear Nucleus\"\n Some laboratories headed by doctors or surgeons are set directly within hospitals. I worked in such a lab during my stay. It was part of a group of labs called the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories. I found it very motivating every day to come across patients who are likely to benefit from our technology.\n As for the campus itself it was quite impressive, especially with all these red brick buildings. When I first saw it, I felt as if I were in a film.\nWhat did you work on?\n The lab in which I studied focuses on Implants for people who had their auditory nerve cut following the removal of a tumor, for example. The function of these implants - or small electrodes - is to stimulate the patients' brain stem, with the aim of helping them to recapture an auditory sensation. My mission consisted of testing an alternative method based on lasers. We wanted to see if optically-based methods could stimulate neurons more selectively than electrodes. I take a particular interest in neuroprosthetics and I greatly appreciated this research.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n The cosmopolitan city of Boston does not seem to be representative of the so-called \"American culture\". Some aspects of their lifestyle were surprising, though. Everybody follows the rhythm of huge events such as Halloween, Thanksgiving or the Superbowl. Also, some students in Boston participate in real Quidditch championnships which made us laugh (quidditch - fictional sport from the Harry Potter series). The team players run sideways with a broomstick between their legs and pass the ball. The Golden Snitch is personified by a guy wearing a yellow outfit, who holds a tennis ball. He has to hide most of the time.\nDid this exchange open doors for you?\n Yes, I'm now working on another project financially supported by the Bertarelli program. I've just started a thesis at the Laboratory for Soft Bioelectronic Interfaces (LSBI), headed by Stéphanie Lacour. We are exploring the possibility of developing flexible electrodes that can adapt more easily to the brain stem.\n----\n What happens in our brain while we are under a general anesthetic?\nElvira Pirondini\nAge:\n 25 years old\nPerformed her research at:\n Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care\nMaster title:\n \"Sparse Priors and Empirically-Tailored Basis Sets For EEG Source Localization, Applied to Cross-Frequency Coupling under General Anesthesia\"\n This is a great place. My supervisor - the Professor Emery Brown - was affiliated both to MIT and Harvard. I could therefore attend lots of talks and conferences in the two universities. In this respect, possibilities were more diversified than at EPFL. As for the quality of research and teaching, the level was quite similar, in my opinion.\nWhat did you work on?\n I was part of the team of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory that seeks to find out what is happening in the brain when patients are undergoing a general anesthetic. This question has not been answered yet. The group is formed by 50-60 people. They use several statistical methods and non-invasive techniques such as electroencephalography to unravel this mystery. The method consists of developing algorithms and models in order to depict brain activity. Personally, I was supposed to improve one of the existing algorithms that had been previously developed, following the brain observation of 10 patients under general anesthetic. My role was to speed up its computation to provide surgeons with a real-time estimation of the state of an anesthesia during surgery.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n In general, American people are very nice. I was surprised by the way television is omnipresent in their lives. A lot of discussions center around TV series. As for the education policy, I have the impression that people from Harvard are extremely specialized in their field, but if they wander away from their research, they have little knowledge. The situation is not similar at EPFL, a place where scientists seem more versatile.\nDid this exchange open doors for you?\n Yes. While participating at the Bertarelli Symposium in Boston, I got to know Sylvestro Micera, head of the Translational Neural Engineering Lab (TNE) at EPFL. Thanks to this encounter, I have now been able to start a thesis in this lab. My mission consists of observing the activity in the brain of stroke patients while they do exercises with the help of a robot.\n At the end of the exchange, Emery Brown had suggested that I perform my thesis in Boston. However, I preferred to come back to EPFL. The quality of the research is equally high and I can be closer to my family, who live in Italy.\n----\nA detection of motor disorders in patients with Parkinson disease\nLéonie Asboth:\nAge: \n23 years old\nPerformed her research at:\n Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Department of Neurology\nMaster title:\n \"Quantification of fine movement disorders in Parkinson's disease using a digitized tablet: turning experimental findings into a clinically simple diagnostic tool\"\nWhat is special about Harvard?\n Over the years, Harvard has progressively stretched to different places in Boston. Each space is devoted to a specific function. Built in a New-England style architecture, the \"Harvard yard\", for example, groups several dormitories and study areas for freshmen.\n Hospitals affiliated to the Harvard Medical School as well as centers for medical research are located on the other side of the river, which is on the Boston side. This environment encourages translational research: the transfer of findings from Basic science to clinical test, as well as human care is facilitated.\n As for education, I had the opportunity to attend a few lectures that were very proactive. Students kept trying debating different issues with professors.\nWhat did you work on?\n In the Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation of Boston, I was in charge of the development of a digitized tablet aimed at quantifying fine movement disorders related to Parkinson disease. We got the opportunity to test our technology with 20 people at different stages of the disease. Patients were asked to reproduce some pattern on the tablet, which recorded each tremor. We then proceeded to a kinematic and frequency movement-analysis. The results revealed some motor disorders that were invisible to the naked eye. We could objectively quantify inferred movements. This work was very simulating, because we developed a cheap and useful finished product that doctors could use every day. Moreover, this tool could prove useful to reduce the subjective aspects of neurological tests.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n I was astonished to see how easily Harvard students were able to put their innovative ideas into practice before the end of their studies. The launch of a startup is highly encouraged by professors. Harvard cultivates an entrepreneurial spirit among students from the very beginning of their studies. This is a major asset of American culture.\n I was also surprised to see how extravagant Americans could be. While we were in Boston, they organized a contest where people were asked to swallow as many donuts as they could, before running a distance of 5 miles in less than an hour. We have also seen MIT students dressed as Star wars characters and performing \"light saber\" combats.\nDid the exchange open doors for you?\n Yes. I have discovered the lab in which I'm working right now through the Bertarelli program. It is called the IRP Chair in Spinal Cord Repair, headed by Grégoire Courtine. My thesis focuses on optogenetics, a method which consists of activating neuronal networks with light after genetically modifying the neurons. We want to understand the regeneration mechanism of the corticospinal projections in patients with spinal cord injury. The ultimate goal is to restore the ability to walk for paralyzed people.\n----\nIs rehabilitation through robotics efficient for everybody?\nNicolas Beuchat\nAge:\n 23 years old\nPerformed his research at:\n Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\nMaster title:\n \"Estimating Motor Adaptation Dynamics from the Force-Field Adaptation Paradigm using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm\"\nWhat is special about Harvard?\n This University is very lively and there is always something going on. Harvard is located next to the MIT and both universities are full of famous professors. Talks and conferences are numerous, as are research areas.\n Moreover, as Leonie previously mentioned, Americans are more adventurous than we are, when it comes to the creation of a company. Failure is not stigmatized and more accepted than it would be in Switzerland.\nWhat did you work on?\n I was part of the Motion Analysis Laboratory which deals with rehabilitation through robotics with the help of exoskeletons, for example. Currently, the problem lies in the fact that robotic neurorehabilitation shows a large variability in its outcome in stroke patients. Some of them show very promising improvements in their motor skills whereas others show no improvement at all. In order to overcome this problem, I worked on a robotic platform devoted to predict which patient would respond positively to that kind of treatment. The tool took the shape of a lever that had to be pushed straightforward while a side force was applied. 14 patients were tested during my stay. I developed an algorithm to analyze the data collected by another laboratory. The aim was to assess patient motor learning and adaptation capabilities.\nWhat did you think of American culture? Were you surprised?\n In Switzerland, we hear plenty of prejudices about Americans and they do not apply to Boston. People are very much into sport in general, and during competitions, the show takes place both on the field and among the supporters, who often wear crazy outfits. During the basketball championship called March madness, my coworkers and I participated in a contest that consisted of predicting the result of every game during the championship. Of course, we didn't win.\nDid the exchange open doors for you?\n As a first step Yes. When I returned to EPFL I worked for a few months in José Millán's laboratory: the Chair in Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface (CNBI). Then I decided to take some time off, and to go travelling in South America. Argentina will be my first destination.\n----\nAdditional information:\n-\n- /  /", "summary": "Four students from EPFL completed their masters projects in Harvard Medical School labs thanks to the sponsorship of the Bertarelli Foundation.

{"id": 96, "text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, produces hundreds of millions of proton collisions per second. But researchers working on the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment, which involves physicists from EPFL, can only record 2,000 of those collisions, using one of the detectors installed on the accelerator. So in the end, this technological marvel leaves the physicists wanting more. They are convinced that the vast volume of uncaptured data holds the answers to several unresolved questions.\nIn elementary particle physics, the Standard Model – the theory that best describes phenomena in this field – has been well and truly tried and tested, yet the researchers know that the puzzle is not complete. That’s why they are looking for phenomena that are not accounted for by the Standard Model. This quest for \"new physics\" could explain the disappearance of antimatter after the Big Bang and the nature of the dark matter that, although it represents around 30% of the universe, can only be detected by astronomical measurements at this point.\n“To extract more information from the LHC data, we need new technologies for our LHCb detector,” says Aurelio Bay from EPFL’s Laboratory for High Energy Physics. EPFL has teamed up with several research institutes to develop the new equipment that will upgrade the experiment in 2020.\nUsing scintillating fiber to detect particles\nAfter five years of work, EPFL’s physicists, together with some 800 international researchers involved in the LHCb project, have just taken an important preliminary step towards significantly enhancing their experimental equipment. They have decided to build a new detector – a scintillating fiber tracker dubbed SciFi.\nConstruction of the tracker, which incorporates 10,000 kilometers of scintillating fibers each with a diameter of 0.25mm, has already begun. When particles travel through them, the fibers will give off light signals that will be picked up by light-amplifying diodes. The scintillating fibers will be arranged in three panels measuring five by six meters, installed behind a magnet, where the particles exit the LHC accelerator collision point. The particles will pass through several of these fiber 'mats' and deposit part of their energy along the way, producing some photons of light that will then be turned into an electric signal.\n Data on how the particles traverse the fibers will be enough to reconstruct their trajectory. The physicists will then use this information to restore their primitive physical state. “What we will essentially be doing is tracing these particles’ journey back to their starting point. This should give us some insight into what happened 14 billion years ago, before antimatter disappeared, leaving us with the matter we have today,” says Bay.\nHuge data flows\nSciFi is a key component for acquiring data at the highest speed, as it includes filters that are designed to preserve only useful data. In an ideal world, the physicists would collect and analyze all of the data without needing to use too many filters. But that would involve a massive amount of data.\n“We may already be at the limit, because we of course have to save the data somewhere. First we use magnetic storage and then we distribute the data on the LHC GRID, which includes machines in Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, at CERN, and in France and the UK. Many countries are taking part, and numerous studies on this data are being run simultaneously,” adds Bay. He points to his computer screen: red is used to denote programs that are not working well or those that have been trying for several days to be included among the priorities.\nBay neatly puts this initiative into a physicist’s perspective: “If the LHC doesn’t have enough energy to uncover new physics, it’s all over for my generation of physicists! We will have to come up with a new machine, for the next generation.\"\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press\n +41 79 502 81 06\nAurelio Bay\n High Energy Physics Laboratory 1\n +41 21 693 04 74\nOlivier Schneider\n High Energy Physics Laboratory 2\n +41 21 693 05 07\nTatsuya Nakada \nHigh Energy Physics Laboratory 3\n +41 21 693 04 75", "summary": "EPFL’s physicists are moving forward in their efforts to solve the mysteries of the universe.

{"id": 100, "text": "You’ve probably noticed over the past two months how hard it is to speak with people when half their face is hidden. You can’t hear them very well or make out their facial expressions. And for some segments of the population – like children, the elderly and the hearing impaired – the masks are a major obstacle to communication. That’s why a team of researchers from EPFL’s EssentialTech Center and Empa (the Swiss federal materials-science center) has been working for the past two years on a completely transparent surgical mask. They have now finalized a biomass-based material to fabricate the masks and have created a startup called HMCARE to market them. After completing a CHF 1 million fundraising round, the company is now ready to develop the industrial process. Discussions are under way for a planned market launch in early 2021.\nTransparent, resistant and eco-friendly, with just the right level of porosity \nCalled HelloMasks, the transparent masks are intended to replace the tri-fold green or white ones that healthcare workers usually wear (and that have been polluting our sidewalks since the start of the pandemic). This protection could be worn by anyone, although they’re designed primarily to make the contact between caregivers and patients less impersonal. The idea came when Klaus Schönenberger, the head of EPFL’s EssentialTech Center – whose mission is to help transfer modern technology to developing countries – was working in western Africa during the 2015 Ebola outbreak. “It was touching to see that nurses – covered from head to toe in protective gear – pinned photos of themselves on their chests so that patients could see their faces,” he says. The following year, Schönenberger was approached by Thierry Pelet, now the CEO of the start-up, and Sacha Sidjanski, a project manager at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences, with an initial design for a transparent mask. Recalling his experience in Africa, Schönenberger didn’t hesitate for a second. Pelet and Sidjanski were inspired by Diane Baatard, a former storyteller at the Geneva University Hospitals, who found it unfortunate that the seriously ill children she entertained couldn’t see her facial expressions as she spoke.\n“Looking online you can find prototypes of masks that are partly transparent, but they’re just normal masks with some of the fabric replaced by clear plastic,” says Pelet. Since that plastic isn’t porous, however, it makes it hard for the wearer to breathe and fogs up easily. The EPFL and Empa researchers spent two years finding the right combination of transparency, resistance and porosity. They eventually came up with a membrane made from a polymer developed specifically for this application. The polymer fibers are just 100 nm apart, which is the same spacing used in conventional masks – small enough to filter out viruses and bacteria but large enough to let air through.\nBecause the new masks will be disposable for optimal efficacy, like existing surgical masks, the researchers focused from the start on finding a material that was either recyclable or biodegradable. “Our material is made at 99% from a biomass derivative, and we’ll keep working on them until they’re completely eco-friendly,” says Pelet.\nProduction facilities probably in Switzerland \nThe material is made using a common method called electrospinning, where an electric force is used to draw polymer fibers. However, the researchers adapted the method slightly for large-scale production. The material will be generated in spools from which individual masks can be cut and assembled. While the research team initially planned to fabricate their masks in Asia, they’re now considering keeping production local, here in Switzerland. A number of companies – including HMCARE – are planning to build surgical-mask plants in the country to meet the surging demand caused by the pandemic. Pelet is in talks with several other businesses and public-sector organizations.\nFundraising a snap\nThe surging demand also made fundraising a lot easier for the startup. “We could’ve raised more than CHF 1 million, but we don’t need the extra money right now so we turned it down,” says Pelet. The research on HelloMasks was initially funded by close to a dozen non-profit organizations and later by an Innosuisse grant. While the masks will first be sold to the medical community – dentists have also expressed an interest – they may eventually be marketed to the general public. The product launch could take place in early 2021.", "summary": "EPFL’s EssentialTech Center, working with Empa, has developed a fully transparent surgical mask that will soon be produced on an industrial scale.

At the final stage of EPFL’s “My Thesis in 180 Seconds” competition held this evening, the oratorical talents of 14 PhD students managed to turn sober topics into captivating listening for a non-specialist audience. In other words, a fun way for some 600 spectators to expand their knowledge.\nThree minutes and not one second more. According to the rules governing this competition, the students have 180 seconds to talk about their research to a decidedly diverse crowd. The criteria were numerous and specific – e.g., elocution, rhythm, fluidity, gestures, clarity, contextualization and use of metaphors – and the bar was high.\nHumor and analogies to present the mechanisms of the cellular division in 3 minutes\nFirst prize was won by Alessandro de Simone, a PhD candidate in Pierre Gönczy’s laboratory. His presentation on DNA organizers in stem cells – which he compared to waiters in a restaurant – was delivered with abundant poise and humor. It won over both the jury and the crowd, as he also shared the audience award with Justine Gay-Des-Combes.\nThe similarities found by Elise Berodier between flowers and building materials earned her second place. Felix Bobbink won third place after using the image of Legos to help the audience understand his work on catalysts for converting CO2. The three winners took home prizes of 1,000, 700 and 400 francs, given by Cisco, along with the chance to participate in the first Swiss finals planned for next spring under the aegis of the Conference of Western Switzerland’s Universities (CUSO). The audience awards handed out at each of the three qualifying rounds went to Elise Berodier, Justine Gay-des-Combes and Rosamaria Cannavo.\nTraining in public speaking\n This edition was the competition’s debut in Switzerland and it was a definite success, as 34 PhD candidates squared off in three qualifying rounds that took place in September. In order to prepare most effectively, the students took part in public-speaking training that same month. The training, which took place over the course of several days and was delivered by two media professionals in cooperation with the Staff Training Service, emphasized practice. Each participant went in front of the camera several times and received constructive criticism from the trainers and their peers. According to the students’ feedback, the training in itself was a real boon for their future career.\nThis competition was created in Australia several years ago and then run in French in a slightly different form in Quebec.

{"id": 110, "text": "The time has come. The \nAkademik Treshnikov\n will leave the port of Cape Town, South Africa today on the three-month Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). The imposing Russian research ship will carry over 120 people: some 60 researchers from 30 different countries and about the same number of crew members. In addition to circumnavigating Antarctica, they will visit around twelve subantarctic islands.\nThis is the first project put together by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI). It was Frederik Paulsen, a businessman and major philanthropist, who came up with the idea. He is also providing the ACE expedition with logistical backing, drawing on his extensive experience in Arctic exploration. Additional support is being provided by Presence Switzerland, a unit of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.\nThe idea behind the ACE expedition is to measure and quantify the impact of environmental changes and pollution in the Southern Ocean. This region plays a key role in climate regulation: currents of icy water deep in the ocean travel from the poles toward the equator, while warm water and air move across the ocean’s surface towards the cold regions. The earth’s climate can thus be compared to a huge heat engine. This process of heat transfer between polar and tropical regions is also an important component of the carbon cycle and a key factor in the oceans' ability to store CO\n2\n.\n“The poles are essential for climate balance, but they are also the regions where changes are most apparent: that’s where the largest temperature differences have been recorded,” said Philippe Gillet, vice president of EPFL, director ad interim of the SPI and a specialist in Earth and planetary science.\nFrom plankton to microplastics \nTwenty-two research projects will be run during this trip by teams from Switzerland, the UK, France and Australia, to name a few. The projects were selected by a panel of international experts following a call for proposals organized jointly by the polar institutes of eight countries: South Africa, France, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Norway, Russia and Switzerland.\nThe projects cover a wide range of fields, including glaciology, climatology, biology and oceanography. The topics of study include wave formation, geographical variations in plankton populations, chemical exchanges between air and water, biodiversity on the islands, the ocean’s CO\n2\n storage capacity, microplastic pollution and its impact on fauna, and an acoustic analysis of whale populations. This expedition will also build bridges between the various scientific fields. Not only will the researchers collaborate in their on-ship research, but they will build relationships that will set the stage for future collaborations at the international level.\nThe first Maritime University successfully completed\nThe ACE expedition was preceded by the ACE Maritime University. Fifty students studying marine and earth sciences at universities around the world took part. They boarded the \nAkademik Treshnikov \non 19 November in Bremerhaven, in northern Germany, and reached Cape Town on 15 December. The young researchers took intensive theory-oriented classes and then engaged in hands-on practicals that taught them different sampling and analytical techniques and how to handle basic instruments. The students also used this opportunity to learn about their peers’ work in other fields.\nA chair for the study of extreme environments \nThe SPI also has a new chair, which will be formalized today in Cape Town. The Ingvar Kamprad Chair of Extreme Environments will be supported by Ferring Pharmaceuticals and based at EPFL’s Valais-Wallis outpost in Sion. The new team will work in EPFL’s alpine and extreme environment research center. It will apply cutting-edge scientific and technological solutions to environmental challenges like climate change and global resource management. This approach will enhance Switzerland’s existing scientific, economic and diplomatic contribution to this effort.\nThe research ship will hoist anchor at 4pm today, and is scheduled to return to Cape Town on 19 March 2017. An initial review of the expedition will be presented the following September at an international symposium to be held in Valais.\nRegular updates on the ACE expedition will be available here:\nThis website also provides a wide range of background information on the expedition, the projects, the researchers, the ship, etc.\nPress kit:\n Press release, project descriptions, FAQs, photos: \nSocial media: \n The ACE expedition is also on ,  and Instagram (ace_expedition).\nContacts:\n- Philippe Gillet, director ad interim of the SPI, , +41 21 693 70 58\n- Sarah Perrin, press officer at EPFL's Mediacom, , +41 21 693 21 07\n- Danièle Rod, Advisor to the EPFL Presidency in Cape Town, South Africa, ,\n+27 61 445 30 57\n- Helen Gallagher, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, , +41 58 301 00 51\n--------------------------------------------\nThe Swiss Polar Institute\n The Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) is an interdisciplinary center whose mission is to conduct research on the earth’s poles and other extreme environments.

{"id": 111, "text": "The daily dance of commuting and working – the famous French “métro, boulot, dodo” - hasn’t changed much in the past few decades, aside from our new constant companions – mobile phones. They collect a host of data as we travel, particularly about the trajectories we follow. And because most of us aren’t very adventurous, these data can also be used as a statistical basis from which to predict with a high degree of accuracy where we’re likely to go next at any given point in time. Three PhD students at the EPFL Computer and Communication Sciences School have refined this idea, which could lead to new services and applications. On June 19, the accuracy of their predictions earned them first place in the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge, an international contest involving 108 teams from universities such as TU Berlin, Carnegie Mellon and Virginia Tech.\nWhere will I go next? This was one of the challenges Nokia put forth in its contest, and the one that the EPFL students chose to tackle. Nokia provided mobile phone data from 200 volunteers in Western Switzerland collected over the course of more than a year. The contestants had access to eight months’ worth of partial data. The remaining data were used to verify the accuracy of their predictions.\nThe first task was to unveil the users’ regular behavior. The data from the phones gave clues about the places the users visited; lots of Bluetooth devices in a particularly crowded spot, wifi networks that reappeared regularly, devices to which the users connected.\n“The method is based on our habits,” explains Juha Laurila, from Lausanne’s Nokia Research Center. “If, for example, an event repeatedly occurs on a certain day of the week and a more or less identical hour of the day, then we have an element that allows us to statistically predict the user’s movements.”\nTo make the challenge even tougher, the students only had access to a limited amount of data – for example, they couldn’t use the phones’ GPS data. These constraints forced them to push the statistical techniques to their absolute limits. Starting with very piecemeal information, the three PhD students, Vincent Etter, Mohamed Kafsi and Ehsan Kazemi, were able to predict in most cases where the user would go next at any given point in time. “The goal was to glean as much information as possible from an incomplete data set,” explains Laurila. “If we add things like GPS data, then we would have an even more powerful system.”\nLooking forward, these results could be used to develop new services and mobile phone applications, such as automatic traffic notifications, automatic messaging to warn of possible delays, improved agendas, and so on. According to Laurila and Daniel Gatica Perez, co-director of the contest at Idiap, the social sciences could also benefit from these kinds of analysis methods. “This procedure could be very useful for understanding people’s habits and regular behavior, particularly in the field of computational social sciences.”", "summary": "Can mobile phones predict our behavior?

{"id": 113, "text": "The number of inventions evaluated by EPFL's Technology Transfer Office (TTO) has shot up in recent years. 950 inventions were submitted between 2005 and 2014 versus 450 between 1995 and 2004. The number of patent filings has increased in similar proportions, rising from 256 between 1995 and 2004 to 539 between 2005 and 2014. This increase is due in part to EPFL's growth. But for Gabriel Clerc, head of the TTO since it was created, this rise can also be attributed to a growing awareness among researchers of the importance of gaining market recognition for their ideas and research results.\nOver half of licenses are used by Swiss SMEs\n Of the 1500 inventions filed so far with the TTO, around 40% have been or will be put to commercial use through a license agreement with a start-up or existing company. The number of innovations currently being used by companies in the form of licenses is also twice as high now (391) as in 2005 (191). More than half of these rights were assigned in recent years to Swiss companies with fewer than 250 employees. “It is gratifying to see that most of our license agreements are with Swiss start-ups and small businesses,” said Mr. Clerc. “These companies are a major contributor to the strength of our economy and employment levels both regionally and nationwide.”\nSome of EPFL’s inventions enjoy widespread use around the world. One of its first inventions to experience widespread industrial success – Reymond Clavel’s Delta robot – was created 30 years ago. It is used by many companies and is commonly found in a number of sectors, including the rapid manipulation of small objects, watchmaking, remote surgery, measurement systems and material processing. Another major invention managed by the TTO is none other than Michaël Grätzel’s famous dye-sensitized solar cells. They have spawned many research projects and patents, not to mention industrial applications and improvements, since the end of the 1980s.\nInvention number 1500: a microscope for seeing cells in vivo\n “The most important thing for me is to form a solid team with the researchers for each invention,” said Mr. Clerc. “Nothing can be done without their expertise and enthusiasm.” Christophe Moser and Demetri Psaltis, both professors at EPFL, have indeed benefited from this precious teamwork. EPFL’s 1500th invention, which they recently filed, is the final step in a microscope capable of providing three-dimensional high-resolution images of functioning cells in the human body. These cells are smaller than a micrometer. Four years of research, in conjunction with Harvard Medical School, culminated in five patent filings for this device, which represents a major advance in the areas of medicine and microbiology. Potential uses include, for example, observing cells in the inner ear to determine whether an implant is working, and studying a functioning neuron.\nThis imaginative animated short film, produced by two young graphic designers, shows the various steps in the technology transfer process from the perspective of the invention itself.", "summary": "EPFL's Technology Transfer Office evaluated twice as many inventions between 2005 and 2014 than it did during the prior decade.

{"id": 121, "text": "With its quick and painless allergy detection and analysis system, Abionic is on a roll. This spin-off of EPFL’s Biomedical Imaging Laboratory has just obtained two million Swiss francs from private and institutional investors, including MedHoldings, Polytech Ventures, Blue Ocean Ventures, Fongit Seed Invest and the Business Angels Switzerland. This funding will allow the company to finish developing its system and aim for commercialization next year. Yesterday, the young company selected as one of Europe’s 100 most innovative companies in late April by Red Herring, a US magazine that is considered a reference for many venture capitalists. Four other EPFL startups were also on the top 100 list: Biocartis, Paper.li, HR Matching, and StereoTools.\nA multitude of allergens on a single CD\nGeared for use by allergists, pediatricians and other medical practitioners, this device resembles a DVD player equipped with a touch screen. It comes equipped with plastic capsules containing single-use biochips. It only takes about 20 minutes to diagnose a patient’s primary allergies, using a single drop of blood. This system could free millions of people throughout the world from having to undergo the tedious skin test, which consists of scratching or pricking the skin to allow exposure to various allergens, and then evaluating the skin's reaction.\nA few drops of a reagent are mixed with the blood sample. The preparation is placed in a compartmentalized capsule that contains ten biochips, each of which is prepared with a different allergen. The tiny device is mounted on a plastic surface in the form of a CD and “read” by a laser. The results appear on the screen and are automatically saved to a memory card. The doctor can read, print and save the results to his or her computer. The CD can be personalized with several dozens of different allergens.\nCounting molecules\nIn a general sense, nanofluidic biochips take advantage of various special properties that fluids exhibit at the nanometer scale. Nicolas Durand built upon this technology as part of his PhD research in EPFL’s Microsystems Laboratory, and it was further developed by the Biomedical Imaging Laboratory start-up. Here’s how it works: The blood enters into contact with allergens that have been previously deposited in the biochip. The interactions between certain proteins in the blood, which are marked with a fluorochrome (a chemical substance that can emit light upon excitation) and the immobilized allergens are measured by fluorescence. The device’s laser excites the protein-allergen molecular complexes, and they emit light. The concentration of these complexes determines the degree of the allergy. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, but in this case, you’re sure to find it if it’s there.\nNext targets: cancer and Alzheimer’s disease\nAccording to the Swiss Center for Allergies, about a quarter of the Swiss population exhibits various allergic symptoms. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has announced that close to 50% of Americans suffer from allergies. On a global scale, all allergies, including food allergies, have been on the upswing since the mid-1950s. “The world market for diagnostics in 2011 was evaluated at more than 40 billion Swiss francs,” Durand reports.\nThe company’s objectives are equally promising; in addition to reducing the analysis time on their device even further, the start-up is already looking at the possibility of using the method to detect other diseases whose blood biomarkers will be commercially available, such as certain cancers and Alzheimer’s disease.", "summary": "Abionic, an EPFL spin-off, has just brought its first round of financing to a close and was selected yesterday by Red Herring as one of Europe’s 100 most innovative companies.

The future of energy production will surely be a combination of several power sources, and Maher Kayal’s team from EPFL’s Electronics Laboratory (ELab) are developing a dedicated hardware that manages the network a thousand times faster than current software running on a conventional computer. The first unit of this integrated circuit has just been developed and could be deployed on the scale of a town five years from now.\n Defective power lines, problems with generators, or risks of power cuts will be handled by the chip a thousand times faster than at present. This will allow their management in close to real time, and at a lower cost than existing installations. “The problem with power grids has always been that ‘fatal moment’ when there is a sudden power failure”, emphasizes Kayal. This chip will enable the anticipation of breakdowns that could occur when the network is stretched to the limit in much greater security, efficiency and speed than software coupled with hardware not developed specifically for this purpose. This increased speed will allow for modeling of thousands of possible scenarios and anticipate failures and calculate their best solutions before they even happen.\nSmart Grids\n “Apart from the increased speed, a further advantage will be an easier use of renewable energy sources that depend on climatic conditions, and therefore are non-programmable, in comparison with nuclear energy power stations, which require advance planning”, he adds.\n This way of managing the network is in line with the concept of the “smart grid”: that is, the use of electronic technologies to optimize the production and distribution of electricity and thereby match demand and supply, ultimately reducing economical and ecological impact without even limiting energy consumption. However, Maher Kayal prefers not to put a figure on the financial savings: “Everything depends on the education, the intelligence and the psychology of the users of the network.” These factors will probably take longest to address and resolve.\n Once in production, the chip should only cost a few Swiss francs, and will have the significant advantage of being both reconfigurable and programmable according to the town, the district, or any other scale of network. The company ABB, which is financing part of the research work, has now filed a patent. This new concept of the intelligent management of energy will be unveiled on June 22 and 23, during the EPFL Middle East research days, which will bring together Swiss- and Emirates-based scientists to focus on the future of energy and sustainable development. \nOperational five years from now\nThe location of the study phase has already been found: Al Hamra, a small town close to Ras Al Khaimah, in the United Arab Emirates.

It is indeed something unique with great potential for a technical and social revolution\" said Gerd Binnig, 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics and co-inventor of the scanning tunneling microscope.\n“The potential created by Guardian Angels to collect real-time, real-world data from the environment and patients simultaneously has the power to revolutionize brain healthcare as we know it” stated Magali Haas, Chief Science & Technology Officer at One Mind for Research, USA.\n ‘’The research towards the development of Guardian Angels as being the future zero-power intelligent autonomous systems that will actively assist humans from their infancy to old age, will in my view contribute to addressing grand challenges Europe will face in the coming years\" said Luc Van den hove, CEO of IMEC, Belgium.\nAs a candidate for the European FET Flagship Initiatives, the Guardian Angels project that encompasses revolutionary self-powered smart devices for medical, transportation, and environmental use involved 66 partners: 29 universities, 16 research institutions and 21 companies. Now, 59 of these partners have already confirmed their intention to move forward in the Guardian Angels Consortium and pursue public-private partnerships involving national funding, the European Community, Universities, and its partners IBM, Infineon, NXP, Philips, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Sanofi, Siemens, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, Thales and others (see full list below).\nGuardian Angels for a Smarter Life congratulates the Human Brain Project and Graphene, two winning finalists, for their success in the race for the European FET Flagship Initiative Prize. Guardian Angels is proud to have been able to reach the ultimate rung of the competition, being nominated among the \"final four\" places.\n\"This remarkable journey to the final-four alone shows the quality of our project and track record,” said Professors Adrian Ionescu of EPFL (Lausanne) and Christofer Hierold of ETH (Zurich), coordinators of Guardian Angels. “Everyone involved is so convinced that we must continue with the momentum, the cohesion, and work together as the Guardian Angels Consortium that we are now moving forward into a new chapter of research, development and technology transfer.\"\n“This project addresses crucial social issues such as health, safety, security and mobility. As an industrial partner, we strongly believe that Guardian Angels will promote the competitiveness of European industrial players, by offering them the opportunity to develop a wide range of applications for everyday life”, added Sylvain Allano, Scientific director of PSA Peugeot Citroën.\nZero-power technologies and new frontiers of innovation\n The Guardian Angels partners have joined forces to help develop the electronics of tomorrow, with an ambition to create \"Zero-Power\" devices that are completely energy autonomous. This “Zero-Power” technology will in turn help to devise solutions to improve quality of life through new prevention and communication tools, medical devices focused on the human element and prophylactic environmental sensors that monitor the quality of air, water and food, for example. Additionally, only through the zero power concept could a comprehensive realization of the “internet of things” be materialized.\nTo achieve this, researchers are working simultaneously on two fronts. The first is to drastically reduce the power consumption of electronic components, like microprocessors, memory, sensors and wireless communication interfaces, among others. The second is to develop techniques to recover small amounts of energy - solar radiation, vibration, movement, and temperature differences, coupled with dramatically improved energy storage options - a considerable advantage, especially for implantable medical devices, but also in everyday life.\nThe researchers did not wait for the end of the application process to progress in their work. They have already achieved remarkable results, from energy efficient tunneling transistors (article in Nature), world-record nanostructured solar-cells (article in Science), flexible environmental sensors (article in Materials today), the use of carbon nanotubes and nanowires for integrated low power sensors (Article in Journal of Material Resarch and Nature Nanotechnology) and ultra-low power wireless communications (Article in IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits) to new biological sensors (Article in Proceedings of Wireless Health'10). To translate such breakthroughs into new applications the unifying effort proposed by the Guardian Angels FET Flagship is critically needed at European scale.\n The Guardian Angels Consortium will also pursue its alliance with the One Mind for Research project (www.1mind4research.org), uniting European and North American research efforts. The revolutionary Zero Power Biosensors and its potential for analysis will be used for monitoring and treatment of major brain diseases.\nRenewed support\n \"The prospects, both in research and industry, are enormous,” said Ionescu. This project also has the advantage of having partners at all stages of the value chain, which makes it very interesting from an economic point of view. Guardian Angels therefore is beginning its search for new sources of funding through funds dedicated to research in Switzerland and Europe, private support and investment from the partner companies.

{"id": 135, "text": "Nearly a third of highway accidents are caused by fatigue. Nowadays, there exist several attention detection systems for drivers, e.g.: based on the loss of vehicle control. Marina Zimmermann, as part of her master thesis in electrical and electronic engineering and in partnership with PSA Peugeot Citroën, has focused directly on drivers and their state of wakefulness. She developed an algorithm able to measure the degree of eyelid closure by using a single camera and thus avoiding invasive methods.\n One of the indicators most frequently used to determine the state of a driver’s fatigue is \"PERCLOS\" (percentage of eye closure). It measures the percentage of time that the pupil is at least 80% covered by the eyelid during a predetermined timespan. The challenge was to measure this indicator in real time, keeping the drivers’ eyes on the viewfinder and bearing in mind that they can turn their head, wear glasses, drive during the night, cross through tunnels etc.\n The Signal Processing Laboratory 5 (LTS5) at EPFL is specialized in face recognition, monitoring and analysis techniques and has man-machine interfaces capable of keeping track of a driver’s face in real time. This is achieved by placing a small infrared camera behind the wheel. In order to carry out the project -initiated by the Transportation Center and carried out at LTS5- Marina Zimmermann developed an eye-analyzing module by creating an algorithm able to disregard possible light effects as well as the drivers’ different eye morphologies.

{"id": 138, "text": "A study by researchers at EPFL has cast fresh light on a range of intracellular phenomena. The team used a microscope developed by spin-off Nanolive to observe changes in cell size during division, organelle movements, and the formation of tiny lipid droplets – all over an extended period and without damaging the cell. They then quantified the observed phenomena using software specially designed to sift through the mass of raw imaging data. The study, published today in the journal \nPLOS Biology\n, paves the way for the technology to be used in other areas of scientific research.\nCells in the spotlight\nThe Nanolive microscope used in the study combines holotomography, which measures the three-dimensional refractive index tomogram of living cells, with epifluorescence microscopy, which relies on the light emitted by an object that has absorbed higher-energy photons. Taken together, the data paints a detailed picture of a cell’s structure and chemical composition, allowing scientists to precisely calculate dry mass, morphology, cell membrane dynamics and other features.\nThe label-free, non-invasive imaging technique meant the team could observe the cells over an extended period of time. But one of the microscope’s major advantages is its ability to capture several biological phenomena and objects at the same time, enabling researchers to observe organelle rotation and other complex cellular dynamics involving multiple subcellular structures. The tradeoff is that the microscope generates vast quantities of raw data – so much, in fact, that the team had to develop new algorithms to process it. “We took existing, open-source image-processing software and wrote our own programs with some basic Python code,” explains Mathieu Frechin, head of quantitative biology at Nanolive. “The software we developed could be equally useful in other areas of biology.”\nCells dynamics over mitosis are full of surprises \nThe researchers observed a range of intracellular phenomena, studying them with an unprecedented degree of clarity. The team’s findings have even answered several enigmas in science.\nFor instance, cells change size considerably when they divide – a process known as mitosis. But inconsistent research findings meant that scientists were unsure whether the cells expanded or contracted. By observing cell division with the Nanolive microscope and processing the data with the purpose-designed computer vision strategy, the team was able demonstrate that, in fact, cells do both: expanding then quickly contracting again immediately prior to separation. “Our findings could lead to new label-free approaches to studying whole-cell dynamics,” says Frechin.\nLikewise, the researchers knew that organelles – the “organs” of a cell – were not static. Yet, with conventional microscopy techniques, scientists were unable to quantify or connect their relative movements. “We weren’t aware of any image-processing software suited to measure multiple rotating organelles in a coordinated way,” adds Frechin. “Developing one posed a real challenge.” Using the new technology and cross-disciplinary computer vision strategies, the team demonstrated that the entire cell nucleus rotates, not just the liquid inside it known as nucleoplasm. In addition, they posited that the entire intracellular compartment could be rotating, since the lipid droplets inside it move in a similar way. The researchers also measured rotation speed, acceleration and rotation time. Their discoveries could result in a better understanding of the phenomenon’s molecular origins, as well as the role it plays in cell physiology – especially in germ cell dormancy and other fundamental functions.\nUnderstanding lipid droplet formation in cells\nThe research team also observed and quantified other phenomena, such as lipid droplet formation inside the intracellular compartment. These droplets bud off the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by recycling material from older droplets. The flows of material could even be synchronized, suggesting membrane continuity between the droplets and the ER. Future research could shed further light on how lipid droplets interact, for instance by genetically or chemically disrupting the ER-droplet relationship. Armed with this new-found ability to peer deep inside cells, researchers are poised to unlock more of their hidden secrets.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and spin-off Nanolive have used a special microscope that combines two imaging technologies to observe and quantify new intracellular phenomena.

{"id": 141, "text": "In the quest for more efficient crystalline silicon solar cells with low manufacturing costs, one of the most promising approach is to bring all electrical contacts at the back of the device. This suppresses all shadowing at the front, increasing the current and the efficiency. This approach generally requires several delicate processing steps, because well-defined narrow negative and positive contact lines need to be created, which will then collect the electrons (negative charges) and holes (positive charges). This requires usually several steps of masking of photolithography to create the alternated positive (+) and negative (-) areas.\n The team at the EPFL Photovoltaics laboratory and at the CSEM PV-center succeeded in establishing an innovative process in which the positive and negative contacts align automatically. This is made possible by depositing the first “negative” contact by plasma process through a mask. Subsequently, a second layer (positive) is deposited over the full surface. The growth of this layer is such that the negative contact, even covered with the positive contact, remains negative.\n Using this simple process, 25-cm2 solar cells have already reached 23.2% efficiency, with the potential of reaching almost 26%.

{"id": 145, "text": "Nitrogen is abundantly available in nature and forms the basis for many valuable products, both natural and artificial. This requires a reaction known as “nitrogen fixation”, whereby molecular nitrogen is split into two atoms of nitrogen that can then be connected to other elements like carbon or hydrogen. But performing nitrogen fixation to make ammonia on an industrial scale requires harsh conditions with very high temperature and pressure. EPFL scientists have now developed a uranium-based compound that allows nitrogen fixation to take place in ambient conditions. The work, , forms a basis for the development of more efficient catalysts, while it highlights new concepts that can be expanded to metals beyond uranium.\nDespite being widely used, ammonia is not that easy to make. The main method for producing ammonia on an industrial level today is the Haber-Bosch process, which uses an iron-based catalyst and temperatures around 450\no\nC and pressure of 300 bar — almost 300 times the pressure at sea level. \nThe reason is that molecular nitrogen — as found in the air — does not react very easily with other elements. This makes nitrogen fixation a considerable challenge. Meanwhile, numerous microorganisms have adapted to perform nitrogen fixation under normal conditions and within the fragile confines of a cell. They do this by using enzymes whose biochemistry has inspired chemists for applications in industry.\nThe  synthesized a complex containing two uranium(III) ions and three potassium centers, held together by a nitride group and a flexible metalloligand framework.

{"id": 151, "text": "Nothing in biology is static. Biological processes fluctuate over time, and if we are to put together an accurate picture of cells, tissues, organs etc., we have to take into account their temporal patterns. In fact, this effort has given rise to an entire field of study known as “chronobiology”.\nThe liver is a prime example. Everything we eat or drink is eventually processed there to separate nutrients from waste and regulate the body’s metabolic balance. In fact, the liver as a whole is extensively time-regulated, and this pattern is orchestrated by the so-called circadian clock, our body’s internal metronome, as well as biochemical signals and eating rhythms.\nBut the liver also has an intriguing “geography” as it is actually divided into small repeating units called “lobules”, in which distinct zones perform different functions. This intricate spatial organization is known as “liver zonation”. For example, the breakdown of sugars during digestion takes place preferentially on one side of the lobule, the so-called central zone, while the production of glucose while we rest from stores such as fat, occurs on the other side of the liver, at the portal side.\nSo far, liver zonation has only been studied statically, looking into what each zone does independently of time, and vice-versa. And given how central the liver is in mammalian physiology, the two research approaches have to join efforts to understand how temporal and spatial liver programs interact.\nLiver zonation patterns of E-cadherin around the portal vein and of N-cadherin around the central vein, shown by immunofluorescence (scale bar: 100 micrometers).

Naef, EPFL© 2021 EPFL\nIn a first ever study, scientists at EPFL and the Weizmann Institute of Science, led by Professors Felix Naef at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences and Shalev Itzkovitz at the Weizmann, have been able to monitor the spatial shifts of gene expression within liver lobules in relationship to the circadian clock. Studying this link is a focus of Naef’s research, which has previously uncovered connections between the circadian clock and , our , and , the tightly packaged DNA in the cell nucleus.\nThe study came out of a EPFL-Weizmann joint grant from the Rothschild Caesarea Foundation.\nBy exploiting the ability to analyze liver tissue in every individual cell, the researchers studied approximately 5000 genes in liver cells at several timepoints throughout the 24-hour day. They then statistically classified the space-time patterns they uncovered with a model that can capture both spatial and temporal variations in the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA), a marker of gene expression.\nThe study revealed that many of the liver’s genes seem to be both zonated and rhythmic, meaning that they are regulated by both their location in the liver and the time of the day. These dually regulated genes are mostly linked to key functions of the liver, e.g. the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, but also include a few genes that have never been associated with metabolism, e.g. genes related to chaperone proteins, which help other biomolecules change their 3D structure or even assemble and disassemble.\n“The work reveals a richness of space-time gene expression dynamics of the liver, and shows how compartmentalization of liver function in both space and time is hallmark of metabolic activity in the mammalian liver,” says Felix Naef.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have carried out the first comprehensive study of how genes in the liver perform their metabolic functions in both space and time of day.

{"id": 154, "text": "“Just think about what a fly can do,” says Professor Pavan Ramdya, whose , with the  of Professor Pascal Fua at EPFL’s Institute for Computer Science, led the study. “A fly can climb across terrain that a wheeled robot would not be able to.”\nFlies aren’t exactly endearing to humans. We rightly associate them with less-than-appetizing experiences in our daily lives. But there is an unexpected path to redemption: Robots. It turns out that flies have some features and abilities that can inform a new design for robotic systems.\n“Unlike most vertebrates, flies can climb nearly any terrain,” says Ramdya. “They can stick to walls and ceilings because they have adhesive pads and claws on the tips of their legs. This allows them to basically go anywhere. That's interesting also because if you can rest on any surface, you can manage your energy expenditure by waiting for the right moment to act.”\nIt was this vision of extracting the principles that govern fly behavior to inform the design of robots that drove the development of DeepFly3D, a motion-capture system for the fly \nDrosophila melanogaster\n, a model organism that is nearly ubiquitously used across biology.\nIn Ramdya’s experimental setup, a fly walks on top of a tiny floating ball – like a miniature treadmill – while seven cameras record its every movement. The fly’s top side is glued onto an unmovable stage so that it always stays in place while walking on the ball. Nevertheless, the fly “believes” that it is moving freely.\nThe collected camera images are then processed by DeepFly3D, a deep-learning software developed by Semih Günel, a PhD student working with both Ramdya’s and Fua’s labs. “This is a fine example of where an interdisciplinary collaboration was necessary and transformative,” says Ramdya. “By leveraging computer science and neuroscience, we’ve tackled a long-standing challenge.”\nDifferent poses of the fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster\n are captured by multiple cameras and processed with the DeepFly3D software. Credit: P. Ramdya, EPFL.\nWhat’s special about DeepFly3D is that is can infer the 3D pose of the fly – or even other animals – meaning that it can automatically predict and make behavioral measurements at unprecedented resolution for a variety of biological applications. The software doesn’t need to be calibrated manually and it uses camera images to automatically detect and correct any errors it makes in its calculations of the fly’s pose. Finally, it also uses active learning to improve its own performance.\nDeepFly3D opens up a way to efficiently and accurately model the movements, poses, and joint angles of a fruit fly in three dimensions. This may inspire a standard way to automatically model 3D pose in other organisms as well.\n“The fly, as a model organism, balances tractability and complexity very well,” says Ramdya. “If we learn how it does what it does, we can have important impact on robotics and medicine and, perhaps most importantly, we can gain these insights in a relatively short period of time.”", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a deep-learning based motion-capture software that uses multiple camera views to model the movements of a fly in three dimensions.

{"id": 166, "text": "The main points of phase two of EPFL’s expansion in Valais were defined in the agreement in principle signed by the school and the Valais Council of State. The signing ceremony was also attended by the president of Sion and the president of the ETH Board. This new agreement builds on the one signed in 2012: it increases the number of employees and the number of scientific teams planned, and it introduces a new field of research that is closely linked to Valais’s industrial and natural environment.\nCutting-edge research in alpine and extreme environments\nSion will host EPFL’s new research center in the science and technology of alpine and extreme environments, a field that ranges from biology to physical processes. The EPFL Valais Wallis campus is ideal for this type of research thanks to its proximity to the Alps and to the canton's water and snow resources, and in view of the canton’s exposure to environmental risks, which derive largely from climate change. The research conducted at this center will cover the physics and dynamics of ice, water harvesting and hydrology, the microbial ecology of waterways, ecosystems, cryosphere biology, the science of alpine and polar macrosystems, processes associated with precipitation and snow cover, environmental robotics and natural water resource management. \nThis center offers solid perspectives in terms of future job-creating technologies in the fields of extreme materials, sensors and robotics, autonomous drones and satellites, and extreme biotechnology. It also builds on the expertise that EPFL has acquired through the Solar Impulse project. The center supports Switzerland’s aim to play a larger international role in issues related to water, the oceans and resources through its expertise as an alpine country and its scientific activity at the poles. The center’s activities also dovetail with Valais’s water strategy, which was adopted by the Council of State.\nInternational influence thanks to the Swiss Polar Institute\nThe Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) was co-founded at the end of December 2015 by EPFL and Editions Paulsen together with the Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL), ETH Zurich and the University of Bern, and with the official support of the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI). It was developed to group together research initiatives in the field of extreme environments by coordinating international projects and expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. It will be located in the Sion-based research center specializing in alpine and extreme environments, enabling it to draw parallels between the high latitudes (Arctic and Antarctic) and high altitudes (\"the third pole\", of which the Alps are a major component on the global scale). \nThe newly created SPI is already organizing an international mission to Antarctica: the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Twenty-two research projects in fields such as glaciology, climatology, biology and oceanography will be conducted during the expedition, which will run from December 2016 to March 2017. The projects were developed by teams from countries including Switzerland, the UK, France, Australia and South Africa. In September 2017, an initial assessment of the expedition will be presented at an international symposium to be held in Valais.\n“Large-scale hydropower” partnership between EPFL and HES-SO Valais \nThe 2012 plan called for all of EPFL’s hydropower activities to be transferred to Valais. But that project has been adapted to changing academic and technological factors.\nIn view of the high cost of moving the research facilities and laboratories, the partners have now opted for a close partnership under which both EPFL and HES-SO Valais will use the Lausanne-based infrastructure.\nPromising research in neuroengineering\nEPFL Valais Wallis’s rehabilitation and health cluster, which already has a research chair in neuroengineering at the SuvaCare rehabilitation clinic in Sion, will be expanded through a greater emphasis on scientific work and clinical application testing. Clinical research and observations on spinal cord repair and motor function will also be conducted in Valais. The aim will be to help people with paraplegia to regain as much mobility as possible, in part through a robotics-based rehabilitation platform. Together with HES-SO Valais, there are plans to develop a neuroprosthetic training program for physical therapists and nursing staff. Valais hospitals will also be further integrated in personalized medicine projects currently being developed in western Switzerland’s “Health Valley”.\nStrengthening and positioning the hub for green chemistry and energies of the future\nNearly 150 people from 31 different countries are engaged in research in the fields of green chemistry and energies of the future in Sion. These activities will be strengthened through the addition of two demonstrators and by positioning this research hub in the Swiss Innovation Park. Scientific work in this field is starting to generate opportunities both for startups and existing companies.\n350 high value-added jobs\nThe second phase of the project will significantly extend EPFL’s footprint in Valais and deepen its economic commitment to the canton. It will also strengthen the partnership between EPFL and HES-SO Valais, further driving research and innovation forward and adding breadth and depth to the courses taught in Valais. The EPFL Valais Wallis campus will eventually employ more than 350 researchers, with a total of 16 or 17 chairs and three permanent research groups. EPFL will finance five or six more chairs than the initial plan called for. New premises near the train station, rather than in Chandoline as initially planned, will accommodate the added researchers. The framework credit approved by the Valais parliament in 2013 remains in place.\nThese projects and their local and global impact are further examples of how EPFL fulfills the mission given to it by the Federal Council to serve society and support economic growth in Switzerland. EPFL and the Canton of Valais have entered into a partnership that takes into account the region’s unique industrial, cultural and environmental features. This partnership is designed to contribute to the canton’s growth in a number of key sectors (see box: \"EPFL Valais Wallis: phase two of the project and the expected return on investment for Valais\").\nNext steps\nThe Valais Council of State and EPFL plan to move forward quickly with a detailed academic plan and implementation schedule. The agreement of 19 December 2012 will be amended to include the process, financing and timeframe for phase two of EPFL's expansion in Valais.\n---\nEPFL Valais Wallis: phase two of the project and the expected return on investment for Valais\nThe second phase of EPFL’s expansion in Valais is designed to:\nstrengthen EPFL’s academic activities in Valais in green chemistry for energies of the future and extreme (bio)technologies and to position EPFL at the forefront of rehabilitation and health;\nincrease the appeal of both EPFL and Valais within Switzerland (Health Valley) and abroad (the Swiss Polar Institute), an effort that has already paid off internationally in terms of job creation and investments in phase 1 of the project (energy/green chemistry);\ngenerate substantial new synergies with HES-SO Valais (health, IT, big data, industrial systems), the Centre de Recherches Energétiques et Municipales (CREM), and, in the medium term, the research institute IDIAP, and to link up HES-SO Valais with the research being carried out at EPFL’s hydropower center in Lausanne;\npromote gradual technological development and job creation in EPFL’s activities in Valais, including digital and robotic technologies – especially drones and remote sensing – and to position Campus Energypolis in the future Swiss Innovation Park; and\nshowcase EPFL’s activities in Valais for investors.

{"id": 169, "text": "EPFL’s Modern Architecture Archives Department (ACM) has put together a unique event illustrating the key role that the Lake Geneva region played in the development of modern architecture in the 20\nth\n century. The exhibition is called “Habiter la modernité. Villas de style international sur la Riviera vaudoise” (“Living in Modernity. International Style villas in the Swiss Riviera”) and is being held in association with EPFL’s Archizoom exhibit hall and L’Atelier De Grandi Museum in Corseaux.\nThe goal is to trace the influence that a collection of villas built in Vaud between 1920 and 1940 had on architectural trends. Some of the houses reflect innovative experiments by pioneering architects such as Le Corbusier, Henri-Robert Von der Mühll and Alberto Sartoris. Those who commissioned their work were often rich and well-educated and didn’t shy away from trying out the bold new designs of the time.\nThe De Grandi house and painting studio, which hosts the exhibition, is itself an example of the “international style” that the event aims to showcase. Commissioned by painter Italo De Grandi, the villa was built by Italian architect Alberto Sartoris in 1939. De Grandi’s two sons converted it into a museum in 2017 to display works by their father as well as their uncle, Vincent De Grandi, and other Swiss artists.\nThe exhibition will run from 6 September to 29 November 2018. The ACM Department sees it as an opportunity to introduce a new approach and to spark research into the architectural heritage of French-speaking Switzerland. We spoke with Salvatore Aprea, Head of the ACM and the exhibition curator, about the vision behind the event.\nHow would you describe the “international style” being presented at the exhibition?\nI chose to focus the exhibition on the international style of architecture, a term coined by American architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock in 1929. The word “international” refers to the fact that the style developed simultaneously in several countries – including Switzerland, France, Italy and Germany – in the 1920s. The style’s hallmark features include a focus on harmonious spaces rather than axial symmetry, the use of large surfaces to envelop spaces, and an absence of outside embellishments. This was a sharp contrast to the eclectic style popular at the time, which characterized much of late 19\nth\n-century architecture.\nWhy were so many international-style villas built in the Lake Geneva region?\nBetween 1920 and 1940, our region offered modern architects a place to test out new ideas. They were commissioned by wealthy patrons to build villas that responded to contemporary criteria for construction, comfort and design. These architects used novel materials like concrete and steel and advanced building methods – or they used conventional materials but created new forms and spatial compositions. Our region was a hotbed of \navant-garde\n thinking not just by architects, but also publishers, painters and writers – all of whom helped modernize local society through contemporary architecture and art. However, some of them, especially artists, had to keep their villa-construction plans under wraps. Many designs were developed but not all of the villas were actually built, which is why we wanted to include the ACM’s archives in the exhibition, so as to show how the international style expanded over the two decades. We decided to focus on Vaud, but there are some other international-style villas elsewhere in the region, especially in Geneva.\nHow is the exhibition structured?\nChronologically, starting with the Le Lac villa that Le Corbusier built for his parents in Corseaux in 1924. This villa was named a UNESCO world heritage site in 2016. The exhibition also ends in Corseaux with De Grandi’s house and painting studio, registered as Historical Monument. Drawings by Lausanne architects Henri Robert von der Mühll and Jacques Favarger show how new construction methods emerged in the late 1920s. One example is Favarger’s and Charles Dubois’ design for a “standard villa” – never built – that combined standardized industrial production methods with high-quality architecture. Contemporary approaches spread throughout the 1930s, and Lausanne architect René Bonnard even opened his 1935 villa to the public so they could “experience” modern architecture.\nWhat will this exhibition bring to the ACM?\nIt gives us a chance to extend our reach beyond EPFL and opens new doors for research into modern architecture in French-speaking Switzerland. It lets us reveal another facet of Switzerland between the First and Second World Wars. Architects from our region studied in Paris and Berlin, and some patrons commissioned foreign architects. So our region became more international rather than isolated over that period, contrary to the image that a lot of people have of this being a highly rural and conservative area. This cultural heritage is just as much a part of Swiss identity as anything else. Our role is to remind people of that and showcase this extraordinary architecture.\nHabiter la modernité.

{"id": 170, "text": "Scientists around the world are excited about the new possibilities being offered by advanced data collection and processing methods. But making such data understandable and useful to the uninitiated remains a challenge. With its Affinity Map, ENAC hopes to give its faculty a tool for better leveraging the vast amount of data related to their research and teaching. Such a visual method could even make it easier for scholars to share academic knowledge across the entire scientific community.\nENAC’s Affinity Map was driven by the school’s former dean, Marilyne Andersen. It is designed to help ENAC researchers spot potential academic synergies, topics they share with colleagues and possible areas for joint research. The map is fast, intuitive to use and now . “This public version is intended to show academic community the potential of data visualization and how it can help encourage research collaboration on a global level,” says Dario Rodighiero, the map’s co-author.\nDigital humanities\nRodighiero created the Affinity Map as part of his thesis in digital humanities at EPFL, which was supervised by Professors Frédéric Kaplan and Boris Beaude, and defended in January 2018. The map combines the latest visualization methods with annual data from ENAC, including journal publications, courses given and student supervision. After finalizing his prototype, Rodighiero teamed up with Ogier Maitre, an EPFL computer scientist and cartographer, to turn it into a program that can be used by anyone. Rodighiero’s work will now be extended to an even larger scale, thanks to a grant he just obtained from the Swiss National Science Foundation to conduct post-doc research at MIT so that researchers around the world can benefit from his invention.\nWhat makes Rodighiero’s thesis unique is that it is based on interviews he conducted with ENAC researchers over four years. That means his program is not just easy to use and efficient, but also tailored specifically to their needs. “Marilyne Andersen, ENAC’s former dean, saw the Affinity Map as a tool for visualizing the school as a whole and for facilitating cross-disciplinary research. It was also meant to support the development of new teaching activities – such as for the Design Together program – and new research topics at the crossroads of existing fields. But as we were building the map, we saw that researchers were really interested in seeing their laboratory represented in the Affinity Map, and it became a way of depicting the school through its faculty members. Today they all can use it,” says Rodighiero.\nThe ENAC galaxy\nThe Affinity Map looks like a galaxy of some seventy planets, each surrounded by satellites. The planets are the ENAC labs and their color indicates which of the school’s three disciplines they belong to: red for architecture; blue for civil engineering; and green for environmental engineering. The lines between the labs represent any one of three types of affinities: shared teaching subjects; joint project supervisions (including at students, PhD and postdoc levels); and joint publications.\nUsers can select filters to display only the information that interests them. For example, you can group certain kinds of planets together or arrange the planets in new ways by choosing a particular affinity. You can also zoom in on the map to view a specific lab and its joint research projects with other ENAC labs, which are displayed as satellites around the planet.\nThe LIPID laboratory and its satellites. © EPFL\nKeywords and a search engine\nShared keywords between the planets, used to indicate common research topics, are generated using natural language processing algorithms that comb through the abstracts of ENAC literature published in a given year and identify correspondences.\nThe map also contains a search engine where you can search by keyword to find out which labs worked on a given topic, like transportation systems or water treatment. You could also use the search engine to screen for a specific discipline, research topic or laboratory. And missing lines between two labs – despite their affinities – could indicate opportunities for collaboration.\nThe data used to generate the map come from EPFL’s existing dynamic databases, reviewed and updated by the labs themselves through their annual reports. There are private and public versions of the map. The private one, accessible only by ENAC faculty via a password, provides a complete picture of the myriad of ways that ENAC labs work together and makes it easier for people to contact each other. It gives the names of all researchers at each lab, their existing collaborations in teaching, thesis supervision and publications, and current research projects with non-ENAC labs. The public version gives only the names of the head of each lab in order to protect their researchers from any kind of evaluation.\nBetter than a website\nFor now the Affinity Map includes only data for 2017. But Rodighiero and Maitre plan to have it be updated every year. “Once it contains several years of data, ENAC faculty can use it to better understand its researchers’ developing careers and where the school is headed – particularly as some labs close, others open and new research topics emerge. The map will help ENAC students, researchers and professors get a better grasp of their environment and the best way to explore it. And for that, the map is more effective than any website,” says Rodighiero.\n“The Affinity Map took five years, starting at the beginning of my tenure as dean. The goal is to better understand, and therefore better ‘see’ – literally – the diversity and complexity of a school like ENAC. I’m very pleased it has been made available to the public as an interactive map so that users can discover the synergies and specific subjects that we teach and research. And I’m delighted that the project will continue to be developed both here at ENAC and beyond, reaching all the way to the United States, so that we won’t forget that we are part of greater whole, one that offers increasingly great opportunities to support and learn from each other through new affinities,” says Andersen, ENAC’s dean from 2013 to 2018 and the driving force behind the project.", "summary": "The Affinity Map showing cross-laboratory collaboration among faculty at EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) is now available to the general public.

{"id": 173, "text": "The microelectrodes developed by André Mercanzini should generate a lot of interest from investors: they have the potential to reduce side-effects, the risk of complications, and cost. At a time when Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has an increasing number of applications – such as the treatment of pain relief, epilepsy and depression – the market for these products is estimated to be around 450 million Swiss francs. “It should grow at about 25% each year,” notes Jean-Pierre Rosat, CEO of Aleva Neurotherapeutics. The start-up, launched by the young scientist in 2008, has just completed a round of financing that raised 10 million francs, thanks to BiomedInvest AG, BB Biotech Ventures III, Initiative Capital Romandie, and private investors. It’s almost certainly a record for the school for an innovative product resulting from doctoral work over the last ten years.\nThe DBS technique has been used since the beginning of the nineties for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. It consists of implanting 3 millimeters long electrodes at precise points in the brain, while a pacemaker, implanted at the level of the thorax, continuously sends impulses in order to reduce symptoms. To fit the electrode in place, the target zone is identified using the technique of radiological localization. The results are spectacular: as soon as the device is implanted, trembling, rigidity and problems with movement diminish, thus improving the quality of life of the patient.\nAs part of his thesis with Professor Philippe Renaud, André Mercanzini – now CTO of the company – developed the microscopic electro-stimulators at the Center for MicroNanoTechnology, most of the work taking place in the clean room, a dust-free area. Measuring from 50 microns in diameter (the width of a hair) to a millimeter, they will enable improved precision, which in turn will limit side effects. Its dimensions will make it possible to position more than twenty of them on the surface to be treated, compared with a maximum of four using products currently on the market. This will result in an increase in the number of neurological diseases that might be treated by this method.\nThe fineness of these devices will also enable easier implantation and the surgical procedures will be more rapid. Moreover, the treatment of other conditions can be envisaged, in particular psychiatric illnesses, where the relevant zone is very small. The material used is a composite of polymer and metal, and this greatly reduces any risk of rejection of the implant by the patient’s body.\nThis product, currently the subject of clinical trials at CHUV, combines reliability with cost reduction. The recent investments will allow the company to increase its activity and bring the new electrode to the market.", "summary": "One of the biggest financing rounds for furthering the work of a doctoral student has just been completed at EPFL.

Now put it down on the ground in Central Park, against a rock on Mount Everest, or on your kitchen table; there will always be a point on the map that sits exactly on the actual physical place it represents. Obvious? Not for mathematicians. A more complex theorem, called a “fixed point theorem,” has eluded them since 1963. “Some ideas seem evident to the human mind, but in reality involve complicated concepts that are difficult to demonstrate mathematically,” says Nicolas Monod, head of EPFL’s Chair of Ergodic and Geometric Group Theory. It turns out that the answer was there all along, simple and elegant. To reach it, the team of mathematicians had take a different approach to the problem. Their discovery will impress their fellow mathematicians, of course; but on the longer term, it also will be of interest to physicists and economists.\nThink outside the map\nSurprisingly, this theorem works for all kinds of maps, from a diagram of a metro route to a map of spaces used in quantum physics. But to prove it, a fixed point must be found for every possible case. Since the number of possible maps is infinite, the mathematicians were looking for a universal, purely mathematical method -- one that would work in any situation.\nThe challenge for the mathematicians was to find that fixed point. It was a bit like designing a method that could pinpoint the center of gravity of any object, real or purely mathematical. It seemed like an impossible task for the specialists. “That’s why this approach hadn’t been more fully explored,” Monod explains. “It was in thinking about another space and exchanging our ideas that we realized that we actually could find that center of gravity.” It was possible to determine it in a parallel space. The center of gravity was definitely there ... but outside the space you started from. It was a counterintuitive result, but one that allowed them to prove the theorem.\nTurning the page\nIn 2008, a thirty-page article, full of technical jargon, almost arrived at a proof. Even Barry Edward Johnson, who formulated the theorem and worked hard to find a proof all the way up to his death in 2002, was ultimately unsuccessful. Today, the proof is only a few pages long. In addition to the indisputable intellectual satisfaction this elegant result represents, it also opens up long-term perspectives in other disciplines; theories in physics and economics, for example, both make use of the idea of fixed points.\nSource:\nA ﬁxed point theorem for L1 spaces\n, U.

{"id": 176, "text": "Gamaya, an EPFL spin-off, has developed an automatic, aerial system for monitoring crops using a hyperspectral camera affixed to a drone. The system detects a wide range of information, including seed type, stage of growth, hydration level, parasites and diseases. The aerial views can also be used to cut costs by ensuring that herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers are only applied to areas that need them.\nThe company has just raised 3.2 million francs from investors including the Sandoz Foundation, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Seed4Equity and the Swiss venture capital firm IV Partners. In addition, last Thursday it was awarded the W.A. de Vigier award worth 100,000 francs.\nSensing the spectral signature of plants\nHyperspectral cameras expand the spectrum of colors that can be detected by recording light wavelengths from visible to infrared. They are therefore effective in picking up the “spectral signature” of plants, which varies with their stage of growth and the surrounding conditions. A lack of water or nutrients, for example, modifies the physiological state of plants and affects how they reflect light. So a healthy plant will have a different spectral signature from that of a plant experiencing stress. Wide range of variations have been documented and put into databases.\nGamaya developed a software program that maps the nuances of the spectrum detected by the drone onto colors visible to the human eye. Each problem has a color, which means farmers can analyze their crops in detail on their computer screen. The system also provides advice – such as how much fertilizer to use – and yield projections.\nWell-suited for the vast croplands in South America\nThe system, which simply requires farmers to operate a drone, is now ready for use with soy, corn and sugar cane fields. “We are starting out by targeting Latin America, where the market is estimated to be worth five billion dollars,” said Yosef Akhtman, the company’s CEO. The farms there are vast, which means that conditions are frequently uneven. The system has already been successfully tested by farmers in Brazil.\nGamaya says its system can help farmers boost their harvest, bring down costs and reduce disease-related risks. “It could boost profits by up to 30% by helping farmers quickly and accurately resolve problems,” said Akhtman. The company, which was founded last year, has been selected by Forbes and Business Insider as one of the twelve most promising young companies in agriculture-related technologies. “This system’s ability to enhance efficiency in crop treatment could also help address the main challenge awaiting agriculture: we will have to produce as much food between now and 2050 as we did over the past 10,000 years combined.” The global population is expected to reach some 10 billion people by mid-century.", "summary": "EPFL spin-off Gamaya has just raised 3.2 million francs for its agricultural drone system.

The care he took over his architectural drawings and the importance he gave to details and perspective show his desire to fill the viewer with wonder. That provided the inspiration for EPFL’s Archives of Modern Construction to put together a retrospective of the architect’s work, comprising 103 of his drawings dating from his time as a trainee in the 1920s to the end of the 1930s, along with 13 color screen prints produced between the 1970s and the 1990s. \nThis one-off exhibition, called “La macchina delle meraviglie.

It is a rare opportunity to give international exposure to an important collection held at EPFL, and thereby to promote Switzerland’s cultural heritage beyond its borders.\nAlberto Sartoris was born in Turin in 1901 and grew up in Geneva, where he attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In the 1920s, having moved back to Turin, he took an interest in avant-garde art movements and became close to the Futurists. After helping to found the International Congresses of Modern Architecture in La Sarraz in 1928, he settled in the Lausanne region. He became one of the main architects of the Modern Movement, involved in the practice, theoretical development and promotion of modern art. \nProject for an industrial building. © Acm / EPFL\nInvention through drawing\n His undeniable graphical mastery was based on a precise philosophy inspired by humanism. For Sartoris, architectural drawings were an art form in their own right, a manifestation of an idea taking shape – they must be considered and planned with great precision before being executed. Sartoris’ drawings are thus manifestos of his thoughts, or, as he liked to say, “graphic designs intended to produce architectural inventions.” \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Sartoris’ artistic ambitions took on a new form with the production of hundreds of screen prints based on his earliest drawings.

{"id": 179, "text": "The main drawback of small drones is their limited flight time, which results from their heavy batteries and relatively inefficient propellers. So for longer missions, a small drone’s battery has to be regularly recharged or replaced. While engineers are working on new designs to address this problem, no real solution has been found – until now. Samir Bouabdallah, who has over 20 years of experience developing drone technology at EPFL and ETH Zurich, has come up with an inventive propulsion system modeled after those used by helicopters. His design, marketed through his startup Flybotix, uses just two propellers and an algorithm-based stabilization mechanism, giving his drones “the aerodynamic performance of a helicopter and the mechanical stability of a quadcopter.” Recently in China for the CES Asia conference and the Venture Leaders China program, Bouabdallah has decided to explore opportunities in this promising market.\nTwo rotors guided by stabilization algorithms \nA drone’s flying time is proportional to its size – the smaller the machine, the less time it can spend in the air. “Drones with four rotors are highly stable, making them reliable and easy to use,” says Bouabdallah. But as these drones get smaller, their propellers become increasingly inefficient. That, combined with their limited battery capacity, explains their abbreviated flying times.\nOne way to extend those times is to use a completely different kind of propulsion system. By reducing the number of propellers from four to two, for instance, engineers can make each propeller longer and the rotor more efficient. That also cuts the amount of power required, meaning the same-sized battery can run for longer. But until now, drones with two propellers were generally less stable and harder to manipulate. Bouabdallah’s design employs a ring-like structure – around 30 centimeters in diameter – in which the propellers are stacked on top of each other in the center and turn in opposite directions. His drones look more like flying saucers than the machines we’re used to seeing.\nAnother innovation relates to his drones’ stabilization mechanism. Helicopters use a complicated transmission system that enables pilots to control the blades and maintain the aircraft’s pitch.

French, Colombian, Australian and Dutch banners bring color to a giant workshop where students hasten among boats with different degrees of original design and accomplishment.\nThey have set their hopes in winning the competition organized by the Hydros Company, based at EPFL’s Innovation Park. These student teams are expected to make boats that are as energy efficient and operational as possible within the limits of a certain size, with a 1200W electric motor and batteries provided by the organizer. One of the rounds requires a 200 kg load and the other only 20 kg. The boats must cover from 400 to 600 meters in a record time. A total of 12 universities have submitted their teams. The competition starts today on Lake Geneva (free access to the UNIL-EPFL Nautical Center, Lausanne, until Sunday. ).\nA \"torpedo\"... \n One of the boats representing EPFL looks like an upside-down dirigible. The boat that Felix Cazalis, Sacha Pollonghini, Jordan Holweger and colleagues will present consists of a torpedo-like structure that operates one meter below the water surface and on top of which an ultrafine hull floats. \"We imagined this configuration could work for the round that requires the boat to carry a 200 kg load,\" said Felix Cazalis. Since the ballast and the motor are located in the submerged part of the boat, this guarantees the stability of the whole structure.\n… and a flying boat \n For the light-weight category, the team had a totally different approach. This time, they devised a flying boat, a.k.a. a foiler. Remote controlled \"wings\", fixed under the keel and rudder, should allow the vessel’s hull to come out of the water since the very first propeller spins so as to reduce the water resistance to its movement and thus the energy losses.\n\"We had to grope for finding a way in which the boat could fly without rearing up or losing its lateral stability,\" said Jordan Holweger. Suffice to say that the last few weeks, which were also the end-of-year exams’, were intense. \"We still have some adjustments to make for ensuring a better stability as weather conditions may be difficult,\" he said.\nThe goal of Hydros, through this competition that aims to become an annual event, is to make young engineers face the challenges – mainly energy saving –encountered by maritime transport of goods.

{"id": 201, "text": "Since 2012, engineers at EPFL’s Space Center have been hard at work on a new junk-clearing satellite to capture debris orbiting the earth. The team has now shifted up a gear, founding a company called ClearSpace to pick up where the CleanSpace One project leaves off. For the first test mission, penciled in for 2024, the company has set its sights on capturing and destroying SwissCube, a nanosatellite developed by students from EPFL and other Swiss universities and launched on 23 September 2009. Looking further ahead, the startup plans to develop a viable, cost-efficient system for cleaning up the estimated 3,000-or-so derelict satellites orbiting closest to earth.\n“We have no option but to clear space debris from Low Earth Orbit,” says ClearSpace CEO Luc Piguet. “The viability of satellite technologies, which are an increasingly important part of our lives, is at stake.”\nClearSpace’s satellite, similar in design to a drone, features a tapered net that shoots out, grabs a piece of debris and then retracts, trapping the junk in its clutches. The team’s long-term plan is to launch a platform carrying multiple satellites.\nMillions of pieces of junk\nEver since the world’s first satellite was launched in 1957, space has become increasingly cluttered with junk of all shapes and sizes – from tiny nuts and paint chips to rocket stages and satellites the size of a bus. The problem is particularly acute in Low Earth Orbit, the area between around 100 km (the edge of earth’s atmosphere) and 2,000 km above the surface of the planet. Using radar technology, scientists have so far identified and tracked some 22,000 pieces of debris bigger than 10 cm. That figure does not include smaller items, amounting to around 900,000 pieces larger than 1 cm – and around a hundred million measuring more than 1 mm. All of that fast-moving debris, flying around the planet at some 8 km per second, poses an ever-growing threat to spacecraft and crew.\nYet capturing space junk is harder than it looks. The whole process demands extreme precision, and it takes place at mind-boggling speeds. The first task – actually locating a piece of debris – is challenging enough. Take SwissCube, for instance. Scientists currently know where it is to within 5 km or so, but pinpointing its exact location requires ultra-precision detection and identification systems involving lasers. The next stage of the process – the rendezvous – is just as problematic. The satellite needs to get close enough to capture the debris without touching it, because that could cause it to quickly fly off course and out of reach. The final step is to trap the junk firmly in the net before dragging it down through earth’s atmosphere, where it will burn up. The engineers have to make sure their calculations and predictions are spot on before launching the satellite. Because once it has been released, they have no way to adjust its flight path or make repairs.\nClearSpace recently signed a collaboration agreement with EPFL, focusing largely on the question of technology transfer. The startup has also secured funding from the European Space Agency (ESA) and local authorities, and it is in talks with a number of key industry partners. The company is expected to expand quickly in the coming year, yet it is already making its mark. For one, it is the only small business – alongside some industry heavyweights – to get through the first round of an ESA tender to deorbit one of the agency’s derelict satellites.", "summary": "Engineers working on the CleanSpace One project at EPFL’s Space Center have come up with a way of capturing and destroying the space debris that has built up over 60 years of low-orbit activities.

{"id": 204, "text": "The 12,000 colored solar panels really make the Copenhagen International School’s new building stand out. They completely cover the building and will provide it with 300 MWh of electricity per year, meeting over half of the school’s energy needs. The panels are a distinctive sea green, yet no pigments were used to make them. The color comes from a process of light interference developed over a number of years in EPFL labs.\nLight interference is one way of producing color. It’s a similar effect to that seen in soap bubbles, on the wings of some butterflies and in a layer of oil on the surface of water: “The iris effect creates a colorful rainbow on a very thin layer. We used the same principle and adapted for glass,” said Jean-Louis Scartezzini, the head of the Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB).\nThis sounds easy on paper. In reality, controlling the light reflected by the solar panels so that they produce only one color without reducing energy efficiency was a real challenge.\n12 years of research \nThe researchers’ aim was to be able to define the color of their solar panels – such as brick red, royal blue, golden yellow or sea green – by ensuring that only certain wavelengths are reflected. This required a series of digital simulations and a special manufacturing process, and it took 12 years to get from the first sample to the first colored solar facade. The researchers developed special filters, which they applied to the glass panels in nanometric layers. The filter design determines which wavelengths of light will be reflected as visible color. The rest of the sunlight is absorbed by the solar panel and converted into energy.\nAndreas Schüler, who has led this project from the start, notes the challenge in achieving stable colors: “We have a free hand in developing our filters – we can achieve specific refraction indexes by combining different oxides. We work layer by layer, using between three and 13 layers in any given filter design. We have to find the right composition and thickness of layers so that they reflect the desired wavelengths while at the same time meeting the solar power requirements.”\nBy tinting the solar and thermal panels, the researchers are able to hide their unsightly components. The panels thus become architectural features in their own right.\nA spin-off, patents and projects\nThis technology is covered by two patents, and the colored solar panels are now being mass produced. They are made in one large size – 3 x 6 meters, 4 mm thick – and then cut to the architects’ specs.\n“Making evenly colored samples was difficult,” notes Schüler. “A discrepancy of only 5 nanometers would affect the color. We thus had to achieve nanometric \nprecision at a scale of a square meter.” Another problem was the size of the machines, which have to be at least 100 meters long in order to apply the layers of the filter. “We looked for partners in Europe, but companies here weren’t willing to take the chance. It turned out that Emirates Glass had the factory, the machines and the desire to take on this project,” said Nicolas Jolissaint, an engineer at SwissINSO, an EPFL spin-off. The two companies set up a joint venture, Emirates Insolaire, which provided the colored panels to cover the Copenhagen International School.\nThis building was described by Mother Nature Network as one of “5 solar-powered buildings that will forever change architecture.”\nCIS Nordhavn is the Copenhagen International School's new campus. The campus building was designed by C.F. Møller Architects and sits in Nordhavn, a new district in Copenhagen.\nPress kit", "summary": "The Copenhagen International School’s new building is covered by 12,000 colored solar panels based on a technology developed at EPFL.

In response to a request from the Brussels architecture center CIVA, EPFL contributed to the makeover project by loaning HOUSE 3.

{"id": 212, "text": "The race is on to optimize solar energy’s performance. More efficient silicon photovoltaic panels, dye-sensitized solar cells, concentrated cells and thermodynamic solar plants all pursue the same goal: to produce a maximum amount of electrons from sunlight. Those electrons can then be converted into electricity to turn on lights and power your refrigerator.\nAt the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces at EPFL, led by Michael Grätzel, where scientists invented dye solar cells that mimic photosynthesis in plants, they have also developed methods for generating fuels such as hydrogen through solar water splitting. To do this, they either use photoelectrochemical cells that directly split water into hydrogen and oxygen when exposed to sunlight, or they combine electricity-generating cells with an electrolyzer that separates the water molecules.\nBy using the latter technique, Grätzel’s post-doctoral student Jingshan Luo and his colleagues were able to obtain a performance so spectacular that their achievement is being published today in the journal Science. Their device converts into hydrogen 12.3 percent of the energy diffused by the sun on perovskite absorbers – a compound that can be obtained in the laboratory from common materials, such as those used in conventional car batteries, eliminating the need for rare-earth metals in the production of usable hydrogen fuel.\nBottled sun\n This high efficiency provides stiff competition for other techniques used to convert solar energy. But this method has several advantages over others:\n \"Both the perovskite used in the cells and the nickel and iron catalysts making up the electrodes require resources that are abundant on Earth and that are also cheap,” explained Jingshan Luo. “However, our electrodes work just as well as the expensive platinum-based models customarily used.\"\n On the other hand, the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen makes its storage possible, which addresses one of the biggest disadvantages faced by renewable electricity—the requirement to use it at the time it is produced.\n\"Once you have hydrogen, you store it in a bottle and you can do with it whatever you want to, whenever you want it,\" said Michael Grätzel. Such a gas can indeed be burned – in a boiler or engine – releasing only water vapor. It can also pass into a fuel cell to generate electricity on demand. And the 12.3% conversion efficiency achieved at EPFL \"will soon get even higher,\" promised Grätzel.\nMore powerful cells\n These high efficiency values are based on a characteristic of perovskite cells: their ability to generate an open circuit voltage greater than 1 V (silicon cells stop at 0.7 V, for comparison). \n “A voltage of 1.7 V or more is required for water electrolysis to occur and to obtain exploitable gases,” explained Jingshan Luo. To get these numbers, three or more silicon cells are needed, whereas just two perovskite cells are enough. As a result, there is more efficiency with respect to the surface of the light absorbers required. “This is the first time we have been able to get hydrogen through electrolysis with only two cells!\" Luo adds.\nThe profusion of tiny bubbles escaping from the electrodes as soon as the solar cells are exposed to light say it better than words ever could: the combination of sun and water paves a promising and effervescent way for developing the energy of the future.", "summary": "Today, the journal Science published the latest development in Michael Grätzel’s laboratory at EPFL: producing hydrogen fuel from sunlight and water.

{"id": 213, "text": "With more than 130 research institutions from Europe and around the world on board and hundreds of scientists in a myriad of fields participating, the Human Brain Project is the most ambitious neuroscience project ever launched. Its goal is to develop methods that will enable a deep understanding of how the human brain operates. The knowledge gained will be a key element in developing new medical and information technologies. On Monday, October 7, 2013, the project partners met at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne), the coordinating institution. Over the course of a week, neuroscientists, doctors, computer scientists and roboticists will fine-tune the project’s details. Six months after its selection by the EU as one of its FET Flagships, this project of unprecedented complexity, with an estimated budget of €1.2 billion, has now been set in motion. \nSix platforms to move the project forward\n The Human Brain Project’s initial mission is to launch its six research platforms, each composed of technological tools and methods that ensure that the project’s objectives will be met. These platforms are: neuroinformatics, brain simulation, high-performance computing, medical informatics, neuromorphic computing and neurorobotics. \n Over the next 30 months scientists will set up and test the platforms. Then, starting in 2016, the platforms will be ready to use by Human Brain Project scientists as well as researchers from around the world. These resources – simulations, high-performance computing, neuromorphic hardware, databases – will be available on a competitive basis, in a manner similar to that of other major research infrastructures, such as the large telescopes used in astronomy.\nNeuroscience, medicine and technology: the Human Brain project’s goals\n In the field of neuroscience, the researchers will have to manage an enormous amount of data – in particular the data that are published in thousands of scientific articles every year. The mission of the neuroinformatics platform will be to extract the maximum amount of information possible from these sources and integrate it into a cartography that encompasses all the brain’s organizational levels, from the individual cell all the way up to the entire brain. This information will be used to develop the brain simulation platform. The high-performance computing platform must ultimately be capable of deploying the necessary computational power to bring these ambitious developments about. \n Medical doctors associated with the project are charged with developing the best possible methods for diagnosing neurological disease. Being able to detect and identify pathologies very rapidly will allow patients to benefit from personalized treatment before potentially irreversible neurological damage occurs. This is the mission of the medical informatics platform, which will initially concentrate on compiling and analyzing anonymized clinical data from hundreds of patients in collaboration with hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.\n Finally, the Human Brain Project includes an important component whose objective is to create neuro-inspired technologies. Microchips are being developed that imitate how networks of neurons function – the idea being to take advantage of the extraordinary learning ability and resiliency of neuronal circuits in a variety of specific applications. This is the mission of the neuromorphic computing platform. The neurorobotics platform will focus on integrating neural network simulations into robots (initially virtual ones), who will benefit from new aptitudes such as learning ability or resiliency. \nNext milestone: 2016\n The platforms will be set up as part of a global, coherent project. For example, the scientists will depend on the brain simulation not only to better understand the mechanisms of neurological disease and identify new therapeutic targets, but also to update functional principles or even accelerate the development of neuro-inspired technologies. At the same time, these same technologies could contribute to meeting the simulation’s computational requirements. The success of the Human Brain Project depends in large part on the dynamics of exchange that will occur between its six platforms.\n The scientists involved in the Human Brain Project now have two and a half years to finalize the research platforms. Once these are established, researchers will have at their disposal the infrastructures, tools and methods they need in order to meet their objectives. Now, nine months after its selection as a EU Flagship, the project is officially on its way.\n---\nHuman Brain Project website:\nAbout the Human Brain Project platforms\nAbout the EU FET Flagship program", "summary": "The world’s most ambitious neuroscience project is underway.

It is so much so that, out of comfort, we often end by listening to the same customary playlists. Genezik, a piece of software invented by researchers from the EPFL’s Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS2), proposes to guide listeners in the exploration of new musical avenues and help them rediscover their own music and forgotten pieces as if listening to them for the first time. This is one of the inventions that EPFL is currently presenting within the framework of the Montreux Jazz Festival. The general public will be able to test it in the \"Chalet d’en bas\" through 15,000 musical pieces from the festival archives.\nMainly, what makes this program original is its possibility to create musical paths. It determines which pieces to put together when, for example, gently taking the listener from good old Aretha Franklin to Daft Punk, or even from a Mozart piece to Metallica. After choosing a single song, it creates a coherent route among tracks whose properties have been determined to be similar with regards to scientifically established parameters.\nFinely dissected tracks\n\"When cataloguing music, most of the programs currently used are based on tags or user reviews, explains Kirell Benzi, Genezik creator with his colleague Florian Carrere. Then again, a band like Led Zeppelin, for example, is generally classified as hard rock, but some of their songs, including \"D’yer Mak’er” are much closer to Bob Marley! Our program can easily identify it as such. \"\nGenezik’s concept lies in combining a thorough computer analysis of music signals and each user’s musical “DNA”. For each song, the software dissects data such as its rhythmic structure, timbre, harmonic progression, notes, their sequence, the spaces between them, disharmonies, and so on. Based on the “graph theory” each piece is represented by a node in a graph. All nodes are grouped and connected according to their similarities and they form sorting clouds under the categories of \"rock\", \"pop\", \"jazz\", etc. Consequently, each user’s musical DNA is gradually deciphered through automatic learning algorithms based on their listening habits.\nGraph networks\nTo integrate a human dimension to the listening process, the software is then able to record the listener’s instructions, who at any time can indicate whether she/he likes a transition between two songs or not. In this way, the system will consider this information in its subsequent proposals and, as a result, it gradually refines and customizes its suggestions. Additionally, the software comprises a social dimension as different users’ graphs can be connected to each other and form a network, enabling them to recommend songs to discover to each other.\nIn the coming months, Genezik’s creators will put a start-up together and launch an application for mobiles and tablets.

The yellow two-winged vehicle, which is able to dive down to 1,000 meters below the ocean’s surface, will take measurements of Lake Geneva’s turbulence for several weeks.\nOcean gyres, which are fed by wind and the earth’s rotation, are hundreds of kilometers across. Through centripetal force, as an example, they turn plastic wastes in the ocean into huge vortexes of garbage.\nGyres occur in Lake Geneva as well, the result of the lake topographic form and the prevailing wind along the lake axis. From June to October, two gyres, each around 10 kilometers in diameter, often form in the widest parts of the lake south-west of Morges and south-east of Lausanne. The researchers decided to study the first one, where there are fewer boats around that could collide with the glider whenever it surfaces.\nWe still have a lot to learn about gyres. Just ask Alexander LeBaron Forrest, professor at the University of California, Davis, and a top expert in this field. He has led several research projects into gyres around the world using autonomous robots. He has also gathered data in Lake Tahoe in California, which is similar to Lake Geneva in a number of ways. “Our goal is to measure turbulence in gyres as accurately as possible, so that we can learn more about how the hydrodynamics affects the lake environment.”\nWhat does the gyre at the eastern end of Lake Geneva stir up in the middle of the lake and wash onto the lakeshore?\n What is its impact on the nutrients that it pulls up to the surface or down to the depths? What role does it play in oxygenating the water’s surface? How much chlorophyll does it hold? Oscar Sepúlveda, from EPFL's Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory (APHYS), hopes to identify the gyre’s impact on the layer of phytoplankton that forms each summer in the lake’s waters: “I’d like to know whether the turbulent mixing caused by the gyre affects the structure and distribution of phytoplankton in the lake.”\nTo answer all these questions, it took the expertise of Alcherio Martinoli who heads the Doctoral Program in Robotics, Control and Intelligent Systems (DISAL) but also a battery of sensors integrated into their own robots. These include a miniaturized high-frequency temperature sensor implemented at EPFL’s labs by Hydromea, one of the school’s startups.\n“We used to collect data by attaching sensors to a profiler and dropping them straight down into the water from a boat. We learned a lot about turbulence and exchange with the sediment using this technique, but unfortunately only at specific locations. With this advanced glider from UC Davis, we will be able to cover very large areas within the gyre,” says Johny Wüest, who heads the APHYS lab and is also a researcher in Aquatic Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag).\nThe glider can operate autonomously for several days at a time, surfacing every four hours to transmit some of its data via a satellite connection. Since it is not self-propelled, the glider does not interfere with the measurements it takes. It can descend to a maximum depth of 250 meters in Lake Geneva, moving up and down as it glides by changing its center of gravity and the position of its batteries. This yo-yo path means it can collect data both vertically and laterally throughout its journey of many km length.\nPress Kit:\n https://go.epfl.ch/glider\nContacts\n Sandy Evangelista \nPress Service EPFL\n \n +41 79 502 81 06\nProfessor Alfred Johny Wüest\n Head of Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory - Margaretha Kamprad Chair\n +41 21 69 38004, +41 21 69 36368\nOscar Rodrigo Sepúlveda Steiner \n Doctoral assistant of Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory - Margaretha Kamprad Chair\n +41 21 69 33938\nProfessor Alexander Lebaron Forrest\n · Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n Visiting Professor to the Physics of Aquatic Systems Laboratory - Margaretha Kamprad Chair\n +41 21 69 38004", "summary": "Huge systems of rotating water masses - called gyres - form in oceans and large lakes.

While the chair slowly moves around a room, avoiding obstacles along the way, Tavella remains eerily still and concentrated. His thoughts activate specific brain patterns that are recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a helmet with electrodes. These patterns are then interpreted by a computer that transmits a command to the chair.\n“When I want to turn left, I imagine moving my left hand,” says Tavella. “And this is very natural and very quick; I can send a command in about a second.”\nIt took Tavella a couple of hours for his brain to adapt to the system, and in turn the system adapts to the particularities of the brain that is controlling the machine—it is a process of mutual apprenticeship between human and machine.\nArtificial intelligence helping the brain \nThe current brain-machine interface allows for comfortable piloting of the wheelchair, but it remains rudimentary. To compensate for the simple but effective tertiary input (left/right/forward), and to take some of the pressure off the user, a system using artificial intelligence is used. Called \"shared control\", two small cameras, situated on each side of the chair, along with image-processing software help avoid obstacles.\nTom Carlson, from Imperial College London, has recently joined the Neuroprosthetic Center to improve the \"shared control\" piloting. “We are looking to improve the security and precision of the system,” explains the young research associate.\nThe system requires advanced artificial intelligence—it will need to distinguish between different types of objects: furniture, people, and doorways. Carlson explains that “if it is a cabinet, the chair should be directed around it. But if it is a desk, the chair will have to recognize it and approach it appropriately.”\nIn the future, the system will be able to interpret the user’s higher-level intentions. “We are trying to analyze different brain patterns, such as error-related potentials that may help to disambiguate the intentions of the user,” says Carlson. “Does the user want to avoid the desk or is it his, and should the chair pull up to it so he can work?”\nHuman and artificial intelligence are intricately intertwined and this complex interaction requires competences from varying fields: electronic, neuroscientific, computer programming.

{"id": 224, "text": "The Universe is expanding, but there is still a great deal that we don’t know. How fast is it spreading? Why is the process speeding up, pushing various celestial objects away from each other, when the force of gravity should instead be drawing them together? What roles do dark matter and dark energy play? Questions like these – which are central to current astrophysics research – may soon find answers, thanks to a fleet of EPFL-designed microrobots.\nThese microrobots developed by EPFL scientists are expected to produce a surge in the amount and quality of astrophysics data we can gather, thus expanding our knowledge. It consists of a collection of 1,000 tiny robots, which were recently manufactured and delivered to Ohio State University. In time, they will be fitted to two telescopes – the Irénée du Pont telescope, at the Carnegie Institution for Science's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, and the Sloan Foundation telescope at New Mexico’s Apache Point Observatory – which are part of the international Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). EPFL is playing an active role in the SDSS (see  from July 2020).\nThe robots will be used to automate the positioning of hundreds of optical fibers which serve to direct the telescopes towards objects in space. The primary targets will be stars within our own galaxy, the Milky Way. By measuring the stars’ luminosity, scientists can calculate the “redshift” (i.e., the increase in the emitted light wavelength) of nearby galaxies that harbor black holes or that are part of clusters, and determine how far away they are. These measurements will help flesh out SDSS’ 3D map of the Universe’s stars and galaxies.\nSome of the microrobots during manufacture. © 2021 EPFL\nA painstaking task\nUp to now, the optical fibers in the SDSS telescopes have been positioned by hand – a lengthy, painstaking task that demands extreme precision. For the telescope to be able to observe celestial objects, hundreds of fibers need to be placed in holes set in a massive aluminum plate. There is no room for error: each fiber has to be positioned to the nearest micron to ensure that the image is perfectly in focus.\nUnder the current method, it takes a month to select the target stars and design, manufacture and drill the plates, which are then dispatched to the observatory. Then an experienced pair of hands needs 45 minutes to correctly position the thousand fibers. What’s more, on observing nights, twenty minutes are required to switch plates, during which the telescope is offline. “The Swiss robots speed up this process by orders of magnitude opening up the possibility of large-scale spectroscopic time-domain exploration”, rejoice Juna Kollmeier, Director of the SDSS-V project.\nThe positioner robots are expected to be operational at the Sloan telescope this fall and in Chile early next year.\nDoubling and tripling the number of stars observed\n“In addition to huge gains in flexibility and accuracy, we also hope to substantially increase the number of objects we can observe,” says Mohamed Bouri, head of EPFL’s Rehabilitation and Assistive Robotics group and the scientist in charge of designing the robots and getting them up and running. “This will allow us to shorten observation times and double or triple the number of stars and galaxies we can target. We will also be able to use spectroscopy to observe elements of the variable universe, such as exploding stars,” says Jean-Paul Kneib, head of EPFL's Laboratory of Astrophysics (LASTRO). \nJean-Paul Kneib and Mohamed Bouri. © 2021 EPFL / A.Herzog\nThis initiative is being spearheaded by EPFL's Astrobots group, which aims to promote synergies between the fields of astrophysics and robotics.

By late 2019, working closely with the University of Michigan and the University of Berkeley, the group had already helped build 5,000 robots for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which is designed to better understand dark energy.\nThere is little doubt that the DESI and SDSS will expand the horizons of both astronomers and astrophysicists alike, resulting – in the years to come – in a richer and more detailed map of the Universe. But this is just the beginning: EPFL scientists are already hard at work on a new generation of smaller, equally robust microrobots.\nThe 1,000 robots were designed and certified at EPFL and built and assembled by Swiss company Micro Precision Systems (MPS) using micromotors supplied by Faulhaber.

The new diagnostic tool developed by the start-up Lunaphore, which is both inexpensive and easy to use, enables doctors to perform an accurate assessment of the disease in merely a few minutes. Several hours are currently required.\nThis microfluidic system also improves accuracy. At the start of clinical trials carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Pathology at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), analyses were made of 76 samples of breast tumors. The traditional method of analysis gave ambiguous results for 27 of them, against 3 with this new technology. In other cases, the analysis proved to be 100% correct.\nThe current technology requires bathing the samples in a full antibody solution for a long period of time so that the entire fabric is penetrated. In this prolonged bath, the results can be false because the antibodies may cling to the wrong place. With the microfluidic chip developed by Ata Tuna Ciftlik during his PhD at EPFL, the sample is irrigated evenly over a definite time span.\nThe device comes in the form of a chip made of glass and silicone with tiny channels 100 microns in diameter.

{"id": 229, "text": "A few weeks ago, French charity Solidarité Sida caused a sensation when it published a  as part of an awareness-raising campaign. The video in question is what’s known as a deepfake, a technique that involves using machine learning to fabricate increasingly realistic images and videos as well as audio and text files.\nThis use of a deepfake video by a charity highlights the growing prevalence of this phenomenon. While pornography currently accounts for the vast majority of deepfake videos, the technique can also be used to defraud, to defame, to spread fake news or to steal someone’s identity.\nEvolving threats\nIn September,  (IRGC) brought together around 30 experts for an interdisciplinary seminar to discuss this fast-evolving phenomenon and its growing prevalence. The IRGC has today published a report containing valuable insights into the risks associated with deepfakes.\nThe headline observation is that these risks could potentially cause widespread harm across many areas of life. “Any business organization or activity that relies on documentary evidence is potentially vulnerable,” says Aengus Collins, the report’s author and deputy director of the IRGC. Deepfakes can cause a great deal of uncertainty and confusion. In a recent case, . On a society-wide scale, a proliferation of fabricated content could undermine truth and erode public trust, the very cornerstones of democratic debate.\nThe report provides a framework for categorizing deepfake risks. It highlights three key impacts – reputational harm, fraud and extortion, and the manipulation of decision-making processes – and notes that these impacts can be felt individually, institutionally or across society.\nWith such a wide range of potential harm from deepfakes, where are risk-governance responses most needed? The experts recommend focusing on the scale and severity of the potential harm, as well as the ability of the “target” to cope with the fallout. For instance, a well-resourced company with established processes will be better able to absorb the impact of a deepfake attack than a private victim of harassment.\nInterdependent solutions\nIn the report, the IRGC sets out 15 recommendations covering a variety of potential responses to deepfakes that could mitigate the risks they present. It also calls for deeper research across the board.\nOne of the main categories of recommendation is technology, including tools that can verify the provenance of digital content or detect deepfakes. At EPFL, the Multimedia Signal Processing Group (MMSPG) and startup Quantum Integrity are currently developing a  that could be deployed in 2020. “For any given set of defenses, there will be vulnerabilities that can be exploited,” Collins says. “But maintaining and developing technological responses to deepfakes is crucial to deterring most of the misuses.”\nThe report also highlights the need for a greater focus on the legal status of deepfakes, in order to clarify how laws in areas such as defamation, harassment and copyright apply to synthetic content.\nMore generally, digital literacy has an important role to play. But Collins cautions that there is a paradox here: “One of the goals of digital literacy in this area is to encourage people not to take digital content at face value. But there also needs to be a positive focus on things like corroboration and the assessment of sources. Otherwise, encouraging people to distrust everything they see risks exacerbating problems related to the erosion of truth and trust.”\nWider horizons\nWhile the IRGC report focuses on deepfake risk governance, this research is part of a wider workstream on the risks associated with emerging and converging technologies, which will continue in 2020. “We are currently deciding what our next focus will be,” says Collins. “And there is no shortage of candidates. We live in a time when the relationship between technology, risk and public policy is more important than ever.”", "summary": "EPFL’s International Risk Governance Center (IRGC) has published one of the first comprehensive overviews of both the risks posed by deepfakes and the potential responses to them.

{"id": 235, "text": "We used to talk about means of transportation; now we have transportation systems. Today’s smart systems are built around four pillars: sharing, automation, electric power and integrated mobility. Professor Matthias Finger and PhD student Maxime Audouin, both from the La Poste Chair in Management of Network Industries at EPFL, have published a new book* describing governance mechanisms that can help cities make the most of these changes. We spoke with Audouin about why governance is important.\nWhy did you decide to study transportation system governance?\nTransportation today is largely dominated by personal cars, and that has become counter-productive. Cities are gridlocked with traffic congestion – reflecting a major failure of their transportation systems. New solutions do exist, thanks in large part to advancements in information and communication technology, and they are generally based more on the usage than the ownership of the means of transport. They are paving the way to new kinds of transportation systems and making it possible to transition to a post-car, and potentially more sustainable, world. The transportation industry is being disrupted by four major shifts caused by the development of mobility solutions that are shared, automated, electric and integrated.\nWhy should cities be so concerned about governance?\nToday’s mobility solutions are being driven mainly by the private sector, where the goal is to generate a profit. For instance, Uber wants to have as many customers as possible, which means having more cars on the road and therefore greater traffic congestion. By the same token, a car maker wants to sell as many electric – and perhaps one day driverless – vehicles as possible, but if nothing is done to encourage the sharing of those vehicles, they won’t improve traffic congestion and could even make it worse. So we must look at how cities can regulate these businesses so that they also act in the public interest. Our book gives some ideas, which would help cities realize the full potential of new transportation technology.\nThrough technology like ride-hailing platforms, such as Uber.\nYes, but policymakers haven’t always had the right responses to these platforms. Many try to make them comply with regulations that were developed for conventional transportation methods. Others just simply close their eyes or try to ban them. But the companies behind these new platforms are highly disruptive and will always find a way to get around the rules. So policymakers would be wise to get one step ahead and start integrating them into existing systems.\nSo what should cities do?\nThe longer they wait to adopt new transportation technology, the harder it will be. That doesn’t mean cities should throw out the rule book and consider new technology as the solution to all their transportation problems. Rather, it gives them a chance to improve the current situation. Digital technology can give cities an unprecedented amount of data on how the transportation upstarts operate – this data can be used to develop regulations that help incorporate new platforms into existing systems. Also, it’s essential that policymakers set precise medium- and long-term targets for cutting emissions and reducing traffic congestion. Smart transportation systems can help them reach these targets – but only if the targets exist.\nYou have identified automation as another pillar of smart transportation systems. How should cities respond to self-driving cars?\nPolicymakers often forget to include citizens in their decision-making processes. But how can they make laws governing how individuals use self-driving cars if they don’t even consult the individuals in question? Many countries are vying to be the first to have autonomous vehicles on their roads – but, ironically, the percentage of people ready to use such vehicles is much smaller than one might think. Even beyond safety issues, it’s vital for cities to pass regulations encouraging people to share these vehicles. If all conventional cars on the road were replaced with self-driving cars that are neither shared nor electric, traffic conditions would not change – or could even deteriorate.\n*The Governance of Smart Transportation Systems, Eds.

{"id": 242, "text": "The holy grail for both virtual and augmented reality is to produce objects and lighting conditions exactly as they would appear in the physical world, ray by ray. EPFL startup CREAL has moved one step closer to this goal with a disruptive piece of tech that is arousing strong interest. Instead of superimposing two flat images to create an artificial 3D effect, the device projects images in a similar way to a hologram and provides multidirectional light that is almost indistinguishable from real-world conditions. The firm raised 7.3 million Swiss francs in funding late last year, and its prototypes have caught the eye of some major players in this sector.\nExisting virtual- and augmented-reality headsets are known to cause a feeling of nausea in some users. This is because of the way they create virtual objects: the system sets a fixed focal distance and the image is given depth by a programmed 3D effect. Devices at the more advanced end of the market use eye-tracking technology to adjust focus. But even this method does not get around the problem of accommodation, or the process by which the eye naturally adjusts as the distance to an object varies – so that closer objects appear sharper than distant ones, for instance. This phenomenon occurs when we try to focus on an object at different distances with one eye closed: bring it closer and the background becomes blurred, move it away and the foreground loses sharpness. In the real world, accommodation works in tandem with another natural process known as vergence, whereby our eyes superimpose two 2D images to create a 3D picture. But once we put on a headset, the harmony between these two processes is broken. It is this discord that causes us to feel nauseous.\nUltra-realistic light\nCREAL founder and CEO Tomas Sluka has developed a disruptive technology that solves the eye strain typically caused by headsets. His invention dramatically improves the light field, which is considered a missing key to comfortable smart eyewear because the quantity of light traveling in all directions – including reflected light – is vital to producing a realistic lighting effect. CREAL’s new technology generates a sort of simplified hologram that brings real-life detail and depth to virtual scenes, with the light and color of each pixel changing according to the angle of view. This breakthrough resolves the disconnect between accommodation and vergence, allowing the wearer’s eye to function normally and eliminating the sense of nausea.\nContinuous depth resolution\nSluka is keen to maintain his firm’s competitive edge and is naturally keeping his cards close to his chest. “Our light field technology produces a more realistic effect than any other system,” he explains. “It can support hundreds of depth resolutions, from zero to infinite. The resolutions are distributed gradually, with more closer to the eye and fewer further away.” In fact, the technology is so powerful that people who normally wear corrective glasses can use it without them.\nAlthough the functional prototypes are quite bulky and the firm still has some technical challenges to overcome, Sluka is confident that his system will find its way into augmented reality goggles at some point in 2021. CREAL has recently taken on 14 new hires and is ready to shift up a gear after raising 7.3 million Swiss francs late last year, including 4.3 million francs from investors, a 2.5-million-franc grant from the European Innovation Council’s deep-tech champions program, and a 500,000-franc loan from the Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). Sluka believes that, a decade from now, we will all be wearing augmented reality goggles. If he is right, then the market for his firm’s technology – which he plans to make available under a license model – could be enormous.", "summary": "EPFL startup CREAL has developed a new technology that brings real-life detail and depth to the virtual world.

It is also a complex, involving attention, perceptual, linguistic, and fine motor skills.\nYet, around one in four children experience handwriting difficulties and this can have ongoing developmental impacts, including trouble learning other skills, increased fatigue and behavioural problems, and low self-esteem, making early detection key to successful intervention.\nTablets and AI to collect better information \nNow, a new EPFL spin-off, School Rebound, has developed \n, a handwriting analysis tool that can provide a fast, accurate and reliable analysis of handwriting, assessing multiple dimensions, providing adapted remediation through different activities that target specific handwriting skills.\nEPFL researcher and School Rebound CEO, Dr Thibault Asselborn, says that by analysing a child’s handwriting done on a tablet, Dynamico can collect four times more information than in traditionally used, analogue tests. “Our research has shown that all speed and pressure data, as well as the angle of the writing tool, although imperceptible to the naked eye, are more important than static information. Our tool also removes subjective human bias.”\nDesigned in collaboration with therapists, the application then uses artificial intelligence to suggest innovative remediation activities specific to each child and their needs.\nA unique Kazakh experiment\nInitially available in French, with Italian, English and German in the pipeline, the \n from the team, led by Professor head of the \n (CHILI), published in Nature Science of Learning, has shown that the app can also be developed for different scripts or alphabets.\nThe researchers wondered whether handwriting skills transfer when a child writes in two different scripts, such as the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, that is, are our handwriting skills intrinsically bound to one alphabet or will a child who faces handwriting difficulties in one script experience similar difficulties in the other? A recent change of policy in Kazakhstan provided an opportunity to measure this as the country transitioned from Cyrillic to a Latin-based Kazakh alphabet.\nThey followed students in grades 1-4, measuring the influence of the number of years spent practicing Cyrillic on the quality of handwriting in the Latin alphabet. The results showed that some of the differences between the two scripts were constant across all grades, reflecting the intrinsic differences in the handwriting dynamics between the two alphabets. They also observed that, despite the differences observed across the two alphabets (the pressure, speed and other factors are different if a child writes in Cyrillic or Latin) the difference is constant across children. That is, a child that had handwriting difficulties in Cyrillic also had difficulties in Latin.\nThey found that the quality of Cyrillic writing increased across all grades due to increased practice, at the same time as the quality of the Latin writing increased as well, despite the fact that all of the pupils had the same absence of experience in writing in Latin. This improvement in Latin script can be interpreted as an indicator of the transfer of fine motor control skills from Cyrillic to Latin.\nCross-lingual possibilities\n“One interesting aspect of these findings is that the algorithms that we developed for the diagnosis of handwriting difficulties among French-speaking children could be relevant for other alphabets, paving the way for the creation of a cross-lingual model for the detection of handwriting difficulties,” said Professor Dillenbourg.\nThe development of digital tablets in the last decade has allowed researchers to tackle these problems as the dynamics of handwriting can now be assessed, this study shows the potential for developing tests for different alphabets or scripts, something that has not happened to date.", "summary": "New  on whether handwriting skills transfer when a child writes in two different alphabetic scripts may pave the way for cross-lingual digital tools for the detection of handwriting difficulties.", "claim": "New  on whether handwriting skills transfer when a child writes in one different alphabetic scripts may pave the way for cross-lingual digital tools for the detection of handwriting difficulties.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 12], "noise": false}

They flew to northern Russia in July and then boarded a polar expedition ship, the \nProfessor Molchanov,\n for three weeks of research in the Arctic Ocean, less than 1,000 kilometers from the North Pole.\nThe students – who came from EPFL, the University of Lausanne and the University of Geneva – were joined by Russian scientists in the “Arctic Floating University”.

The main goal of the project was to study the effects of climate change in this particularly vulnerable part of the world. The students were divided into two groups: one was based at a research station on Samoylov Island in the Lena River delta, and the other worked on the ship.\nBringing together several disciplines\nThe EPFL students carried out the research as part of a Minor in Science, Technology and Area Studies (STAS) at the College of Humanities. It was the culmination of two semesters of courses on Russia and on the environmental challenges specific to the Arctic region. Whether on the ship or at the research station, the students performed their own research or took and analyzed samples for the Russian scientists. Every morning they also took classes spanning a wide range of disciplines such as geopolitics, international law, geography, social science, meteorology, oceanography, biology, geology, glaciology, ornithology and zoology.\n“We learned a lot of different things, some more theoretical and some more practical, like how to use certain kinds of instruments,” says Séchaud, who is studying environmental engineering. “It was really interesting,” adds Roth, who is studying biotechnology and chemical engineering. “Not only did the classes give us a multi-faceted understanding of this region, but being able to talk with the different people on the project – the Russian scientists and students from other schools – was a great opportunity.”\nThe first polar albatross\nThe expedition also led to a number of scientific discoveries, especially in geology and ornithology. One student, while carrying out field observations, photographed an albatross – which could very well be the first of its species seen north of the Arctic Circle. Some soil samples taken by pedology researchers in Franz Josef Land seem to indicate a sharp increase in organic matter below the earth’s surface, which points to a change in soil type from polar desert to tundra. And the zoology experts saw a species of mosquito never before observed at those latitudes. Such findings, if confirmed, could be tangible signs of climate change in this part of the Arctic.\nEPFL students looked specifically at CO\n2\n transfer between the air and seawater. Roth and Séchaud were also involved in a research project that measured the mass of zooplankton between the city of Arkhangelsk and Franz Josef Land. “Physiochemical changes have a direct impact on the aquatic food chain.

{"id": 254, "text": "David Kammer, a doctoral student at , has developed a digital model that explains what happens at the interface between two materials when they slide against each other; like a book on a table, rubber soles on linoleum, or – more to the point – tectonic plates.\n Earthquakes occur at the point where two tectonic plates meet. Between each period of sliding, forces accumulate between them up to the point where the friction resistance is overcome, leading to movement. This displacement of the Earth’s crust triggers a shock-wave that is transmitted to the surface of the planet. The scientists  put the physics of earthquakes in the “top ten” of the most interesting scientific mysteries.\nAccumulation of energy determines the stick-slip\nWhen two materials slide against each other, they don’t always react in the same way, according to the prevailing conditions, such as rigidity or the speed of movement. Sometimes the sliding is regular and homogenous; in the case of tectonic plates, the movement is hardly felt, or not at all. At other times, there is a succession of phases of stopping or speeding up, called “stick-slip”. Earthquakes are the result of sudden movement.\n These heterogenous movements systematically trigger a shock-wave at the surface. But what determines the intensity? And why do some earthquakes create such devastation? David Kammer began by basing his research on experimental results obtained by external laboratories. “I wanted to understand the dynamics of the point at which the plates suddenly begin to slide against each other – in particular, the way it starts and is subsequently transmitted between the two solid bodies in contact. I discovered that the accumulation of energy at the breaking-point of the interface determines the acceleration of the sliding.” \n The doctoral student, whose research results are being published in the journal Tribology Letters, has thus discovered another path to explore for the communities of mechanics and geoscience, by revealing that the energy-related aspects are critical.\n\"This research is supported by the European Research Council (ERC-StG UFO-240332) \"", "summary": "Scientists have succeeded in modelling what happens when two bodies slide against each other and thereby release the pressure; a discovery that has implications for the understanding of the magnitude of earthquakes.", "claim": "Scientists have succeeded in modelling what happens when ten bodies slide against each other and thereby release the pressure; a discovery that has implications for the understanding of the magnitude of earthquakes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [8, 8], "noise": false}

They are also involved in the aging processes and muscular performance.\nAt EPFL, the Laboratory of Integrated Systems Physiology (LISP) is specialized in the study of such cellular organelles. Its director, Johan Auwerx, is one of the co-founders of Mitokyne, a spin-off whose goal is to develop therapeutic molecules targeting mitochondria. He founded it together with three distinguished colleagues: Bob Horwitz (Nobel Prize) from MIT, Andrew Dillin from the University of California at Berkeley and Ron Evans (Lasker Award) from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. The start-up mainly takes aim at orphan diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction.\nFrom extremely rare cases to a global scale\n According to Johan Auwerx, \"the interest in mitochondria and the rare diseases associated to them opens extremely interesting perspectives for developing drugs that could be able to tackle more common diseases.\" That is how drugs for lowering cholesterol – today’s best-selling medications – were developed. \"Statins were originally developed to treat a very rare and violent form of hypercholesterolemia, said the researcher. Only afterwards were they prescribed for treating a less severe form of the disease – for a current turnover of 35 billion dollars.\"\nMitokyne’s objective is to fight mitochondrial related diseases, which can cause blindness, deafness, chronic muscle weakness or neurological disorders. \"The molecules that we will develop for treating extreme forms of these diseases are very likely to also work on less severe ones or on types occurring at an advanced age, such as glaucoma, hearing loss, sarcopenia and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's diseases, estimated Auwerx.

Mercedes-Benz reached out to the two entrepreneurs last spring, asking them to develop a version for a new concept car. They quickly accepted the challenge, repurposing the little fold-up joystick and stripping it of its haptic function. Salerno and Mintchev then headed to Mercedes-Benz’s head office in Germany, where they ran a series of tests and explained the ins and outs of their technology to the firm’s engineers.\nThe new robots – the result of several months of design and development work – also have applications in advertising and other visual media, where they can create moving images for branding or color effects.", "summary": "Yesterday evening, tiny robots developed by EPFL spin-off Foldaway Haptics were the center of attention at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

{"id": 266, "text": "With a drone, things like letters, medicine, first-aid supplies and food can be delivered quickly, cheaply and autonomously without having to worry about traffic, blocked roads or a lack of roads. Some companies will surely come to rely on these drones. And engineers will be called on to develop ever more sophisticated models to keep pace with this new facet of e-commerce.\nThe drone, which has been designed in EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems with funding of NCCR Robotics, is equipped with several innovations that make it particularly safe, autonomous and easy to transport.\nThe unique idea here is that the drone becomes the package that wraps around the cargo before flight, just like a mail package. The foldable carbon-fiber cage protects the drone and the cargo in case of a collision or fall. What’s more, the recipient can catch the drone mid-flight without being injured by the propellers, which are located within the structure and have a safety system so that they stop when the cage is opened.\nThe origami-inspired design means that the frame can be folded and unfolded in a single movement. It can be flattened in just a few seconds, reducing the drone's volume by 92% so that it can easily be slipped inside a backpack.\n An accurate, self-flying drone\nThe drone – a multicopter with four propellers – can take off and land vertically, which enhances its accuracy. And it can carry a package weighing up to 500 grams over a distance of 2 kilometers.\nThe drone contains specially designed self-flying software to program the delivery. A flight plan is created to ensure it avoids obstacles such as trees and buildings. The drone can then be tracked in real time on a tablet or smartphone. And once the package has been delivered, the drone makes its way back on its own. The device also has a safety system to prevent it from being hacked.\n“This project is a work in progress - in addition to strengthening its ability to detect and avoid objects, we are exploring possibilities to increase the drone’s payload capacity and enhance its autonomy, ”says Przemyslaw Kornatowski, who developed the drone. \"Throughout the summer, we tested our human-friendly, drone-delivery system on the EPFL campus, delivering items to people over 150 test flights\".

In heart attack situations, time is of the essence in preventing death.\n This new tool is one of a new generation of embedded systems that are intelligent and autonomous; as they monitor human biological systems, these so-called “wireless body sensor networks,” (WBSN) consume very little electricity. They’re made up of high-precision body sensors applied to the skin, a ZigBee radio module and a chip that’s optimized for analyzing and processing biological signals. \n They’re miniaturized, so everything is light and non-invasive. Connected to a wireless network, they monitor users’ heart rates remotely and in real time. By means of complex algorithms, anomalies can be detected and analyzed. When a problem is detected, information is sent to the user’s smartphone, then by text message or e-mail to medical personnel, who can intervene if necessary. \n “This system collects very reliable and precise data, it’s equipped with a very effective noise filtering system, and it has batteries that can last for 3-4 weeks at a time,” notes EPFL professor David Atienza, head of EPFL’s Embedded Systems Lab. “Above all it provides an automatic analysis and immediate transmission of data in compressed format to the doctor, preventing him or her from having to work through hours of recorded data.”\n “Its size, its lightness, its ease of use, the fact that it measures continuously and remotely, which allows analysis to take place anywhere, makes this device very attractive to doctors,” says Etienne Pruvot, a cardiologist in the Lausanne University Hospitals (CHUV) Cardiology Service, who adds that the system still needs to be tested in real-life conditions. \n According to Atienza, other applications, such as monitoring athletic performance, are also possible.

{"id": 280, "text": "Solar energy appears to be the only form of renewable that can be exploited at level that matches the world’s growing needs. However, it is equally necessary to find efficient ways to store solar energy in order to ensure a consistent energy supply when sunlight is scarce. One of the most efficient ways to achieve this is to use solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and get the energy back by consuming hydrogen in a fuel cell. Publishing in \nNature Communications\n, scientists from two labs at EPFL have found a method to create a high-efficiency, scalable solar water splitting device using cheap materials.\nAlthough one of the best means of sourcing renewable energy, solar systems cannot consistently produce adequate energy since sunlight varies from time to time and place to place. A solution to this problem is a device that can store energy in the form of hydrogen for later use, offering a consistent output over time with very little pollution.\nOne of the most sustainable methods of producing hydrogen is photoelectrochemical water-splitting. Solar energy is used to break water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen through a process called “hydrogen evolution reaction”. This reaction requires a catalyst, which is a chemical agent that increases its speed. In photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices, a common catalyst used to split water is platinum, which is deposited on the surface of the solar panel’s photocathode – the solar panel’s electrode that converts light into electric current.\nA research team at EPFL has now found a way to make efficient solar-powered water splitting devices using abundant and cheap materials. The group of Xile Hu developed a molybdenum-sulfide catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the group of Michael Grätzel developed copper(I) oxide as a photocathode. The researchers found that the molybdenum sulfide can be deposited on the copper(I) oxide photocathode for use in photoelectrochemical water splitting through a simple deposition process that can be easily expanded onto a large scale.\nThe technique shows comparable efficiency to other hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts like platinum, it preserves the optical transparency for the light-harvesting surface and it shows improved stability under acidic conditions, which could translate into lower maintenance. But more importantly, both the catalyst and the photocathode are made with cheap, earth-abundant materials that could greatly reduce the cost of photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices in the future. According to senior author Xile Hu, the work represents a state-of-the-art example for solar hydrogen production devices.\nReference:\nMorales-Guio CG, David Tilley S, Vrubel H, Grätzel M, Hu X. 2013.

Therefore by continuously monitoring these biomarker concentrations on our skin’s surface, doctors can spot such turns for the worse and act immediately, preventing complications and saving lives. That’s the idea behind the latest development work being done at Xsensio, which has just been granted CHF 1.8 million by the European Innovation Council (EIC) to adapt its Lab-on-Skin™ technology so that it will detect biomarkers specific to viral inflammations. Only 36 of the 1,400 funding applications were selected for the EIC’s two-year funding program, intended to support the fight against COVID-19.\nSimultaneous and continuous biomarker measurements \n“Our highly miniaturized Lab-on-Skin™ technology means we can create biomarker-sensing patches that operate continuously, which could be an important element in the future of healthcare,” says Esmeralda Megally, Xsensio CEO.

The bodily fluid collected by the patch is carried to the sensors via capillary action through a microfluidic system. The results of the patches’ analyses are immediately sent by Bluetooth to a smartphone app where patients and their doctors or, in some cases, athletes and their coaches, can view and store them. The miniaturized components require very little energy thanks to their structure; depending on the application, they can run anywhere from one day to one week.\nXsensio’s engineers developed the miniaturization technology in association with EPFL’s Nanolab. The patches’ small size, along with their ability to accommodate different biochemical surfaces, means the Lab-on-Chip™ system is modulable and can be used in a variety of monitoring situations.

{"id": 300, "text": "Researchers have simplified the steps to create silicon solar cells that convert sunlight to electricity with high efficiency by applying a new mix of materials to a standard design. Published this week in \nNature Energy\n, the work is a result of a collaboration between the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), EPFL, and the Australian National University (ANU).\nThe special blend of materials – that could also prove useful in semiconductor components – eliminates the need for a process called “doping”, which steers the device’s semiconductor properties by introducing foreign atoms, but also makes the device’s processing more complicated and causes losses in performance.\n\"The solar-cell industry is driven by the need to reduce costs and increase performance,\" says James Bullock, the lead author of the study. Bullock participated in the study as a visiting researcher from the ANU at the U.S. Department of Energy's Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley, where he will return soon as a postdoc.\n“Conventional silicon solar cells use impurity doping, which brings about a number of limitations that make progress increasingly difficult. If you look at the architecture of the solar cell we made, it is very simple. That simplicity can translate to reduced costs.\"\nThe majority of today’s solar cells use crystalline silicon wafers. The wafer itself, and sometimes layers deposited on the wafer, are doped with atoms that either have electrons to spare when they bond with silicon atoms, or alternatively generate electron deficiencies – so called \"holes\". In either case, doping enhances electrical conductivity.\nThese two types of dopant atoms are required at the electrical contacts to regulate the way that electrons and holes travel across a solar cell so that sunlight is efficiently converted to electrical current flowing out of the cell. However, doping itself can degrade its overall performance.\nCrystalline silicon-based solar cells with doped contacts can exceed 20 percent power-conversion efficiency – meaning more than 20 percent of the sun's energy is converted to electricity. Dopant-free silicon cells had never exceeded 14 percent efficiency before. The new study, though, introduces a dopant-free silicon cell – referred to as a DASH cell (dopant free asymmetric heterocontact) – with an efficiency approaching 20 percent. The cell is made with new materials and a simple coating process for layers on the top and bottom of the device. The study also shows that it is possible to create a solar cell in only seven steps.\nIn this study, the research team used a crystalline silicon core (or wafer) and applied layers of dopant-free amorphous silicon for surface passivation. Then, they applied ultrathin coatings of a material called molybdenum oxide, also known as moly oxide, at the sun-facing side of the solar cell, and lithium fluoride at the bottom surface. The two layers act as dopant-free contacts for holes and electrons, respectively.\n\"Moly oxide and lithium fluoride exhibit extremely high and low work functions, respectively, which make them ideal for dopant-free electrical contacts,” says lead senior author Ali Javey, program leader of Electronic Materials at Berkeley Lab and a professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley. “They were previously explored for organic devices, but they were not carefully explored by the crystalline Si solar cell community.\" Javey notes that both materials are transparent, and have complementary electronic structures that are well-suited for solar cells.\nJavey’s group discovered the utility of moly oxide as an efficient hole contact for crystalline silicon solar cells a couple of years ago. \"It has a lot of defects, and these defects are critical and important for the arising properties,” he says. “These are good defects.\"\nStefaan de Wolf, team leader on crystalline silicon at EPFL Neuchâtel (Switzerland) adds: “We have adapted the technology in our solar-cell manufacturing platform at EPFL, and found out that these moly oxide layers work extremely well when optimized and used in combination with thin amorphous layers of silicon on crystalline wafers, allowing amazing variations of our standard heterojunction approach.”\nIn the current work, the team identified lithium fluoride as a good candidate for electron contacts to crystalline silicon that has been coated with a thin amorphous layer, thus complementing moly oxide hole contacts. The team used a room-temperature technique called “thermal evaporation” to deposit the layers of lithium fluoride and moly oxide for the new solar cell. There are many other materials that the researchers hope to test to see if they can improve the cell's efficiency.\nAccording to Javey, there is also potential for adapting the material mix used here to improve the performance of semiconductor transistors. \"There's a critical need to reduce the contact resistance in transistors, so we're trying to see if this can help.\"", "summary": "A group of international researchers led by Berkeley scientists create a high-efficiency silicon device in seven steps.

Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier was the guest of honor, and his three conferences were fully booked.\n As in previous editions, EPFL laboratories shared their latest developments with the public. Young visitors were also able to make use of their creativity and skills in numerous workshops. Alongside EPFL there were Universities of applied sciences, vocational schools, associations and startups offering a comprehensive overview of the robotics business and its dynamics in Switzerland.\n Another attraction was the handout of astropodes to the first 5000 visitors. This peculiar creature is half slug, half scorpion and moves by swaying its body. Under its toyish appearance, it has definite robotic attributes. Finally, the valuable commitment of 450 volunteers was also for free.

{"id": 311, "text": "Mycobacteria are a category of pathogenic bacteria that causes tuberculosis, leprosy, and various infections that harm people with compromised immune systems, e.g. AIDS patients. When in the human body, mycobacteria produce energy by metabolizing fats through a “cycle” of biochemical reactions. Along the way, the cycle also produces a molecule that the bacterium can take away to use elsewhere, thus stopping the energy-producing cycle. EPFL scientists have now found that mycobacteria can switch between these two routes by using a “volume control” mechanism that improves their survival. The findings, , could prove critical for developing new treatments.\nThe molecule in question is called isocitrate, which, once produced, can go in two directions: continue the energy production cycle or be taken away to synthesize other parts of the bacterium. But if isocitrate goes the biosynthesis route, it must be replenished or else the energy-producing cycle will stop. Devastating though it sounds, this does present an excellent target for killing off an infecting mycobacterium.\nThe key to controlling which route isocitrate will take seems to lie in the enzymes surrounding all these reactions: the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase keeps it for the fat-metabolism and energy production cycle; the enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase divert it away into biosynthetic processes in the bacterium.\nThis motivated , in collaboration with the lab of , to look at how mycobacteria activate or inactivate the genes of these enzymes. The researchers used a genetic technique called “gene deletion”, which involves removing a specific gene in a bacterial strain and observing the consequences. Using this method, they produced various strains of mycobacteria without the genes that code for the enzymes of interest.\nThe results showed that the mycobacterium decides where to direct isocitrate by using a mechanism that is not like a simple on-off switch. Instead, lead author Paul Murima (EPFL) describes it as a thermostat that controls a home’s heating system in response to temperature fluctuations: “If the temperature becomes too high, a thermostat cools the house down; if it gets too low it heats it up. Similarly, the mechanism that controls how isocitrate is used responds to negative feedback, and so it dampens ‘noise’ to maintain optimal levels.”\nThe mechanism is appropriately adaptable and flexible, quickly responding to the dynamic environments in which the bacterium can find itself. Interestingly, the mechanism is also different from that used by gut bacteria. This means that if it becomes a target of future treatments, it should not affect the patient’s microbiome, which increasing evidence shows to be intimately linked to the healthy function of the immune system.\nThis study involved a collaboration between EPFL’s Global Health Institute and Protein Crystallography Platform, with ETH Zürich, the National University of Singapore, and Nanyang Technological University. It was funded by the European Commission Framework Programme 7 (SysteMTb) and the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nReference\nMurima P, Zimmermann M, Chopra T, Pojer F, Fonti G, Dal Peraro M, Alonso S, Sauer U, Pethe K, McKinney JD. \nA rheostat mechanism governs the bifurcation of carbon flux in mycobacteria. \nNature Communications\n 24 Aug 2016.

{"id": 321, "text": "“It was a risk to try living in my own architecture. But it turned out to be magnificent.” Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier, penned these words in a letter to his mother on 29 April 1934. The celebrated architect had just moved into the top floor of a building that he had designed at 24 Rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris, near the Bois de Boulogne park. This quote also opens one of the chapters of an EPFL book written about that apartment, which, from 1934 to 1965, served as Le Corbusier's painting studio and architecture lab.\nThe book’s authors, Giulia Marino and Franz Graf, are researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM). They were commissioned by the Fondation Le Corbusier, with funding from a Keeping it Modern Grant from the Getty Foundation, to come up with a list of guidelines for fully restoring this unique site so that it can be opened to the public. As part of their work, they had access to previously untapped sources of information, which they publish and cite in their book: these sources include photos, letters and first-hand accounts provided by people who were close to the architect.\nLe Corbusier tested out his architectural ideas in his apartment. As a result, it played host to a combination of styles dating from 1930 to the 1960s and ranging from a ‘purist’ interior to a ‘brutalist’ feel – Le Corbusier was constantly changing the apartment’s interior and trying out different materials as he experimented with architecture. So what should be considered the core period? What should be preserved? What can be done away with? What story should be told? The researchers came up against these and many other questions, always aware that they were dealing with a true legend – a legend they dented at times. We spoke with Giulia Marino in the run-up to the book launch on 7 May and the reopening of the apartment-studio to the public in June 2018.\nWhat sort of options does a restorer have in turning a famous architect’s apartment into a museum?\nThere are many examples of what can be done. You can, for example, recreate the interior, giving the impression that the architect has just stepped out. That’s how Ernö Goldfinger’s London apartment, which we visited, is set up. There, the concept is taken to the extreme, with cans of baked beans and a bottle of ketchup in the kitchen! But there’s a risk of giving the place the feel of a wax museum. At the other end of the spectrum, Milan architect Vico Magistretti’s former office has been turned into an exhibition space with offices for the foundation’s staff, although some original features have been kept. In other cases, the interior is left completely empty, like in Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye just west of Paris.\nWhat is it that stands out about Le Corbusier’s apartment-studio?\nIt’s a manifesto, a unique concentration of his inventions, such as the brise-soleil – which protects a building from sunlight – and indirect lighting. There is also Modulor Man, a human silhouette whose proportions served, among other things, to define the dimensions of his famous housing units. It is present in the form of stained glass in the dining room's bay window. In addition, we realized that the reason Le Corbusier covered some walls and ceilings with oak plywood was to hide water stains from leaks in the roof. This is rather ironic, since this type of paneling then became a fixture of modern architecture! From an ethical perspective, we found it impossible to favor one period over another. So we proposed to preserve the way Le Corbusier left his apartment – a palimpsest of eras.\nHow did the unpublished sources that you consulted help you develop your recommendations?\nA lot of photos were taken of the apartment, but many of them aren’t dated. So we had to come up with ways of putting them into chronological order, such as by carefully looking at the works of art in the images. By comparing hundreds of photos, we saw how the space changed over the decades, how furniture, materials and artwork came and went, and how certain aspects remained constant over the years, such as a red painted wall in the living room and the location of particular objects and paintings. Le Corbusier was a painter and a collector too. For us, placing carefully selected objects (paintings, rugs, sculptures) in strategic locations where they have always been is crucial if visitors are to truly understand the architecture and how the space was used. We also studied his correspondence, his bills and the impact of the countless – if not always felicitous – renovations that the apartment went through after his death. We also came up with recommendations on additional studies that are needed before any restoration work can begin, such as analyzing the layers of paint to identify all the colors used, since such things cannot be identified with any accuracy from the black and white photos. Now it’s up to the architect-restorers and exhibition specialists to review our guidelines and factor in the necessary security measures so that they can come up with a display approach that will be of interest to both researchers and the broader public.\nDoes the apartment-studio reflect Le Corbusier’s day-to-day existence?\n The apartment was indeed in keeping with how the architect and his wife lived. It was divided into two parts, separated by two pivot doors. Le Corbusier’s painting studio was on one side and the other side was where the couple, who didn’t have any children, lived – sitting room, bedrooms, kitchen and dining room. There is also a lovely terrace on top of the building. There are numerous stories about Le Corbusier’s wife Yvonne who, according to people who worked with Le Corbusier, was not allowed to enter his studio. Le Corbusier himself noted that, after his wife complained about 'living in a barrack' – an expression we find in his correspondence – he developed the principle of indirect lighting, in which artificial light is projected onto a colored wall. This invention became iconic both in his work and beyond it.\nVernissage and conference \"Les multiples vies de l'appartement-atelier de Le Corbusier\"\n Presentation of the 2nd edition of the ; Introduction with Christine Mengin, General Secretary of the Foundation Le Corbusier\n Moday 7 May 2018 - 6:30pm, Project Room, , EPFL.", "summary": "How should an iconic piece of modern architecture be restored?

Yet this young woman just spent the past month far from the school's halls and classrooms. She was taking part in the ACE Maritime University on board the \nAkademik Treshnikov\n – an imposing research vessel chartered for the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE).\nThe ACE Maritime University was held on the ship during its transit voyage from its home port in Bremerhaven, Germany to Cape Town, South Africa, where it arrived yesterday. The ACE expedition will begin on 20 December, carrying nearly 60 researchers on a three-month scientific voyage around Antarctica. The month-long ACE Maritime University hosted 49 students who study water-related sciences – including oceanography, hydrology and climatology – in universities around the world.\n Before departure in Bremerhaven, Germany, Oriane Etter discussing with Philippe Gillet, Swiss Polar Institute ad interim director.\nOriane was the only EPFL student on board. And her thing is fresh water: her Master’s project focuses on a specific part of Lake Geneva, where she is studying urban waste in lakes. The vastness of the ocean provided her with a new perspective. “The discussions among students and the classes we took on the ship opened my eyes to the wide range of ocean-related fields you can study”, she said a few hours before the voyage ended.\n Sunset on the Equator...\nWanderlust \nOriane, who is from Fribourg, has always been interested in environmental issues. She lives by this ethic, which has given her a desire to explore and brought her to EPFL to study Environmental Sciences and Engineering. It has also led her to a number of interesting life experiences. Oriane first learned about oceanography during her Erasmus exchange in Norway. That came after a gap year during which she volunteered on organic farms in Germany for a few months and worked as a whale watching guide in the Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia, Canada .\nThis 25-year-old has now completed the ACE Maritime University as well. Before the trip, Oriane looked forward to meeting new people on this adventure, learning how to operate oceanographic instruments and experiencing the multidisciplinary structure of the teams and work on the ship. She was not disappointed. \nOriane with samples collected in the frame of the afternoons' work sessions on the deck.\n“I'm struck by the vastly different backgrounds of the other participants and by the depth of the discussions we have about education, critical thinking, the role of science and climate change,” she said while the boat was sailing off the Namibian coast. “In our daily lives, it's easy to get discouraged by the feeling that people don't care about environmental issues or social problems in general. But here, we realize that we’re not alone, that we share these feelings, and that we have the same desire to take action. It’s extremely inspiring.”\n Sampling wih the Bongo net\nBack to basics\nOriane will never forget watching waterspouts form off the coast of Angola, where the sea meets the sky. “It was really fascinating – but also scary, because if they kept growing we knew we were in danger!” She also mentioned some of the presentations, like the one by Kyle Neumann, a student at the University of California. He uses remotely operated vehicles equipped with cameras to take underwater pictures.\nThen there's the human dimension of living in close quarters and sharing this type of experience. “All those card games, including jass, were really unforgettable. We won people over to Swiss culture through these games – and with the help of lots of chocolate.”\nSunset off the coast of Mauritania and swing course on the helideck.

{"id": 331, "text": "To generate electricity, Switzerland has been using nuclear energy for nearly 40 years, and its five nuclear power stations provide about 38% of the electricity required. It’s the second most important source of electricity in Switzerland after hydro-electricity. However, the Swiss government recently decided on a gradual phasing-out of atomic energy, and the existing nuclear power stations will be decommissioned over the next twenty years, with the last remaining installation scheduled to be closed down in 2034. The federal law on nuclear energy stipulates that nuclear waste must be managed in Switzerland: more specifically, it states that the waste should be stored in depots located in deep strata, which is considered to be the most appropriate solution for Switzerland. So how should we prepare for the safe and definitive storage of our nuclear waste? For several years, the Laboratory of Soil Mechanics (LMS) has been contributing to research into the identification of the best place for its storage. In parallel, the LMS is also researching into various tools for the evaluation of multi-barrier systems. We asked Professor Lyesse Laloui, the director of the LMS, about the current state of affairs from a scientific and critical viewpoint.\nHow does Switzerland currently handle its nuclear waste?\n Since the moratorium voted by the parliament in 2006, Swiss nuclear waste is no longer sent to France and Germany: instead, the 8000 m3 of waste is being cooled in enormous pools in Würenlingen in the canton of Aargau. This is only a temporary measure, since it is planned to bury the waste permanently in deep geological strata.\nAre there different types of waste?\n Yes, there are in fact two categories of waste:\n • Waste that is low- to medium-level radioactive, whose lifespan is short – from a few dozen years to 300 years maximum. It comes not only from nuclear power stations, but also from medical uses, industry and research establishments. We have a lot of expertise in handling this waste.\n • Highly radioactive waste, which will take several million or even billions of years to become inactive. We call this “final waste” – that which is at the end of the re-processing chain, and which is not possible to refine further. This is the type that we have to store definitively.\nWhich scenarios are favored in Switzerland?\nStorage in deep geological strata:\n Several sites are being evaluated in Switzerland. Once the location has been chosen, it will be necessary to create a network of tunnels one kilometer deep: the waste will then be stored there.\nVitrification of the waste:\n This means mixing the waste with a glass matrix. It’s estimated that glass can withstand heat, irradiation and degradation through contact with water for about 300,000 years. Each glass cylinder is placed in a steel container: this constitutes a kind of “package” of glass waste 8 meters long and weighing about two tons.\nThe fixing of vitrified waste in sodium bentonite:\n this clay expands in volume when it is exposed to moisture. It can absorb several times its mass in water, and – when injected in the storage tunnels – it expands and fills the spaces between the cylinder and the rock. Each country is carrying out research in different directions. The Swiss strategy is not to be able to access the waste once it has been sealed in the bentonite.\nWhat is the nature of your research work? Where is it carried out? And what are the risks?\nOur research is focused on the physical phenomena that interact in the course of the life of buried waste. We have to ensure a maximum level of security with regard to both natural and man-made barriers.\n In choosing the site, we’re evidently concerned with its stability.\nSpecifically, we concentrate on the connected thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical processes. Heat is an important factor: the waste generates temperature of the order of 150 degrees over hundreds of years. How do we ensure that the radio-necleotides won’t damage the vitrification?\n When we consider the environment below ground, water is everywhere: we regard it as the biggest threat. It can damage the steel lining by corrosion, which would have two consequences: the formation of gas – at the LMS we are trying to understand how this gas circulates in the tunnels – and the release of radioactive particles that could be transported by underground circulation.\nTo minimize risk, it’s therefore essential to develop performant evaluation tools for the various barriers designed to seal off the waste, and to test and improve the materials that would be used in the process. We are developing scientific research on materials and also scenarios for the optimization of technical solutions.\n We have analyzed the impact of environmental elements on the behavior of geo-structures. To do this, we worked with the Mont-Terri underground laboratory in the Jura region of Switzerland. The laboratory consists of a network of tunnels located 300 meters deep, that are cut into a type of rock that can be found just about everywhere in the country. Because of this, the data gathered can be extrapolated.\n We are also carrying out research on the enhancement of the properties of bentonite, which is the final protection and sealing barrier before the rock, and are currently in the middle of trials in the underground laboratory at Grimsel. We blasted bentonite on rock walls, and then after the drying process was completed, we took some samples, which are currently being analyzed at EPFL. We need to determine its level of hermeticity, its mechanical properties, its expansion potential and its density, and use this data to develop the best possible material. We’re testing various compositions of bentonite, subjected to heating at 120° in an underground laboratory in Sweden. Our own laboratory is involved in international research, and I’m currently coordinating a European proposal as part of the 7th framework program, as well as organizing an international conference on this subject, to be held at EPFL from February 1 to 3, 2012.", "summary": "If Switzerland does indeed abandon nuclear energy within the time-frame announced by the Swiss Confederation, the question of the burial and disposal of the accumulated waste needs to be addressed.

According to a study by independent news website startupticker.ch, they raised CHF 1.236 billion in funding – 31.8% more than the previous year and exceeding one billion for the first time. While Zurich was the region with the highest increase and took the top spot in terms of funds raised, Vaud came in second with over 20% of the Swiss total, or CHF 267.5 million. This marks the first time since 2013 that Vaud has not ranked number one.

{"id": 337, "text": "Both of the EPFL projects that applied for the European Commission’s FET Flagship program have successfully cleared the first hurdle. These projects are the Time Machine, headed by Frédéric Kaplan at the Digital Humanities Laboratory, and Health EU, run by Adrian Ionescu at the Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab).\nA total of 33 projects from universities across Europe have applied for the program, which is intended to support future and emerging technologies (FET). Only 17 of them – just over half – were selected for the second round, scheduled to end on 18 September 2018.\nA huge historical database\nThe Time Machine is based on the Venice Time Machine (VTM), a project that started in 2012 and served as a proof of concept. The VTM aimed to build a multidimensional model of the city that spans the past millennium, using millions of historical documents stored in a variety of formats. After five years, the project team has scanned 190,000 records from the Venice State Archive along with 720,000 photographs and 3,000 books on Venice’s history.\nThe objective of the Time Machine is to replicate the VTM across Europe. It will create a large-scale simulator for mapping 2,000 years of European history and turning the huge archives and sizeable museum collections into one big digital information system.\nMany universities are already in the process of building their own Time Machine to bridge their cities’ past to the present and connect the paths of history. Amsterdam, Nuremberg, Paris, Jerusalem, Budapest and Naples have all decided to dig through their archives and create a huge linked database on a national and European level.\nTo date, 170 partner institutions from 32 countries have joined the Time Machine project and formed a consortium to develop new technology for digitizing, analyzing, accessing, preserving and sharing historical and cultural documents on a large scale.\n“Making it past the first round of the selection process was critical, not just for our consortium but also for our cultural heritage in general,” says Frédéric Kaplan. “This is the first time that a cultural project of this scope – one billion euros over ten years and supported by institutions from all European countries – has been proposed. Never before has a continent-wide initiative aimed at turning our historical heritage into a key resource for education, research and the economy ever been attempted. This latest news brings us one step closer to making our dream of creating a time machine a reality for all Europeans.”\nAn avatar for managing your health\nWith Health EU, everyone will one day have their own medical avatar – a virtual replica of themselves featuring their own personal data – that could improve the way their health is managed and the treatments they are given. This international project, led by a consortium headed by EPFL and the University of Twente, aims to achieve enhanced disease prevention, early diagnosis, more accurate monitoring and customized, targeted administration of medicines and treatments, especially for increasingly common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular, chronic and neurodegenerative disorders.\nThe project’s core idea is to combine customized medicine with digital technology, using the latest technological developments such as connected objects and artificial intelligence, as well as the novel concepts of digital twins and organs-on-chips. Digital twins are essentially computer models that enable doctors to test and measure the effect of variables, processes and scenarios that would be impossible to apply in the real world. Organs-on-chips let doctors observe the biological functions of an organ or the effect of a medicine – but outside the human body. That has the advantage of avoiding side effects that can sometimes be extremely harmful and allowing treatments to be tailored as closely as possible to a patient’s needs. \n“The Health EU project will lay the foundation for a bright future for European healthcare in the 21st century,” says Adrian Ionescu. “It represents a human avatar-based revolution, where personalized medicine and the early interception and prevention of diseases will create an economically sustainable approach and enhance everyone’s quality of life.”\nProfessor Ben Feringa, who won the 2016 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the development of molecular machines, adds: “This is a very ambitious program that combines modern science and technology to create new opportunities for the future of healthcare and keep it affordable.” Professor Feringa is a pioneer in the field of molecular engines, catalysis and smart medication. \nHealth EU is being coordinated by EPFL in association with the University of Twente and HDMT (Organ on Chip association), both based in the Netherlands, and represented in the coordination board by professor Albert van den Berg.

{"id": 338, "text": "Mankind first set foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969. Five decades on, thoughts have turned to establishing a permanent settlement there. Over 150 students have descended on the mountain village of Zermatt as part of IGLUNA, a project coordinated by EPFL’s Swiss Space Center under the European Space Agency’s  initiative. The multidisciplinary teams will all be working toward the same goal: building a “habitat in the ice” that might one day be deployed on the Moon.\nSupporting human life in an extreme environment is no easy task. The students spent the 2018/2019 academic year working on answers to some of the many challenging questions – both human and technological – that such an endeavor raises. How should the habitat be structured? Where will oxygen, food and power come from? How will settlers communicate and carry out research? What about their health and welfare?\nDestination: Zermatt\nThe students headed to Zermatt in the Swiss Alps on 17 June for their field work. “The students are very much working as one team, sharing their modules and concepts,” says Tatiana Benavides, who leads the project at the Swiss Space Center. “Put it all together and you can see how people might one day live on the Moon.”\nThe students’ work is on display in two separate locations: conceptual and design pieces at the Vernissage Art Gallery (Backstage Hotel), and scientific and technical pieces at the Glacier Palace – Klein Matterhorn. . “As well as presenting their work, the students are also testing out the habitat and robots, checking whether the plants grow and conducting scientific experiments,” adds Benavides. “They may not be sleeping under the ice, but they’re operating in real-world conditions all the same.”\nEPFL shoots for the moon \nAt EPFL, students from several schools have been busy working on the project since September. The team, led by architect and lecturer Pierre Zurbrügg, built an igloo-like habitat 15 meters below the surface of the Klein Matterhorn glacier, which stands 3,883 meters above sea level. The structure, made from load-bearing and insulating materials, was designed and built by students from the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) as part of the “Living on Mars” teaching unit. “We had to factor in the practical constraints of the IGLUNA field site,” explains Zurbrügg. “For instance, we needed to be able to transport the materials, assemble the habitat quickly, and work in temperatures of -4°C. We opted for a brick structure that’s relatively easy to assemble. It took just three days to build.”\nWhat would life be like inside the habitat? “Our team thought long and hard about life support,” adds Zurbrügg. “Simply surviving isn’t enough. We needed somewhere people could actually live.” The students’ idea was to harness the metabolic processes of the people and plants inside the habitat to create a life cycle and keep waste to a minimum. They also produced a complete 3D model of their habitat, with computer-generated images and an interactive animation showing what different parts of the environment would look like.\nA team from GrowbotHub – a joint initiative between EPFL, UNIL and urban farming non-profit Légumes Perchés – designed a fully automated food production system for growing and harvesting fruit and vegetables in extreme conditions. “Our job is to assemble the structure and install the robot inside the habitat,” explains Victoria Letertre, a robotics student at EPFL who was involved in programming the robot. “The SWAG team from Zürich is responsible for the aeroponics systems, and for growing and tending to crops in the lunar environment.”\nThe EPFL team considered various other aspects of life on the Moon. For instance, they used 3D laser shock peening – a technique developed at the Laboratory of Thermomechanical Metallurgy (LMTM) – to design a saw capable of cutting through the ice. In another collaboration, this time between the Swiss Space Center and EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB), cameras were installed to monitor human behavior inside the igloo. Motion-capture algorithms were used to analyze the footage and identify where habitat design and safety improvements could be made.\nAn ongoing human and scientific endeavor\n“Our fascination with space comes from our natural curiosity and our desire to push the boundaries of human knowledge,” says Benavides. “Living on the Moon is an immense challenge. Yet the technologies that the students have developed could have applications here on Earth, too – in extreme environments or in the aftermath of natural disasters, for example.”\nAs IGLUNA 2019 draws to a close, the Swiss Space Center is preparing to run the project again next year. “It’s been an incredible learning experience on both the human and technology fronts,” adds Benavides. “Some of the teams are planning to continue honing their prototypes next year. We’re also looking forward to receiving new proposals.” The  closes on 21 July 2019.\n“For me, IGLUNA is a dream come true. I never imagined I’d be working on a robot that could one day be sent to the Moon,” says Letertre. “And if an opportunity arose for me to go into space, I’d be there in a heartbeat!", "summary": "On 17 June, students from EPFL and 12 other European universities headed to Zermatt as part of the IGLUNA project.

{"id": 341, "text": "In the field of photovoltaic technologies, silicon-based solar cells make up 90% of the market. In terms of cost, stability and efficiency (20-22% for a typical solar cell on the market), they are well ahead of the competition.\nHowever, after decades of research and investment, silicon-based solar cells are now close to their maximum theoretical efficiency. As a result, new concepts are required to achieve a long-term reduction in solar electricity prices and allow photovoltaic technology to become a more widely adopted way of generating power.\nOne solution is to place two different types of solar cells on top of each other to maximize the conversion of light rays into electrical power. These “double-junction” cells are being widely researched in the scientific community, but are expensive to make. Now research teams in Neuchâtel – from EPFL’s Photovoltaics Laboratory and the CSEM PV-center – have developed an economically competitive solution. They have integrated a perovskite cell directly on top of a standard silicon-based cell, obtaining a record efficiency of 25.2%. Their production method is promising, because it would add only a few extra steps to the current silicon-cell production process, and the cost would be reasonable. Their research has been published in \nNature Materials\n.\nPerovskite-on-silicon: a nanometric sandwich\n Perovskite’s unique properties have prompted a great deal of research into its use in solar cells over the last few years. In the space of nine years, the efficiency of these cells has risen by a factor of six. Perovskite allows high conversion efficiency to be achieved at a potentially limited production cost.\nIn tandem cells, perovskite complements silicon: it converts blue and green light more efficiently, while silicon is better at converting red and infra-red light. “By combining the two materials, we can maximize the use of the solar spectrum and increase the amount of power generated. The calculations and work we have done show that a 30% efficiency should soon be possible,” say the study’s main authors Florent Sahli and Jérémie Werner.\nHowever, creating an effective tandem structure by superposing the two materials is no easy task. “Silicon’s surface consists of a series of pyramids measuring around 5 microns, which trap light and prevent it from being reflected. However, the surface texture makes it hard to deposit a homogeneous film of perovskite,” explains Quentin Jeangros, who co-authored the paper.\nWhen the perovskite is deposited in liquid form, as it usually is, it accumulates in the valleys between the pyramids while leaving the peaks uncovered, leading to short circuits.\nA key layer ensuring an optimal microstructure\n Scientists at EPFL and CSEM have gotten around that problem by using evaporation methods to form an inorganic base layer that fully covers the pyramids. That layer is porous, enabling it to retain the liquid organic solution that is then added using a thin-film deposition technique called spin-coating. The researchers subsequently heat the substrate to a relatively low temperature of 150°C to crystallize a homogeneous film of perovskite on top of the silicon pyramids.\n“Until now, the standard approach for making a perovskite/silicon tandem cell was to level off the pyramids of the silicon cell, which decreased its optical properties and therefore its performance, before depositing the perovskite cell on top of it. It also added steps to the manufacturing process,” says Florent Sahli.\nUpdating existing technologies\n The new type of tandem cell is highly efficient and directly compatible with monocrystalline silicon-based technologies, which benefit from long-standing industrial expertise and are already being produced profitably. “We are proposing to use equipment that is already in use, just adding a few specific stages. Manufacturers won’t be adopting a whole new solar technology, but simply updating the production lines they are already using for silicon-based cells,” explains Christophe Ballif, head of EPFL’s Photovoltaics Laboratory and CSEM’s PV-Center.\nAt the moment, research is continuing in order to increase efficiency further and give the perovskite film more long-term stability. Although the team has made a breakthrough, there is still work to be done before their technology can be adopted commercially.", "summary": "In Neuchâtel (Switzerland), researchers from EPFL and CSEM have combined silicon- and perovskite-based solar cells.

{"id": 348, "text": "For months the 21 student teams selected for the fourth edition of the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition toiled away in secret, turning their bold ideas into unique solutions that could one day be the driving force behind a new means of transportation. Then came time to unveil their prototypes. It turns out that EPFL’s team, dubbed EPFLoop, and Swissloop, the team composed of students from ETH Zurich and the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, settled on the same type of propulsion system, a linear induction motor. They were the only ones to choose this type of motor, and they made the right decision. The conventional motor used by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) may have been faster – it reached a speed of 463 km/h – but the Swiss teams’ pods proved more reliable. Unlike TUM’s pod, the Swiss teams’ machines remained physically intact after reaching speeds of 238km/h (for EPFLoop) and 259 km/h (for Swissloop).\n“We’re disappointed with the outcome, of course,” says Martin Seydoux, the EPFLoop captain. “But we're happy that our pod, \nBella Lui\n, functioned exactly as expected. In all the tests we ran over the past week, up to the very last minute, the performance indicators were right in line with our predictions.”\nSo what went wrong?\nAt 9am on Sunday morning, the four teams chosen to compete in the final race on the 1.6 km vacuum track were hard at work. EPFLoop went second – after the University of Delft – at 11:30am. The pod’s batteries were fully charged and even heated slightly in order to boost their power. The EPFL students carefully loaded their pod onto the track following very strict procedures, and then the door to the tube was sealed and the air removed. On a giant screen, eight video cameras positioned every 250 meters in the tunnel displayed the rail lit by a series of black and white neon lights. Just like at a rocket launch, the pod’s mission objectives were announced in a detailed protocol: maximum speed, distance and braking. The pod pilots handed control over to the autonomous system just prior to takeoff: “Ready to go! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, launch!”\nAs the seconds ticked by, the onlookers watched \nBella Lui\n approach and shoot past each video camera in turn. At the same time, a curve graph displayed the relationship between the pod’s speed and the distance covered. 100 km/h, 150 km/h, 200 km/h…the tension mounted as the pod neared the sixth camera – you could hear a pin drop. The pod was approaching the seventh camera when the compressed air brakes suddenly engaged, grinding the machine to a halt. For some reason, the communication link between the control post and the pod had broken. Even operating autonomously, the pod couldn’t continue on its own for safety reasons, and so it stopped in its tracks after recording a top speed of only 238 km/h. The team will need to figure out the source of the communications snafu.\n“The EPFLoop students possess values that will be critical for the future of our planet, dedicating themselves to developing systems meant to further reduce humankind’s environmental impact,” says Mario Paolone, the team’s main advisor. “And the team made enormous progress over the past year. For the first time we used a high-speed linear induction motor and high-temperature batteries, combined with a carbon fiber shell and a robust autopilot that can operate even if some of the sensors fail.”\nTUM’s victory nevertheless left the two Swiss teams with a sense of frustration and disbelief. Although the German team chalked up an impressive speed record, its pod began to self-destruct while braking. Shouldn’t the team be disqualified for this? After deliberating for more than an hour, the organizers decided against that.\nAs expected, Elon Musk, who owns SpaceX, came to congratulate the four finalist teams in person. EPFL’s Martin Seydoux asked him whether he would consider applying criteria other than just speed – such as reliability – to the competition. Although Musk did not answer this question directly, the billionaire entrepreneur mentioned his hope of using a longer tube, possibly in the shape of a tunnel, in the 2021 competition.\nMarc Gruber, EPFL’s vice president for innovation, was on hand to support the team: “By participating in this event, EPFL showed that it is a global leader in innovation. We faced off against nearly two dozen teams from all over the world and finished third. Just as publications are a measure of successful research, student competitions like this are proof of our ability to innovate alongside the best of them.”", "summary": "Using similar propulsion technology, the Hyperloop pods developed by EPFL and ETH Zurich turned in a solid performance in Los Angeles: EPFLoop topped out at 238 km/h in the airless tube set up by SpaceX, while Swissloop peaked at 259km/h.

{"id": 351, "text": "Cancer cells are gluttons. We have long known that they monopolize large amounts of sugar. More recently, it became clear that some tumor cells are also characterized by a series of features such as mobility or unlikeliness to join in an ordered set. Researchers are calling this behavior “mesenchymal,” and they suspect it promotes metastasis.\nAt EPFL, Etienne Meylan’s research team was able to demonstrate that the two observations – appetite for sugar and mesenchymal behavior – result from the same mechanism, at least in “non-small cell lung cancer.” They also showed that the intensity of the phenomenon significantly influenced the chances of patient survival. Published in Cancer & Metabolism, this discovery opens up new potential targets for future therapies.\nA useful mechanism, but put to work by cancer \nMesenchymal behavior is not in itself an anomaly. During embryonic development, some cells acquire these characteristics. In adults, a few cells retain this disposition.\n“Mesenchymal behavior is a quite useful feature, but is abnormally reactivated in non-small cell lung cancer, which we studied,” says Etienne Meylan.\nThe mesenchymal cancer cells studied by the researchers produce a protein called GLUT3. The latter serves the function of capturing glucose to activate various growth processes. This is the protein responsible for meeting the cell’s need for sugar.\nBy artificially inducing mesenchymal behavior in cancer cells, the researchers found that the cells spontaneously produced GLUT3. This observation clearly shows that the same mechanism is at work. “This shift from one behavior to another, called epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is a highly debated issue. We have clearly established a cause and effect relationship between this transition and the glucose consumption of cancer cells,” explains Mark Masin, lead author and PhD student at EPFL.\nA case study confirms the results \nLung tumor cells produce widely varying amounts of GLUT3. This is because the gene is itself regulated by an element called ZEB1, and the amount of the latter is a function of many causes.\nThese variations in the amounts of GLUT3 seem to be a strong indicator of the aggressiveness of the tumor. By analyzing data from 450 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, researchers were able to show that the larger the quantity of GLUT3, the lower the chances of survival.\nPatients were diagnosed relatively early and were followed for several years. Depending on whether they produced high or low amounts of GLUT3, their survival rates over seven years spanned almost 20%. “Our data don’t permit us to conclude that the mechanism promotes metastasis, but it reinforces the assumption,” says Mark Masin.\nThe discovery identifies a potential target for future medications. Etienne Meylan imagines, for example, a toxic molecule that could be specifically incorporated by GLUT3 to destroy the cell from within. “Protected by the blood-brain barrier, neurons that also produce GLUT3 would not be affected,” says the researcher.", "summary": "Some cancer cells are characterized by both high sugar intake and high mobility.

On cloudy days it is impossible to imagine what purpose they serve. “The many fingerprints on them testify to the curiosity they generate,” says Mark Pauly, project head. However with a single ray of sunlight, the hidden function of these plates is illuminated. Looking up, one discovers four portraits of great leaders in science and architecture.\nThanks to the caustic effect, Marie Curie, Alan Turing, Eileen Gray and Rachel Carson appear under the vault of the RLC as soon as the light hits the metal plates. This effect can be observed everywhere around us. Glass, water and shiny metal objects often create seemingly random patterns on nearby surfaces through the reflection and refraction of light. When these models are used in computer graphics, they are referred to as caustics. Using algorithms developed by the Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory (LGG), researchers were able to control and organize this caustic effect into coherent pictures.\nAfter experimenting with this new technology by initially passing light through transparent acrylic plates, it took Mark Pauly’s team over a year and a half of work to achieve this amazing installation on aluminum plates. This time, however, light is reflected by the material.\n“It is a very detailed operation. We had to develop a manufacturing process that ensures the 3D surface computed by our algorithm can be achieved with the necessary precision,” says Romain Testuz, who specializes in digital manufacturing. This new computer algorithm calculates the smallest curvature of the surface to produce the image depending on various parameters such as the direction of light, properties of the material and focal length. What it comes down to is focusing light on the illuminated areas of the image and diverting it from the regions that should be dark.\nThe artistic and technological installation was completed with the collaboration of EPFL’s ALICE laboratory and ATPR workshop, and was christened, sol.id, in reference to both the sun and to the identity of the personalities in the images selected – and given that these blocks form geometric solids. “By their movement in space, we found that clouds gave an extra dimension to the installation by making the images disappear and reappear like magic,” said computer graphics specialist Yuliy Schwartzburg.\nThrough the successful installation of sol.id, the researchers were able to show that the algorithms they developed can be used in various fields such as architecture, design or technology.

{"id": 360, "text": "Databases have revolutionized the business world. Every bottle of shampoo you buy, every purchase you make, is just one more data point sent out to your bank’s and your supermarket’s servers. This enormous quantity of detailed information allows merchants to optimize their inventories and displays and bankers to optimize the flow of money. Gigantic farms of servers are deployed in an effort to keep up with this breakneck pace of information storage and transfer. Researchers in EPFL’s DATA Laboratory have developed DBToaster, a system that speeds up the pace of operations by a factor of 100 – 10,000. The latest version has just been made available on www.dbtoaster.org.\n“Ten years ago, CERN set up one of the world’s largest databases,” explains EPFL professor Christoph Koch, DBToaster’s creator. “Today, your average supermarket has a bigger system.” This inflation has escalated dramatically, to the point that optimizing databases has become an environmental issue. In the U.S., electricity use by server farms is growing exponentially, currently representing 2% of total electricity consumption.\nAvoiding data jams by accelerating the flow of data\n In a classic database, data are handled in a series of successive packets. For example, say a bank wants a list of all its clients who live in Zurich who have a balance of at least 5,000 francs. The user queries the database by selecting certain criteria. This request is translated into a series of mathematical operations. Because every banking transaction results in a separate database entry, the amount of information that must be sorted is phenomenal - the first operation has to search through billions of entries. The resulting data set is then sorted by the second operator, and so on, until the list is reduced to the clients desired.\nThe data are so vast that often the server’s RAM is not large enough to temporarily store initial results, causing a data jam. The server must temporarily store intermediate results on the hard disk before sending them on to the next operator. This slows things down considerably, because accessing the hard disk is 10,000 times slower than accessing RAM. It also requires much more electricity.\nThe EPFL scientists were able to get their system to compile successive operators as one single operator. This extremely complex operation makes it possible to store huge intermediate results. In doing so, DBToaster is able to efficiently prevent data jams.\nKeeping queries in memory so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel\n DBToaster has a second innovation, as well. The researchers took into account the fact that queries are often repetitive. “In general, the same operator is used many times within brief periods of time,” explains Koch. Rather than having to recalculate everything each time, the system keeps the preceding result in memory and merges it with new entries. “The big innovation with DBToaster is its ability to generate efficient code that manages to figure out how previous queries should be changed in order to be updated.” In this way, only recently entered data has to be queried, rather than billions of entries.\nDBToaster is available online for no charge. Financial institutions, in particular, are enthusiastic about the system. According to Koch, DBToaster \"enables analytical processing in real time, which financial institutions need to perform automated trading or to enforce regulatory compliance – for instance to detect patterns of money laundering in their streams of financial transactions.” But the benefits go farther than this. As data processing consumes escalating amounts of power, DBToaster is a solution that can be easily deployed on existing servers to reduce their electricity consumption and mitigate their impact on the environment.", "summary": "In gigantic server farms around the world, billions of database entries are queried every second.

An initiative like this can only strengthen the quality and impact of EPFL’s scientific output.” Her idea proved an instant hit.\nIn December last year, a committee of EPFL professors received 22 proposals. Following a review by outside experts, just six made the grade. “We set a number of criteria, including two key tests,” explains Fontcuberta i Morral. “First, the project had to include a significant element of risk – in other words, it had to be genuinely innovative. And second, the researchers involved mustn’t have collaborated with each other before.

Using a new computer program, EPFL researchers revealed some interesting statistics on the famous saga. Drawing on the principles of graph theory, which harnesses computing power and mathematical calculations, they analyzed hundreds of web pages devoted to the legendary film series created in the 1970s by producer George Lucas. Apart from highlighting Star Wars geeks’ prodigious output, their study could prove interesting for a large number of scientific fields when it comes to extracting and analyzing data.\nThe Star Wars universe is huge. In addition to seven full-length films, the story is further developed in ways the general public may not follow, such as books and video games, which have gradually added episodes and expanded the saga. The EPFL study, which was conducted at the Signal Processing Laboratory 2 (LTS2) under the direction of Professor Vandergheynst, gives some idea of the scope of the saga.\n80% human beings\n“Fans will be surprised to learn, for example, that we came up with over 20,000 characters,” said Kirell Benzi, a PhD student and the project lead.

But when it comes to infinitely small structures, manipulating and assembling high-performance nanoparticles on a substrate is no mean feat.\nResearchers in EPFL’s , which is headed by Jürgen Brugger, have come up with a way to position hundreds of thousands of nanoparticles very precisely on a one-centimeter square surface. The nanoparticles were placed within one nanometer – versus 10 to 20 nanometers using conventional methods – and oriented within one degree.\nTheir work, which was published in \nNature Nanotechnology\n, sets the stage for the development of nanometric devices such as optical detection equipment and biological sensors. “If we manage to place gold nanoparticles one nanometer apart, we could, for example, confine light to an extraordinary degree and detect or interact with individual molecules,” said Valentin Flauraud, the lead author.\n“Playing golf” with nanoparticles\n For their study, the researchers used gold nanoparticles that were grown chemically in a liquid. “These nanoparticles exhibit better properties than those produced through evaporation or etching, but it is more difficult to manipulate them, because they are suspended in a liquid,” said Flauraud.\nTheir technique consists of taking a drop of liquid full of nanoparticles and heating it so that the nanoparticles cluster in a given spot. This drop is then dragged across a substrate with nanometric barriers and holes.\nWhen the nanoparticles encounter these obstacles, they detach from the liquid and are captured by the holes. “It’s a little like playing miniature golf,” said the researcher. Each trap is designed to orient a nanoparticle in a specific way. “The challenge was to figure out how the liquid, the particles and the substrate interact at the nanometric scale so we could trap the nanoparticles effectively,” said Massimo Mastrangeli, the second author and now a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart.\nWriting out the alphabet with nanoparticles\n (Source: Nature Nanotechnology)\nTo show how well their method works, the researchers took on several challenges. First, they tested the optical properties of their system with a powerful transmission electron microscope in EPFL's Interdisciplinary Center for Electron Microscopy (CIME).\nThey then showed that their technique could be used to produce geometrically complex structures by writing out the alphabet with nanoparticles – the smallest segment display in the world. “All of this work was conducted at EPFL and is the result of strong synergies between the various technical platforms and the labs,” said Professor Brugger. “It’s an excellent example of how top-down and bottom-up methods can be combined, opening the door to numerous unexplored fields of nanotechnology.”\n -----\nSource: \nPartners:\nNanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory (NAM)\nCenter of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi)\n Interdisciplinary Center for Electron Microscopy (CIME)\n -----", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a method to place and position hundreds of thousands of nanoparticles very precisely on a one centimeter square surface.

{"id": 382, "text": "Luzzone, located some 2,150 meters high in Ticino’s Malvaglia valley, was a small hamlet used by mountain herders and their livestock. It was abandoned in the 1950s and today lies mostly in ruins. But this past weekend, the workshop’s 120 participants teamed up to restore and remodel the ancient structures.\nOf the hamlet’s original ten buildings, one is still being used, one is falling down and six others are in ruins. “These functional buildings were made entirely of stone and measured just four meters long by four meters wide. They served as stables and as mountain huts for herders during the summer and were typical of life in the Alps, and especially Ticino, at the time,” says Patrick Giromini, a PhD student in architecture and assistant at EPFL’s Arts of Sciences Laboratory (LAPIS) and one of the workshop organizers.\nRemodeling, not rebuilding \nThe students first identified the original layout of the buildings’ walls – which are now nothing more than piles of stones. Any stones sitting outside the perimeter of the hamlet were carried back to their original structures and used to rebuild some of the walls. This helped restore the volumes of the original buildings. Rather than reconstructing the buildings, however, the students put their creative juices to work in order to remodel them.\nTicino architect and EPFL graduate Martino Pedrozzi () came up with the idea for the project. Currently a guest lecturer at the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture at the Università della Svizzera Italiana (USI), he has been involved in this kind of remodeling work for over 20 years. “There are many examples of this rural heritage scattered throughout the Alps, not just in Ticino. The question is, what should we do with these ruins? Given their remote locations, they are virtually useless. But by remodeling them, we can give them a purpose: to serve as landmarks. That is a function they once had but have since lost,” he says.\nThe students’ project therefore aimed not just at preserving the region’s heritage, but also at bringing it to people’s attention and underscoring the importance of our rural memory. “It also introduced the students to the rigors of rural life. Every summer, for example, the farmers had to repair snow damage,” says Giromini.\nSurprisingly popular \nThe workshop was run jointly by three Swiss architecture schools: the Mendrisio Academy of Architecture at USI, EPFL’s architecture department and ETH Zurich’s Institute for Spatial and Landscape Development. This was the first time these three schools teamed up for a workshop. The project also received support from the municipality of Serravalle, where the ruins are located.\n“We expected around 30 students to sign up – ten from each school. But we ended up with 120 people on the registration list. We never thought our workshop would be so popular!” says Nicola Braghieri, head of EPFL’s architecture department and of LAPIS.\nAn unforgettable experience \nThe workshop also gave the students a chance to team up with peers from a variety of backgrounds. They travelled from Mendrisio, Lausanne and Zurich to the foot of Mount Luzzone, which they hiked up for 90 minutes to reach the ruins. After spending the day remodeling the hamlet, they camped out there for the night. “A workshop like this is always a unique experience and I enjoy them every time,” says Agathe Loeb, a Master’s student in architecture at EPFL and program participant. “You usually meet people from different schools and even different countries, who bring an entirely different perspective on architecture. Speaking with them can be really interesting – it opens your mind and breaks you out of your routine ways of thinking.” Not to mention that the entire experience – from performing back-breaking work to camping out in rustic conditions – is bound to leave a lasting impression.\nWhile this particular workshop involved remodeling stone structures in Ticino, the same format could be used for just about any kind of abandoned heritage site in the Alps. “At LAPIS, we have been studying the preservation of mountain huts and pastures for five years now, mainly in the canton of Valais. But since many of those structures are made from wood in addition to stone, we would have to adapt the workshop format slightly. It’s definitely something worth considering,” says Braghieri.", "summary": "Around 120 architecture students, including some from EPFL, took part in a unique workshop on Mount Luzzone in Ticino on 6–7 July 2019.

It’s this game of constant flux that drives gene expression asides essentially every other biological process.\nUnderstanding the specific details of how these interactions take place is thus crucial to our overall understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of living organisms. There are millions of possible combinations of molecules, however; determining all of them would be a Herculean task. Various tools have been developed to measure the degree of affinity between a strand of DNA and its transcription factor. They provide an indication of the strength of the affinity between them.\n“Commercial” devices, however, have one main drawback: many preliminary manipulations are necessary before an experiment can be carried out, and even then, the experiment can only focus on a dozen interactions at a time.\nMicrons-wide channels\nAs part of his doctoral research at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Sebastian Maerkl designed a device that he named “MITOMI” – a small device containing hundreds of microfluidic channels equipped with pneumatic valves. This week Maerkl, who is now an assistant professor in EPFL’s Bioengineering Institute, is publishing an article describing the next step in the evolution of the device in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The new version, “k-MITOMI,” was developed in the context of the SystemsX.ch RTD DynamiX in cooperation with the University of Geneva.\nThis microfluidic device has 768 chambers, each one with a valve that allows DNA and transcription factors to interact in a very carefully controlled manner. “In traditional methods, we generally manage to determine if an interaction takes place or not, and then we restart the experiment with another gene or another transcription factor,” Maerkl explains. “Our device goes much further, because it allows us to measure the affinity and kinetics of the interaction.”\nThe strength of the device lies in a sort of “push-button” in its microreactors. A protein substrate is immobilized on the device; above it circulates a solution containing DNA moelcules. The push-button is activated at regular intervals of a few milliseconds, trapping protein-DNA complexes that form on the surface of the device. “Then we close the lid, and fluorescence reveals the exact number of bound molecules,” explains Maerkl. “We can also observe how long these molecules remain bound.”\nIn addition to providing quantitative kinetic information, the k-MITOMI device can work in a “massively parallel” manner. Each of the 768 independent chambers can simultaneously analyze different molecule pairs. It can also be used to synthesize proteins in vitro, with a massive reduction in time and number of manipulations compared to the traditional method, which involves producing proteins inside a living organism such as a bacterium, purifying, and putting them in contact with the genes to be studied.\n“The number of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that remain to be characterized is phenomenal. Our device not only allows us to accelerate the acquisition of this information, which is crucial to our understanding of living organisms, but it also meets a need for the production of specific proteins,” adds Maerkl.\nThis research has been conducted with support of a SystemsX.ch research, technology and development grant (DynamiX).

Our new initiative with ETH Zurich and the ICRC gives our work added meaning because we know what we do will have a concrete, positive impact on people's daily lives.”\nA spirit of innovation\nAccording to ICRC President Peter Maurer, “throughout the ICRC’s history, there has been a spirit of innovation and of partnering up to develop new solutions. From 1863 to today, we have endeavored to leverage the best of science to aid those living in war and conflict. This is especially critical today, given the enormous, complex humanitarian challenges caused by violence, climate change and pandemics. We need to make sure that humanitarian services evolve so as to remain relevant, efficient and inclusive – and to meet peoples’ most pressing needs.”\nSeveral projects are already underway and others are in the pipeline. One current project, led by Carmela Troncoso, a professor at EPFL's Security and Privacy Engineering Laboratory, addresses privacy issues related to biometric data. Biometric data could be an effective way to eliminate redundancies in aid provision and make sure that the ICRC help reaches as many people as possible. Yet these types of data raise privacy concerns. Troncoso's project seeks to identify the ICRC's on-the-ground security and privacy requirements when processing beneficiaries' biometric data, and to design a system that keeps these data confidential.\nAnother project involves using artificial intelligence to map vulnerable populations. By compiling information such as satellite images and social media posts, the project will estimate the size and density of these populations, as well as associated information such as settlement type and changes in population. The resulting data will be fed into terrain maps. This project is being carried out by Konrad Schindler, from ETH Zurich’s Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry, and Devis Tuia, the head of EPFL’s Environmental Computational Science and Earth Observation Laboratory.\nIn the area of technology for personalized healthcare, a project led by Stephan Wagner, the Chair of Logistics Management at ETH Zurich, deserves special mention. His project aims to improve the availability of medical equipment in conflict zones. The goal is to reduce shortages and cut down on the waste of certain medical products. By analyzing medical supply-chain data and combining them with a qualitative assessment of the ICRC’s system, the project team hopes to identify the root causes of inadequate information flow, model potential improvements, and propose feasible solutions.\nETH Domain provides seed funding\nResearchers from both ETH Zurich and EPFL can propose projects under the initiative.

Equipped with LED and other electronics, the bracelet flashes when the cyclist reaches out to indicate a lane change.

The device consists of an accelerometer and a magnetometer - a kind of compass - that can detect the position of the user's arm. When the rider reaches out laterally, the accelerometer and magnetometer provide data to a microcontroller, which directs the LED to engage. \"According to the habits of the rider, it's possible to adjust the angle at which the LED starts flashing,\" says Pietro Buccella, one of the students participating in the project. The bracelet is also equipped with small solar panels connected to a battery. It is therefore possible to run it only on solar energy. \"We still equipped it with a USB port to enable recharging with a computer, if necessary,\" says the student.\nTowards a multi-function wristband\n At a size of about five square centimeters, the circuit controlling the operation of the wristband is too bulky to be worn comfortably. It must be said that the young scientists developed their invention in just three months, on their own time, under the supervision of the Director of ELab, Maher Kayal.\nIn the near future, the wristband will be miniaturized to the size of a small watch.

{"id": 403, "text": "Biology is swaddled in lipids: fats, oils, and even waxes envelop cells and their organelles, mediate the flow of vast biological information networks, protect fragile tissues, and store essential energy across multiple organisms.\nBut despite their importance, lipids have traditionally been among the hardest biomolecules to study because of the diversity of their molecular structures, which are not determined by the well-defined building blocks and simple rules that govern DNA, RNA, and proteins. And this diversity means that, unlike building and analyzing genome and transcriptome databases, lipids require more customized analytic procedures.\nBecause of this, it is very difficult to study either the physiological function of a vast majority of lipid species or the way they are so precisely regulated in cells. But while lipidomics technologies are progressing, translating their findings into medical applications and introducing them into clinical laboratories is still a considerable challenge.\nThis is the challenge that , in collaboration with  at the University of Wisconsin-Madison took on by measuring almost 150 lipid species in the blood and liver of mice. They also followed this up by identifying the genetic regulators of each lipid species as well as their physiological functions.\nThe researchers used systems genetics approaches to combine the lipidomics data with other “omics” datasets (phenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) from this population of mice (so-called BXD). The approach identified plasma and blood lipid species from different lipid classes as signatures of healthy or unhealthy metabolic states.\nFor example, the scientists demonstrated seven plasma triglyceride species as signatures of healthy or fatty liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Their observation was validated in an independent dietary and therapeutic model of NAFLD in mice and in plasma from patients with NAFLD.\n“This finding fuels optimism that lipid species could serve as signatures or biomarkers that will replace the invasive tissue biopsies currently used to diagnose diseases such as NAFLD – simply by measuring specific lipid species in the blood,” says Johan Auwerx.\nIn a companion paper published at the same time, the authors identify as signatures of healthy or fatty liver a subset of the cardiolipin lipids, which are the essential phospholipids in the inner membrane of mitochondria.\nIn both papers, the researchers pinpoint several genetic locations that may regulate the production of lipid species. By comparing the genetic data from the BXD mouse population to data from so-called genome-wide association studies of lipid-related disorders in humans, they were able to identify common genes between mice and humans that regulate lipids.\n“Analyzing lipids and finding their physiological role may never be as straightforward as studying nucleic acids or proteins,” says Auwerx. “But these companion studies provide a foundation for understanding the genetic regulation and physiological significance of lipid species, while yet again demonstrating the potential of Big Data mining to address biological and clinical questions.”", "summary": "Scientists from EPFL and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have carried out one of the most extensive lipidomics studies to date, connecting almost 150 different lipid species to their respective genetic regulators, revealing signatures of metabolic health and disease.

{"id": 412, "text": "Biofuels still have a long way to go to become sustainable substitutes for fossil fuels. A number of social and environmental hurdles have to be overcome, and crucially, their price has to come down to make them competitive. One way to make the overall process economically viable would be to process the biomass in biorefineries and transform it into additional high value chemicals for the chemical industry. Publishing in the journal \nIndustrial Crops and Products\n, researchers from EPFL present how one such source of biomass, agricultural residues from Brazilian oil palm plantations, can be used to produce bioethanol and two additional end products: furfural, a much-used industrial compound, and lignin, a solid fuel that can be used in the biorefinery.\nOil palm dates grow in bunches, which are harvested and pressed to extract oil, which is currently used for cooking, cosmetics, and the production of biodiesel, among others. The left over fibrous residues are typically discarded as waste. But as Edgard Gnansounou and Jegannathan Kenthorai Raman from EPFL’s Bioenergy and Energy Planning Research Group (BPE) explain, the empty fruit bunches are far from worthless. “You can make at least 30 valuable biochemical compounds using residues from palm oil production,” they say.\nSo are empty palm oil fruit bunches a sustainable source of biomass? And if so, what types of compounds should they be transformed into? These are the kinds of questions that Gnansounou and Kenthorai seek to address in their research. For this particular study, they characterized the composition of the empty fruit bunches and optimized the chemical processes for their transformation. These data will feed into an assessment of the environmental impact and economic cost that such a biorefinery would have.\nFrom oil refineries to biorefineries\n“If all you do with the empty fruit bunches is produce bioethanol, it will be too expensive to compete with fossil fuels,” they say. “But adopt a biorefinery approach to produce additional compounds that you can sell for a profit, such as furfural, which has many applications in the chemical industry, such as fungicides, special adhesives, flavor compounds and solvents, and you can lower the price of biofuel.” But even this, they warn, may not be enough to compete economically with today’s cheap fossil fuels.\nFor now, biorefineries exist as blueprints and computer models. Once mature, they will be capable of process and add value to most forms of agricultural wastes – rice husks, corn stalks and leaves, wheat straw, and green wastes, such as forest and garden residues. Because they all share the same basic make-up, long and shorter chain sugar polymers (cellulose and hemicellulose), and tough, hard to digest lignin, they can all be processed similarly.\nTowards sustainable biofuels\nBiofuel production has not been free of controversy, as the feedstock can potentially come into direct competition with food crops. But, say the researchers, second generation biofuels can avoid the first issue by only using biomass from non-arable crops or agricultural residues that are commonly incinerated or left on the field. And while in many countries palm oil production has been associated to deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats, policy in place in Brazil specifically promotes the use of degraded land for oil palm plantations.\n“There is huge potential for commercial scale biorefineries in the future,” the researchers say, citing the European Union’s target of having at least 10% transportation fuels from renewable energy sources by 2020 and increased support for bio-based chemicals as positive developments. Scaling up production will involve developing sustainable solutions to round up biomass from farms, plantations, and agricultural processing sites, and improving the efficiency of the biotechnological processes used in the biorefineries.\n“As the son of a farmer myself, I am excited about this work, as it adds economic value to something that farmers have a lot of: plant residues,” says Kenthorai. The development of biorefineries, he says, has the potential to stimulate the economy of rural societies, creating jobs in the collection, transportation, and processing of agricultural residues, and these new opportunities could potentially counteract rural exodus in certain communities.", "summary": "To cut the cost of biofuels, their production-process can be enhanced to include additional valuable biochemical compounds.

{"id": 421, "text": "In the world of the infinitely small, unexpected phenomena can occur at the interface between two materials when they are artificially combined. At EPFL scientists have shown that it is possible to generate a conducting channel with a width of a few atoms in the contact zone between different sheets of insulating materials. This work, just published in Nature Communications, could enable the creation not only of new micro- and nanoelectronic devices but also of a new kind of solar cell.\nTwo-dimensional materials\n To generate these tiny conducting channels, researchers studied two-dimensional materials, that is to say sheets of material a few atoms thick, sometimes only consisting of a single layer of atoms. \n Like graphene, these materials are composed of atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure, similar to the cells found in beehives. The difference is that while graphene is conductive and only composed of carbon atoms, the two-dimensional materials mentioned in the study are insulating and are composed of different elements.\nAmong many possibilities, researchers considered boron nitride (BN), which is composed of two kinds of atoms. In its natural state, a “sheet” of boron nitride acts as an insulator and therefore cannot conduct electric current. However, the technique, after a slight chemical modification, allows researchers to develop “leads” for conductive electrons.\nA proton sandwich \n The fabrication of the electrical channel is a two-step operation. It is made by fixing a proton (i.e., an hydrogen atom) on a sheet of boron nitride above each boron atom (B) and one below each nitrogen atom (N). Thus sandwiched between the hydrogen atoms, the “decorated” boron nitride sheet generates a conductive channel a few atoms wide when it is placed in contact with a “pristine” sheet of BN. The new “wire” located at the interface between the two sheets enables precise control of the circulation of the electrons when tension is applied. “Taken separately, the chemically modified sheet and the blank sheet are not conductive,” says Giovanni Pizzi, co-author of the study. “It is only by combining one with the other that the channel appears.”\nPotential applications associated with these simulations are numerous. The new conductive “wires” could particularly serve to develop more compact and powerful micro- and nanoelectronic devices. “The ‘wires’ produced by traditional lithography don’t fall below twenty nanometers, which means at least one hundred atoms,” says Giovanni Pizzi. “A few atoms wide, our wire could connect the different processors of a nanochip by taking far less space than current wires.”\nA new model of solar cell \n Applications related to these tiny conductive channels could also include the creation of a new kind of ultra-thin and flexible solar cell.\n When the material patterned with channels is subjected to sunlight, electrons present in the insulating part move toward the conductive pathways. “To obtain an electric current, it then suffices simply to connect the channels,” explains Marco Gibertini, who also co-authored the study.\nTowards experimental tests\n EPFL researchers now hope their simulation work attracts the attention of specialists in the experimental area to conduct tests in real-life settings. “In our study we provide a simple calculation that researchers can perform to see if a given material, after chemical modification, will form these tiny wires,” says Marco Gibertini. “Our idea relies on previous results on 3D materials. We have also intentionally investigated existing experimental materials and techniques. This should facilitate experimental tests,” he adds.", "summary": "EPFL researchers showed it is possible to create an electrical channel a few atoms wide within two-dimensional insulating materials.

{"id": 427, "text": "Imagine a network of smart solar streetlights that store energy to light up refugee camps at night and provide power to up to 25 families in shelters. Small-scale solar appliances such as solar lanterns have been popular in camps, but the potential of large-scale integration of renewables in refugee camps is becoming more of a reality. For his Master’s project, Hamed Ziade, a student at EPFL, put together a power consumption model for refugee camps around the world, a first essential step in the battle against darkness in refugee camps.\nIn the developed world electricity is often taken for granted, but in refugee camps it can bring immense benefits in terms of increased safety, education, and prosperity. Today, most camps facilities are provisioned with power using diesel generators, and refugees use firewood in their homes for cooking, lighting, and heating. However, supply of electricity is often sporadic, and the use of these fuels has serious implications for the well being of refugees, and for sustainability. Renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic solar panels could offer a better solution, transforming the abundant sunlight in camps into much needed electricity.\nAn hourly power budget\n“In refugee camps, electricity helps reduce violence and it extends working hours, allowing the youth to study when the sun goes down and promoting the pursuit of livelihood activities,” explains Hamed Ziade, one of the first students to graduate from EPFL’s new Master’s program in Energy Management and Sustainability in October 2013.\nZiade’s main objective was to find out how much power was being consumed in refugee camps, thus supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in their vision to provide refugees with a clean and reliable source of power. Working under the auspices of UNHCR, he had access to the data he needed to determine how much power is used for lights, medical and administration facilities, schools, mobile charging stations, and a wide range of other applications. This data allowed him to develop CAMPOW©, a tool with which demand for electricity can be predicted for every hour of the day in refugee camps\nSmart refugee camps\nThe next challenge was finding ways to match the demand in electricity and provide sufficient power when it is needed. Solar panels produce most electricity when the sun is strongest, but refugees need it predominantly during the hours of darkness. Matching electricity supply and demand calls for a new generation of refugee camps. Inspired by the notion of smart cities, ”Smart refugee camps” could be designed based on innovative technologies allowing camps to manage themselves in terms of energy, by combining renewable energy production, consumption monitoring, and energy storage. Ziade’s work represents a first step in that direction.\n“Hamed’s work with UNHCR also comes at a time where the importance of energy access is being increasingly acknowledged, and coincides with the development of a UNHCR Strategy for Access to Energy, which will support the design of new approaches to meeting energy needs in refugee camps,” says Dr. Gebre Egziabher who supervised Ziade’s project at UNHCR.\nZiade comes from Lebanon, a country faced with an influx of refugees following the crisis in Syria. There, he co-founded a social charity and obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the American University of Beirut. He then benefited from the varied curriculum in Energy Management and Sustainability Master’s program at EPFL. “The multidisciplinary courses I attended in my Master’s fully contributed to the realization of the project,” he says, adding that this shift, from civil and environmental engineering to energy management, would have been impossible without it.", "summary": "SERIE D'ÉTÉ (8): Rolling out renewable and smart energy solutions in refugee camps could dramatically improve the well being of millions of refugees world-wide.

{"id": 432, "text": "“Collective creation: improv-arts & engineering” was developed by Professor Simon Henein in cooperation with the Arsenic Theater (Centre d’art scénique contemporain) in Lausanne. The year-long course, which was launched in September 2017, is part of EPFL’s Social and Human Sciences (SHS) program. It introduces Master’s students from all sections to improv techniques used in the performing arts (theater, music and dance) and explores how these techniques can be applied to engineering design. The 24 students taking the class will stage their final project on 16 May in a dress rehearsal and on 23 May in their final presentation before a board of examiners. Both events are open to the public.\nEach improv performance will feature technical artifacts made ahead of time by the students. “This requirement creates tension between the creative processes involved in engineering and those inherent in improv,” says Professor Henein. “The aim is to highlight where they overlap and how they differ.” One example is the “stage machine” that one group of students came up with. Drawing on artificial intelligence and deep learning, the machine picks up sounds produced during the performance and turns them into images, and vice versa. The resulting layers of real-time visual and sound effects are part of the improv performance and evolve in step with it.\nTeaming up with the Arsenic\nProfessor Henein worked with the Arsenic Theater in Lausanne to develop this course. Around a dozen scheduled artists and artists in residence supervised the students and provided them with creative support. The Arsenic also gave Henein and his class access to its studios throughout the course, which meant that the students could truly immerse themselves in the theater.\nEngineering and improv\n“Beyond engineering, I get the sense that people have a pressing need to understand their place in the world,” says Patrick de Rham, director of the Arsenic. “And with the emergence of artificial intelligence – machines that perform as well as or better than humans – I think we have to reconnect with our typically human trait of intuition, that part of ourselves that is subjective and sensitive rather than mechanical. It’s what makes two people come up with two different ideas and lets them think outside the box, and this is what drives society forward.”\nProfessor Henein adds: “Collectively, our creative potential is huge – much greater than that of each one of us individually – but to fully tap into it, we have to be able to create together. That's why this class delves so deeply into this skill, which will be crucial in the students’ future careers. We look at intuition, expression, listening, trust and self-reflection. The students are exposed to a wide range of approaches to the creative process, from the hard sciences to engineering and stage performance. All these influences will play a part in their professional work.”\nCourse description\n“Collective creation: improv-arts & engineering” combines workshops, which explore improvisation through the theater, music, dance and performance art, and lectures, which address the history of creativity in the sciences, approaches to collective engineering design, dramaturgy and the sociology of improvisation. The course is the brainchild of Professor Henein, who runs the Instant-Lab at Microcity, EPFL’s Microengineering Institute, and has practiced improv for the past 15 years. It is open to all first-year Master’s students at EPFL. The classes are run in three-period blocks every week throughout the school year.

{"id": 438, "text": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can offer high light-conversion efficiency with low manufacturing costs. But to be commercially viable, perovskite films must also be durable and not degrade under solar light over time. EPFL scientists have now greatly improved the operational stability of PSCs, retaining more than 95% of their initial efficiencies of over 20 % under full sunlight illumination at 60\no\nC for more than 1000 hours. The breakthrough, which marks the highest stability for perovskite solar cells, .\nChallenges of stability \nConventional silicon solar cells have reached a point of maturation, with efficiencies plateauing around 25% and problems of high-cost manufacturing, heavyweight, and rigidity has remained largely unresolved. On the contrary, a relatively new photovoltaic technology based on perovskite solar cells has already achieved more than 22% efficiency.\nGiven the vast chemical versatility, and the low-cost processability of perovskite materials, the PSCs hold the promise to lead the future of photovoltaic technology by offering cheap, light weight and highly efficient solar cells. But until now, only highly expensive, prototype organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs,selectively transporting positive charges in a solar cell) have been able to achieve power-conversion efficiencies over 20%. And by virtue of their ingredients, these hole-transporting materials adversely affect the long-term operational stability of the PSC.\nTherefore, investigating cheap and stable hole transporters that produce equally high efficiencies is in great demand to enable large-scale deployment of perovskite solar cells. Among various inorganic HTMs, cuprous thiocyanate (CuSCN) stands out as a stable, efficient and cheap candidate ($0.5/gr versus $500 /gr for the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD). But previous attempts to use CuSCN as a hole transporter in perovskite solar cells have yielded only moderately stabilized efficiencies and poor device stability, due to problems associated with depositing a high-quality CuSCN layer atop of the perovskite film, as wells as the chemical instability of the CuSCN layer when integrated into a perovskite solar cell.\nA stable solution\nNow, researchers at , in a project led by postdocs Neha Arora and M. Ibrahim Dar, have introduced two new concepts that overcome the major shortcomings of CuSCN-based perovskite solar cells. First, they developed a simple dynamic solution-based method for depositing highly conformal, 60-nm thick CuSCN layers that allows the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with stabilized power-conversion efficiencies exceeding 20%. This is comparable to the efficiencies of the best performing, state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD-based perovskite solar cells.\nSecond, the scientists introduced a thin spacer layer of reduced graphene oxide between the CuSCN and a gold layer. This innovation allowed the perovskite solar cells to achieve excellent operational stability, retaining over 95% of their initial efficiency while operating at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full-sun illumination at 60 °C. This surpasses even the stability of organic HTM-based perovskite solar cells that are heavily researched and have recently dominated the field.\nStructure of β-CuSCN and cross-sectional SEM micrograph of a complete solar cell (credit: M. Ibrahim Dar/EPFL)\nThe researchers also discovered that the instability of the perovskite devices originates from the degradation of CuSCN/gold contact during the solar cell’s operation.\n“This is a major breakthrough in perovskite solar-cell research and will pave the way for large-scale commercial deployment of this very promising new photovoltaic technology,” says Michael Grätzel. “It will benefit the numerous scientists in the field that have been intensively searching for a material that could replace the currently used, prohibitively expensive organic hole-transporters,” adds M.

{"id": 441, "text": "“In my study, I wanted to show that calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels tells just half of the story. What we really need to do is quantify the emissions of each product coming out of biorefineries,” says Edgard Gnansounou, professor at EPFL and head of the school’s Bioenergy and Energy Planning Research Group. To that end, Gnansounou has developed a sophisticated computer model described in an article appearing in \nBioresource Technology\n.\nBiofuels and other biomass-derived products have become viable options for replacing fossil fuels. But they have to meet certain environmental standards if they are to genuinely help cut carbon emissions. Under a new EU directive, bioethanol-based fuels – which are made by fermenting biomass – must save 70% greenhouse gas emissions compared to their fossil-fuel counterparts starting in 2021. In Switzerland, the government passed a law requiring that from 1 August 2016, biofuels must cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% relative to fossil-fuel equivalents. However, calculating the total greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels is no mean feat. The entire processing chain – not just the production of the biofuel itself – must be taken into account. For sugar cane, that would include emissions from growing and harvesting the plant, transporting it to a biorefinery, turning it into biofuel, and producing the other compounds and animals feed supplements that are generally made as coproducts. The hitch is that until now, no computer model existed for analyzing the entire life cycle of each product and coming up with a single emissions figure subject to environmental requirements.\nMany different variables involved\n One major challenge is the many different variables involved in calculating the emissions of biofuels and their various coproducts. But after five years of research, Gnansounou has come up with a model that incorporates all the various data. “I tackled the problem of allocating greenhouse gas emissions among the different coproducts by specifying an environmental requirement for each one. That lets plant engineers compare those emissions with their fossil-fuel equivalents and set up the right incentives to make their biorefineries economically viable.”\nGnansounou’s model is intended for second-generation biorefineries, which are still relatively new – only five currently exist around the world. The advantage of these biorefineries is that instead of processing crops that are also used as food, they use debris from farming (like wheat straw) and foresting. Wheat straw is the crop that Gnansounou looked at specifically, taking into account the wheat ears, which are used for food, and the stems, which are used by biorefineries to produce bioethanol for fuel, biogas for heating and electricity and phenol for the chemical industry. He also factored emissions from the fertilizer and farming machines used to grow and harvest the wheat, and whether the field had previously been used for other crops. Once he calculated a total greenhouse gas emissions figure, he used his model to divide the total up among the various coproducts.\nA scientific perspective\n With his research, Gnansounou hopes to bring a scientific perspective to the political and economic debate on biofuels. “Second-generation biorefineries should replace some oil refineries, but engineers still don’t have a clear method for calculating emissions across a biofuel’s life cycle,” he says. “What’s more, biorefineries have trouble competing with low oil prices” – since biofuels are two to three times more expensive than fossil fuels. He concludes: “Policymakers still haven’t fully grasped the emissions challenge, which is why it’s a good area for research.” Gnansounou believes that the renewable energy industry is too focused on the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels alone, whereas it should be looking more closely at the emissions of each coproduct from biorefineries, subject to climate policy constraints. That would also give consumers more information about the sustainability of biomass-derived products. Gnansounou plans to continue his research on other types of crops and publish his findings in a second article.\nReference", "summary": "A new EU regulation aims to shrink the environmental footprint of biofuels starting in 2021.

{"id": 444, "text": "A compact, precision tool for counting and tracking laser frequencies may improve atomic clocks and optical data transmission devices. However, light waves oscillate hundreds of trillions of times per second, a frequency that is impossible to measure directly. Large pulsed laser sources are typically used to produce “frequency combs” that can link the optical domain to the radio frequencies and make counting the oscillations of light possible. EPFL scientists have found a way to miniaturize frequency combs, realizing a new step toward miniaturization of such tools. Their device was capable of measuring light oscillations with a precision of 12 digits. The work is .\nThe lab of , in a project led by Victor Brasch and Erwan Lucas, created what is called a “self-referenced optical frequency comb”. This is essentially a series of densely-spaced spectral lines whose spacing is identical and known. Because they are so well defined, optical frequency combs can be used as a “ruler” for measuring the frequency – or color – of any laser beam. By comparing an unknown color to this ruler, it is possible to calculate its frequency. However, this implies a critical step called “self-referencing”, a method that exactly determines the position of each individual tick of the frequency ruler, but demands a very long ruler – a broad spectral range, as scientists say – which is challenging to obtain.\nAlthough optical frequency combs earned their inventors the Nobel prize in Physics in 2005, they still required bulky optical setups. Prof. Kippenberg’s lab showed in 2007 that optical frequency combs could be created using tiny devices called “optical microresonators”: microscopic ring-shaped structures made from very fine silicon nitride measuring a few millimeters to a few tens of microns in diameter. These structures can trap a continuous laser light and convert it into ultra-short pulses – solitons – thanks to the special nonlinear properties of the device. The solitons travel around the microresonator 200 billion times per second and the pulsed output from the microresonator creates the optical frequency comb.\nLast year, the group solved an outstanding challenge, demonstrating that a careful control of the microresonator parameters, enabled to generate a very broad frequency spectrum directly on-chip. At this point, the frequencies generated extend over two thirds of an octave compared with the frequency of the incoming laser (an octave refers to either double or half the frequency). When combined with a laser transfer system, based on non-linear crystals, the team’s approach enabled self-referencing, while eliminating the need for bulky, external systems traditionally used for frequency broadening.\nWith this, the researchers could prove that their optical frequency comb can be used for the most precise measurement applications: they measured the frequency of a laser using their technique as well as a traditional frequency comb system and showed that the two results agreed over 12 digits.\nThe technology is amenable to integration with both photonic elements and silicon microchips. Establishing devices that provide a RF to optical link on a chip may catalyze a wide variety of applications such as integrated, atomic clocks and on-chip, and could contribute to making optical frequency metrology ubiquitous.\nThis work was supported by a Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship and Intra-European Fellowship, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Space Agency, and the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency QuASAR program. \nReference\nVictor Brasch, Erwan Lucas, John D Jost, Michael Geiselmann, Tobias J Kippenberg. \nSelf-referenced photonic chip soliton Kerr frequency comb.\nLight: Science & Applications \n(2017) \n6\n, e16202; 13 January 2017.\nDOI:10.1038/lsa.2016.202", "summary": "EPFL scientists have found a way to miniaturize frequency combs, realizing a new step toward miniaturization of such tools.

She's just received one of these ultra-competitive European research grants. \"It's a real boost to my career, and it means I can work right at the interface between two fields, which is uncommon.\"\nLaunched ten years ago, the European Research Council (ERC) initiative has really transformed the landscape of European research.

Each year, the ERC pays out close to two billion Swiss francs.\nA 30% success rate\nSwitzerland ranks fifth in terms of recipient countries, with nearly 500 ERC grants awarded to researchers in Switzerland over the last ten years. And EPFL, which has been awarded 116,* comes in fourth among Europe's higher education institutions, behind three UK universities. It is closely followed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (110 grants). For Switzerland's two institutes of technology, this achievement is even more impressive given that they missed out on two application rounds in 2014 as a result of the referendum on mass immigration, which took place on 9 February of that year. Beyond these absolute figures, the recent success rate of EPFL applicants is impressive: more than 30% of applicants have been awarded a grant, compared with the average of around 10%.\n\"That illustrates just how good our researchers are,\" stated Michele De Palma, who has just been awarded a Consolidator Grant, after first receiving a Starting Grant. \"The Research Office and the central services also provide significant support when it comes to the applications and the selection interviews.\" The grants are awarded to individuals, which gives researchers more freedom to carry out their projects. Like De Palma, several researchers arrive at EPFL with their ERC grant already in hand, which means even more funds for the university.\nOnly high-risk and groundbreaking projects are successful, in recognition of their pursuit of scientific excellence. \"For a researcher, applying for an ERC grant is also a time to reflect on what you want to do for the next five years,\" commented Denis Duboule, a professor in the Laboratory of Developmental Genomics, who has already received two Advanced Grants.\n\"In five years, you have time to get some interesting findings and publish them,\" said De Palma.

{"id": 446, "text": "What is the WCSJ and why was it created?\nThe WCSJ was set up by the World Federation of Science Journalists (WFSJ) to provide a forum for science journalists to discuss the state of their profession, share best practices and outline new goals to aspire to. It’s held every two years and attracts over a thousand science journalists from around the world. The conference – which is run by science journalists for their peers – also aims to enable science journalists from different continents to meet each other and therefore start working together more efficiently. The conference is a hotbed of ideas! But more generally, it’s an opportunity for our industry to show that we strive for independent, fact-based science journalism through a healthy critical eye, in both the specialist and mainstream press. The hope is that by sharing best practices, we can raise the overall level of our profession.\nWhat is science journalism?\nIt’s a specific branch of journalism, although it has the same fundamental role: to investigate important issues, uncover the facts, compare different points of view, go behind the scenes, interview key people and get the background story. The main objective is to provide information to our readers. But since that information is scientific, we also have to explain complicated concepts in a simple way. So our job is to make science easy to understand, yet through a critical approach so that we are sure to describe it accurately and objectively. We step into laymen’s shoes, and we enter into a kind of tacit agreement with the scientists whose findings we report so that we can explain their research clearly and stay true to the scientific facts.\nBut science journalists aren’t the only people whose job it is to explain high-tech concepts in laymen’s terms?\nNo, of course not. That’s also the job of communications officers working in the science world, for example. These professionals – some of whom are attending our conference – play an important role in the information chain. But unlike science journalists, they are not independent; they usually work for a research institution. One of the talks at our conference will be on the role that YouTubers can play in disseminating scientific knowledge. Personally I believe social media is a vector we mustn’t ignore, provided that the science is described as accurately as possible. And social media can let us reach people – especially today’s youth – who don’t necessarily read magazines or newspapers.\nWhat does the WCSJ offer to partner organizations like EPFL?\nThis year’s event is bringing some 1,200 science journalists and communications officers from 83 different countries to the EPFL campus, as well as to the campuses of other partner organizations like UNIL, CHUV, CERN and the University of Geneva. Attendees will visit these organizations’ research labs and meet the researchers during the  tours we are holding every day during the week of the conference. These tours will give researchers a unique opportunity to speak with journalists who would have never come to the school otherwise, and to build an international network.\nWhat do you hope will be the long-term impact of the conference?\nThe WCSJ offers huge networking potential. Journalists get to speak directly with researchers and vice versa, meaning that partner organizations can forge lasting ties with science journalists the world over. And for science journalists, the WCSJ enables them to build a peer network that helps them do their jobs faster and more efficiently. I’m still in touch with researchers I met at previous editions of the WCSJ – and with journalists from other countries, whom I sometimes ask for assistance when writing an article about something related to their country.\nAs the head of the organizing committee, you’ve been able to step behind the scenes. What has that taught you?\nIt definitely pulled me out of my comfort zone! I had to don the hat of a professional conference organizer – but fortunately I had a team of 45 talented people behind me, based in France, Switzerland, Italy and even Montreal where the WFSJ headquarters is located. Working with them was a fantastic experience and I’d like to thank them personally. The process also forced me to take a deep look at our profession and think about what’s important to us and our community. The answers to those questions are what informed the conference program. I learned more about the field of science communications by working with the WCSJ’s partner businesses, research institutes and philanthropic organizations. It’s gratifying to put on an event that’s useful for so many people and that adheres to its founders’ original vision of a global conference that’s independent, open-minded and innovative, and that encourages journalists to think critically yet positively.\nA competitive process for selecting the conference organizers \nAt each WCSJ, the WFSJ selects a national association of science journalists to organize the following conference. The process is similar to the one for selecting the host city for the Olympic Games: candidates must submit a bid that meets several criteria. At the last WCSJ, held in San Francisco in October 2017, the Alpine Consortium – made up of the Swiss, Italian and French science journalist associations – was selected to run the 2019 edition. This is the first time a consortium of associations was selected. The winning bid was presented by representatives from those associations and EPFL.", "summary": "The 11\nth\n World Conference of Science Journalists (WCSJ) is being held in Lausanne this week, attracting some 1,200 visitors to our city.

This is plasma, a substance that could be used in the future to control the movement of small satellites and space probes.\n This machine is part of Félicien Filleul’s Master’s project. A 26-year-old physics student at EPFL, Filleul also did a Minor in Space Technologies. Through this project, which he did at the Swiss Plasma Center in collaboration with the Space Engineering Center (eSpace), Filleul contributed to the effort to develop plasma-fueled satellite propulsion engines. Research on this groundbreaking technology has been ongoing for around 10 years.\n “Plasma engines could work really well with small satellites like Cubsats, which are sent into orbit without any way to control or adjust how they move,” said Filleul. So the objective is to develop a system of low-power but steady thrusters that are highly precise and consume little energy. Scientists could use them to maintain or correct the satellites’ orbit or orientation, or to set up a constellation of Cubsats, in which several of these small satellites are networked for the needs of individual missions.\nParticle soup\n “Plasma is perfect for this type of propulsion,” said Filleul. “We make it out of xenon gas, a single gram of which provides 10 times more acceleration than the same quantity of traditional fuels.”\n Plasma is neither solid, liquid nor gas – it is the fourth state of matter. While less familiar than the other three states of matter, plasma is used in everyday items such as neon signs and television screens. It is very common in the universe and can be found in the sun and other stars.\n Plasma is made by heating xenon in a vacuum at temperatures so high that the electrons are pulled out of their orbit around the nucleus. They come to form a ‘soup’ of highly charged particles. More plasma can be generated by sending a helicon-type electromagnetic wave – which spreads as it turns like a corkscrew – through the soup. Scientists can freely adjust the substance’s density by controlling the wave’s intensity.\nHeading for Mercury\n Filleul’s project focused on the antenna used to generate the helicon wave. The antenna, designed and developed at EPFL by the startup Helyssen, lends itself to plasma engines that are both small and light. And those are two major concerns in the area of space technology. “My job was to test the antenna with different densities and qualities of plasma, in order to find the ones that will work best in space,” said Filleul.\n But the fun doesn’t stop there for Filleul. Next year, he will work at the European Space Agency (ESA) on a plasma-propulsion system for the BepiColombo mission, which in 2018 will launch two probes headed for the planet Mercury.", "summary": "Summer series on student projects (3) – For his Master’s degree in physics, Félicien Filleul worked on a plasma-fueled propulsion system for small satellites and space probes.", "claim": "Summer series on student projects (two) – For his Master’s degree in physics, Félicien Filleul worked on a plasma-fueled propulsion system for small satellites and space probes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [6, 6], "noise": false}

{"id": 459, "text": "Peptides are short chains of amino acids that occur in our body, in plants or bacteria to control diverse functions. Several peptides are used as drugs such as insulin, which controls the metabolism of sugar, and cyclosporine, which suppresses organ rejection after transplants. More than 40 peptides are already approved as drugs, generating revenues in the billions. There are several hundreds of peptide-based medications currently in clinical trials.\nBut almost none of these drug-peptides can be taken orally. Since peptides are an important part of food, the stomach and intestines harbor countless enzymes that can degrade them, meaning that most peptide-based medication do not survive the passage through the gastrointestinal tract.\nHope to generate more stable peptides came from “cyclic” peptides, whose ends are joined together by chemical bridges making them more stable than linear ones because their backbones are less flexible and thus harder to attack by enzymes. In 2018, the research group of Christian Heinis at EPFL developed a peptide format termed double-bridged peptides, where peptides are cyclized by two chemical bridges that provide even higher stability. Despite its success, most such peptides were not sufficiently stable to survive the enormous enzymatic pressure found in the gastrointestinal tract.\nNow, Heinis’s group has developed a new method that identifies among billions of double-bridged peptides those that bind a disease target of interest and survive enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract. The method is published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, and involves three steps.\nFirst, billions of genetically encoded random peptide sequences are cyclized by two chemical bridges that impose conformational constraints onto the peptides' backbones so that they are more difficult to attack by enzymes.\nSecond, this library of peptides is exposed to enzymes from cow intestine to eliminate all those peptides that are not stable.\nIn the third and last step, the scientist dip target proteins into the pool of surviving peptides to fish out those that bind to the wanted disease target. “It’s a bit like searching a needle in a haystack, and this method makes this easy,” says Heinis.\nWith this method, the researchers have succeeded for the first time in evolving target-specific peptides that can resist breakdown in the gastrointestinal tract. For example, they gave mice a lead peptide that inhibits thrombin – an important anti-thrombosis target – in the form of a pill. The peptide remained intact in the stomach and intestines, and even though it reached the blood stream in rather small quantities, most of it remained fully intact across the entire gastrointestinal tract. This is a key step towards engineering oral peptide drugs.\nHeinis’s group is now applying the new method to develop oral peptides that act directly on gastrointestinal targets, meaning that they don’t need to travel into the blood stream. “We are focusing on chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as bacterial infections,” says Heinis. “We have already succeeded in generating enzyme-resistant peptides against the interleukin-23 receptor, an important target of these diseases, which affect millions of patients worldwide without any oral drug available.”\nOther contributors\nEPFL Protein Production and Structure Core Facility\nEPFL Laboratory for Biomolecular Modeling\nSwiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "summary": "Peptides represent a billion-dollar market in the pharmaceutical industry, but they can generally only be taken as injections to avoid degradation by stomach enzymes.

These five common objects were selected because they offer a varied range of situations in which the part of the object that the robot has to catch (the handle of the racket, for example) does not correspond to its center of gravity. The case of the bottle even offers an additional challenge since its center of gravity moves several times during its trajectory. When projected into the air, all these items will make even more complex movements, often involving several axes. As a result, when the moving objects are submitted to the robot’s abilities, the outcomes turn out quite interesting.\nIn the first learning phase, objects are thrown several times in the robot’s direction. Through a series of cameras located all around it, the robot creates a model for the objects’ kinetics based on their trajectories, speeds and rotational movement. Scientists translate it into an equation which then allows the robot to position itself very quickly in the right direction whenever an object is thrown. During the few milliseconds of the approach, the machine refines and corrects the trajectory for a real-time and high precision capture. This efficiency is further enhanced by the development of controllers that couple and synchronize the movements of the hand and fingers.", "summary": "A robot developed by EPFL researchers is capable of reacting on the spot and grasping objects with complex shapes and trajectories in less than five hundredths of a second.", "claim": "A robot developed by EPFL researchers is capable of reacting on the spot and grasping objects with complex shapes and trajectories in half hundredths of a second.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [22, 22], "noise": false}
{"id": 465, "text": "For their semester project, Océane Hames and Lucas Ott, two Master’s students in Environmental Engineering at EPFL, chose to focus on the Yverdon-les-Bains wastewater treatment plant. This plant is known as a pioneer in Switzerland because in 2016 it became the country’s first to install a stripping membrane system for nitrogen recovery. These systems work by using a polypropylene membrane to filter the nitrogen from the rest of the wastewater, after the effluent has gone through some initial processing. By stripping out the nitrogen in this way, plants can both reduce their nitrogen emissions into nearby streams and produce a high-quality liquid fertilizer. The fertilizer made at Yverdon-les-Bains has been certified by the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture; some 140 m\n3\n are generated each year and sold to a local farmer who spreads it on his crops, thus completing the nitrogen cycle. \n But Hames and Ott wanted to make the nitrogen recovery process more efficient by increasing the fertilizer’s nitrogen concentration to above 40 g/L, as that would cut the cost of storing and transporting the fluid. Taking inspiration from the osmotic distillation technique commonly used to concentrate fruit juice, the students developed a method specifically for nitrogen that could be incorporated into existing wastewater treatment processes. They conducted lab experiments over several days to bring the nitrogen concentration close to its saturation point. They also measured the flow rate of steam through the membrane so that engineers can later size the equipment needed to implement the technology on a large scale. \nWorking hand in hand with industry\n The students tested their new osmotic distillation method at a pilot unit provided by Membratec, a Sierre-based firm that develops membrane technology for wastewater treatment. The unit consisted of two 25 L wastewater reservoirs, pumps and two metallic cylinders containing a stripping membrane. They ran tests on the closed-loop system using a fluid with the same composition as the fertilizer supplied to the Vaud farmer. \n “Osmotic distillation has the advantage of being able to concentrate fruit juice at room temperature, meaning the juice’s taste and nutritional properties remain intact,” says Hames. Ott adds: “In osmotic distillation systems, a hydrophobic porous membrane lets gas compounds like steam pass through but not liquids. The driving force is generated by a partial vapor-pressure difference between the two fluids separated by the membrane. That’s the same mechanism we used to concentrate the nitrogen in the liquid fertilizer.”\nSupplementing the theory learned in class\n These types of semester projects, called Design Projects, are required of all Master’s level environmental engineering students at EPFL. They are intended to give students first-hand experience with the R&D carried out in industry. “I really liked the trial-and-error aspect of the project and the opportunity to discuss our progress week by week with a Membratec engineer,” says Ott. And according to Hames: “It was nice to take a break from the classroom and spend the day running lab experiments. And it was really motivating to know that there could be a concrete application for the work we were doing.” The students’ project was supervised by Christof Holliger, a full professor at EPFL and head of the School’s Laboratory for Environmental Biotechnology (LBE). \n The students weren’t the only ones to gain from the project. Christophe Bonvin, who oversaw their work at Membratec, viewed it as a win-win experience: “We really enjoyed coaching the students. It’s impressive how much students can contribute when they’re motivated and well-guided, and when the scope of their projects is clearly defined.”", "summary": "Summer series: Two EPFL Master’s in Environmental Engineering students have developed a novel method for recovering nitrogen from wastewater.

{"id": 472, "text": "Why is it that within a homogeneous population of the same species, some individuals live three times as long as others? This question has stumped scientists for centuries.\nNow, EPFL researchers led by Johan Auwerx report in the journal Nature how a mechanism in mice plays a determining role in longevity. And they go a step further: by disrupting this mechanism using simple antibiotics in a population of nematodes, or roundworms, they can multiply lifespan by a factor of 1.6.\nMitochondia: biological timekeepers\n The process identified by EPFL scientists takes place within organelles called mitochondria, known as the cellular powerhouses because they transform nutrients into proteins including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used by muscles as energy.\n But that's not all they do. Several studies have shown that mitochondria are also involved in aging. The new EPFL research, done in collaboration with partners in the Netherlands and the US, pinpoints the exact genes involved and measures the consequences to longevity when the amount of protein they encode for is varied: less protein, longer life.\nNatural variations in mice\n Laboratory mice in the BXD reference population typically live from 365 to 900 days. This population, which reflects genetic variations that occur naturally within a species, is used by many researchers in an approach known as “real-world genetics”. The benefit of working with this population in particular is that their genome is almost completely decoded.\nThe team led by professor Auwerx, head of EPFL's Laboratory of Integrative and Systemic Physiology, analyzed mice genomes as a function of longevity and found a group of three genes situated on chromosome number two that, up to this point, had not been suspected of playing any role in aging. But the numbers didn't lie: a 50 percent reduction in the expression of these genes—and therefore a reduction in the proteins they code for—increased mouse life span by about 250 days.\nExtending life in worms\n Next, the team reproduced the protein variations in a species of nematode, Caenorhabidtis elegans. “By reducing the production of these proteins during the worms' growth phase, we significantly increased their longevity”, says Auwerx.\n The average life span of a worm manipulated in this way went from 19 to more than 30 days, an increase of 60 percent. The scientists then conducted tests to isolate the common property and determined that the presence of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) is inversely proportional to longevity.\nLife-prolonging stress\nThe researchers concluded that a lack of MRP at certain key moments in development created a specific stress reaction known as an \"unfolded protein response\" within the mitochondria. \"The strength of this response was found to be directly proportional to the life span,\" says Auwerx. \"However, we noted that it was more pronounced if the protein imbalance—the reduction in MRP— occurred at a young age. A similar stimulation in an adult did not affect the worms' longevity.\"\nWhat's more, the effect can be induced without genetically manipulating the worms. \"Exposure to certain readily available drugs inhibits ribosomal function and thus causes the desired reaction,\" says Auwerx. In other words, mitochondria are sensitive to certain antibiotics, and the drugs can be used to prolong life.\nWeary youngsters, vigorous old folks\n Worms given antibiotics don't just live to ripe old age. At maturity, which is 13 days, they also moved twice as much as the others, according to Laurent Mouchiroud, co-author of the study. \"Around 20 days of age, the difference was even more pronounced because the 'control' individuals were often already in bad shape,\" he adds.\nUsing a software program modified by colleagues in EPFL's School of Computer and Communications Sciences, Mouchiroud was able to follow, measure and qualify the movements of many worms during their entire life, and he observed that those who had undergone drug treatment had superior endurance and energy. \"In addition, their muscles were in better shape,\" he reports.\nHowever, individuals who were given the antibiotics early in life—for example in the larval stage—also presented several less favorable characteristics. Their development was slightly slower, they laid fewer eggs and they had less energy at about three days old, the outset of adult development. \"This reminded us of the vaguely flu-like state one gets right after the administration of a vaccine,\" says Mouchiroud. \"But the stress reaction in the mitochondria, and thus the potential for increased longevity, remained after the treatment phase.\"\nAll indications are that the observed and proven mechanisms in worms should be similar to those in mice, and therefore possibly in other mammals. Further studies are necessary, of course, to confirm that aging and its deleterious effects could be slowed down in mammals using antibiotics at precise moments in development.\n\"This research gives us hope not only for increasing longevity, but also for lengthening the period of adult vitality, and doing this with simple drugs such as antibiotics,\" concludes Auwerx.", "summary": "EPFL scientists reveal the mechanism responsible for aging hidden deep within mitochondria—and dramatically slow it down in worms by administering antibiotics to the young.

{"id": 477, "text": "It’s safe to say that the world as we know it would be quite different without concrete. Following its invention in the 19th century, modern concrete – or Portland cement – quickly found its place in the building industry. This novel material could be used to rapidly build roads, bridges, dams and many other types of civil engineering works. Nowadays, nearly 4.2 billion tons of concrete are produced every year around the world.\nEPFL’s  has been instrumental in the advancement of concrete technologies over the past century. Initially called the Building Materials Laboratory (see the history of the lab below), it was founded in 1918 by Henri Demierre and Professor Marius Lacombe. For its centenary celebration, the lab has offered guided tours, children's workshops, videos and a retrospective exhibition. Karen Scrivener, the lab’s current director, is unequivocal:\n“No other material can compete with concrete.” \nWhat has changed in the study of concrete since 1918?\nIn the early days, the focus was on defining the properties of this burgeoning material and on responding to basic questions, like how much concrete is needed for a building, and what its mechanical properties are. The professors who have headed up the lab since then have each had their preferred research topics, and some of them quickly made a name for themselves internationally.\nHow has this material changed our lives?\nWe used to make buildings out of stone, but that was very expensive and time-consuming and offered little design freedom. Concrete starts out as a powder, which makes it very easy to transport and then fast and straightforward to use. It is also highly versatile – EPFL’s Rolex Learning Center is a good example of what can be done architecturally with concrete.\nWhat is your lab’s current focus?\nThese days our research centers on environmental issues. Concrete is a relatively environmentally friendly material to produce but the manufacturing process nevertheless accounts for nearly 10% of human CO\n2\n emissions owing to the huge – and growing – level of demand.\nWe study all of the fundamental phenomena that characterize concrete in order to produce green concrete and keep CO\n2 \nemissions down. The world needs answers to global warming now, not in 20 years.\nIs there an alternative to concrete? \nNo other material offers so many possibilities. Concrete works best and has become the industry standard. And Switzerland – with the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, ETH Zurich and EPFL – is among the leading countries in concrete research and can have an impact at the international level.\nOur lab teams up with partners in Asia and Latin America, where demand is booming. Much research remains to be done in order to make concrete even better and more environmentally friendly than it is now.\nHistory\n- 1918 The Materials Testing Laboratory (Laboratoire d'essai des matériaux) is created\n - 1927 The lab is split into two divisions, one for metals, the other for mineral-based materials\n - 1954 Two different labs are created: the Building Materials Laboratory (Laboratoire des matériaux pierreux) and the Laboratory of Metals and Machines (Laboratoire des métaux et machines)\n - 1980 Professor F.

The Portico is located at Ciudad Abierta (“Open City”), some 16 kilometers north of Valparaíso on the Pacific Coast. You can follow the students’ progress on EPFL Out There, the blog covering EPFL research expeditions and projects abroad. \n - \nA supplement to classroom learning \n Before heading to Chile, the students spend the week of 8 July getting ready for their trip at EPFL. The goal of the program is to expose them to rudimentary building methods and an approach to architecture that is focused more on the humanistic aspects. “EPFL began working with Ciudad Abierta six years ago, after we put together an exhibition about this pilot site,” says Patricia Guaita, an architect and scientist at EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE). Since then, she has been taking a small group of EPFL students to the site every summer so they can pitch in with the construction work. The students are selected through an interview process and obtain credits they can use towards their Master’s degree. \n “This ‘summer school’ is intended to supplement what the students learn in class by giving them hands-on experience with concepts related to construction and the use of space,” says Guaita. “The Portico is being built through a cross-disciplinary team project, and we hope that through our program, students will see how its construction is the tangible result of knowledge built up over the years. That will give them a fresh perspective on the construction process.” This year students will be testing out a new method for concrete form work.\n Accommodations at the site will be basic, with little or no internet access. Does that worry the students? “Not at all! It’ll give us a chance to get back in touch with the real world, after spending years behind a computer,” says Annabelle Thuring, a Master’s student in architecture. Pablo Grunig, a first-year architecture student, adds: “I immediately liked the idea of building something on the other side of the planet, in the middle of sand dunes, and being completely immersed in the project.”\nA once-in-a-lifetime experience\n “This program, with its unique living and working conditions, will show the students that construction work must not be limited to technical considerations but should also take into account the human and material experience associated with the site and its occupants,” says Guaita. David Jolly, the e[ad] PUCV professor who supervises the EPFL students every year, agrees. “The timeline for building the Portico is not dictated by school calendars. Students have been building a section of it every year for the past five years. The central role in this project is thus not played by students but by Ciudad Abierta. This workshop offers a unique platform where the students’ work, education and daily life meld. In working on this project, EPFL students don’t just help build a portion of the City, they also build up a part of themselves. What they are constructing today will last, in terms of both the building they construct and the unique experience they gain.” \nAn avant-garde artistic approach \n Ciudad Abierta was created in 1970 by a group of architects, poets, philosophers, sculptors and painters including Chilean architect Alberto Cruz and Argentinian poet Godofredo Iommi. Little known by the general public, the City has always fostered avant-garde thinking in a variety of arts and disciplines.\nThis year, the Open City Research Platform is sponsored by the EPFL Institute of Architecture, the EPFL Architecture Section, the Design Together program and the ETH Board.

{"id": 483, "text": "It’s not just mycologists who are interested in the physical properties of mushrooms. Today a growing community of environmentally conscious consumers is looking more closely at mycelium, or the part of mushrooms that grows underground. This thread-like substance can bind together various substrates, such as woodchips, and the resulting mixture can be molded into things like bricks, panels, packing chips, furniture and a host of other objects. Eight students at ENAC are studying how mycelium – which individuals can grow themselves – could potentially be used to replace plastic.\n“This idea came up when we met with architecture students at our school to develop an original, innovative alternative to existing building materials, which generate a lot of pollution,” says Gaël Packer, an environmental engineering student at ENAC. Inspired by a TED talk, he and his classmates decided to lend their support to this groundbreaking community concerned about the future of the earth. As future architects and construction engineers, they realize that, as a result of resource depletion, some of today’s building materials won’t be around forever, and that existing materials generate a lot of emissions throughout their life cycle, from production to disposal.\nPromising results\nMycelium-based materials offer a promising alternative because not only are they light, cheap and easy to make, but they also provide a way to recycle waste products and can be biodegraded in just three months. Today a number of grow-it-yourself kits are available online; all you need is mycelium, a substrate and a bit of patience (not included in the kit). The first step is to grow the “mushroom roots” in a sterile or pasteurized environment together with the substrate and some flour and water. The resulting mixture is then poured into a mold. Once it has set – which takes about a week – it needs to be baked at a low temperature to stop any further growth and consolidate the object’s shape. The result is a light, low-density, solid, and resistant object – much as if it had been produced using 3D printing.\nRather than use a grow-it-yourself kit, the students made their own version of the mixture using mycelium from local oyster mushrooms and fibers from hemp grown in the Jura region. Then, armed with a healthy dose of scientific skepticism veiled in optimism, the students tested out their mushroom-derived material. “We worked with several EPFL labs to test the material’s key properties: thermal insulation, acoustic absorption, compressive strength, and water- and fire-resistance,” says Packer. They found that its thermal insulation capacity was on par with other insulating materials, that it could easily withstand the weight of a human body, that it floats and is watertight, and that it is fairly fire-resistant. Acoustic absorption tests are still under way.\nA recipe that can be improved\n“Although further testing is needed, the results so far are highly promising and show that the material’s properties are similar to those of expanded polystyrene. We can certainly improve those properties further by adjusting the composition of our mixture, whether in terms of the substrate or the mushroom feed,” says Packer.\nThe success of this project owes in part to ENAC’s Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory (SKIL), an open-space workshop where students can work on class projects and receive technical and practical support as well as assistance from teachers.\nThe Mycelium, Design and Architecture (MD&A) team members are: Kimberley Berney, Adrien Berteaux, Aurélien Brun, Mathias Helfenstein, Thomas Läng, Enrico Margaroli, Leily Moser and Gaël Packer.\nContact:", "summary": "Summer series.

{"id": 493, "text": "Can you analyze the internal structure of a piece of concrete without damaging it? Yes! With a micro Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. This is a special type of x-ray machine that delivers images with a resolution going down to several microns for small objects. Switzerland now has its first such CT scanner, and it’s at EPFL.\nMicro CT scanners are similar to medical CT scanners, but they're designed to work on materials rather than living organisms. “With a medical scanner, the patient must hold perfectly still, while the micro scanner irradiates the object as it turns,” said Pascal Turberg, a scientist with the Civil Engineering Institute and the Ecological Systems Laboratory. “The machine collects thousands of images of the material and recreates its internal structure in three dimensions, layer by layer, with great precision.”\nSeeing how a material deforms\nCT scanners provide a remarkably detailed snapshot of a given material’s components, imperfections and overall quality. For example, when a concrete cylinder is scanned, the images include many shades of gray (see video). The black spots correspond to gaps within the material – its natural porosity and any cracks – while the lightest spots show the aggregates and intermediate hues indicate the cement. Nothing is left to the imagination.\nThe images produced could find applications in many fields. Engineers, for example, could run “coupled experiments” to test how materials perform under stress: they could scan a piece of metal, wood or concrete, deform it in various ways and then scan it again to see how it behaves up to the fracture point. They could even watch how the material deforms in real time. Used in this way, the images could validate the engineers’ theoretical computer models.\nNumerous applications\nThe micro CT scanner acquired by EPFL will not sit idle. ENAC was behind the initiative and hosts the machine, but other schools intend to get in on the action too, including the School of Engineering, and Life Sciences. “The CT scanner can test the quality of materials and electronically check for manufacturing soundness, such as in a welded joint,” said Turberg. “In the field of environmental sciences, the machine could be used to scan things like rocks, plants and river sediment. It could also test the resilience of new composite materials designed for construction work or medical prosthetics.”\nTurberg also hopes that EPFL’s new scanner will lead to joint initiatives with outside entities. He says that it could appeal to archeologists, art historians and art restorers: “We’ve already been in contact with a number of individuals who would like to try out the machine. As far as micro CT scanners go, this is the top model in its category. It’s a perfect addition to the other scanners we have access to for our research, including those at the university teaching hospitals and the Paul Scherrer Institute. What’s new and exciting about our scanner is that it delivers very high resolution images and is designed specifically for engineering research.”", "summary": "Micro computed tomography scanners deliver very high-resolution images of the internal structure of materials.

{"id": 496, "text": "Do young people drink more out on the town or at a friend’s place? In small groups or at large parties? Do they drink more if they stay at a single bar or go bar hopping? And among all these factors, which are the most influential in whether or not they drink? Researchers at Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have set out to answer these questions through a study based on factual information – i.e., smartphone data collected on weekend nights – to characterize the drinking habits of young people. A model they developed from the data can estimate\nthe nights when someone is likely to drink with over 75% accuracy. \nSpecific applications\nThe researchers developed two apps that the study participants installed on their smartphones. Participants used the first to photograph and record all the beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) they drank during a weekend night, along with the type of drink, the volume, the number and where they drank them. The app sent a reminder to participants every hour in case they forgot to enter any drinks. This data indicated whether a participant drank alcohol on a given night, and was used to classify participants as either “with alcohol” or “without alcohol” for each night in the study. \nA model that estimates alcohol consumption\nThe second application activated sensors that continuously collected data on each participant’s location, activity level, apps used, battery level, screen usage and nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi spots. The researchers compiled the data from the two apps and matched up the contextual data with the sensor data, giving them a comprehensive picture for each participant and each night. That showed them under what conditions – alone or in a group, at home or in a bar, at one or several different locations – participants consumed higher amounts of alcohol. Then they developed a machine-learning algorithm to crunch through the data. It can estimate whether an individual drank alcohol on a given night with over 75% accuracy. The researchers were also able to determine which factors were most significant in estimating behavior; these include the activity level, the number of different locations where beverages are drunk, and how many other people are around. Their findings have just been published in .\nIncreasingly rich data\nThe data was collected anonymously from 241 participants between the ages of 16 and 25 over 10 weekends – Friday and Saturday nights from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am – in Lausanne and Zurich. This is the first study that uses rich data collected by smartphones to understand the drinking habits of Swiss youth. What’s more, because it is based on factual information and not perceptions, it marks a novel approach to research on public health and prevention. “Most studies of alcohol consumption by young people are based on questionnaires that participants fill out the following morning, for example. But we know that people typically forget to note down much of what they drink,” says Daniel Gatica-Perez, adjunct professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering and Digital Humanities Institute, and head of Idiap’s Social Computing Group. The same holds true for the situations in which we drink – it can be rather subjective. But for this study, researchers used data collected by sensors: activity level, the extent to which people moved around, the number of other people present, the type of apps they used during the night, and how often they used their smartphone. \nA starting point for future alcohol-consumption research\nThis study shows that smartphone data provided voluntarily in the interest of public health can be used to estimate alcohol consumption on a given night with promising results. That opens the door to investigating related topics, such as drinking at home and the role of the time factor in drinking. However, the researchers stress the importance of including interviews in such studies; for this study, interviews were carried out by a partner scientist at the University of Zurich. “Data don’t tell the whole story,” says Gatica-Perez. “Interviews help us understand the nuances and many factors involved when people go out at night, and validate our findings.”", "summary": "Researchers from Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have carried out a study using smartphone data from young Swiss people to better understand the circumstances in which they are most likely to drink. A computer model developed from the data can estimate, with over 75% accuracy, whether alcohol was consumed on a given weekend night.", "claim": "Researchers from Idiap Research Institute and EPFL have carried out a study using smartphone data from young Swiss people to better understand the circumstances in which they are most likely to drink. A computer model developed from the data can estimate, with over one accuracy, whether alcohol was consumed on a given weekend night.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [48, 48], "noise": false}
{"id": 498, "text": "The human genome contains millions of sequences derived from so-called transposable elements, genetic units that “jump” around the entire genome. Long considered as junk DNA, transposable elements are now recognized as influencing the expression of genes. However, the extent of this regulation and how it is harnessed were so far unknown. EPFL scientists have now taken the first extensive look at a family of ~350 human proteins, showing that they establish a complex interplay with transposable elements to create largely human-specific gene regulatory networks. \n,\n the work also traces the evolutionary history of these proteins, and opens up a new dimension in genetics and medicine. \nThe lab of  revealed a few years ago that a protein serving as cofactor to many KZFPs (KRAB-containing zinc-finger proteins) was involved in silencing transposable elements during the first few days of embryogenesis. Now he and his collaborators have carried out an extensive analysis of human KZFPs, retracing their evolutionary history and identifying their genomic targets.\nThe scientists combined phylogenetics – the study of evolutionary relationships between different species, with genomics — the study of how the genome of an organism conditions its biology. By comparing the genomes of 203 vertebrates, they first traced the origin of KZFPs back to a common ancestor of tetrapods (four-legged animals) and coelacanth, a fish that evolved over 400 million years ago. This evolutionary conservation of the KZFP-transposable element system hints to its fundamental importance.\nTrono’s team then mapped out the genomic targets of most human KZFPs, finding that the greatest fraction recognizes transposable elements. “The vast majority of KZFPs binds to specific motifs in transposable elements,” says Trono. “For each KZFP we were able to assign one subset of transposable elements, and also found that one transposable element can often interact with several KZFPs. It is a highly combinatorial and versatile system.”\nThe EPFL scientists finally went on to demonstrate that KZFPs can convert transposable elements in exquisitely fine-tuned regulatory platforms that influence the expression of genes, which likely takes place at all stages of development and in all human tissues.\n“After emerging some 420 million years ago, KZFPs evolved rapidly in a lineage-specific fashion, parallel to the invasion of host genomes by transposable elements,” says Trono. “This co-evolution resulted in shaping human gene regulatory networks that are largely proper to our species or at least primate-restricted — the farther away in evolution, the fewer the similarities.”\nThe data from the study demonstrate that KZFP partner up with transposable elements to create what the authors call “a largely species-restricted layer of epigenetic regulation”. Epigenetics refers to biological processes — mostly biochemical modifications of the DNA and its associated proteins — that condition the expression or repression of genes. As a field, epigenetics has come into prominence in recent years, revealing a previously unimagined complexity and elegance in genetics.\n“KZFPs contribute to make human biology unique,” says Trono. “Together with their genomic targets, they likely influence every single event in human physiology and pathology, and do so by being largely species-specific — the general system exists in many vertebrates, but most of its components are different in each case.” The findings of this work will help scientists identify possible shortcomings of current animal models and construct a more accurate picture of how genes work in humans.\n“This paper lifts the lid off something that had been largely unsuspected: the tremendous species-specific dimension of human gene regulation”, says Trono. “It has profound implications for our understanding of human development and physiology, and gives us a remarkable wealth of resources to examine how disturbances of this system might result in diseases such as cancer”.\nThis study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Research Council, and the Fonds de la Recherche en Santé du Québec.

{"id": 505, "text": "It’s a major breakthrough in the field of electronics. Engineers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES) have developed a next-generation circuit that allows for smaller, faster and more energy-efficient devices – which would have major benefits for artificial-intelligence systems. Their revolutionary technology is the first to use a 2D material for what’s called a logic-in-memory architecture, or a single architecture that combines logic operations with a memory function. The research team’s findings appear today in \nNature\n.\nUntil now, the energy efficiency of computer chips has been limited by the von Neumann architecture they currently use, where data processing and data storage take place in two separate units. That means data must constantly be transferred between the two units, using up a considerable amount of time and energy.\nBy combining the two units into a single structure, engineers can reduce these losses. That’s the idea behind the new chip developed at EPFL, although it goes one step beyond existing logic-in-memory devices. The EPFL chip is made from MoS\n2\n, which is a 2D material consisting of a single layer that’s only three atoms thick. It’s also an excellent semi-conductor. LANES engineers had already studied  a few years ago, finding that it is particularly well-suited to electronics applications. Now the team has taken that initial research further to create their next-generation technology.\nThe EPFL chip is based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). The advantage of these transistors is that they can hold electric charges for long periods; they are typically used in flash memory systems for cameras, smartphones and computers. The unique electrical proprieties of MoS\n2\n make it particularly sensitive to charges stored in FGFETs, which is what enabled the LANES engineers to develop circuits that work as both memory storage units and programmable transistors. By using MoS\n2\n, they were able to incorporate numerous processing functions into a single circuit and then change them as desired.\nIn-depth expertise \n“This ability for circuits to perform two functions is similar to how the human brain works, where neurons are involved in both storing memories and conducting mental calculations,” says Andras Kis, the head of LANES. “Our circuit design has several advantages. It can reduce the energy loss associated with transferring data between memory units and processors, cut the amount of time needed for computing operations and shrink the amount of space required. That opens the door to devices that are smaller, more powerful and more energy efficient.”\nThe LANES research team has also acquired in-depth expertise in fabricating circuits out of 2D materials. “We made our first chip ten years ago by hand,” says Kis. “But we have since developed an advanced fabrication process that lets us make 80 or more chips in a single run, with well-controlled properties.”\nFull scientific article:", "summary": "EPFL engineers have developed a computer chip that combines two functions – logic operations and data storage – into a single architecture, paving the way to more efficient devices.

{"id": 511, "text": "For reasons you can imagine, much of what we used to do in the physical world is now being done virtually. That’s having an effect on energy-related pollution – CO\n2\n emissions from manufacturing and transportation have fallen drastically, for example. But there has been a concomitant increase in energy use for digital services. Exact numbers aren’t yet available, but according to Babak Falsafi, the director of , the trend is clear. “Behind every digital service we use lies a data center. And we’re heading towards a world where everything is done digitally, across all markets and industries.”\nFalsafi continues: “A lot of business activities have been shifted online because of the pandemic, causing a huge surge in demand, mainly for video. Non-work-related demand for streaming has also exploded. What’s more, today’s ultra-high-resolution screens use up a lot of energy. People don’t understand everything that’s involved in watching a movie in 8k – a lot of power is needed for all that data processing and transfer. You put that all together and it’s huge!”\nRelentless rise in demand\nThe current situation is set to last for a while longer: it’ll be weeks, or probably months, before a vaccine is ready – and that’s without factoring in a second wave. Many organizations, including schools and universities, have announced that they will keep holding classes online, at least partly. But the issue of data-center-related emissions was already a pressing one before the pandemic. “New technology like the internet of things, artificial intelligence, 5G and 4k televisions – which are now going to 8k – has pumped up demand, and therefore energy use,” says Falsafi. According to an article appearing in \nMIT Technology Review\n last year, training a single Transformer artificial intelligence model can generate as much carbon emissions as five American cars throughout their useful life. In another example, Netflix announced that its electricity use jumped 84% in 2019 to 451,000 megawatt-hours, or enough to power 40,000 homes in the United States for a year.\nSome studies predict that digital technology will account for 8% of global electricity use by 2030 – up from 3–5% today – and 4% of CO\n2\n emissions. This includes data centers, those huge buildings that house the servers we use to store, process, analyze and transfer data on the cloud (the biggest data centers already consume hundreds of megawatts). It also includes, in an equal measure, the telecommunication systems that transport those data. Consumer electronics and the energy used to build computing facilities also play a role, albeit smaller.\nThe end of Moore’s law\nWhile demand is skyrocketing, supply is bumping up against a ceiling. Moore’s law, which states that the number of transistors contained on a silicon chip doubles every year, has pretty much expired. We can’t keep packing more computing power onto chips like we’ve been doing over the past 50 years. The two options currently available are to build new data centers or expand existing ones. The data-center construction market is expected to swell to 57 billion dollars over the next five years.\nWho’s responsible for keeping a lid on digital-related emissions? “Nobody!” replies Falsafi. “Nobody is being held accountable for those emissions. We pay telecom operators for our internet connections, for example, but the services we use on the internet – like Google and Facebook – are free. And those service providers aim to collect as much data about us as possible to improve their services. At no point in this arrangement are carbon emissions taken into account, since power use is measured at data centers and not on telecom networks.” Edouard Bugnion, EPFL’s Vice President for Information Systems, adds: “Data centers are basically technological advancement wrapped up in a consumable format. They are the vector by which cyberspace can develop. Google wouldn’t exist without data centers. Neither would much of the research conducted at EPFL.”\nTowards more sustainable data centers \nEngineers at EPFL’s EcoCloud have been working since 2011 to find a way around the supply ceiling. Their approach involves not only making data centers more efficient, but also reducing their carbon footprint. Nobody cared much about this latter aspect when the centers were first being built – but times have changed. “There are three things that need to be factored into the equation. First, the energy efficiency of data centers, which needs to be improved. Second, the CO\n2\n that’s emitted to run them, which can be reduced by switching to renewable energy. And third, the energy the servers give off in the form of heat – can’t we do more with that heat than open a window and warm up the parking lot?” says Bugnion.\nEcoCloud, along with the other members of the Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association (SDEA), introduced an energy-efficiency certification system in early 2020. Their program – called the SDEA Label (see \"\") – quantifies how much CO\n2\n per kWh data centers emit, with the goal of encouraging operators to use renewable energy. EcoCloud also scouts opportunities for EPFL labs to work with businesses to develop advanced systems for cooling, energy management, energy storage and power generation – all within a local innovation ecosystem designed to help data center operators shrink their carbon footprint.\nNEW CERTIFICATION SYSTEM ENCOURAGES GREENER DATA CENTERS\n© 2020 EPFL\nEPFL, along with other members of a tech-industry consortium, introduced the world’s first energy-efficiency certification system for data centers in January.\n“When we created  in 2011,” says director Babak Falsafi, “the goal was to cut data centers’ energy use and CO\n2\n emissions – at the time, IT industry heavyweights cared only about the financial and business aspects. We developed pioneering technology that brought renewable energy into the data center ecosystem.” His research center aims to spur innovation across the ICT sector – from algorithms to infrastructure – to help meet today’s major challenges.\nAnd data centers will play a growing role in those challenges as people rely more and more on digital technology. The amount of power consumed by data centers is set to expand rapidly, and by 2030 could account for 8% of global electricity use.\nMaking data centers carbon-free \nTo help keep that electricity use in check, a consortium of Swiss tech-industry organizations created the Swiss Datacenter Efficiency Association (SDEA). The initiative was spearheaded by digitalswitzerland and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE); members include EcoCloud, HPE, Green IT Switzerland, the Luzern University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU), the Swiss datacenter association (Vigiswiss) and the Swiss telecom industry association (ASUT). The initiative is also being supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) through its SwissEnergy program.\nIn January, the SDEA introduced a green certification system specifically for data centers. The system involves calculating data centers’ carbon footprint based on the energy efficiency of the building and IT equipment, as well as the IT equipment’s power load. “Until now, there was no way to measure data centers’ impact on CO\n2\n emissions,” says Falsafi. “Our certification system is unique because it also factors in the source of the power used and how well heat is recovered. Everything is connected – if a data center uses renewable energy, its performance improves.”\nThe SDEA uses three certification levels (bronze, silver and gold) to encourage data center operators to cut their power consumption. Pilot tests at ten sites in Switzerland show that the SDEA’s “toolkit” effectively takes into account their efforts to shift in full or in part to renewable energy.\nArriving at just the right time\nSince computer processors are reaching their maximum physical capacity, the only solution for managing the surging amount of data is to build more data centers. “Our certification system comes at just the right time,” says Falsafi. “We hope that it will encourage data center operators to build facilities that run on renewable energy, and stimulate innovation and investment in this field.”\nUSING MATHEMATICS TO MANAGE BIG DATA\n© 2020 EPFL\nMost organizations run a huge variety of computer software and hardware, which bogs down their IT systems and wastes energy. But Anastasia Ailamaki has a found a solution that works by giving all the different system components a common language.\n“Sustainability means coming up with solutions for problems as efficiently as possible while using fewer resources,” says Anastasia Ailamaki, a professor at  and founder of local startup RAW Labs SA. “And so we can say that our research is directly related to sustainability.” The engineers at DIAS are developing a data management system that makes as much use as possible of an organization’s existing hardware and software – a real challenge given the wide variety of hardware and software out there.\n“Hardware that’s turned on but not used is a waste of energy,” says Ailamaki. In the same way that our bodies burn calories even when we’re just sitting there, computers burn up a considerable amount energy even when they’re idling. “Most computers are used to only 20% of their potential. It’s like if you filled up your fridge with food, let it sit there until it goes bad, and then complained that you don’t have anything to eat,” says Ailamaki. The same holds true for software. She explains: “Today most people use only 10% of the data they store. But before data can be stored, they have to be saved onto a server and standardized – and you generally need to know what you want to do with them afterwards.” She offers this example: “Suppose you have a series of interviews saved in different Word files, along with an Excel file listing all the companies that invest in EPFL startups. Imagine you wanted to search all the files and find the names of people who mention sustainability in their interview \nand\n who have invested in an EPFL startup. You couldn’t do it. The data would have to be stored in a database for that kind of query. And because the data are stored in two different formats – text and table – you’d have to standardize them before you could save them in the database.”\nOrdering data à la carte \nAilamaki’s approach involves formatting the data even before this process begins. “Instead of standardizing the data, our system recognizes what kind they are and gives them a mathematical format based on how they will be searched. Then when it comes time to search the data, our program generates the exact code needed to execute the query – one query at a time,” she says. However, one potential drawback to this approach is that it’s significantly slower than conventional methods where data are already saved in a database and searches are done directly. But Ailamaki’s team found a solution for that, too. “Our system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remember the kinds of queries performed. It stores all the work done previously – much like a cache that lets programs respond much more quickly to queries of the same dataset,” she says.\nThe system, with its just-in-time approach, allows users to search any type of data in any way, combine data from any source and create a cache of the most frequently used data. It’s similar to ordering à la carte. And the system can be used with any kind of data, hardware or application since it doesn’t rely on code, but mathematics. RAW Labs used this approach to develop its RAW technology for combining different types of data on the fly and generating important information in a ready-to-use format for both businesses and consumers.\nWhen it comes to hardware, the DIAS engineers are taking the same approach. Their just-in-time code-generation method can develop a program for mapping out hardware’s properties on the fly and helping organizations run their IT equipment more efficiently. “With our system, organizations can use their computers at up to 80% of their potential,” says Ailamaki.\nSERVERS DESIGNED TO WORK LIKE HUMANS\n© 2020 EPFL\nDavid Atienza believes that when it comes to IT systems, everything that can be done locally, should be. That includes processing data where they are generated – thereby substantially reducing the amount of power required.\n is studying two major energy-related problems with servers. The first is that they aren’t being used anywhere near their maximum capacity. Actual use is closer to 60%, according to ESL head David Atienza. “Servers are designed for tasks that require a lot of processing power – such as running neural networks – but they’re being used mainly for watching movies or sending pictures via chat,” he says. As a result, they overheat. “It’s like driving a Ferrari at 40 km/h – it would burn up a lot more energy at that speed than a Twingo would,” he adds.\nThe problem is that even if the servers are the only equipment that overheats in a data center, operators still have to cool the whole center. To help find a solution, Atienza is working on the Compusapien research project, for which he received an ERC Consolidator Grant in 2016. His team found that cooling servers locally can cut a data center’s power requirement by 40%. They worked with engineers from IBM to develop a system where cooling water is used to lower the temperature of individual servers, as opposed to running fans to cool the entire room. With this system, heat is recovered in the cooling water and reused. The water runs through microfluidic channels that are just 50–100 µm high and sandwiched between two layers on a cooling plate. As the water absorbs heat from the servers, it transfers it to microfluidic fuel cells where it’s converted into electricity. The electricity can then be fed back to the servers as power, reducing the amount of power that the data center draws from the grid.\nProcessing data locally\n“The human brain works the same way. Blood carries nutrients to the brain and cools it. It’s just that with servers, the process is a little more complicated!” says Atienza. While a lot of data centers already use cooling water, his is the first system to use microfluidic fuel cells to recover heat and turn it into electricity. The technology – nicknamed “electronic blood” – was tested in a 3D prototype developed in association with IBM, and proved to be feasible from a technical point of view. Now ESL engineers are building a 3D version of the integrated system and plan to develop a full server through a joint project with another company.\nThe second component of Atienza’s approach is to process data as locally as possible since transmitting them takes up a lot of energy. One example of this approach is a next-generation Nespresso machine that the ESL team developed. Their machine uses an embedded artificial intelligence system to manage maintenance and restocking completely on its own. “More and more applications – especially those for smartphones – operate locally and don’t go through data centers,” says Atienza. “That’s a lot like the human body. Our bodies have lots of tiny modules that can carry out two or three simple functions; the brain gets involved only when important decisions need to be made. That’s a lot more efficient than today’s data centers where everything runs all the time.”\nINFRASTRUCTURES\nEPFL gets a new data center\nEPFL is building a new data center as part of the upgrade to its thermal power station. The high-density center, which will eventually have 3 megawatts of capacity, will be used to store, manage and process data collected by EPFL scientists during their lab experiments. Its sides and roof will be covered entirely in solar panels, and the heat generated by its servers will be recovered and used in the new power station. It’s scheduled to go into service in the second half of 2021.\n© 2020 EPFL", "summary": "Digital technology is running up against its physical limits.

{"id": 523, "text": "Hikers setting out on one of Switzerland's many walking trails often bring back beautiful photos, the occasional cramp and – quite unintentionally – ticks. These tiny acarids, which are present in dense undergrowth and at the edges of forests, are particularly active in hot weather and attach themselves to human and animal hosts passing nearby. Despite their small size, they can transmit potentially serious diseases such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Recent research by the Institute of Microbiology at CHUV has shown that ticks are often carriers of large amounts of chlamydia, a still poorly-understood bacteria that can be passed to humans and cause secondary disease. \nScientists are aware that tick proliferation and activity are influenced by numerous environmental factors, including temperature and humidity. However, data are still lacking on their regional distribution over time in Switzerland, which has been classified as a tick risk area. At EPFL's Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG), Estelle Rochat's thesis project set out to address this lacuna and to identify areas where ticks carry chlamydia. Her extensive mapping work has been published in the prestigious .\nTop collaboration with  and his team at , as well as with , great work by Estelle Rochat  - another  contribution to \n — Stéphane Joost @HOME (@stephanejoost) \nThree data sources\nAfter identifying the environmental conditions that are conducive to the presence of the castor bean tick (\nIxodes ricinus\n), Switzerland's most prevalent tick species, Rochat generated maps of their geographical distribution between 2008 and 2018. She drew on three databases: a 2009 field campaign carried out by the Swiss Army, during which more than 60,000 ticks were collected and analyzed; thousands of entries into a  that allows users to indicate where they observed ticks; and a tick collection project led by Rochat in 2018.\nShe then used machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence) to predict the probability of ticks and bacteria being present based on values taken from a set of environmental data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, etc.) in the vicinity of collection points.\n© LASIG\nThe machine learning program allowed Rochat to estimate the ticks’ locations, and revealed that the surface area of zones propitious for tick propagation grew from 16% of Switzerland’s land mass in 2008 to 25% in 2018. \nStatistically, the model works well. Using the rules of probability, we can tell if a given location is tick-friendly, or if, conversely, ticks are unlikely to be present. Using the distribution model, we then estimated the prevalence of bacteria within those locations. This in turn allowed us to identify sub-zones where areas that are favorable for ticks are also favorable for chlamydia.\nEstelle Rochat\n“A landmark project”\nThe scope, originality and fresh approach of Rochat’s research drew praise from Gilbert Greub, a world-renowned expert in chlamydia and ticks and Director of the CHUV’s Institute of Microbiology. “This is a landmark project, and contains sufficient detail at national level to allow us to draw conclusions. We can clearly see that between 2008 and 2018, there was an increase in high-risk tick exposure areas, which I believe is a reflection of global warming. It shows that ticks have migrated 300–400 meters higher up in subalpine zones.”\nFor Greub, the study is a valuable tool for prevention purposes, as well as for awareness-raising. In addition, it will be useful at the Institute, which is conducting clinical studies on the impact of tick-borne chlamydia on humans.\nRochat’s model is now available in open access and can be used in future research on other tick-borne pathogens. “It’s extremely interesting to see how ecological niches overlap. We used chlamydia in this case because we were working with Gilbert Greub, a global expert, but our approach can also be applied to tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. The algorithms needed to crunch through environmental data are freely available and can be applied to other datasets,” says Stéphane Joost, who supervised Rochat's thesis at LASIG.\nJoost sees an opportunity for the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health to fine-tune its risk maps for ticks – which will be increasingly present in Switzerland as a result of global warming.\nMore ticks? Remain calm.\nAccording to Gilbert Greub, Director of the CHUV’s Institute of Microbiology, the presence of more ticks in certain zones increases the chance of exposure to certain diseases. For the past three years, patient consultations for tick bites, Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis have . Greub reiterates the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health’s recommendations. \"Summer is beautiful here and people enjoy cycling and walking. The most important thing is to get vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis. Secondly, avoid hiking in high-risk areas that are off the beaten track – or if you do, wear long pants that can be tucked into your socks. Also, you should examine yourself carefully in the evening when you come back from a hike, including your back and any hidden areas. There's no need to panic or check every half hour. If you do find a tick however, use a pair of tick tweezers to remove it.\"", "summary": "A comprehensive study by EPFL and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) has enabled researchers to map the geographical distribution of ticks in Switzerland for the first time, as well as to determine whether they are carriers of chlamydia.

{"id": 527, "text": "Surface wear describes the process of material loss when two surfaces come into contact with each other. It has significant economic, social and health consequences – just think of the fine particles emitted by moving vehicles. What’s more, it can be observed at all levels, from the nanoscale up to the scale of tectonic faults, with the formation of gouge. There are several wear mechanisms, yet the adhesive type is most common. It takes place when two surfaces – such as two pieces of the same metal – rub against one another and adhere.\nOne of the parameters that influence the wear mechanism is surface roughness. A better understanding of how surface roughness changes during the wear process would improve our control over this mechanism. This could lead to significant reductions in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and costs.\nUnprecedented simulation\nResearchers at EPFL’s Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory (LSMS) have taken an important step in this direction. They have numerically simulated how surface roughness changes over time, and their results are in line with experimental results. What sets their simulations apart is their duration: using a method developed at EPFL, the LSMS researchers were able to simulate these mechanisms over an extended period of time. In other words, they managed to capture the entire process – from the initial geometry to the final fractal geometry. Their findings were published on 8 March in \nNature Communications\n.\nThis study is the LSMS researchers’ third on adhesive wear. Their first study – published in 2016 in \nNature Communications\n – used numerical simulations to describe how the process of adhesive wear produced fine particles. In 2017, taking their simulations further, they came out with a second study, appearing this time in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Science\n, demonstrating that it was possible to predict the volume, shape and size of these particles.\nImage of the computer simulation showing adhesive wear on a self-affine surface. © LSMS / EPFL\nIncomplete picture\nScientists are still far from fully understanding the physics underlying wear, and engineers must still carry out ad hoc experiments for each situation. What is known, however, is that worn surfaces often display a characteristic fractal morphology, called self-affine, that has some fundamental properties regardless of the material and the scale. The origins of this self-affine morphology are still unknown.\nLittle work has been done on how surface roughness changes over time – and it has been mostly experimental. One limitation of experiments is that, because of the debris that forms, it is not easy to monitor how surface morphology changes during the rubbing process. The researchers overcame this problem through their numerical simulations, which provide a constant stream of data.\nPowerful numerical simulations\n“We used high-performance computer simulations to track the change in surface morphology in 2D materials,” says Enrico Milanese, a PhD student at the LSMS. “In our simulations, we observed that contact between two surfaces always generates a wear debris particle. That particle is then forced to roll between the two surfaces, wearing them down. This led us to conclude that wear debris must be present for the surfaces to develop their characteristic self-affine roughness.”\nIn the future, the LSMS researchers hope to explore the origins of adhesive wear by applying their simulation approach to 3D models of materials that are of interest to industry.", "summary": "Using high-performance computer simulations, EPFL researchers were able to observe how surface roughness changes when two materials rub together.

According to Dr. Hintsa living a better life also requires us to rethink our concept of success and evaluate our goals in light of who we are and what is important for us.\n“The Brain Forum 2016 Innovation Award” will open the afternoon sessions. The competition will once again offer opportunities for early-stage start-ups to connect with leading experts and scientists in the field of brain research as well as with investors interested in the solutions of the future. More than 120 companies working in the field of neuroscience have already been screened. The six start-ups making the final round will have five minutes to pitch their projects to the audience and a jury composed of thought leaders in innovation.\n“Neuroscience and mental health: challenges and opportunities” broaches the challenges that mental diseases pose in terms of socioeconomic burden, public health and better management of patients. This session will also focus on opportunities to develop new strategies for integration of neuroscience with psychiatry and possible novel approaches to develop new medicines based on better knowledge of the biological mechanisms of mental diseases. These points will be discussed by Prof. Pierre Magistretti, Dean of the Division of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering at KAUST and Professor of Neuroscience at the Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Dr. Sophie Dix, Director of Research at MQ: Transforming Mental Health, and Prof. Julio Licino, Deputy Director for Translational Medicine and Head of the Mind and Brain Theme at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.\nThe first day of The Brain Forum 2016 will close with “Act like you mean it”, a reworking of Romeo and Juliet celebrating neuroscience in the 400\nth\n year since Shakespeare’s death. During this lecture‑performance, the authenticity of actor’s emotions will be investigated from a theatrical and neuroscientific perspective. Each and every one of us has been touched by our favourite actors’ performances. But how do actors convey such complex feelings? Do they really “love” or “hate” their stage partners? “Act like you mean it” will reveal both neuroscientific and artistic answers to these questions. Using artistic expertise and results from modern techniques to examine brain activity, Prof. Thomas Grunwald, Medical Director at the Swiss Epilepsy Centre in Zurich and Prof. Anton Rey, Head of the Institute for Performing Arts and Film at Zurich University of the Arts, will quarrel over the veracity of actors’ emotions during a performance of the Romeo and Juliet balcony scene.", "summary": "The Brain Forum 2016 opened today and is generating massive interest among specialists as well as the general public: more than 1000 people have registered.

Pristem was founded by Bertrand Klaiber, who is also its CEO, and is the first spin-off to emerge from the EssentialTech program run by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). This represents a major success for the program, which is based at EPFL’s Cooperation and Development Center and which aims to develop essential technologies to combat poverty and vulnerability around the world. This successful first round is the result of an innovative and unique approach pioneered by the EssentialTech program: combining high-level technological development with innovative business models to meet fundamental human needs sustainably and on a large scale.\nA world first: a radiology machine capable of operating in any location\nAccording to the World Health Organization, two thirds of the world’s population still have no access to medical imaging. This is especially problematic since it is an essential medical instrument, particularly for diagnosing tuberculosis and injuries resulting from road accidents, for example. At the same time, healthcare costs are surging all around the world, and medical imaging represents a significant proportion of those costs.\nThe technology devised through the EssentialTech program, which Pristem will bring to market in the next two years after recruiting specialist engineers, involves a digital radiology machine that is both robust and economical. The machine was designed to meet the needs of markets all around the world and combines both leading-edge technological solutions, meeting the highest standards of industrialized countries, with innovations allowing it to operate in low-income countries that normally lack the infrastructure for this type of technology.\nThe solution was also designed to achieve drastically lower total costs, in terms of the machine itself and all aspects of its life cycle (e.g., commissioning, maintenance and training).\nA machine that brings together the best of Swiss and African research\nMore than 100 researchers, doctors, engineers, technicians and students from prestigious institutions in both Switzerland and Africa have worked on the project, which was initiated by the EssentialMed foundation and led by EPFL’s EssentialTech program. Klaus Schönenberger, the EssentialTech program director, said: “I’m delighted to see the great enthusiasm for this project among the scientific, student and now investor communities. This shows that we share the same vision of universal access to essential technologies, particularly in the medical field.” \nThe University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Western Switzerland (HES-SO) and its advanced engineering schools have worked closely with EPFL, complementing each other perfectly, to develop a pre-industrial prototype. The prototype will be presented to the public on 29 October in the presence of Swiss federal councilor Johann Schneider-Amman, in an event organized by HES-SO.\nMajor economic opportunities\nThe development of robust, sustainable and affordable solutions is a matter of great interest for all regions of the world. As Klaus Schönenberger explained: “I am particularly pleased that the start-up we spun out of the program has attracted Swiss and African investors, because this shows that it’s possible to combine social impact with an attractive business model. Switzerland, with its technical and scientific skills, its quality-focused culture and its openness to the world, has what it takes to improve global access to essential technologies, and at the same time this is creating a whole new set of economic opportunities.”\nThe EssentialTech program already has other projects under development, and this initial success is likely to be repeated as it seeks to address numerous other global problems.\nAll \npartners and sponsors\n of the project are. \nThe prototype will be presented in an event organized by HES-SO on 29 October in Yverdon-les-Bains in the presence of Federal Councillor Johann Schneider-Amman, Luciana Vaccaro, rector of HES-SO and Martin Vetterli, president of EPFL:  (French only)", "summary": "Pristem SA, a company spun off from EPFL’s EssentialTech program, has raised CHF 14 million of new capital in a first round.

And a symbolic threshold has been crossed this year, as 31% of new first-year Bachelor's students are women. The total number of new first-year students also rose again, with a 6% increase on last year.\nThe schools that attract the largest number of women are architecture and life sciences, and life sciences is the only school at EPFL where women accounted for more than half of incoming students in 2015 (50.3%).\nThe 2016 Bachelor’s degree enrollment figures suggest that this year’s class will be a strong one for women at EPFL. But this is a continuation of a 15-year trend. 20.5% of the study body was composed of women in 2002 versus 27.7% in 2015. The school of life sciences, which began in 2002 at EPFL, accounts for one third of this increase. But women have made strides in other schools as well, including engineering (rising from 12% to 17%), computer and communication sciences (from 11% to 15%) and management (from 21% to 33%).\nSlowly but surely, more women in the technical sciences \n “The technical sciences are less and less a male bastion, and the ongoing improvement shows that the progress we have made is here to stay, even if we would like it to happen more quickly,” said Patrick Aebischer, president of EPFL. “This is clearly the result of a changing society, but also of efforts that we have made in terms of encouraging women to study here and highlighting the careers that women graduates have embarked upon, whether in academia or entrepreneurship.”\nThe size of the overall student body should also increase, since the number of new first-year Bachelor’s students is up 6% compared to 2015. Physics showed the steepest rise (around 50%), followed by math (20%) and life sciences (15%). Of EPFL’s 13 schools, chemistry is the only one to see a significant decline in the number of new first-year students (-30%).

{"id": 541, "text": "Dwarf galaxies don’t emit much light and are therefore hard to observe, but they have a lot to teach us about how the universe was created. A team of scientists from EPFL’s Laboratory of Astrophysics (LASTRO) meticulously studied 27 such galaxies and found a surprising degree of variation in the mechanisms by which their stars were formed. The results of their painstaking work was published in \nAstronomy & Astrophysics\n.\n“Dwarf galaxies are the smallest and probably the oldest galaxies in the universe. Under standard cosmology theory, larger galaxies are formed by the merger of these smaller ones,” says Yves Revaz, a galaxy dynamics expert at LASTRO.\nWhile they may be called “dwarves,” they are in fact huge and can weigh anywhere between hundreds of thousands and several million times as much as the sun. They are also the galaxies with the most dark matter. The LASTRO team therefore had to develop highly sophisticated computer models to study these galaxies’ properties, size and temporality – all of which go well beyond our basic understanding.\nTheir models take into account each of the galaxies’ components – gases, stars and dark matter – as well as the relationship between dark matter and visible matter (called “baryonic matter” in astrophysics). The models also factor in the conditions under which matter was formed when the universe was first created some 14 billion years ago – conditions that are now known thanks to recent space missions carried out to discover the signatures of the Big Bang.\nStep by step\nTo analyze the dwarf galaxies, the scientists first took each model and went step by step through the galaxies’ key characteristics like how much gas (mainly hydrogen) they contain, the heating and cooling of their interstellar mediums, their compression and expansion processes, the successive generations of their stars, those stars’ supernovae, and the resulting release of an array of chemicals. The scientists then compared the results of their models with data that had been obtained by observing dwarf galaxies – more specifically, those orbiting our galaxy, the Milky Way, and its neighboring galaxy, Andromeda (M31) – using eight-meter optical telescopes, the biggest that are currently out there. These dwarf galaxies form part of what is called the Local Group and are close enough for astrophysicists to be able to obtain accurate information on the ages and chemical components of individual stars.\nMaking sure that the models’ results match empirical data is essential if the scientists want to use them to test their theories about dark matter, the kinds of objects responsible for the reionization of the universe, and the conditions and time periods for new star formation.\nThis is the first time that dwarf galaxies have been examined in such detail and under cosmologic conditions – that is, not by considering them as isolated systems but rather by taking into account all the interactions among the very first galactical systems.\nExcellent guinea pigs \n“The advantage of dwarf galaxies is that they respond very well to even minor changes in conditions, making them excellent guinea pigs for studying galaxies in general,” says Pascale Jablonka, a LASTRO researcher specialized in spectroscopy and galaxies’ chemical development and co-author of the study. For instance, by analyzing the light that stars emit, she was able to determine their chemical composition and how long it took them to form.\n“Our models enabled us to create a database of many different types of stellar activity and gave us valuable insight into the factors that can cause star formation to speed up, slow down or even stop altogether,” says Revaz.\nBased on the data they collected – which include an impressive number of different star-formation mechanisms given how “small” dwarf galaxies are – the LASTRO team found that the specific mechanism used depends on the density of the galaxy’s dark and baryonic matter. That density determines whether a galaxy will keep on making stars or suddenly stop. If a dwarf galaxy’s matter is too dispersed, then its hydrogen will get too hot and evaporate, meaning it can no longer form stars. If on the other hand a dwarf galaxy has a dense halo of dark matter protecting it, then star formation will continue apace.\nScientific article: \nMore simulations:", "summary": "EPFL scientists have completed the fastidious task of analyzing 27 dwarf galaxies in detail, identifying the conditions under which they were formed and how they’ve since evolved.

{"id": 543, "text": "For his EPFL Master’s project in environmental science and engineering, Francesco Giardina looked at the future of the Amazon rainforest. His research showed that trees that are more than 30 meters tall were up to three times less sensitive to precipitation variations than those measuring less than 20 meters.\nThese taller trees were older and had more biomass, as well as deeper roots that enable them to access nutrients and moisture lower in the ground, making them more resistant to drought. The project was supervised by Professor Fernando Porté-Agel, who runs EPFL’s Wind Engineering and Renewable Energy (WIRE) Laboratory and conducted in partnership with Columbia University. The findings were published in the latest issue of \nNature Geoscience\n.\nCarbon sink\nScientists across the globe are studying the capacity of the Amazonian rainforest to resist climate change, but they have not yet managed to fully understand or predict what will happen. The Amazon rainforest covers an area of 5.5 million km² and is the biggest carbon sink in the world. It therefore plays a critical role in regulating the global climate system.\nResearchers know that in the near future some areas of the Amazon rainforest will be drier than today, while others will be wetter, with random variations from year to year. The region has already experienced severe droughts in recent years, causing widespread tree mortality and affecting the forests’ carbon storage capacity.\nThe EPFL study sheds some light on how to resolve this problem: preserving taller trees will allow the rainforest to better resist water stress and droughts and any other future variations caused by climate change. It also serves as a reminder that continued deforestation will only make the Amazon rainforest more fragile.\nTree physiology\nTo develop his model, Giardina combined two typical atmospheric data – average precipitation at ground level and air humidity variation – with a map indicating all the tree heights in the rainforest, going from 10 to 100 meters, and their solar-induced fluorescence, which is a proxy for photosynthesis.\nFluorescence is determined by using remote sensing to measure the sunlight that bounces off the trees and then into the atmosphere at another frequency. This also revealed that taller trees are more sensitive to atmospheric dryness than trees measuring less than 20 meters.\n“Our study underscores the importance of factoring aspects of tree physiology – such as size, age, behavior and biomass – into climate models in order to more accurately predict how the Amazon rainforest will react in the future,” says Giardina. “The purely atmospheric models that are used at the moment don’t go far enough.”\nThis change in methodology should help to fine-tune researchers’ forecasts and could be used to predict the behavior of other major rainforests around the globe, such as those in Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "summary": "An EPFL study has shown that Amazonian trees measuring more than 30 meters are more resistant to precipitation variations than other, shorter trees.

{"id": 544, "text": "This week, every two hours, a humming noise can be heard at CES in Las Vegas – that’s when the drones come out at the Swiss Pavilion. Some onlookers are intrigued by the noise, while others have come specifically to see the 15-minute demonstrations, which are introduced by Nicolas Bideau, head of Presence Switzerland. The 200m² area around the stand is not large enough to accommodate all the spectators, some of whom stand on their tiptoes in the aisles to catch a glimpse of the action. In each demonstration and subsequent Q&A session, it’s clear that these aircraft – most of which were developed at EPFL – are attracting interest from professionals looking for potential collaborations or investment opportunities.\nFor US specialists, Switzerland – with its “Drone Valley” – is not necessarily a country they associate with aerial technology. However, as Romeo Durscher, the director of Public Safety Integration at multinational drone specialist DJI, says: “The real experts know what’s happening, and they like the positive, professional and visionary approach emerging in Switzerland, in particular around its elite universities.” Some Swiss startups are meeting with success in the US, like Flyability -which comes from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and supported by the NCCR Robotics, as Dronistics and FlyJaket- and Pix4D, two EPFL spin-offs that have forged strong positions in the American market. Flyability’s drones, in their protective frames, can bounce off obstacles and continue on their way, while Pix4D’s mapping and measurement software is widely used by industry professionals.\nIntuitive piloting\nWhile EPFL has spun off around 12 drone-related startups so far, a number of other aerial technologies are currently being honed in its laboratories. If they can be turned into practical solutions, they may one day be turned into business ventures as well – a good example of this is Flyjacket, which came out of EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems. Flyjacket’s Carine Rognon says that “events like CES not only raise our profile but also allow us to bounce our technology off a large number of specialists, so that we can position ourselves more effectively in the market.”\nTimothée Peter and Arthur Gay, who founded the startup MotionPilot before they had even completed their studies, are visiting the stands of potential partners at CES and presenting their joystick, which makes piloting a drone more intuitive. “For the 60 years that drones have existed, the market has been dominated by conventional remote controls,” says DJI’s Durscher, a Swiss native who has been living in the US for 20 years. “The new applications we are seeing, along with the foldable, haptic-feedback joystick that could work with drones, are in keeping with the market trend towards more intuitive ways to fly drones, particularly for rescue missions.”\nDurscher is also enthusiastic about Dronistics, which is developing drones that fly inside a light, foldable cage. They could become the standard solution for traditional, short-distance parcel deliveries, just as email has replaced letters.\nGetting to the starting blocks at the right time\nBy attending CES – with the help of Presence Switzerland and Switzerland Global Enterprise – and taking part in other programs set up by both public- and private-sector organizations, Swiss startups can learn more about the US market and start meeting people. But this second phase needs to happen very quickly: speed is of the essence in the US, even more than in Switzerland.\nAccording to Durscher, however, the race should not start too early in a company’s life cycle: “It’s better to take full advantage of all available financial assistance and build a solid project before going to market. It’s not easy to convince investors, including in Silicon Valley, and it’s best to arrive with a well-developed technology and a clear message.” As soon as a company hits the starting blocks, the race begins. For Christian Simm, who served as CEO of Swissnex San Francisco for a decade and is now CEO of Swissnex Boston, companies shouldn’t be afraid to knock on doors and get back in touch with the contacts they have made. “After a meeting, it’s almost standard practice in the US – and particularly in Silicon Valley – to get a follow-up email before you’ve even made it back to the office,” he says with a smile.\nThe element of surprise\nFinally, the fact that the US does not regard Switzerland as a leading player in drone technology – at least, not yet – can sometimes be an advantage. The element of surprise can make a crucial difference according to Simm, who often hears comments like: “Why didn’t we know that you had this level of technology in Switzerland?” Maybe one day Switzerland will be more famous for its drones than for its chocolate and watches.", "summary": "This week, four EPFL-designed drones are being shown in the Swiss Pavilion at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

{"id": 551, "text": "Last year, EPFL’s Center for Learning Sciences (LEARN) launched an ambitious pilot project. The idea was to teach computer science and computational thinking skills to over 350 generalist elementary teachers – 98% of whom were women – and to inspire them to pass on their new-found knowledge to pupils despite resistance to technology in the classroom. LEARN, which coordinates Vaud Canton’s lifelong digital skills program in conjunction with the Vaud University of Teacher Education (HEP), the Vaud Department of Education, Youth and Culture (DFJC) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL), has recently reviewed the initiative – and the results are in.\nTeachers from  completed 24 hours of training over four days: three at their school and the fourth and final day at EPFL. The course was largely team-taught by two trainers: a teacher familiar with the local educational system and an academically trained scientist.\nAs part of the packed program, the teachers were introduced to concepts including algorithms, coding, educational robotics and computational thinking. “We realized that unplugged activities would work best because most of the teachers had reservations about using screens in class with such young children,” explains LEARN academic director Francesco Mondada. “The program’s success also hinged on how we designed the course. We opted for hands-on, collaborative learning. By listening to what the teachers needed and taking their input on board, we built a flexible program that gave them the confidence to take what they’d learned and apply it in the classroom.”\nPromising uptake\nAn impressive 97% of the teachers who took the course ran some of the activities with their pupils, despite being under no obligation to do so. “We applaud what EPFL and our partners have achieved,” says Cesla Amarelle, Vaud cantonal councillor for education, youth and culture. “Based on the feedback we’ve had from teachers and school administrators, we’re planning to run the course again. We’d even like to fast-track the pilot phase.”\nThe unplugged and robotics activities proved particularly popular with the teachers. Among the favorites was the “sorting machine,” where pupils try their hand at sorting data using a universally known algorithm and consider the implications of processor speed. Another front-runner was the “stupid robot” game, which introduces pupils to algorithms, loops and bugs. One pupil writes a set of instructions for escaping a maze or collecting an object, and another executes them. The teachers also singled out activities involving the Blue-Bot and Thymio robots, which teach children about robotics and coding.\n“Children form ideas about computer science at a young age,” adds Mondada. “That’s why it’s so important to get computing onto the curriculum early on – for pupils and teachers alike. Some of the teachers who completed the course said they’d changed their view of technology. Their opinions are now based on evidence rather than prejudice.” Many of the teachers said they had a more solid understanding of how computers work and felt better equipped to run computer science activities with their pupils. They also enjoyed the fact that the activities got pupils working in groups and said that children found the exercises engaging and easy to grasp. The only downside was that, after the course, many of the teachers were still unsure about the concept of “computational thinking.”\n“We’ll work on that aspect ahead of the next course,” explains Mondada. “Likewise, we need to improve how we track and assess pupils’ learning. We want to make a long-term difference when it comes to digital uptake in the classroom.” The aim is that, by the age of 8, pupils should be able to write and execute simple algorithms, encode and decode data to represent and transmit information, and recognize the key components of a computer. This fall, LEARN will train middle-school teachers at the same ten pilot schools, plus a cohort of elementary teachers from two new schools in a condensed, three-day course.", "summary": "During the 2018–2019 school year, teaching staff from ten pilot schools learned how to teach computer science and computational thinking to pupils aged 4–8 years, with a strong focus on unplugged activities.", "claim": "During the 2018–2019 school year, teaching staff from over 350 pilot schools learned how to teach computer science and computational thinking to pupils aged 4–8 years, with a strong focus on unplugged activities.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [9, 10], "noise": false}

{"id": 559, "text": "What do solar cells, laser surgery and HD TV have in common? The answer is photonics: all three relate in some way to this fast-growing field of research. Photonics, or \"light science,\" goes hand in hand with many new technologies. It underlies any technique for emitting, detecting, modulating, transmitting or amplifying optical signals. Below is a little overview of the topic, which is highlighted in a special review of EPFL's monthly publication Flash.\nLight to replace electronics\n The field of photonics came into its own in the 1960s, with the advent of laser technologies. Optics gradually replaced electronics in many fields, starting with specific areas like telecommunications but expanding its reach over time. Today, practically every scientific discipline relies on optics. \n At EPFL, almost 30 different labs are employing photonics, with the labs divided between the Engineering Faculty (STI) and the School of Basic Sciences (SB). They deal with all kinds of researches, from fundamental studies (i.e quantum photonics) to concrete applications (i.e solar panels). \n The fields concerned include metrology, optical communications, molecular detection and more - in short, photonics is everywhere. It is used for work on all scales and across the entire light spectrum. \"Frankly, there are very few fields that don't involve photonics in some way,\" says Benoît Deveaud-Plédran, head of NCCR Quantum Photonics, \"because anything involving a laser or an optical microscope is based on photonics, to take just two examples.\"\nEPFL among the only Schools to offer an academic training\n Only two Swiss schools offer Masters studies in photonics: one is the University of Applied Sciences in Buchs (St. Gallen Canton), which has a Masters in optics. The other is EPFL, with its \"optics option\" in the Master in microengineering and its photonics PhD. At postgraduate level, the number of photonics doctoral students at EPFL is steadily growing, with 87 PhDs in 2012 as against 7 in 2003.

The School’s online distance learning capabilities were put to the test when in-person classes were halted on 13 March to contain the spread of COVID-19.\nHaving honed its production and publication capabilities under trying circumstances, EPFL is bringing the benefits of its expertise to Morocco as part of Excellence in Africa, a joint program with Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), a young university located 50km north of Marrakesh. Students at UM6P can now access 41 MOOCs developed at EPFL free of charge, while teaching staff can plan classes, track students’ progress and set assessments based on the course materials. \nMoroccan universities, like their counterparts elsewhere, have been forced to shut their doors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"id": 565, "text": "Once mastered, nuclear fusion will be able to produce enough energy – clean, reliable energy – to meet the needs of mankind for centuries to come. Unlike fission, fusion does not create radioactive waste with a long lifespan, and it is based on abundant materials that are easier to extract than uranium.\nNumerous international research projects are under way, and one of the most crucial challenges they face is plasma confinement. This refers to confining a gas that is heated to more than a hundred million degrees – considerably hotter than the core of the sun – so that the component hydrogen atoms will fuse and release huge amounts of energy. But these extreme temperatures must not damage the reactor, which means the plasma must be kept away from the walls. This is done using a magnetic field that is contained inside a ring-shaped chamber called a tokamak.\nOne-of-a-kind research facility\nThe Variable Configuration Tokamak, which was built in 1992 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland), has always been on the leading edge among research facilities in this field. The TCV tokamak, as it is known, is operated by the Center for Research in Plasma Physics (CRPP) and is unique because – as its name indicates – it can produce plasma in various shapes. This feature allows scientists to determine the most appropriate configuration for use in an energy-producing reactor. And it was thanks to this feature that in late 2013 the TCV tokamak was selected by the EUROfusion consortium as one of three national facilities on the European continent to be used to help design the international power plant ITER, currently being built in the south of France, and develop its successor, DEMO, a prototype commercial reactor.\nThe Swiss government, via the ETH Board, recently decided to grant the Lausanne-based lab 10 million francs over 4 years (2017-2020), to upgrade certain aspects of its facility. Thanks to these funds, the Center will soon be equipped to carry out new experiments on the TCV tokamak, particularly in relation to extracting energy and particles from the plasma. New mechanisms for heating the plasma with microwaves and with the injection of neutral particles may also be installed. At the same time, the Center is expanding its sector for lower density and lower temperature plasmas in order to explore new applications for plasma, such as in the medical field, the food industry and astrophysics. These improvements will encourage many Swiss and European researchers to visit Lausanne and conduct new experiments.\nThe “Swiss Plasma Center”, a new international reference\nAlongside these developments, the Lausanne-based lab is changing its name. It is now the Swiss Plasma Center that will impress its credentials on Switzerland, Europe and the rest of the world as a leading institution in this field. The renamed Center was officially inaugurated today in Lausanne. Attendees included Bernard Bigot, Director-General of ITER, along with officials from the EUROfusion consortium, who emphasized the importance of the research being carried out in Switzerland in support of the objective of the reactor being built in Cadarache.

Using the data from these sensors, a person with asthma would know what time of day the pollution was at its lowest in the neighborhood, and thus pick this moment do his or her shopping, for example. Parents would know where to take their children to play on a summer day, because they would be aware of zones with low ozone concentrations…\nThis project, run by four laboratories at EPFL and one at ETH Zurich, is setting up a new infrastructure for measuring air quality that takes advantage of already existing networks, such as the public transport network. Mobile, secure, predictable, and spread out over a given area, buses are an ideal data collection base. The researchers thus have set themselves the tasks of designing climate and traffic-resistant sensors that can be placed on vehicles and organizing the networking of the information they collect, using mobile phones.\n“The advantage of a sensor network like this is that you can collect more data in a much more evenly spread-out area than you can from the few fixed pollution measuring stations that are currently being used,” explains EPFL Professor and project leader Karl Aberer.\nAs a test, a box of sensors was installed on the roof of a bus that is part of the Lausanne Public Transport system and another was installed on a tram in Zurich. These devices are collecting atmospheric data, the presence and quantity of particulates and certain pollutants - ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric acid (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\nTowards practical applications\nA second important objective of the project is to better involve and inform the public about the quality of the air they’re breathing. In order to more precisely determine the best and most concrete use of the data collected, a complementary study is being done with the Nokia Research Center in Lausanne (NRCL). It could be, for example, a warning service or a smartphone application for people who are more susceptible to variations in pollution levels – children, people with asthma, the elderly, or people with allergies.\nAlthough the idea of the project seems simple, putting it into practice involves overcoming numerous scientific and technical difficulties. “Being able to precisely locate the sensors is very important for the reliability of the data produced,” explains Alcherio Martinoli, one of the four EPFL professors involved in the project. This localization can be done using GPS technologies.

The invention is described in an article published today in the journal\n Advanced Materials\n.\nBoth solid and flexible, this new metallic and partially liquid film offers a wide range of possible applications. It could be used to make circuits that can be twisted and stretched – ideal for artificial skin on prosthetics or robotic machines.

Applying liquid metal to a thin film in polymer supports with elastic properties naturally seems like a promising approach.\nThin and reliable\nOwing to the high surface tension of some of these liquid metals, experiments conducted so far have only produced relatively thick structures. “Using the deposition and structuring methods that we developed, it’s possible to make tracks that are very narrow – several hundredths of a nanometer thick – and very reliable,” said Stéphanie Lacour, holder of the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Neuroprosthetic Technology and who runs the lab.\nApart from their unique fabrication technique, the researchers’ secret lies in the choice of ingredients, an alloy of gold and gallium. “Not only does gallium possess good electrical properties, but it also has a low melting point, around 30o,” said Arthur Hirsch, a PhD student at LSBI and co-author of the study. “So it melts in your hand, and, thanks to the process known as supercooling, it remains liquid at room temperature, even lower.” The layer of gold ensures the gallium remains homogeneous, preventing it from separating into droplets when it comes into contact with the polymer, which would ruin its conductivity.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed conductive tracks that can be bent and stretched up to four times their original length.

{"id": 578, "text": "The Swiss transport sector has become the country’s leading CO2 emitter, accounting for 41% of total emissions. That proportion is higher than the figures for the European Union (28%) and the United States (34%). Most of these emissions (98%) come from road traffic, with individual vehicle owners responsible for two thirds of them. The large proportion of emissions generated by transport in Switzerland also results from the country’s large number of 4x4 vehicles, which represent around 40% of new vehicle registrations as opposed to an average of 13% in the EU. Strategies for reducing vehicle emissions are a key subject for discussion in both political and economic terms, and road traffic is expected to rise steadily unless tough political decisions are made. \nAt EPFL, researchers specializing in environmental economics looked into this matter at the request of the Swiss Energy Modelling Platform. Using macroeconomic simulation tools, they compared several carbon-tax scenarios between now and 2050. They found that a uniform tax on heating oil, gasoline and diesel fuel would be a cost-effective way to reduce CO2 emissions from 4.5 tons per inhabitant today to 1.5 tons. The proportion of total emissions generated by transport would fall from 41% to 33%. \nA uniform tax\n In practical terms, the CO2 levy, which is currently 25 cents per liter of heating oil, would be applied to gasoline and diesel fuel as well and steadily increased to 1.70 francs by 2050. “By treating fuels equally, you would avoid penalizing one sector relative to another. So if the levy on gasoline and diesel fuel were limited to 1 franc per liter, the tax on heating oil would have to rise to 4 francs. We also took into account the steady decrease in the amount of fuel consumed by car engines, which means that, in the end, the levy has very little impact on drivers’ budgets,” says Philippe Thalmann, head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Environmental and Urban Economics and co-author of the study that has just been published in the \nSwiss Journal of Economics and Statistics\n. \nThe researchers also factored other technological developments into their projections, such as the rise of biofuels and electric cars. Carmakers are under real pressure to change. For example, Volvo has announced that half of all the vehicles it produces will be equipped with an electric engine by 2025. Growth in alternative travel methods, such as public transport, car-sharing and human-powered modes of travel, were also taken into account. \nHowever, Philippe Thalmann stresses that “for such a tax to work, it must encourage people to use a clean alternative in order to avoid the levy. The resulting tax revenue could facilitate this, such as by subsidizing a network of electric charging points, electric car purchases and the public transport system.”", "summary": "Using macroeconomic modeling, EPFL researchers have identified the most effective carbon tax for Switzerland to meet the Paris Agreement targets: a uniform levy on gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil, rising steadily to 1.70 francs per liter by 2050.", "claim": "Using macroeconomic modeling, EPFL researchers have identified the most effective carbon tax for Switzerland to meet the Paris Agreement targets: a uniform levy on gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil, rising steadily to 25 cents per liter by 2050.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [37, 38], "noise": false}
{"id": 579, "text": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are seen as a potential means by which severely physically impaired individuals can regain control of their environment. BCIs use the electrical activity in the brain to control an external device. They have seen growing use in people with severe motor disabilities, for communication (by controlling a keyboard), mobility (by controlling a powered wheelchair), and daily activities (by controlling a mechanical arm or other robotic devices). But establishing such an interface is not trivial.\nIn a study published in the open-access journal \nPLOS Biology\n, a group of researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Geneva (Campus Biotech), led by José del R. Millán -, School of Engineering, suggests that letting humans adapt to machines improves their performance on a brain-computer interface.\nThe scientists trained two tetraplegic subjects to compete in the Cybathlon BCI race 2016, an international competition where competitors control an on-screen avatar with brain-computer interfaces. The results suggest that the most dramatic improvements in computer-augmented performance are likely to occur when both human and machine are allowed to learn.\nHow does it work?\n With BCIs, the electrical activity is typically detected at one or more points of the surface of the skull, using non-invasive electroencephalographic electrodes, and fed to a computer program that, over time, could improve its responsiveness and accuracy through learning.\nAs machine-learning algorithms have become both faster and more powerful, researchers have largely focused on increasing decoding performance by identifying optimal pattern recognition algorithms. It was suggested that the performance could be improved if the operator and the machine both engaged in learning their mutual task. However, direct evidences of such a learning mechanism were rare and fragmented.\nWinning the gold medal\n At EPFL, two tetraplegic adult men were trained with a BCI system designed to detect multiple brain wave patterns. Training took place over several months, culminating in an international competition, called the Cybathlon, in which they competed against ten other teams. Each participant controlled an on-screen avatar in a multi-part race, requiring mastery of separate commands for spinning, jumping, sliding, and walking without stumbling. The two subjects marked the best three times overall in the competition, one of them winning the gold medal and the other holding the tournament record.\nA specific training\n Electroencephalography recording of the subjects during their training showed that the brain wave patterns related to imagined movements (called sensorimotor rhythms), which have been adopted to control the avatar, became stronger over time, indicating that the subjects were learning how to better control the BCI during the training.\nThe authors believe they have maximized the chances for human learning by infrequent recalibration of the computer, leaving time for the human to better learn how to control the sensorimotor rhythms that would most efficiently evoke the desired avatar movement. Training in preparation of a competition may also contribute to faster learning, the authors propose.\n“This study is one of the few to provide multi-faceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training,” the authors said. “Contrary to the popular trend of focusing on the machine learning aspects of BCI training, a comprehensive mutual learning methodology could strongly promote acquisition of BCI skills.”", "summary": "People using brain-computer interface are more efficient when both human and machine are allowed to learn.

{"id": 580, "text": "The smartwatch market is booming. According to the International Data Corporation,* nearly 50 million smartwatches were sold worldwide in 2016, and this number is expected to grow to 150 million by 2021. The ever-growing range of features – such as a step counter, altimeter and GPS – requires sensors with varying energy needs. The most power-hungry function – the heart-rate monitor – devours almost 80% of battery power.\nBut a new generation of sensors developed by ActLight, a startup based in EPFL Innovation Park, can measure the wearer's pulse with the same precision while consuming only one-fifth of the energy. These sensors have been tested by Maher Kayal’s laboratory as part of a CTI (Commission for Technology and Innovation) project and are now ready to be used in smartwatches. “The longer battery life certainly makes things easier for the user, but it also offers major savings in terms of electricity consumption,” said Kayal. Thanks to this breakthrough, ActLight was named one of the best Swiss cleantech startups in 2015.\nTime as a signal\nThe secret behind the energy-saving sensors lies in signal processing. In order to grasp how the company’s unique ‘dynamic photodiode’ sensor works, we must first understand how sensors in most smartwatches currently work: Two diodes located on the back of the device – nestled against the wrist – emit light that penetrates the upper layers of the skin, and blood flow determines how much light is reflected back. A sensor placed between the diodes detects these light waves and transforms the information into electrical current, which is then translated into the pulse displayed on the watch.\nInstead of converting the light into a current and then measuring the current’s amplitude, ActLight’s dynamic photodiode sensors turn the current into time. The sensors use the pulse of light to identify the moment at which the current is triggered. The result is a small reduction in energy consumption with every heartbeat, but repeated more than 50,000 times per day it adds up to considerable energy savings.\nActLight is in talks with major semiconductor makers and is about to sell the rights to mass produce its innovative sensors. The new sensors are also attractive in terms of cost savings: “They are less expensive to produce because they do not require as much silicon for the same level of manufacturing,” said Sergei Okhonin, the company’s CEO.

{"id": 586, "text": "Duchenne is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy. Because of this genetic disease, one out of every 3,500 children spends their 12th birthday in a wheelchair. This disorder progressively leads to general paralysis, and most patients die of respiratory failure. The disease is caused by a genetic mutation that prevents a protein required to keep muscle cells intact from being produced. While most research focuses on repairing the defective gene, researchers at EPFL have come up with a different strategy. As part of their work on nutrition and aging, they discovered that large doses of a vitamin called nicotinamide riboside were remarkably effective in countering the progress of the disease in animals. Their work has been published in \nScience Translational Medicine\n.\nPatients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy are unable to produce dystrophin. This protein is mainly responsible for connecting the various parts of muscle cells; without it, the cells cannot deform correctly. As a result, cell movement mechanically triggers an inflammatory response, which in turn gradually destroys the muscles.\nA highly damaging second cycle\nJohan Auwerx's team showed that the disease leads to a second cycle of events inside the cells, a series of reactions that exacerbate the disease's damaging effects.\nSeveral processes are at work in the second cycle. First, the 'primary' inflammation overactivates a certain gene, which then consumes a large quantity of an essential component called NAD+.\nThis causes a shortage of NAD+ within the cell. But this component acts as a fuel for the powerhouse of cells, the mitochondria, which are especially important in muscle tissue. The NAD+ deficiency therefore weakens the muscle, an effect similar to that of mitochondrial deficiency in older people.\nYet the consequences are even worse than they appear. Deprived of energy, the dysfunctional mitochondria aggravate the inflammation that causes muscle loss. So much for what could have initially appeared to be just a minor side effect of the disease.\nReversing course with a vitamin: nicotinamide riboside successfully tested on animals\nWhat if it were possible to reduce muscle inflammation - and thus muscle loss - by providing the worn-out mitochondria with fuel? That would mean administering nicotinamide riboside, the vitamin precursor of NAD+. This is the hypothesis that the researchers wanted to test after having already successfully investigated this vitamin's effect on muscle aging in their work on nutrition.\nThey tried out their approach on animals, using C. elegans worms and mice that had been genetically modified to develop the disease. The effect was remarkable. When large doses of nicotinamide riboside were administered, the worms did not develop any of the disease's symptoms. The mice presented much lower muscular inflammation, and existing lesions were attenuated.\n\"We have good reason to think that humans will also respond to this treatment and that we'll be able to reduce inflammation,\" said Auwerx, the lead author. \"But we don't know to what extent. It's important to remember that we're not going after the primary cause of the disease, dystrophin deficiency.\" Which means it is difficult to predict the treatment's effectiveness. \"Regardless, it would still be quite an accomplishment if we can prolong the patient's life by several years and increase their comfort.\"\nClinical tests may be possible within two years\nNicotinamide riboside is a vitamin precursor to NAD+. This molecule is commercially available and presents no known toxicity, even in high doses. The vitamin is water soluble, and any excess amount is evacuated in the urine.\nAccording to Auwerx, because nicotinamide riboside is readily available and harmless, clinical tests could be possible in the very near future, maybe within two years. \"We will need to test the doses,\" says the researcher. \"In the animals that we tested, the quantities were so large they could not be administered through diet. To see if our strategy works on humans, we will have to use massive doses of synthetic molecules.\"\nThe genetic mutation that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy was discovered 30 years ago. 2016 is thus an anniversary year, and it has already been marked by the FDA's recent approval of a promising treatment that partially corrects the defective gene in certain patients. \"My hope is that we will give people suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy a second reason to celebrate in 2016,\" says Auwerx.", "summary": "Researchers are working on a new strategy to combat one of the most severe forms of muscular dystrophy.

{"id": 589, "text": "Hundreds of devices around us use liquid crystals. Screens of all kinds – telephones, computers, flat-screen televisions – are based on this well-established technology, which has been studied for more than a hundred years and was first put into practical use about a half-century ago.\n The principle hasn’t changed much over the years. Each point on the screen (pixel) contains a liquid crystalline substance, and an applied voltage causes the crystals to polarize, or all to point in the same direction. If this direction is parallel to the orientation of the polarized glass covering them, light can travel through. If not, the light is blocked and the pixel becomes opaque.\nWhile this is sufficient for many applications, the technique nonetheless has its limitations, stemming from a short “response time” . When the voltage is cut off or its orientation is changed, the crystals and screen lose their parallel orientation and light is blocked. But this reorganization takes a certain amount of time, about a hundredth of a second at best.\nTargeting the kilohertz threshold\nUsing a fundamentally new approach, developed by scientists in EPFL’s Optics Laboratory (LO), in collaboration with the Liquid Crystals Laboratory at the University of Calabria (Italy), future LCDs might finally be able to overcome this limitation. “We have measured response rates under a thousandth of a second,” affirms EPFL scientist Andreas Vasdekis. To breach this “barrier,” the researchers used optofluidics, a field of investigation in which the LO and its director, Demetri Psaltis, who is also Dean of the School of Engineering, are recognized pioneers. An article outlining their method has been published recently in the journal Nature Photonics.\n“Instead of applying a voltage to our crystals, we create flow in a microchannel, via mechanical pressure exerted on the walls of the microchannel,” explains Andreas Vasdekis. This so-called “peristaltic” technique is comparable to the mechanism by which food is propelled through the esophagus.\nGo with the flow\nWhen the flow advances or retreats in these tiny (just a few microns in diameter) channels, the crystals change orientation slightly in order to align themselves with the current, thus permitting light to pass through. “It’s a more direct method than using voltage. It’s mechanical, which allows us to reduce the reaction time in the crystals to much lower values,” the scientist explains.\nFor the moment, this research is at the proof of concept stage. The researchers have succeeded in generating a 1 kHz cadence in the micro-tubes, or 1,000 oscillations per second. “We anticipate specialized applications, such as optical information processing systems, but there is also the potential for applications that would reach a broad public, such as new generation flat screens, or three-dimensional screens,” he continues. There is also the added advantage that the technology can be applied using industrial processes that are already established and inexpensive, such as soft lithography. Nanotechnological “pumps” controlled by high-frequency electrical impulses can also be exploited.\nCommercial opportunities are certain to follow, because “traditional” liquid crystal displays are so widely used. “The approach that we have developed is a major advance on a technology that is already mature and well established,” comments Psaltis. “That will allow us to rapidly develop applications, possibly within a five-year time frame.”", "summary": "An EPFL laboratory has developed a new technology, based on optofluidics, to improve LCD screens and optical information processing systems.

{"id": 592, "text": "2019 was a great year for EPFL startups, which raised a total of CHF 285.8 million, the second-highest full-year figure ever. That new investment went into 33 young companies, including three that raised more than CHF 20 million. In addition, with 23 new spin-offs created in 2019, EPFL’s ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship is in excellent shape; the only previous year to yield a higher figure was 2016, when 25 new companies were founded.\nFunds raised by EPFL startups since 2010\n10 spin-offs raised more than CHF 10 million each\n2014 was the first year in which total annual fundraising by EPFL startups broke through the CHF 200 million barrier. Since then, they have stepped on the gas, raising more than CHF 200 million in four of the last six years, with peaks of more than CHF 390 million in 2016 and over CHF 280 million in 2019. This increase results from the growing number of startups being created and the various types of assistance available for those wanting to start a business, along with EPFL’s entrepreneurial ecosystem and its participation in events such as CES in Las Vegas and Bits&Pretzels in Munich. More broadly, Switzerland’s rise up the world’s startup rankings is also playing a role. The Swiss ecosystem ranked among the world’s top 30 according to Genome’s annual Global Startup Ecosystem Report published in May 2019. It is also regarded as an ecosystem to watch in the DeepTech sector, where startups are based on disruptive innovations. In addition, the hub consisting of Lausanne, Bern and Geneva ranks sixth among the world’s top life sciences ecosystems, ahead of those in the United States and London.\nLooking more closely at the CHF 285 million raised in 2019, we see that three startups each raised more than CHF 20 million. Kandou Bus attracted the most investment: CHF 56 million, in its third funding round. The company specializes in very low-power connectivity, and the money raised will enable it to launch an essential component to make the world’s first USB-C plugs that are compatible with the new USB4 standard that was officially announced in September. Anokion, which focuses on the treatment of autoimmune diseases, raised CHF 40 million. It was founded in 2010 and designs proteins that modulate the harmful inflammatory immune response in order to treat diseases such as multiple sclerosis, celiac and type-1 diabetes. Also among the top three fundraisers last year was Cellestia Biotech, which attracted CHF 20 million from investors. The money will enable it to continue clinical trials involving molecules targeting NOTCH-driven cancers, in which cells have a defect in their signaling pathway. Seven other companies raised more than CHF 10 million each, and another four raised between CHF 5 million and CHF 10 million.\nThis sort of funding is essential for the development of startups that use leading-edge research, which often do not become profitable until several years after they were created. Achieving profitability is often a long and expensive process, involving steps such as patent filings, clinical trials and prototyping. EPFL does not derive immediate financial benefit from its startups, and these companies are rarely bought out, but those that succeed are a real boon for the region. Not only do they create jobs, but they spur the ambitions of future entrepreneurs and attract the attention of other investors.\nFunds raised across a very wide range of fields\nMany innovative products nowadays rely on technologies from multiple disciplines. If one wants to breakdown of startup funding by its primary field of research area, we find that these areas vary from year to year. 2019 was a particularly good year for startups that are based on research in the wide area of engineering , which attracted almost CHF 130 million in investment including CHF 56 million for Kandou Bus, CHF 18.1 million for satellite antenna specialist Swissto12 and CHF 16.5 million for Bestmile. A combined CHF 40 million was raised by nine other young engineering firms. Biotech was next, with more than CHF 82 million raised, mostly by Anokion and Cellestia Biotech. IT and communications ranked third, with CHF 40 million raised by only three spin-offs: Cyberhaven, L2F and Artmyn.\nMedtech-biotech is still the main sector among EPFL spin-offs founded in 2019, followed closely by engineering. There is also an increasing number of spin-offs offering sustainable products and services.\n23 spin-offs were created at EPFL in 2019\nEPFL startups – figures and initiatives\nSince 2000, 293 spin-offs have been created at EPFL. Of those, 116 are currently located at EPFL Innovation Park, while 31 startups are being developed in the La Forge co-working space. To foster entrepreneurship among students, EPFL is continuing its Innogrant program, which helps them create their own companies. Eleven new Innogrants were awarded in 2019, making a total of 145 since the program began in 2005. Since 2017, the XGrant program, which encourages and supports startup plans developed by EPFL Bachelor’s and Master’s students, has developed a solid pipeline of projects. It awarded 13 grants in 2019, making a total of 30 since it was created. In late 2018, two programs were set up to fund initiatives that have a positive social or environmental impact: YGrants, for Bachelor’s and Master’s students, and PlayGrants, for EPFL researchers. In 2019, six YGrants and five PlayGrants were awarded.\nIn terms of events, EPFL’s first Investor Day took place in November 2019. It featured 78 startups and was attended by more than 200 investors from Switzerland and around the world. Looking ahead, Marc Gruber, Vice President of Innovation at EPFL, indicates that the school will launch several new initiatives in 2020 that intend to further strengthen the entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem.", "summary": "2019 was the second-best year ever in terms of fundraising by EPFL startups, which attracted CHF 285.8 million in new investment.

{"id": 593, "text": "DNA sequencing is a technique that can determine exact sequence of a DNA molecule. One of the most critical biological and medical tools available today, it lies at the core of genome analysis. Reading the exact make-up of genes, scientists can detect mutations, or even identify different organisms. A powerful DNA sequencing method uses tiny, nano-sized pores that read DNA as it passes through. However, “nanopore sequencing” is prone to high inaccuracy because DNA usually passes through very fast. EPFL scientists have now discovered a viscous liquid that slows down the process up to a thousand times, vastly improving the method’s resolution and accuracy. The breakthrough is published in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nReading too fast\nDNA is a long molecule made up of four repeating different building-blocks. These are called “nucleotides” and are strung together in various combinations that contain the cell’s genetic information, such as genes. Essentially, the four nucleotides compose all genetic language. DNA sequencing seeks to decipher this language, breaking it back down to individual letters.\nIn nanopore sequencing, DNA passes through a tiny pore in a membrane, much like a thread goes through a needle. The pore also contains an electrical current. As each of the four nucleotides pass through the pore, they block the current in individual ways that can be used to identify them. Though powerful, the method suffers from high speed: DNA goes through the pore too quickly to be read with enough accuracy.\nSlowing things down\nThe lab of Aleksandra Radenovic at EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering has now overcome the problem of speed by using a thick, viscous liquid that slows the passage of DNA two to three orders of magnitude. As a result, sequencing accuracy improves down to single nucleotides.\nThe research was carried out by Jiandong Feng and Ke Liu, working with colleagues in Andras Kis’s lab at EPFL. The two researchers developed a film made of molybdenum disulfide (MoS\n2\n), only 0.7 nm in thickness. This is already an innovation over attempts in the field that use graphene: DNA is a fairly sticky molecule and MoS\n2\n is considerably less adhesive than graphene. The team then created a nanopore on membrane, almost 3 nm wide.\nThe next step was to dissolve DNA in a thick liquid that contained charged ions and whose molecular structure can be fine-tuned to change its thickness, or “viscosity gradient”. The liquid belongs to the class of “room-temperature ionic liquids”, which are basically salts dissolved in a solution. The EPFL scientists exploited the liquid’s tunability to bring it to an ideal viscosity gradient – enough to slow down DNA.\nFinally, the team tested their system by passing known nucleotides, dissolved in the liquid, through the nanopore multiple times. This allowed them to take an average reading for each one of the four nucleotides, which can be used to identify them later on.\nAlthough still at a testing stage, the team is aiming to continue their work by testing entire DNA strands. “We are seeking opportunities to commercialize this technique, which is promising for sequencing with solid-state nanopores,” says Jiandong Feng.\nThe scientists also predict that using high-end electronics and control of the viscosity gradient of the liquid could further optimize the system. By combining ionic liquids with nanopores on molybdenum disulfide thin films, they hope to create a cheaper DNA sequencing platform with a better output.\nThe work offers an innovative way that can improve one of the best DNA sequencing methods available. “In years to come, sequencing technology will definitely shift from research to clinics,” says Aleksandra Radenovic. “For that, we need rapid and affordable DNA sequencing – and nanopore technology can deliver.”\nThis work was carried out between EPFL’s Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology and Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structure. It was funded by the European Research Council.\nReference\nFeng J, Liu K, Bulushev RD, Khlybov S, Dumcenco D, Kis A, Radenovic A. \nIdentification of single nucleotides in MoS\n2\n nanopores.\nNature Nanotechnology\n 21 September 2015.

The permanent EPFL Valais Wallis project is expected to stimulate the cantonal economy markedly, both on the short and long term.\nBy attracting the Lausanne-based Federal Institute to the canton Valais, the Council of States is underlining both its international ambitions and its commitment to creating framework conditions that are indispensable for the future of the canton. It is also looking to further strengthen research and collaborative efforts with the HES-SO Valais Wallis, with institutions of applied research and with the local business network, particularly through the Ark Foundation.\nEnergy, green chemistry, biotech and bioengineering\n The canton Valais, through its economic, industrial and topographical characteristics, has a unique potential for establishing collaborations in the following areas:\nEnergy: Hydropower and wind turbines, energy mix management, turbomachinery, smart grid, energy management, green chemistry (manufacture and transformation of biomass, use and development of CO2 produced by thermal power plants),\nHealth and nutrition : biotech (manufacture of proteins and viruses from organic cultures, separation and purification of synthetic proteins necessary for producing drugs, vaccines, and gene therapies, etc…) and bioengineering (robotics, motor and visual rehabilitation etc…).\nAll these research areas will also strengthen existing scientific and clinical collaborations with the HES-SO Valais Wallis, and with other institutions, including IRO, IDIAP, CREM, the Hospital of the Valais and the SUVA. The Canton has also indicated its willingness to establish a “renewable energy” plan that is coherent, eco-compatible and sustainable over the long term.\nIn order to attain the scientific critical mass that is sufficient at both a national and international level, the future structure of EPFL Valais Wallis, which will go into effect as soon as 2014, is expected to include:\nTransfer and creation in the canton Valais, by EPFL, of four research chairs, including the promotion to full professor of the director of the Ophthalmologic Research Institute (IRO);\nSimultaneous creation by the canton Valais of seven additional tenure track professorships and the provision of required infrastructure for the entirety of the project;\nEstablishment of joint educational programs between EPFL and the Valais-based institutions of higher learning.\nThe project is in line with the many existing and evolving collaborations between EPFL and the canton Valais. EPFL was a founding member or has provided considerable support to several existing research centers in the canton (IDIAP, CREM, IRO).

In fact, that’s the whole point: recreating a cellular microenvironment \nin vitro\n to study physiological functions or test the efficacy of particular molecules. For her Master’s project, 24-year-old bioengineering student Yara Proust spent several months immersed in this new and fascinating world.\n“I was interested in regenerative medicine,” she explains. “My initial plan was to go abroad. I sent off several unsolicited applications but got nowhere.” After turning to EPFL’s student support office, IS-Academia, for help, she secured three offers: one in Paris, one in Eindhoven, and one from a Bern-based startup. “I decided on Alveolix almost immediately. We exchanged a few emails and they invited me for a 90-minute interview. As soon as I walked through the door, it just felt right.”\nA smooth transition to working life\nProust has no regrets about her decision. Officially, Master’s projects should last between four and six months. But Proust spent a full nine months – September to May – at Alveolix, combining a paid internship with her Master’s project and postgraduate research. “The great thing about working at a startup is that it’s a happy medium between school and a job at a big firm. It eases the transition to working life.”\nProust spent all of her time doing research. She used the company’s ground-breaking solution to test how cell cultures react when exposed to air and respiratory movement. She also carried out other experiments, examining aspects such as toxicity and viability when the cells respond to different substances or are handled in a particular way. The firm’s lung-on-chip technology is designed primarily to assess the efficacy of certain drugs without the need for animal testing. In the longer term, patients’ own cells could be used to develop custom treatments.\n“It was an amazing learning experience,” says Proust. “I got the chance to do a lot of biology work. My studies are much more engineering-focused, so it was good to have that practice. I learned a lot about life as a researcher outside the lab too – analyzing data, attending conferences and weekly progress update meetings, and simply talking to my colleagues.” As well as enjoying her time at Alveolix, Proust worked hard. Her efforts paid off when she scooped up second prize for her poster and oral presentation at the 2019 ISAM Congress.\nA great place to work\nProust was lucky enough to work under a dedicated and attentive supervisor at the firm. But she relished the human side of the experience as well. “It’s a young, cosmopolitan team involved in an exciting new field,” says Proust. “It was a great place to work.” She also enjoyed her time in a new city. “I loved living in Bern!” she says enthusiastically. “It’s a compact city – everything’s on your doorstep and there’s lots to see and do. The people are really friendly, too.” Proust fully embraced life in Bern, living with Swiss-German housemates and taking a two-month intensive language course. “I’d definitely study Swiss German if I ever went back there,” she adds. Proust will graduate on 5 October, so she needs to figure out her next move quickly.

{"id": 604, "text": "EPFL startups raised a total of CHF 217 million in 2018 – not far from the record of CHF 260 million set in 2016, a year marked by MindMaze’s CHF 100 million intake. These figures are up sharply from just eight years ago, when EPFL startups raised some CHF 50 million. “This rapid growth testifies to the entrepreneurial spirit that is very much alive on our campus, as well as the ambition and drive of EPFL-bred entrepreneurs,” says Hervé Lebret, Head of EPFL’s Start-ups Unit. Today, technology developed at EPFL labs is being readily transferred to industry and eventually on to consumers. The upshot is a growing number of successful EPFL spin-offs. Much of this is due to the various forms of assistance available to fledgling businesses at EPFL, through initiatives first rolled out some 25 years ago.\nTen \ncompanies each raised over CHF 8 million \nThe ten largest fundraising rounds carried out this year by EPFL spin-offs – companies established to market technology developed at an EPFL lab or by an EPFL researcher – exceeded CHF 8 million. Nexthink alone raised CHF 85 million to support its development of artificial intelligence-based software to enhance employees’ digital experience. That makes it one of the top three unlisted EPFL startups in terms of attracting fresh capital.\nThe next three biggest fundraising rounds this year were carried out by Cellestia Biotech, Abionic, and Kandou Bus. Cellestia Biotech announced this week that it has raised 20 million. This spin-off is developing molecules to treat certain types of cancer linked to genetic lesions which activate a cellular signaling pathway called Notch. Abionic, founded in 2010 to market technology developed at EPFL’s microengineering clean room, brought in CHF 20 million. The proceeds will be used to validate and launch its microfluid-based diagnostic tests for sepsis and allergies. Kandou Bus raised CHF 15 million for the second time, and will use the funds to step up the production and roll-out of its high-speed chip-to-chip links that enhance the efficiency of electronic devices. Six other EPFL startups raised CHF 8–10 million among which: Pristem, Bestmile, Akselos, Inpher.io and Amazentis.\nThe investors behind the CHF 217 million come from Switzerland, elsewhere in Europe (Index Ventures, Partech, Airbus, Shell and Innogy) and the US (Bessemer, Walden and JPMorgan).

Four students have just started a company for their app called Apety, which is now available on the App Store.Their initial concept was simple: they were looking to make the most of their short lunch break and eat the dish of their choosing with friends. Based on their own experience, the friends thought how nice it would be if there were an app to do those things for them with just a few taps. \"Apety came out of our third-year project for Marc Gruber’s Social and Human Sciences (SHS) course on entrepreneurship in 2016. We designed a comprehensive business model using a made-up company,\" say Aurélien Soccard and Teo Stocco, two of the EPFL students who cofounded Apety. Their professor encouraged them to keep it at, sensing the project’s potential.\nValuing customers’ time\n And so they ran with it. The students turned their core concept into an app that serves as a link between customers and restaurants. Customers choose the sort of food they want, and the app gives them the name of a suitable restaurant nearby. They can reserve a table for a given time and number of people. Then all they have to do is invite their friends and arrive on time – and they’ll get served quickly. At the end of the meal, the bill is expertly handled by Apety, which offers an easy way to divvy the amount up among the guests. The app saves customers time, helps them discover new restaurants and ensures they can enjoy a leisurely meal.\nRaising the number of covers\n Restaurant owners just need to enter their restaurant’s particulars into the app, including their menu and any specials. The app attracts new clients and makes the reservation process smoother. In addition to helping increase the number of covers, it simplifies the payment process at the end of the meal. The restaurants are also able to learn more about their clientele through detailed statistics. In Geneva, where the friends started prospecting, around 40 restaurants have already signed on as well as 10 in Lausanne more recently. \"We tested the app for over two months in Geneva with a few restaurants before broadening our scope,\" says Stocco. The app works well, and their concept has earned them a number of recent plaudits. The students were awarded the “Young Entrepreneur Prize” by the French External Trade Advisers in Switzerland, along with a Microsoft Grant worth CHF 120,000. They are also supported by Genilem. Their company, now up and running, is listed on the commercial register.\nWhat does the future hold? \"Three of us are still studying at EPFL.

{"id": 606, "text": "Cement production is responsible for almost ten percent of human CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, it is one of the most sustainable construction materials. Now, an EPFL-led consortium has received backing from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) to speed up the development and testing of a new blend of low-carbon cement. Elaborated with partners from the Indian Institutes of Technology and from universities in Cuba and Brazil, this new blend substitutes up to half of the usual Portland cement used to make concrete with highly abundant clay and limestone, promising to reduce cement-related CO2 emissions by up to 40%. Applied globally, it could help bring down future global CO2 emissions by several percent.\nSubstituting a fraction of the Portland cement used to make concrete is a well-established way to cut emissions – understandably so, considering that the production of each ton of cement releases up to 800kg of CO2. However, alternative materials that allow substituting a large fraction of cement have been hard to find. Industrial waste products that are commonly used today – slag from the steel industry or fly ash from coal power plants are two examples – but are not available in large enough quantities to keep up with demand.\nSynergistic chemistry\nAs Karen Scrivener, the principle investigator of the project, explains, the strength of the combination of calcined clay and ground limestone, which the researchers call LC3 for Limestone Calcined clay Clinker Cement, lies in its chemistry. When used together, the aluminates from the calcined clay interact with the calcium carbonates from the limestone, leading to a less porous, and therefore stronger, cement paste. While in the past, these materials have been used individually to replace a small fraction of the cement, together, they can replace up to half without altering the performance of the final product.\nThanks to partnerships with industrial and governmental partners, the researchers hope to see LC3 become the new gold standard of low-carbon cement, produced by all major cement companies. Two industrial scale pilot projects in India and Cuba have already emphatically demonstrated the robustness of their method and the ease with which it can be integrated into existing cement production lines. In the next phase of the project, larger-scale production tests are scheduled with industrial partners.\nLC3 is designed to meet the needs of both industry and users. It was developed in close collaboration with industrial partners and designed to integrate into existing cement production lines. Clay and limestone are available en masse in quarries around the world. And consumers will be able to use it the same way they use ordinary Portland cement today.\nTime is of the essence\nTime is of the essence, according to Karen Scrivener, who heads EPFL’s Construction Materials Laboratory. With global demand for cement to double by 2050, driven by growing demand in emerging economies, such as India, China, and Brazil, the need for low-carbon cement is becoming more and more pressing. The just over 4 million Swiss francs in funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation will enable EPFL and its partners to do the necessary research and testing for the introduction and standardization of LC3, so that it makes it to the market as quickly as possible. “If we want to have a real impact on the sustainability of concrete – its cost, its availability, and its environmental footprint – we have to act before demand explodes in the emerging and developing world.”\nThe SDC support comes through its Global Program on Climate Change (GPCC).", "summary": "An EPFL-led consortium is developing a new blend of cement that promises to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by up to 40%.

{"id": 610, "text": "The liver plays a vital role as a filter in the human body. But what happens when it malfunctions? A physicist from EPFL, a clinician from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and a biologist from the Vaud University Hospital Centre (CHUV) and the Universities of Lausanne (UNIL) teamed up to perform a detailed analysis of hepatic encephalopathy, a type of brain damage caused by chronic liver disease.\nFor the first time, the scientists observed how diseased mouse livers can cause molecular disturbances in the animals’ brains within two weeks, before any physical symptoms appear. They also discovered the previously unknown role of two particular molecules in the process. Their findings, published in the \nJournal of Hepatology\n, suggest that brain scans could help detect liver-related brain damage in humans before their health visibly deteriorates.\nExcess ammonium\nThe livers of adults suffering from a liver disease like cirrhosis no longer filter out numerous substances. The psychological, motor and neurocognitive disorders that may result, referred to as hepatic encephalopathy, present a wide range of symptoms, including coma. One substance known to play a role in hepatic encephalopathy is ammonium.\nFour weeks after the onset of liver disease (bottom), astrocytic cells (red) in the brains of diseased rats show altered morphology with shortening and reduction in the number of their extensions (scale bar: 25 μm). © Katarzyna Pierzchala et Dario Sessa\n“Ammonium is produced when proteins break down,” says Valérie McLin, a professor in the Department of Pediatrics, Gynecology and Obstetrics at UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and HUG. “Some of the ammonium goes to the brain, where it is transformed into glutamine and used to produce neurotransmitters. The rest is filtered by the liver and excreted in urine. When the liver malfunctions, too much ammonium goes to the brain. The resulting rise in glutamine production can trigger cerebral edema and, in some cases, hepatic encephalopathy.” That much is known, yet two key questions remained: Are any other molecules involved in hepatic encephalopathy? And how long does it take for a diseased liver to affect the brain?\nImpact much earlier than expected\nIn order to answer these questions, the researchers observed mice with chronic liver disease for eight weeks. “We monitored the animals individually,” says Cristina Cudalbu, a research physicist who manages the 9.4 Tesla MRI machine at the CIBM at EPFL. “Every two weeks, we analyzed them through high-resolution spectroscopy by placing them in a 9.4 Tesla high-magnetic-field MRI machine. This allowed us to track the molecular changes in their brains very precisely from the very onset of the liver disease. And we made some important discoveries!”\nThe scientists observed molecular changes in the mouse brains within two weeks, before the mice presented any symptoms. “Based on earlier studies, we thought it would take about six weeks for the animal’s health to start deteriorating,” says Cudalbu.\nExternal signs of the disease, such as jaundice, malnutrition and water in the stomach, appear between the fourth and eighth weeks. “It was at that point that we saw, in addition to the excess ammonium in the brain, a sudden drop in the level of two other molecules: vitamin C, an antioxidant, and creatine, a compound that, among other things, helps produce energy,” says Olivier Braissant, a professor in the Clinical Chemistry Department at the CHUV and the Faculty of Biology and Medicine at UNIL. This is the first time that researchers have visibly demonstrated the role these two molecules play in the disease. “They come in later, after the level of ammonium increases in the blood,” says Braissant.\nScanning the brain to detect liver disease?\nThese findings suggest that the neurological signs of chronic liver disease could be detected well before any symptoms appear by analyzing the brain through high-resolution spectroscopy. The researchers are also wondering whether doctors could prevent – or at least limit – liver-related brain damage in patients by prescribing supplements, or probiotics such as Vivomixx, to make up for the drop in creatine and vitamin C. “We’re currently conducting similar observations in humans to see whether the brain damage is similar to that in mice,” concludes McLin.\nBringing together the right skillset\nDrs. Cudalbu, Braissant and McLin work at three different research institutions, and their paths crossed thanks to an entirely different research project being carried out by Cudalbu at the CIBM’s EPFL site. “My work consists of developing new, higher-performance spectroscopy methods,” she says. While looking specifically at a method using Nitrogen-15, she unintentionally triggered the symptoms of liver disease. “Since the concentration of Nitrogen-15 is too low to detect in healthy mice, I injected them with ammonium chloride. And that worked in terms of spectroscopy – I was able to obtain a better resolution than we typically get with conventional methods. But the problem was the mice now had too much ammonium in their bodies. So I contacted Olivier Braissant, who is a specialist in this area, and Valérie McLin, who was working on clinical cases in humans,” says Cudalbu. Her development work could therefore be applied in biomedical research on hepatic encephalopathy.\nAbout the Center for Biomedical Imaging (CIBM)\nThe \n is a joint research platform run by EPFL, UNIL, UNIGE, HUG and the CHUV, with facilities on the EPFL, HUG and CHUV campuses. At EPFL, the CIBM has powerful magnets that can create high-resolution magnetic fields reaching not just 9.4 Tesla but also 14 Tesla – in 2007 the CIBM became the world’s first lab to achieve such a high magnetism. The maximum level currently used for clinical medical imaging is 7 Tesla. “The higher the magnetic field, the better the resolution of MRI scans,” says Cudalbu. “With these new methods we hope to be able to detect metabolic changes in patients at an early stage and with a high level of precision.” The methods being developed at the CIBM will help doctors deliver early diagnoses and provide longitudinal, life-long care. This represents a major step forward for personalized medicine.\nThe CIBM was created thanks in part to the generous support of the Leenaards Foundation and the Louis-Jeantet Foundation.", "summary": "Scientists have demonstrated how chronic liver diseases cause molecular changes in the brain.

{"id": 612, "text": "Blocking a pair of sugar-transporting proteins may be a useful treatment approach for lung cancer, suggests a new study in mice and human cells published today in \neLife\n.\nCancer cells use a lot of sugar to fuel their rapid growth and spread. This has led scientists to consider cutting off their sugar supply as a way to treat cancer. The current study suggests this could be an effective approach but it will be necessary to block multiple pathways at once to be effective.\nProteins called glucose transporters supply sugar to cells making them an appealing target for therapies intended to starve cancer cells. But scientists don’t know the best ways to do this, or if cancer cells would just switch to alternative fuel sources if they are denied sugar.\n“Inhibiting sugar use in lung tumours could be an efficient treatment strategy, but whether glucose transporters should be targeted and which ones to target remains unclear,” says lead author Caroline Contat, a PhD student and Doctoral Assistant at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTo find out, Contat and her colleagues genetically engineered mice with lung cancer that were missing a glucose transport protein called Glut1 or an alternate sugar transporter called Glut3. The team found that tumours grew just as fast in the mice lacking Glut1 or Glut3 as they did in mice with both transporters.\nHowever, when they genetically engineered mice with lung cancer that lack both Glut1 and Glut3, they found that the animals grew fewer tumours and survived longer. By using an imaging technology called positron emission tomography (PET) and sugar labelled with radioactive tags, the team confirmed that the tumours used less sugar. The tumour cells also grew more slowly.\nFinally, they deleted Glut1 and Glut3 in four different human lung cancer cell lines grown in the laboratory, which caused these cells to grow more slowly. “These experiments suggest Glut1 and Glut3 together are needed to fuel the growth of lung cancer,” Contat says.\nUsing nanoscale imaging studies, the team also found that most of the sugar-derived biomass in mouse lung tumour cells accumulates in cellular compartments called lamellar bodies and that Glut1 is necessary for this fuel storage.\n“While more studies of these tumour fuel storage compartments are needed, our results suggest a new approach to lung cancer treatment that focuses on starving tumour cells of energy,” says senior author Etienne Meylan, Assistant Professor at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, EPFL. “In particular, treatments that block Glut1 and Glut3 simultaneously will be necessary to help stop lung tumour growth.”\n###\nMedia contact \n Emily Packer, Senior Press Officer\n eLife\n \n 01223 855373\nAbout \neLife\neLife\n is a non-profit organisation created by funders and led by researchers.

{"id": 613, "text": "Optical solitons are special wave packages that propagate without changing their shape. They are ubiquitous in nature, and occur in Plasma Physics, water waves to biological systems. While solitons also exist in optical fiber, discovered at Bell labs in the 1980’ies, there technological use so far has been limited. While researchers studied their use for optical communication, eventually the approach was abandoned. Now, a collaboration of a research group at KIT’s Institute of Photonics and Quantum Electronics (IPQ) and Institute of Microstructure Technology (IMT) with EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements (LPQM) have shown that solitons may experience a comeback: Instead of using a train of soliton pulses in an optical fiber, they generated continuously circulating optical solitons in compact silicon nitride optical microresonators. These continuously circulating solitons lead to broadband optical frequency combs. Two such superimposed frequency combs enabled massive parallel data transmission on 179 wavelength channels at a data rate of more than 50 terabits per second – a record for frequency combs. The work is published in \nNature\n. \nOptical frequency combs, for which John Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2005, consist of a multitude of neighboring spectral lines, which are aligned on a regular equidistant grid. Traditionally, frequency combs serve as high-precision optical references for measurement of frequencies. The invention of so-called Kerr frequency combs, which are characterized by large optical bandwidths and by line spacings that are optimal for communications, make frequency combs equally well suited for data transmission. Each individual spectral line can be used for transmitting a data signal. \nIn their experiment, the researchers from KIT and EPFL used optical silicon nitride micro-resonators on a photonic chip that can easily be integrated into compact communication systems. For the communications demonstration, two interleaved frequency combs were used to transmit data on 179 individual optical carriers, which completely cover the optical telecommunication C and L bands and allow a transmission of data rate of 55 terabits per second over a distance of 75 kilometers. “This is equivalent to more than five billion phone calls or more than two million HD TV channels. It is the highest data rate ever reached using a frequency comb source in chip format,” explains Christian Koos, professor at KIT’s IPQ and IMT and recipient of a Starting Independent Researcher Grant of the European Research Council (ERC) for his research on optical frequency combs.\nThe components have the potential to reduce the energy consumption of the light source in communication systems drastically. The basis of the researchers’ work are solitons generated in low-loss optical silicon nitride micro-resonators. In these, an optical soliton state was generated for the first time by Kippenberg’s lab at EPFL in 2014. ”The soliton forms through nonlinear processes occurring due to the high intensity of the light field in the micro-resonator” explains Kippenberg. The microresonator is only pumped through a continuous-wave laser from which, by means of the soliton, hundreds of new equidistant laser lines are generated. The silicon nitride integrated photonic chips are grown and fabricated in the Center for MicroNanotechnology (CMi) at EPFL. Meanwhile, a startup from LPQM, LiGenTec SA, is also offering access to these photonic integrated circuits to interested academic and industrial research laboratories.\nThe work shows that microresonator soliton frequency comb sources can considerably increase the performance of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) techniques in optical communications. WDM allows to transmit ultra-high data rates by using a multitude of independent data channels on a single optical waveguide. To this end, the information is encoded on laser light of different wavelengths. For coherent communications, microresonator soliton frequency comb sources can be used not only at the transmitter, but also at the receiver side of WDM systems. The comb sources dramatically increase scalability of the respective systems and enable highly parallel coherent data transmission with light. According to Christian Koos, this is an important step towards highly efficient chip-scale transceivers for future petabit networks.\nThis work was supported by the European Research Council (Starting Grant ‘EnTeraPIC’), the European Union (project BigPipes), the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, the Karlsruhe School of Optics & Photonics (KSOP), and the Helmholtz International Research School for Teratronics (HIRST), the Erasmus Mundus Doctorate Program Europhotonics, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the European Space Agency, the US Air Force (Office of Scientific Research), the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF), and the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency (DARPA) via the program Quantum Assisted Sensing and Readout(QuASAR).\nReference\nPablo Marin-Palomo, Juned N.

{"id": 618, "text": "In an unprecedented move, the European Space Agency (ESA) has selected a startup to lead a consortium and execute a landmark Active Debris Removal (ADR) mission under the recently introduced Space Safety Programme. EPFL spin-off ClearSpace will head the ADRIOS activity, developing technologies to capture and de-orbit space debris. The ClearSpace-1 mission will involve recovering a now-obsolete Vespa Upper Part, a payload adapter that once formed part of the Agency’s Vega payload rocket.\nThe ClearSpace-led consortium was selected out of 13 European and Canadian consortia that included the leading names in the Space and Avionics industry. Eight ESA member states have pledged funding for the ClearSpace-1 mission, and the budget was approved at the Space19+ Ministerial meeting in Seville, Spain, in late November. Work is set to begin in early 2020. The removal of the VESPA adapter is planned for 2025.\nSpace is becoming increasingly cluttered with debris. In addition to the 2,000 working satellites currently orbiting our planet, there are over 3,000 abandoned ones. ESA estimates that currently there are more than 34’000 objects of 10 cm and more and this number is rapidly increasing. All this junk is causing a major risk to spaceflight. When disused satellites wear down, explode or collide with other objects, they break up into smaller pieces of all shapes and sizes, many of which measure less than 10 cm across and are undetectable from Earth.\nThe right time to act\nThese fast-moving projectiles hurtle around the planet at 28,000 km/h, posing a clear and present danger to spacecraft and crew. Depending on their distance and trajectory, it can take centuries for these objects to de-orbit on their own (if at all). And with plans to launch thousands of satellites into Space in the next five years – most forming part of network constellations – finding new ways to clear obsolete objects and defective satellites from orbit has never been so urgent.\nSome 40% of modern-day mobile applications rely on satellites and Space infrastructure is a critical component of industries ranging from TV and telecommunications to logistics and Earth observation. The time to act is now.\nESA’s groundbreaking endeavour – to capture and recover one of its own disused satellites – is a first. It is a precedent-setting mission that will pave the way for other, similar missions in the future, laying the foundation for sustainable business models targeting the decluttering and responsible development of Space.\n10 years of experience in space debris\nSince 2010, researchers at EPFL’s Space Center (eSpace) have been hard at work on new space debris rendezvous-and-capture systems as part of the CleanSpace One project. In early 2018, they founded ClearSpace to pick up where the project left off – and turn the idea into a viable, sustainable business model.\nThe startup’s first debris-clearing space robot was designed to de-orbit SwissCube, a Cubesat-type nano-satellite launched into orbit by EPFL and its partners in 2009. The company will now repurpose its space robot to capture a new target: the Vespa Upper Part. This cone-shaped object, weighing 120 kg and measuring 1.8 m by 2 m, was part of an ESA Vega rocket launched in 2013 and designed to place several satellites into orbit.\nEight ESA member states, including Switzerland, will together contribute €86 million to the ADRIOS programme.

It notes the problems to designers as screen captures. The robot, currently available in beta form, will save a lot of time for designers and provides increased reliability. In the next few days, two of the designers of this technology from the Operating Systems Laboratory of EPFL, Olivier Crameri and Renault John-Lecoultre, will present their system in the United States during two major conferences for specialists.\nAnd how does a designer ensure that an entire application, which can contain hundreds of screens, is working properly? Testing websites still poses problems to web developers because existing tools are incomplete and full of loopholes. For each change to a small part of the code, it is necessary to test functionality and ensure that it does not cause collateral damage to the site. The start-up’s first product allows developers to combine the automatic exploration of the technical elements with a very intuitive Javascript API for specifying functional properties.\nSimply enter the URL onto the company’s website and press “start.” The automatic and intelligent explorer analyzes the source code and guesses where to click and what values to enter in order to maximize code coverage. It then identifies the bugs on screen captures and provides detailed information on debugging.\nAnd when the system reports an error—that is precisely what it is. “False positives are not possible. This level of reliability brings a considerable savings of time,” said Olivier Crameri. The system works on a subscription basis for a particular website and can also test mobile applications. It supports all HTML5 applications. Distributed via the “cloud” it will be commercially released in a few months.\nUntil now, no test has existed that can validate, for example, all the possibilities when it comes to an application in which user interaction is required, as with filling out a form. The strategy is to schedule the test scenarios, which are long and tedious to write, considering that the user clicks here and there… and then to automatically replay each change.

{"id": 628, "text": "As part of her PhD research at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS), Justine Gay-des-Combes discovered a sustainable method for improving the slash-and-burn farming practices traditionally used in Madagascar, whereby a wooded area is burned to create a field for growing crops. Slash-and-burn farming also plays a role in the island’s deforestation.\nGay-des-Combes, an environmental engineering student, spent two years conducting tests in two villages in the southwest of the country. The fruit of her labors is a socially responsible and environmentally friendly system that involves generating compost and refurbishing water wells; she also set up training sessions for local farmers on how to use her method.\n“Slash-and-burn farming is deeply ingrained in Madagascan culture, so I decided to respect this traditional method while making it more sustainable,” says Gay-des-Combes. During her project, she took measurements in corn crops, performed tests in new fields, and carried out carefully controlled experiments in pots.\nFarmers using the ancestral method burn entire swaths of old-growth forests – and sometimes second-growth forests – and spread the ashes on the ground as fertilizer. To test her research hypothesis, Gay-des-Combes selectively cut down trees in second-growth forests instead of burning them completely and placed some compost around the corn seeds that were planted in areas where ashes had been spread using the traditional method. The tests were carried out on soil that was no longer considered fertile in order to determine whether effective synergies existed between the ashes and compost.\nBuilding on a little-known method\nAfter developing and testing her method in 2014 and 2015, she was able to boost crop yields by a factor of five relative to traditional farming methods. The corn she planted grew to be 240 cm tall versus 140 cm with the traditional method, and the harvest had more and better-quality ears. Her crop yields might have been even higher if it wasn’t for a cyclone that hit the island in 2015.\n“Not many farmers know about combining ashes and compost,” says Gay-des-Combes. “Some of them think the ashes will burn the compost, but in fact, the ashes raise the soil’s pH to neutral, which is good for tropical regions like Madagascar where the soil is highly acidic. The ashes also help release phosphorus and other nutrients that are important for plants. And the compost provides the organic matter and nitrogen that are missing in both the barren soil and the ashes – that also helps keep moisture in the soil. This method not only makes the soil more fertile, it also makes farming it more sustainable.”\nBecause Madagascan farmers didn’t have enough household waste to create the necessary amount of compost, Gay-des-Combes decided to make it out of branches from nearby trees that had been left unused. “We cut the branches into tiny pieces using a machete and a woodchipper, and then we put the pieces into one-meter-deep pits. We stirred the mixtures once a week and controlled the moisture level in the pits. Seven to eight months later, the compost was ready.”\nWells and training\nAnother challenge was finding the water needed to maintain the compost. Gay-des-Combes created a non-profit organization called \nBlue for Green\n and through it raised funds with the help of EPFL’s engineering student association \nIngénieurs du Monde\n, of which she is a member and former president. She also got help from the Vaud Cooperation Federation (Fedevaco) to refurbish four wells and build a new one.\n“The wells serve two purposes: they let us maintain the compost, and they provide a source of drinking water near the villages,” says Gay-des-Combes. “We work with four instructors who maintain the wells, teach our farming methods to local farmers, and give advice on healthcare and hygiene. Half of the five hundred farmers who were trained have already tried our method of creating compost in pits. But it was hard to get them to understand the importance of regularly watering the 35 pits during a drought, when they already had to wait in line at wells to get water for their own use. So we are developing an automatic watering method to make it easier for them.”\nResisting cyclones\nOne section of Gay-des-Combes’ thesis discusses the effect that cyclones have on crops in Madagascar, comparing the 2015 cyclone season with a typical year. Crop yields drop by 75% after a cyclone, an increasingly frequent occurrence due to global warming. But adding compost to fields and leaving some trees standing – as is done in agroforestry – can prevent soil erosion and leaching by maintaining the ground’s structure and retaining some of the soil’s nutrients.\nGay-des-Combes’ thesis supervisor is Alexandre Buttler, Director of ECOS; he has been performing research in Madagascar for over a decade. He believes her work will open new horizons: “The ultimate goal of our research at EPFL is to give farmers a way to plant the same soil year after year instead of using old-growth forests as a source of soil. Justine’s thesis gives us some promising leads in the effort to improve crop yields and soil sustainability in one of the poorest regions in the world.”\nReference\n Justine Gay-des-Combes, “Improving slash-and-burn agriculture in Central Menabe,” Madagascar, 30 June 2017.\nThis PHD was supported by a joint-program of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nTropical deforestation around the world accounts for around 15% of annual carbon emissions. And deforestation is particularly alarming in Madagascar: some 70% of the island’s forestland has disappeared in the last 50 years. This is mainly due to the harvesting of fine wood, the use of wood to make charcoal, and the use of slash-and-burn farming methods. Slash-and-burn farming, an age-old technique, continues to be used in other tropical regions as well, such as Indonesia and the Amazon. Farmers have been growing corn in southwest Madagascar since the 1930s, mostly for export. But corn is not an indigenous plant and is ill-suited to the island’s barren, acidic soil since it absorbs almost all the nutrients in the ground. As a result, farmers abandon their fields quickly – typically after just three years – and clear forests to make new fields. But it is not easy for the forests to grow back in the fields that farmers leave behind. For instance, the dense and dry forest of Kirindy, where the EPFL research was carried out, is disappearing at a rate of 2.6% per year. At this pace, it will be completely gone by 2050.", "summary": "Research by an EPFL PhD student has found a way to boost Madagascar’s corn crop yields up to five times while decreasing deforestation at the same time.", "claim": "Research by an EPFL PhD student has found a way to boost Madagascar’s corn crop yields up to four times while decreasing deforestation at the same time.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [19, 19], "noise": false}
{"id": 631, "text": "Ultrashort optical pulses are becoming more and more relevant in a number of applications including distance measurement, molecular fingerprinting and ultrafast sampling. Many of these applications rely not only on a single stream of pulses – also known as “optical frequency combs” – but require two or even three of them. Nonetheless, these multi-comb approaches significantly speed up acquisition time over conventional techniques.\nThese trains of short optical pulses are typically produced by large pulsed laser sources. Multi-comb applications therefore require several such lasers, often at prohibitive costs and complexity. Furthermore, the relative timing of pulse trains and their phases must be very well synchronized, which requires active electronics that synchronize the lasers.\nIn a new paper published in \nNature Photonics\n, the research team of , together with the group of Michael Gorodetsky at the Russian Quantum Centre, has developed a much simpler method to generate multiple frequency combs. The technology uses small devices called “optical microresonators” to create optical frequency combs instead of conventional pulsed lasers.\nThe microresonator consists of a crystalline disk of a few millimeters in diameter. The disk traps a continuous laser light and converts it into ultrashort pulses – solitons – thanks to the special nonlinear properties of the device. The solitons travel around the microresonator 12 billion times per second. At every round, a part of the soliton exits the resonator, producing a stream of optical pulses.\nThe microresonator the researchers used here has a special property in that it allows the light to travel in the disk in multiple different ways, called spatial modes of the resonator. By launching continuous lightwaves in several modes at the same time, multiple different soliton states can be obtained simultaneously. In this way, the scientists were able to generate up to three frequency combs at the same time.\nThe working principle is the same as spatial multiplexing used in optical fiber communication: the information can be sent in parallel on different spatial modes of a multimode fiber. Here, the combs are generated in distinct spatial modes of the microresonator.\nThe method has several advantages, but the primary one is that it does not require complex synchronization electronics. “All the pulses are circulating in the same physical object, which reduces potential timing drift, as encountered with two independent pulsed lasers,” explains Erwan Lucas, first author of the paper. “We also derive all the continuous waves from the same initial laser by using a modulator, which removes the need for phase synchronization.”\nAn illustration of the concept behind the new method (credit: Erwan Lucas/EPFL)\nUsing this multiplexing scheme, the team demonstrated several applications, such as dual-comb spectroscopy, or rapid optical sampling. The acquisition time could be adjusted between a fraction of a millisecond to 100 nanoseconds.\nThe authors are now working on developing a new demonstration with the triple-comb source: “We had not planned for a demonstration, as we did not expect our scheme to work so easily,” says Lucas. “We are obviously working on it.”\nThe technology can be integrated with both photonic elements and silicon microchips. Establishing multi-comb generation on a chip may catalyze a wide variety of applications such as integrated spectrometers or LIDAR, and could make optical sensing far more accessible.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have found a way to implement an optical sensing system by using spatial multiplexing, a technique originally developed in optical-fiber communication.

{"id": 642, "text": "Policies encouraging public transportation and foot and cycle travel have been in place for more than two decades. Their effectiveness is reflected in the latest statistics coming from the cantons of Geneva and Vaud; people have changed their travel behavior. Data for the cantons of Geneva and Vaud from the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), carefully combed and analyzed by EPFL researchers, show that inhabitants are increasingly forgoing their cars for public transportation, walking or cycling. The number of kilometers they’re traveling hasn’t changed; however, it’s taking them longer to get where they’re going.\n“The result of our research is a detailed picture of the mobility patterns of the inhabitants of the two cantons and the major changes recorded since 2000. No other Swiss canton has done this analysis to date,” says study coordinator Sébastien Munafò. The study’s objective was to analyze the 2010 statistics from the FOS’s Mobility and Transports Microcensus, and compare it with those of 2000 and 2005.\nAn hour and a half of daily travel time\n The principal results indicate several common tendencies in the two cantons that border Lake Geneva. First, an overall reduction in the use of automobiles. The percentage of households without a car increased (one in four GE, one in five VD) and this should continue to increase given that young people are obtaining their drivers’ licences later, or sometimes not at all. Among 28-25 year olds, nearly half of those responding to the study did not have a license to drive (48% GE, 42% VD).\nIndividual trips, which are not decreasing, are more often taken using public transportation, walking or cycling. The number of people with public transportation passes increased by 16 percentage points between 2000 and 2010 (50% GE, 46% VD). In addition, walking is currently quite popular, representing 37% of trips by those in Geneva (+8 points in 10 years) and 31% of trips in Vaud (+6 points). “In the city of Geneva, walking and cycling now represent the majority of inhabitants’ trips (52%), confirming the importance of this kind of mobility in this dense region of the canton,” says Munafò, who is a researcher in EPFL’s Laboratory of Urban Sociology (LaSUR) and the University of Geneva Mobility Observatory. In fact, Geneva boats the most walkers of anywhere in Switzerland.\nIn the two cantons, every inhabitant spends an average of 1.5 hours (83 minutes) per day getting from place to place. This time is increasing, although the average distance traveled per day (air travel excluded) – 31 km in Geneva and 41 km in Vaud – is slightly decreasing compared to 2000. For Vincent Kaufmann, Director of LaSUR, this can be explained by heavier road traffic, increasing use of public transportation, and more travel done via walking or cycling, all of which tend to increase average travel time.\nLeisure leads the way \n The Microcensus also reveals that, as in 2000 and 2005, the inhabitants of the two cantons travel mostly for leisure. This motive represents 38% of all trips taken. “Free time represents, in reality, a large portion of our lives and thus the trips we take. The overall increase of the number of retirees in the population adds to this,” says Munafò. “In addition, even though we’re very conscious of trips to and from work, there are rarely more than two of these per day, five times a week.” In close second in terms of trips after leisure activities (23% GE, 21%VD), comes shopping (20% GE, 22% VD). The researchers think that the increase in the number of stores open in the evening and on Sundays, for example in train stations and service stations, probably plays a role in this.\nInhabitants of Geneva are traveling from home to work less by car and more by foot or bicycle (these two increased from 23% - 31% over ten years). They are, however, increasingly fond of their motorbikes; the number of motorbike/cycle commuters has more than doubled among the inhabitants of suburban Geneva (from 7% to 15%). In Vaud, these trends are similar, although inhabitants also favor using the train for their home-work travel, with a doubling in the number of train commuters to 7% (+4 points).\nGeneva’s inhabitants on the go\n This study, coordinated by EPFL’s Transportation Center, also highlights cantonal particularities. Geneva, for example, which has long been a destination for commuters, is now experiencing an outflux of its inhabitants, particularly those of the inner city, as they commute to jobs in suburban neighborhoods or the wider Lake Geneva region.\nIn Vaud, the other mandate with the public transportation authority of Lausanne, it is apparent that the metropolitan region of Lausanne has enormously benefited from an overhaul of the public transportation offer between 2005 and 2010, which has accentuated the decrease in automobile use and the increase in the use of public transportation, walking and cycling. “People in Vaud enthusiastically embraced the improved public transport offer, so much so that some regional lines have become victims of their success at rush hour,” says Christian Liaudat, head of mobilty projections in the mobility service in the Canton Vaud.", "summary": "In the cantons of Geneva and Vaud, people are using their cars less often and their overall travel time is increasing.

Launched on the morning of 23 September 2009, its mission was to photograph the airglow, a luminous phenomenon in the upper atmosphere. A few hours later, there was disappointment all round. The satellite was rotating too fast to take the photos. Muriel Noca, responsible for the project, explains that this was probably the result of a problem occurring either when the satellite was being ejected or when the antennas unfolded.\n Scientists and students were faced with a dilemma. They would have to wait quite a long time for the rotation of the satellite to slow down by itself. However, SwissCube was designed to last for only about four months. There was no guarantee that it could stand up to solar radiation and extreme variations in temperature – the deliverable of this students’ project was built using standard electronic components available in shops, and was not designed for such use.\n November 2010. After over a year of suspense, the rotation of SwissCube had decreased. However, bearing out the team’s concerns, some functions had deteriorated. At the Space Center, the idea of relaunching the computer system came to mind, in the hope that it might remedy the faults. “The problem is that, for security reasons, satellites don’t have a re-set function, unlike our computers.” adds Muriel Noca.\nEarth and airglow from the Swisscube © EPFL Space Center\n A former student of the SwissCube team, working at the Space Center, found the solution to the problem. Florian George was the only one to be aware of a command enabling the idle operation of the radiocommunications system. Thus, he managed to drain the satellite’s batteries. Temporarily deprived of energy, the system re-started as expected. The team was relieved when it became clear that all the functions had been re-established.\n Beginning of 2011. Arthur Overlack, a student at the University of Delft in the Netherlands, also made an essential contribution. Informed of SwissCube’s initial setbacks, he developed an IT strategy that would finalize its stabilization. Thanks to his work, the team managed to perfect this aspect of the satellite, by acting on the current of its three electromagnets, aligned with the Earth’s magnetic field. It then became possible to take photos.\n The first pictures eventually reached the team. At low resolution, they clearly show the airglow – this luminescent phenomenon, which results from the formation of O2 oxygen molecules, following their separation by solar radiation. These images will provide precious information to the scientists. However, the greatest success of the program remains first and foremost its educational dimension.

Silvia Müller, who teaches biology and chemistry at the Abbaye de St-Maurice high school, worked as an assistant in a biology review course at EPFL. “I wanted to understand why some of my students were failing at EPFL. I realized the problem went beyond possible gaps in their knowledge,” she said. “EPFL is a wake-up call for students who are used to being coddled, and who never had to take good notes or study hard.” Drawing on this experience, she came up with a way to help her students prepare, including an ‘EPFL-style lesson’. “This exercise led to a very useful discussion on what was going to be expected of them,” she added. \nLearning the scientific method\n Patrick Poscio teaches physics at Creusets high school in Sion. He used his time at EPFL to work on students’ methodological gaps, together with Jean-Marie Fürbringer, an instructor in EPFL's physics section. “We developed an analytical grid that students can use to apply the scientific method to every problem,” said Poscio. The problem is clear: students are not suffering from holes in their learning but rather shortcomings in their methodology. These observations will be useful for the two teachers, both in the high school and at EPFL. “This collaborative approach is very helpful in understanding the difficulties our students face, and I hope this training program grows and expands,” said Fürbringer. \n Bernhard Britsch, who teaches computer science and economics at Brig high school, worked in the EPFL lab that is developing the Thymio educational robots. “I was able to make a concrete connection with high-school teaching and come up with possible learning scenarios,” he said.

{"id": 662, "text": "The African Cities Lab aims to develop training programs in Africa, for Africa. \nThe initiative comes in response to the extremely rapid growth of African cities and the ensuing need for urban planners trained in the challenges specific to those regions, especially in the areas of urban mobility, resource availability, energy management, water supply and sanitation, and the effects of climate change. The goal is to give urban planners the tools and insight to develop African cities as sustainably as possible.\n To that end, EPFL will develop a training platform with massive open online courses (MOOCs) that is intended specifically for urban-development practitioners in Africa; in a second phase of the project, the platform will be extended to students. The platform will be hosted at Sèmè City in Benin. Known as “the International Knowledge and Innovation City,” Sèmè City through its training programs, research projects and support for entrepreneurial ventures, aims to be a catalyst of innovative solutions for resilient and sustainable urban development. \n The platform will be run by local project managers across the continent with the assistance of EPFL. Five other universities have already agreed to take part in the initiative: Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, the University of Cape Town in South Africa, the University of Carthage in Tunisia, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Ghana and the University of Rwanda. These universities were carefully selected so as to span the entire African continent, and will provide the skills needed to develop the MOOCs in French and English. \n EPFL is a pioneer in developing MOOCs for Europe, and its MOOCs for Africa program is already widely known on that continent.

{"id": 665, "text": "The EPFL startup Frontiers announced today that it is launching 13 new open-access journals in fields including Physics, Bioengineering, and Public Health. These new titles will more than double Frontiers’ current repertoire of twelve online journals whose peer-reviewed, scientific articles are immediately accessible, free of charge, to anyone. EPFL researcher Kamila Markram launched the company in 2007 with the support of a small group of scientists. Markram will be giving a keynote speech this Sunday, the 11th of November, at London’s SpotOn conference (formally Science Online London) about open science and scientific publication in the digital age.\n“Since working scientists run all of Frontiers journals, the launch is also a call for researchers to take the lead in defining the direction of research in their fields by joining one of the new editorial boards,” explains Markram.\nIn 2008, a small group of leading neuroscientists from around the world launched Frontiers in Neuroscience. Since then, key members of the active scientific community have continued to manage editorial content for all of its twelve current journals, which include Frontiers in Genetics, Frontiers in Psychology and Frontiers in Microbiology. In January of 2012, Frontiers launched Frontiers Network—a web-based platform for scientists to create profiles, network and disseminate their publications.\n“With over 25,000 scientists currently on its editorial boards, Frontiers has built a strong network of working scientists who believe in putting scientific publishing back into the hands of researchers,” says Kamila Markram.\nFrontiers can expand the ‘Frontiers in’ series, in part, because its technology-driven publishing model makes it possible treat a high quantity of manuscripts. By taking advantage of the possibilities of the Internet for scientific communication and publication, their platform allows for publishing and sharing open-access content online, participating in real-time peer-review of manuscripts and tracking publication impact using detailed web analytic tools. Most importantly, the platform automates much of the distribution of editorial tasks, allowing Frontiers to easily scale up production without raising prices.\nOpen access\nAt Frontiers, peer-reviewed articles appear online, free for all to access under a Creative Commons CC-BY license, with authors retaining copyright. And the authors of articles that receive a lot of attention, i.e. are heavily downloaded and cited, are invited back to write another paper that contextualizes their work—what Frontiers calls “climbing up the tier system.”\nBut Frontiers’ expansion into 13 new fields is indicative of a general shift towards open-access publication across the academic world. A recent announcement by the European Commission, following a similar statement made by the UK government earlier this year, claims that increased open access to research will be a boost for Europe’s innovation. And an article published by researchers from the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki, Finland, claims that, “Since the year 2000, the average annual growth rate has been 18% for the number of (open access) journals and 30% for the number of (open access) articles.”\nA challenge to the publishing status quo\n“To solve another fundamental problem in the publishing industry above and beyond the open access question, Frontiers has developed a transparent peer review process,” says Markram.\nOnce a manuscript enters the review process at Frontiers, a private forum is opened where the author and reviewers can exchange messages in real-time—encouraging an efficient and constructive critique of the paper. And if the manuscript is accepted, Frontiers publishes the reviewers’ identities to acknowledge the reviewers’ contribution and to increase the accountability and transparency of the review process.\n“The launch of the new journals means that Frontiers’ transparent, open-access publishing model will ultimately bring new research directions and collaboration to these fields,” says Markram. Frontiers also plans to add new journals in the Humanities, the Arts and other academic disciplines that could benefit from their open-access platform that currently has over 4 million page views per month.\n---\n---\nThe full list of new Frontiers titles is:\nFrontiers in Bioengineering\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology\nFrontiers in Chemistry\nFrontiers in Computer Science\nFrontiers in Dentistry\nFrontiers in Economics\nFrontiers in Energy\nFrontiers in Environmental Science\nFrontiers in Internal Medicine\nFrontiers in Nutrition\nFrontiers in Pediatrics\nFrontiers in Physics\nFrontiers in Public Health\nFrontiers in Surgery", "summary": "The “Frontiers in” journal series brings its peer review model to 13 new fields.", "claim": "The “Frontiers in” journal series brings its peer review model to 18% new fields.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [13, 14], "noise": false}
{"id": 667, "text": "Intensive care units are known for their incessant symphony of alerts. 90% of them are false alarms, and they are so common that medical staff no longer pay them much heed. These false alarms are the result of several factors, such as when electrodes placed on the patient move, causing artifacts that trigger an alert. The alerts stream forth, filling the air day and night. They have a negative impact on both patients and medical staff: they disrupt the patients’ sleep, but, more importantly, they cause alarm fatigue among staff.\nThis very topic – reducing false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU – was the focus of the 2015 \nComputing in Cardiology\n conference. This annual conference, organized in conjunction with MIT, features a competition involving the application of computers in the area of cardiology in order to improve patient care. Sibylle Fallet and Sasan Yazdani, PhD students at EPFL’s Applied Signal Processing Group (ASPG), took up this year’s challenge. The approach they developed, which cut the number of false alarms in half, earned them first place in the competition.\nBradycardia, tachycardia, asystole, arrhythmia, fibrillation – the two EPFL doctoral students had to quickly master the medical jargon since their research focused on signal analysis in cardiology. “This challenge was right in line with their respective projects,” said Jean-Marc Vesin, Senior Scientist at the ASPG. “Sybille is working on an algorithm for instantaneous estimation that will, among other things, help in monitoring the vital functions of premature babies, and Sasan developed an algorithm capable of reliably detecting R wave peaks in ECGs, something that will improve sensors embedded in smart clothes, for example.”\nLike all the other competitors, the EPFL students were given the electrocardiograms of 1,250 patients. “We were provided with different signals. Even if they weren’t always high quality, most of the time we had the ECG and visual data from the PPG, which is read by placing a sensor on the patient's finger,” said Sibylle. The PPG – short for photoplethysmograph – uses light absorption technology to detect waves produced by the body’s pulse. \n The real hurdle in this type of exercise is to precisely measure the heart rate. Because the quality of the signals can vary, catching each beat is no mean feat. The two algorithms developed by Sibylle and Sasan pick up where the other leaves off. If electrical activity does not show up clearly on the electrocardiogram, the photoplethysmographic waveform can provide the missing data. \n “Thanks to this dual monitoring, we eliminated 87% of the false alarms while effectively detecting real alerts,” said Sibylle.\n “When we were working on this we kept in mind that it could be attached to real intensive-care monitors, so most of our algorithms work in real time and don’t require much memory to do the calculations,” said Sasan. \n ---\nThe researchers will publish an article in an upcoming issue of Physiological Measurement.

{"id": 670, "text": "Why the three “a”s? “To out-do Google with its two ‘o’s,” jokes Denis Gillet, scientist at EPFL. The Graaasp project has just gone  and has been designed to be as a simple as possible to use but remains an extensive tool for scientists and students working on projects either individually or in groups.\n But why go to the trouble of creating a new social network when there are already so many on the market? Because this one has got what others, like facebook or LinkedIn, are missing when it comes to being productive while working together. Graaasp doesn’t focus on users, but on the activities that lead these users to gather on-line and share resources.\n In Graaasp, you don’t have to build up your social network to exist. Everyone has the opportunity to create spaces dedicated to given activities, and populate these spaces according the needs, inviting necessary persons and integrating useful resources.\n The intelligence of the system resides in the fact that it accommodates several different types of elements, clearly distinguished by color: contacts, of course, but also private or common sub-spaces , multimedia resources and Web applications called “widgets”. Documents can be added manually or using a simple click: the “graaasp it!” feature immediately transfers a Web page to the user’s profile. This is particularly attractive for collecting documents, YouTube videos or SlideShare presentations. Moreover, the environment developed at EPFL not only allows for widgets that can be found by the thousands on the Web (such as games, equation editors or multilingual translators), but also applications specifically developed to fit the needs of teaching. “Our students can thus perform their practical work on-line, using a small piece of software that can be found in Graaasp”, explains Denis Gillet. Simulators of all kinds can also be programmed and disseminated. Nothing could be simpler in terms of sharing the results of their work with other students, or to present them to assistants for approval or to ask them related questions.\n Among the advantages that the creators emphasizes is the impressive transparency fostered by the Graaasp environment. This is thumbing the nose at Facebook, with its complicated management of confidentiality parameters: “People you share information with are immediately visible on the screen. It’s very easy to bring together your colleagues, your friends or your superiors in those spaces that concern them, and to decide what each person can see or do”, Denis Gillet confirms.\n Four people, financed in part by European research funds within the framework of the Role project (www.role-project.eu), are working on the ongoing development of Graaasp and its innovative system for documents, spaces, persons and widgets. “Now that the basic platform is functional, we’re expecting an organic pattern of adoption, directly involving the users”, continues Denis Gillet. Universities of Geneva and Fribourg have just begun setting up Graaasp for their students, with the help of the SWITCH Foundation. “Other objectives, such as the completion of a system for recommending documents, people or applications, are being worked on.”\n So it’s really a baptism by fire for Graaasp!

{"id": 671, "text": "The key to future HIV treatment could be hidden right in our own genes. Everyone who becomes infected deploys defense strategies, and some even manage to hold the virus at bay without any therapy at all. This immune system struggle leaves its mark within the pathogen itself – genetic mutations that indicate how the virus reacted to its host’s attacks. Scientists from EPFL and the Vaud university hospital center (UNIL-CHUV) retraced the entire chain of events in these battles, from the genome of the virus to the genome of the victim. They have created the first map of human HIV resistance. The goal of their research, which has been published in the journal eLife on the 29th of October, is to find new therapeutic targets and to enable individualized treatment strategies. \n The human immune system is constantly developing strategies to fight HIV. Unfortunately, “the genome of the virus also changes rapidly, at a rate of millions of mutations a day,” explains Jacques Fellay, co-author and EPFL researcher. In the majority of cases, the pathogen finds an effective strategy via this natural selection.\n Sometimes the virus is faced with a tougher opponent. It resists, but its ability to replicate is compromised. “The virus survives but replicates more slowly, and thus its capacity for destruction is in some sense neutralized,” says the scientist.\n By studying strains of HIV that have been living in human hosts, the researchers can identify specific genetic mutations. These are like scars that each bear witness to a very specific attack launched by the immune system. What are the human genes involved in these defense strategies? And which, among all our genetic variations, predispose us to increased HIV resistance or, on the contrary, increased vulnerability? The scientists developed a method that allowed them to find answers to these questions.\nA supercomputer, 1,071 patients and millions of combinations\nTo draw up the first map of human HIV resistance, the researchers had to analyze an enormous amount of data. They studied various strains of HIV from 1,071 seropositive individuals. They crossed more than 3,000 potential mutations in the viral genome with more than 6 million variations in the patients’ genomes. Using supercomputers, they studied all these possible combinations and identified correspondence between patients. \n “We had to study the virus before the patient had undergone treatment, which is far from easy,” says Fellay. This meant they had to search in data banks established in the 1980s, before effective therapies were made available. \n This novel, indirect method made it possible to obtain the most complete global overview to date of human genes and their implications in terms of HIV resistance. It allows us to not only better understand how we defend ourselves from attack but also how the virus adapts itself to our defense mechanisms. “We now have a true database that tells us which human genetic variation will induce which kind of mutation in the virus”, explains Amalio Telenti, co-author and UNIL-CHUV researcher. \nTherapies inspired by our own natural defense\nThis research has two major implications. New therapies could be developed based on studying humans’ natural defenses, particularly those that result in a reduced replication of the virus. In addition, the scientists hope that by profiling the genome of HIV-infected individuals, it will be possible to develop individually targeted treatments that take into account the patients’ genetic strengths and weaknesses.\nThe journal eLife is part of a recent joint initiative in life science and biomedicine between the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust.", "summary": "Do our genes hold the key to future AIDS therapies?

{"id": 673, "text": "The Twike, manufactured by FINE Mobile, is half-bike and half-electric car: it has an engine, pedals, a lightweight frame, and room for a passenger. All these factors make it ideal for city use, yet its interior remains a bit rudimentary. More specifically, Twikes could use a better onboard electronics system and improvements to the pedaling mechanism. Adrien Hoffet, now an EPFL graduate, went about improving the Twike for his Master’s project.\nEmbedded electronics for easier driving\nFor the Twike – “twin” and “bike” – to be taken seriously as an alternative form of urban transport, it needed a navigation system. So the electrical engineering student integrated a Raspberry Pi mini-computer. This compact device, connected to the serial bus that transmits signals and data, collects and displays useful information for drivers. Various parameters – such as speed, pedaling power and battery life – appear on the screen. It can also store data for statistical purposes or analysis. This system was implemented on the current version of the vehicle – the Twike 3 – but it’s actually designed to exploit even more data on the new Twike that should come out in the next year or two.\nPedaling fast, not hard \nAnother significant problem with the Twike is that its drivetrain is similar to that of a bicycle (gear and chain), which complicates the vehicle’s mechanics and maintenance and makes it noisy. “Since Twikes have only five speeds, you end up having to pedal too fast at higher speeds,” Hoffet said. FINE Mobile therefore asked Hoffet to develop a lightweight, silent pedaling system that would give riders more leeway in the effort they expend. In response, Hoffet added a motor and an electronic feature run by the vehicle’s Raspberry Pi computer. The added electronics measure battery performance and pedaling speed. By monitoring these data, the computer can reduce pedal resistance. Some final adjustments still need to be made to the system before it’s completely finalized.\nTwiking from Germany to Switzerland\nThe eco-friendly Twike was invented in Switzerland in the 1990s but is now manufactured by FINE Mobile in Rosenthal, in the heart of Germany. That’s where Hoffet spent six months working on his project. “I first realized how handy Twikes can be when I was at EPFL and saw a researcher come to campus in one,” Hoffet said. And when his internship at another company fell through, he applied to work at FINE Mobile. The timing turned out to be perfect, since the company was in the middle of developing a new model. In his spare time, Hoffet renovated a Twike at the company’s site and used it to return to Switzerland – at a top speed of 85 km/h.", "summary": "Summer series on student projects (4) – The electric pedal cars with two seats known as Twikes will soon be a snap to drive thanks to a more efficient pedaling system and a compact onboard computer.

EPFL is among the prestigious names of this second group – Caltech, Duke, Johns Hopkins, University of Toronto – and it’s the first university from continental Europe to offer “massive open online courses,” or MOOCs, via the platform.\nStarting this fall semester, Professor Martin Odersky’s Scala programming language course can be taken, free of charge, from anywhere in the world.

Teachers who would like to use this channel can take advantage of support offered by EPFL’s Pedagogical Research and Support Center (CRAFT), in order to avoid the pitfalls that can be encountered in courses that don’t have direct human contact. “I have a feeling that the MOOCs will be a kind of tsunami in the academic world,” says Vetterli. “We don’t know what the consequences will be yet, but it was important for us to participate from the beginning, rather than risk missing the boat!”\nEven if it doesn’t last, the experience will have benefits for the School. “We are in good company with these content providers, and it’s excellent in terms of international visibility,” continues Vetterli. “In addition, I think that we can play a unique role, particularly in basic courses, for example in French-speaking Africa.” Finally, he adds, the “ruthless” comparisons between online courses and the creation of exercises designed for online interaction can only serve to improve traditional teaching methods.\nMore info:", "summary": "Starting this fall semester, EPFL will join a circle of prestigious partners in Coursera, an online learning platform that has already attracted more than 700,000 students.", "claim": "Starting this fall semester, EPFL will join a circle of prestigious partners in Coursera, an online learning platform that has already attracted twelve students.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [24, 24], "noise": false}

With four colleagues who, like him, study mechanical engineering at EPFL and are passionate about space technology, Danylo designed and produced a miniature rocket with the support of the Space Engineering Center (eSpace). The device, around 1.5 meters long and sporting a powerful engine, is not your traditional model rocket. The real innovation is the control system, which the students invented for their Bachelor’s project. “Our goal is to develop rockets that can achieve a soft, vertical landing,” said Danylo.\nA rocket capable of making a precision landing is still a way off. But over the course of five launches the team got past the first major hurdle, which was to stabilize the device vertically at low speeds, specifically when it reached the highest point in its flight, at an altitude of nearly 200 meters.\nThe control system developed by the students consists of a pressurized CO2 gas canister equipped with four valves that feed out the sides of the rocket fuselage. The system kicks in four seconds following launch, after the engine – designed by a US model rocket association – has already finished its burn. When the control system valves open, pressure is released from the pressurized CO2 reservoir. This creates jets whose thrust modifies the attitude of the rocket at the desired point in time.\nFor the system to function properly, special attention is paid to the structure of the rocket and the weight of the various components. Each of the five students contributed his own expertise. Danylo handled the electronics side of things, i.e. the onboard computer located in the nose. Raimondo Pictet ran the flight behavior simulations. Mikael Martins Gaspar developed the launch station and the ignition system. Gauthier Rouaze dealt with the design and production of the payload, including the valves, and helped Xavier Collaud in building the booster. Xavier was also in charge of the rocket design, including the fins.\nAn unusual device\n“The shape and size of the fins are key,” said Xavier.

{"id": 680, "text": "The increasingly powerful microscopes used in biomedical imaging provide biologists with 3D images of hundreds of cells, and cells in these images are often layered on each other. Under these conditions, it is impossible for traditional computational methods to determine the cells' properties (i.e., their size, shape, and density) quickly. Ricard Delgado-Gonzalo's work at EPFL is about to change that. The EPFL Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG) PhD student has developed a virtual tool that can analyze dozens of images in just an hour -which works out to hundreds of cells. All it takes is a standard computer.\nThe technique, called \"Active Cell\", is the fruit of complex mathematical calculations and sophisticated algorithms. Seen on a computer display it looks like a flattened sphere that can be squished into various shapes; it has lines around its surface, rather like a world-map globe. Users can scroll their mouse over a 3D digital microscopic image, using the globe to detect and segregate single cells from within the image -even if the cells are in an environment with many other surrounding objects. The globe precisely anchors itself to the target cell and adopts its contours, determining the cell's shape, size and density in real time. This can be extremely useful in situations where cells are undergoing therapeutic treatments and require monitoring, to take just one example. The technique, which will soon be written up in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, has multiple applications: for instance, it could also be used to analyze imaging of organs, or any other body that has a more or less ellipsoid shape.\nStable, extremely precise data\n \"Until now, biologists have had to manually surround the cell they wanted to analyze by clicking over and over again on its perimeter points, kind of like you do in Photoshop,\" says Delgado-Gonzalo. \"With this method, all you need to do is drag the globe near the target cell, click on it, and it's automatically analyzed.\"\nAvailable as freeware\n In order to make their results as widely available as possible, the EPFL team has put their solution on the open-source platform . This platform contains the equivalent of an \"app store\" for biomedical imaging. And in fact biologists were consulted as the tool was being developed. A 2D version is already being used by scientists, while the team perfects an upcoming 3D version. \"In addition, we're currently designing a website user-guide and a tablets version of the tool,\" says Delgado-Gonzalo.\nStrong reviews from the scientific community\n The new \"snake,\" whose margin of error is on the order of one tenth of a pixel, has been very favorably received by the scientific community. \"I used it for my Master's project when I was at the EPFL,\" says Mustapha Al Kharfane, now an engineer at Biosensors Europe SA. \"We analyzed an MRI of a patient's aorta to determine its elasticity and blood-flow rates. Those are two key clinical parameters for assessing a person's cardiovascular risk. The ‘snake' saved me hours of work.\"\n Another user, Nicolas Dénervaud, is working on a PhD at EPFL's Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization (LBNC). He is equally positive, commenting, \"We use the new technique to analyze large numbers of yeast cells in maximally dense samples. The algorithm is fast and robust.\"\n----\n Michael Unser directs the Biomedical Imaging Lab and is co-author of the article mentioned above. He emphasizes both the sophisticated math that underlies Delgado-Gonzalo's work and the concrete applications it opens up, saying, \"Ricard Delgado-Gonzalo studied both engineering and math at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, which is rare, and that interdisciplinarity was very useful in developing this comprehensive project.\" His work has already earned Delgado-Gonzalo a prize for best poster at the 2012 IEEE EMBS International Summer School on Biomedical Imaging, and the project has been presented at several conferences.\nFor more details: - \n-", "summary": "An EPFL PhD student has developed a technique for analyzing hundreds of images of cells in just a few mouse-clicks.", "claim": "An EPFL PhD student has developed a technique for analyzing two of images of cells in just a few mouse-clicks.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}
{"id": 681, "text": "The construction industry accounts for around 40% of global CO\n2 \nemissions, much of which can be attributed to the manufacture of concrete. And countries like Switzerland, where concrete structures have flourished since the 1960s, now face the task of maintaining these structures to ensure they remain safe far into the future. This is a daunting challenge with both environmental and technical considerations. \nEPFL’s Structural Maintenance and Safety Laboratory (MCS), headed by Eugen Brühwiler, has built up cutting-edge expertise in this field over the past 25 years. The MCS specializes in two areas: developing more eco-friendly concrete, and carrying out increasingly sophisticated, largely monitoring-based, assessments of existing structures, such as road and rail bridges in Switzerland and around the world. \nFor his PhD thesis, MCS researcher Amir Hajiesmaeili sought to develop the next generation of ultra high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). His aim was to develop a material that retains the mechanical properties found in today’s concrete, but without the steel fibers. The UHPFRC that Hajiesmaeili came up with is 10% lighter than other fiber-reinforced concrete, and its environmental impact is 60–70% lower. This new material is so effective that the first tech transfer will take place in 2020, when it will be used to reinforce a bridge.\nRight recipe\nHajiesmaeili likes food and knows his way around a kitchen. After completing a Master’s degree in civil engineering at the University of Tehran, he came to EPFL to do his PhD as part of the Swiss National Science Foundation's NRP  project. He spent nearly four years “cooking” at EPFL. Each week he would prepare various combinations of powders in a scientific way, according to a novel comprehensive packing model that they developed in MCS and stir them up in a mixer. He would then run his samples through various strength and tensile tests and refine his calculations. His aim was to produce a new UHPFRC that is just as strong as the one currently used in the construction industry but that produces less CO2. \n“After three years of this trial-and-error, we finally found the right recipe – one that also meets stringent building standards,” says Hajiesmaeili. How did he do it? Instead of steel fiber, he used a very stiff synthetic polyethylene fiber that adheres well to the cement matrix. He also replaced half of the cement, a commonly used binder in concrete, with limestone, a material that is widely available around the world. “The trick was to find a material that’s very strong and produces the right consistency.” \nSwiss technology\nFor the past 15 years, first-generation UHPFRC has been used to reinforce bridges to make them more sustainable, thanks to a technology developed in Switzerland and exported abroad. Its carbon footprint is already lower than that of conventional reinforced concrete. “With this material, we can add value to age-old structures by ensuring they will last for a long, long time,” says Brühwiler, whose lab has already overseen the structural reinforcement of more than 100 bridges and buildings in Switzerland. “This solution is also much more financially and environmentally sound than razing and rebuilding existing structures like bridges and historical monuments.\" \nIn Brühwiler’s experience, technology transfer in the construction industry is only effective when three criteria are met: people at every step of the construction chain – from construction managers to workers – are well-trained (as is the case in Switzerland); there is a building code; and there are both financial and individual incentives for stakeholders to change their habits.", "summary": "The next generation of ultra high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) has just been created at EPFL.

{"id": 687, "text": "Claude Nicollier, an EPFL professor since 2004, will always be known as Switzerland’s first man in space. He took part in four US space shuttle missions in the 1990s; the first aboard the space shuttle \nAtlantis\n on an eight-day mission some 300 km above Earth. To mark the 25\nth\n anniversary of that flight, which took place from July 31 to August 8, 1992, SwissApollo is holding a commemorative event at EPFL’s SwissTech Convention Center on 3 November. We met with Nicollier – a modest man with a warm smile – to get a first-hand account of his amazing story.\n- Can you tell us how your first space mission came about?\n\"\nAn astronaut’s first space mission is like all important firsts in life: unforgettable. My first mission was the culmination of 14 years of training, starting the day when the European Space Agency selected me for the team. The \nChallenger\n disaster in 1986 delayed my flight for six years. Delays were also caused by the fact that I was the only non-American taking the full Space Shuttle Mission Specialist training – NASA had told me that I would take part only in mis­sions where the payload contained a substantial amount of ESA equipment. That was true for the \nAtlantis\n, which carried an Italian tethered satellite system and the EURECA satellite [European Retrievable Carrier, now on display at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Luzern].\n- What were the days leading up to the mission like?\nWe were flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida three days before take-off, on one of the T-38 Mission Support Aircraft that NASA used to carry astronauts. Around two weeks earlier, at the same site, we did what NASA called a “TCDT” – terminal count-down demonstration test – a kind of trial run where we go through every step of the take-off procedure except starting the engines. NASA simulators had given us a good idea of what take-off would be like. But on the day of take-off, when we experienced it for real and the entire shuttle started shaking, it was an extraordinary feeling.\n- What did it feel like?\nThere was a lot of shaking and vibration. The space shuttle weighs 2,000 metric tons, so you need 3,000 metric tons of power just to get it off the ground. It feels like you’re in a machine of a very, very large mass. Out of the seven astronauts on the mission, just two of us were rookies: Franco Malerba, Italy’s first astronaut, and me. We reached orbit in just eight and a half minutes. We felt anxious, of course – because our mission was dangerous, no doubt about it – but also like we were doing something completely crazy, with such a display of force and fuel. We felt as if we were at the very start of a big adventure. And we knew we had our work cut out for us; deploying the EURECA from the payload was a fairly routine operation, but we were a lot less certain about how the tethered satellite system deployment would go.\nPicture taken by the astronauts to express their concerns about the deployment of the tethered satellite system.\n- \nAnd what did zero gravity feel like?\nLike we were floating. It was disconcerting at first, especially when we shut off the main engines. When you go from 1 G to 0 G, it feels like there’s a force lifting you up. I was always afraid of banging my head on the ceiling! Plus we were wearing heavy orange space suits that restricted our movement. We also felt nauseous, like we were seasick. But we had to learn to live under those conditions. It was hard to sleep the first night. The next day we felt better, but the zero gravity still bothered us. It took me a full 48 hours to get over it. At the same time, it was all fantastic – the sky was filled with stars at night, and during the day we could see the Earth rapidly passing by.\n- But you got the job done, despite the physical discomfort...\nI had an important role to play in the EURECA deployment: operating the robotic arm that sent out the satellite. Once it was deployed, we had to fly in formation with the satellite for a few hours until ground control activated a propulsion system that lifted the satellite to a higher orbit. Then we moved to the next step, deploying the tethered satellite system. And there we ran into all kinds of problems. I would say that out of my four missions, that was the part that went the least well. The satellite was connected to the shuttle by a 20-km long cable. We were afraid the cable would slacken, and that’s exactly what happened, after only 200 meters had been released.\n- What was the problem?\nThe cable dispenser jammed. Since the cable was elastic, the satellite came back towards us. The cable had lost all tension at that point. Given the gravity gradient, the satellite was going to drift upwards. We had to make sure the satellite was properly oriented for when the cable would eventually tighten so that the satellite wouldn’t start spinning. We controlled the cable’s attitude using an alphanumeric keypad, which was like trying to drive a truck by pressing buttons on a keyboard! Not easy! We were really sweating! In the end we were able to stabilize the satellite and bring it back to the shuttle.\nIn this video, the astronauts describe the mission. \n- Can you share any other highlights from the mission?\nThere was the televised conversation with Adolf Ogi, then a Swiss Federal Councilor, during which he made his famous comment: \nFreude herrscht\n! Which means, maybe, joy? That powerful expression became a principle, almost an ideology, both for me and for him. An extremely positive message.\n- What has changed with these types of missions today?\nMainly that procedures aren’t written on paper anymore! And that space missions get much more media coverage these days. We saw that recently with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who posted frequently on social networks during his mission on the International Space Station. Our missions took place almost in secret. Not that they were easier – sometimes they were even harder because we were doing things nobody had ever done before. Today, a lot of the work astronauts do at the International Space Station has already been mapped out. The spirit of our space shuttle missions was different – we were headed into the great unknown! Our missions were shorter and always involved extremely complicated, and pretty crazy, tasks. Another difference is that we could talk with our families for just 20 minutes a week. But today, thanks to digital phones, astronauts can stay in regular contact with their loved ones.\nThe show \nClaude Nicollier - Un Suisse dans l’espace\n will take place at the SwissTech Convention Center at 8pm on Friday, 3 November and will be attended by Nicollier and key people from his life including Derib, a cartoonist and childhood friend, astronauts Charlie Duke and Jean-François Clervoy, and astrophysicist Michel Mayor. \nInformation and tickets at \nExpress bio\nBorn in Vevey on 2 September 1944.\n1966: Became a Swiss Air Force pilot flying Hawker Hunter aircraft.\n1970: Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Lausanne.\n1970–1973: Worked as a graduate scientist at the University of Lausanne’s Institute of Astronomy and the Geneva Observatory.\n1976: Obtained a fellowship at the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Space Science Department.\n1978: Selected by the ESA to become a member of the first group of European astronauts.\n1980: Joined NASA, while remaining with the ESA, for astronaut training as a Mission Specialist.\n1992: Carried out the first of his four space shuttle missions, aboard the \nAtlantis\n (from July 31 to August 8).

{"id": 691, "text": "EPFL start-ups have so far raised a total of CHF 397 million this year, and the number is still rising. That's 50% more than in 2014, when the figure reached CHF 242 million. Spin-offs – companies founded as a result of technology developed in an EPFL lab or created by a campus researcher – saw the largest increase in funding. They raised CHF 261 million this year, compared with CHF 107 million in 2014 and CHF 66 million last year. Funds raised by other companies located in EPFL’s Innovation Park totaled CHF 76 million (CHF 57 million in 2014), and AC Immune began trading on Nasdaq, adding a further CHF 60 million.\nMindmaze, which specializes in rehabilitation through virtual reality, raised CHF 100 million, the largest single amount ever achieved by an unlisted company on campus. AC Immune and NEXThink complete the top three. AC Immune, which has developed an Alzheimer vaccine, raised CHF 42.7 million and began trading on Nasdaq (CHF 60 million). NEXThink, a spin-off specialized in company software management, raised CHF 38 million. Seven other start-ups, including G-Therapeutics, Typesafe and Aleva, completed funding rounds for more than CHF 10 million each this year.\nMore than CHF 100 million a year since 2010\nSixteen smaller companies raised the remaining CHF 37 million, conducting either their first or second funding round. This is a clear sign of the solid health of EPFL's business ecosystem. Among the 15 or so spin-offs created each year, several manage to quickly find investors in order to make their first hires, fine-tune a prototype or start production.\n“While total funds didn't surpass CHF 50 million before 2010, they have regularly exceeded CHF 100 million ever since,” commented Hervé Lebret, head of the Innogrant fund, which helps EPFL companies to get off the ground. “But who knows whether 2017 will be as flush as 2016.” The CHF 397 million brought in during this record year is equal to more than a third of all of the capital raised by companies on campus since the Science Park was created in 1993.\nInnovation Park has been expanded, collaborations with laboratories have been made easier, and there is now more assistance available to start-ups, both in terms of financing and coaching. All these factors have helped to create an environment on campus that is conducive to the development of start-ups over the years. No official ranking exists of places that are of interest to investors, but several indicators put the campus and the wider region in a solid position. A study by Atomico, an international technology investment firm headquartered in London, entitled “The State of European Tech”, mentioned Lausanne four times, in relation to: EPFL, quality of life, Faceshift (a spin-off bought by Apple) and Mindmaze.\nThe sharp rise in venture capital across Europe over the last three years seems to have benefited EPFL-related companies. Half of funded start-ups found some funding in Switzerland, a quarter in Europe and the rest went further afield, to the USA and Asia.\nThe magnet effect of a major international player\nNo sector seems to be particularly sought after or spurned by investors looking at EPFL. Thanks to the CHF 100 million invested in Mindmaze, biotechs topped the list with CHF 121.05 million, followed by IT (CHF 62.4 million) and medtech (CHF 49.7 million). This is unsurprising, as these are the sectors with the highest number of start-ups. “EPFL’s wide diversification will serve it well in the future,” according to Lebret.\nBut what’s preventing the region from competing even more closely with major cities in terms of start-up creation? “We need a major international company that would generate a magnet effect,” says Lebret. “A place that would bring in top engineers and scientists who then decide to stay in the region and maybe turn around a few years later and create a start-up. These new arrivals attract investors to the region and help reduce the risk of start-ups going offshore when they increase their capital.” So far, no funded spin-off has left the region for good, although some of them have also set up offices outside the country.", "summary": "Start-ups linked to EPFL raised almost CHF 400 million this year – that’s over 50% more than in 2014, the last record year.

{"id": 696, "text": "For the 21 teams selected to compete, the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition is more than just a time trial down a track in a vacuum tube. After making the initial cut, the teams have to overcome countless hurdles – including 140 qualifying rounds – in their quest to qualify for the final race, which will be held this coming Sunday at 8pm (Swiss time). Friday morning, EPFL’s pod \nBella Lui\n landed a spot in the top three, finishing neck and neck with ETH Zurich and last year’s winner, Munich.\nThe EPFL students got a confidence boost yesterday after putting their pod through its paces in SpaceX’s airless tube for the first time this year. The large white tube is nearly two meters in diameter and sits on the edge of Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles, perched on concrete blocks and separated from a four-lane road by a line of traffic barricades. To enter the Loop, the pods are mounted on a platform at one end of the 1.6 km-long tunnel and then placed on aluminum rails. “The tests we ran yesterday were to check the brake system and ensure the autonomous driving system performed to spec,” says Mario Paolone, the team’s main advisor.\nLong list of procedures\nAt the end of the tests – which consisted of three trial runs, each faster than the previous one – the team members couldn’t contain their joy. \nBella Lui \nreached a top speed of 158 km/h at a distance of 188 m into the Loop. The distance recorded by the pod as it traveled through the Loop differed from the measured distance by just one meter – this is a negligible discrepancy at this scale, and it proves that the team meets the required criteria. The team’s accomplishment took place under the approving gaze of monitors from SpaceX and The Boring Company, both owned by Elon Musk. During testing in Lausanne, EPFL’s pod reached a maximum speed of 75 km/h at 45 m on the team’s 120 m on-campus track.\nThe trial runs may have lasted only a few tense seconds each – onlookers held their breath before breaking into applause – but were preceded by nearly two hours of careful preparation under a baking sun. Every move, from plugging in the batteries to filling the compressed air brakes and moving the pod onto the loading platform, was carried out according to a set of operating procedures worthy of the Moon landing. At the SpaceX headquarters, flight procedures are standard fare and safety is taken very seriously. What’s more, many of the qualifying rounds had to do with the teams’ operating procedures, and EPFL got a leg up on this from its experience last year. “Strict procedures are also essential given the potential for human error,” says André Hodder, one of the EPFLoop team’s advisors.\nA strong entry despite some unforeseen events\nThe 25 students on the EPFL team have not had a good night’s sleep since they got to LA. Once their pod arrived in boxes, they had to assemble it, test it and deal with the inevitable snafus. For example, they had to lay their hands on a specific type of nut required by the organizers; an electric cable was inadvertently severed; and one of the chargers stopped functioning. Once all the mechanical parts, electronic equipment, outer shell, batteries and brakes were assembled and working and the pod was stable and its propulsion system operational, the team had to focus on the control system – including the autonomous communications among all the subsystems. When you’re targeting speeds of over 500 km/h, there’s no room for error. At this point, the machine picks up where humans leave off.\nOn Saturday, the organizers will decide which teams can participate in the race through the vacuum tube. Given the time required to run the various procedures – plus another 45 minutes to remove the air from the Loop – only three or four teams will get the nod. Last year, three teams qualified for the race: EPFL, Delft and Munich. This year, those three teams and ETH Zurich are at the top of the list.

{"id": 706, "text": "Why do city dwellers so urgently need to get away? Statistics show that they cover a large number of kilometers in their free time, often travelling much longer distances than suburban residents. What are they after? And what is the energy cost? Research carried out at EPFL shows that, rather than making up for a supposed lack of green space, city dwellers also seek the density of other cities or the company of friends and family. And despite the distances they cover, their carbon footprint is lower than that of suburban residents. And for good reason: they use public transports more and cars less.\nThese conclusions contradict a hypothesis commonly advanced to explain the large number of kilometers covered by city dwellers: to enjoy nature and some quiet time, things not available at home. Under this same hypothesis, people who live in suburban areas are thought to take advantage of their surroundings and therefore do not need to get away in order to grill some sausages or build a snowman. This is referred to as the ‘barbecue effect’ or ‘offsetting effect.’ This explanation runs counter to the concept of the compact city that, from the transport perspective, should translate into lower per-capita energy use than in more sprawling cities.\nSébastien Munafò, a researcher in the Urban Sociology Laboratory, wanted to challenge the barbecue effect and made it the subject of his thesis. He took two cities, Geneva and Zurich, and divided them into three sectors: downtown, inner suburbs and outer suburbs. He then analyzed the daily and occasional comings and goings of residents, using figures from the “Mobility and Transport Microcensus” that is carried out every five years by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. When it comes to daily commuting, no surprises: urbanites don’t go far – nearly everything is close by – while suburban dwellers rack up the kilometers.\nNo link with urban density\n But when it comes to occasional travel, which is mainly dedicated to leisure-time activities, the reverse is true. City dwellers catch up with or even surpass suburbanites. Their numbers double, reaching 27,000 km per year and per person in Zurich and 18,500 km in Geneva. For people living in the inner and outer suburbs, these occasional trips add up to around one third of their total. This varies between 18,500 and 22,500 km per year and per person in the Zurich suburbs and between 14,000 and 18,800 km in the Geneva suburbs.\nA closer look at leisure-time travel disproves the theory of the barbecue effect. The researcher identifies two types of travel: compactophile trips, for which being in a city is an advantage, and naturophile trips, in pursuit of the advantages of lower density spaces. That is where the link between urban density and the quest for nature is broken. People living in Geneva tend to fall into the compactophile camp, even though Geneva has a higher population density than Zurich. People living in Zurich proper are in fact very naturophile. And suburbanites, especially near Zurich, commonly seek out nature.\n‘Urbanity effect’\n “The barbecue effect implies that one does not freely choose where one lives and that city dwellers find themselves prisoners of unpleasant surroundings,” said Sébastien. “But in most cases, city living is very expensive. Those who live there are thus making a choice, one that offers advantages as well.\" This means people decide where to live as a function of their lifestyle: the suburbs for those who like to be close to nature, or the city for those who prefer its density and diversity. And having a little patch of green nearby doesn’t keep urbanites from travelling extensively, because in the end that is also part of their lifestyle. “One could say that there is an urbanity effect: the more we live in cities, the more regularly we move around, the more comfortable we are travelling, and the better access we have to reliable means of transportation,” concludes the researcher.\nThis thesis was sponsored by Forum Vie Mobile, a SNCF think tank.", "summary": "Statistics show that urbanites travel thousands of miles during their leisure time.

And that’s exactly what happened last night at the finals of EPFL’s My Thesis in 180 Seconds competition, held at the Rolex Forum. All of the auditorium’s 600 seats were filled as people watched in earnest while the 14 finalists discussed their research on topics ranging from medical imaging and the inner workings of watches to nuclear energy.\nCharlet’s work on developing flexible yet resistant hydrogels paves the way to a next generation of artificial ligaments, which can help people recover faster from skiing accidents, for example. A student at EPFL’s Soft Materials Laboratory, he is testing different types of polymers to come up with the perfect recipe. His presentation took home first place. Second place went to PhD student Radmila Faizova, who is studying uranium. She managed to turn her research on a daunting subject into an interesting exposé on how to clean up uranium 6 which is dangerous for health issues into another form which is safe. And third place went to PhD student Josué Ghering, whose research on snowflakes has taken him to all four corners of the globe – from Switzerland and South Korea all the way to Antarctica.

The public speaking classes he took probably helped him prepare. While all 14 students who presented last night made giving their 3-minute talk look easy, they actually put in hours and hours of work. “The secret to looking natural and conveying your passion is practice, practice, practice,” says Étienne Duval, a freelance journalist who has trained several EPFL PhD students on public speaking, including 11 of this year’s 14 finalists.\nThe special audience award went to PhD student Valentine Magnin, who also won the audience’s second selection . “Your mechanical watch may seem to be running on time, but it’s actually falling behind by a few seconds every day,” said Magnin as she launched into her presentation.

{"id": 709, "text": "EPFL and the University of Lausanne form an integral part of the Lausanne-Morges urban area, attracting thousands to the campus every day by public transport, by car, on two wheels and even on foot. During term time, no less than 150000 kilometers are travelled by train and 83000 kilometers by car every day for EPFL. The annual mobility survey (Rumba) provides EPFL and the University of Lausanne with a vast repository of data concerning transport users. The urban and regional planning community (CEAT) has analyzed these results to give a new spatial representation of the campus commuting patterns. The maps help to determine the provenance of students and employees, the distances traveled and the modes of transport used, as well as how status, age and gender influence mobility-related behavior.\nBoth universities have experienced almost unbroken growth in their student populations. This trend has proved particularly strong in the last few years. Between 2005 and 2010, the University of Lausanne’s headcount increased from 10800 to 12200 (13%), while the EPFL headcount rose from 8700 to 10500 (20%). In 2010, 56% of the respondents indicated that they used public transport, while 21% chose a form of soft mobility (6% on foot, 15% by bike) to reach one of the two sites. Seventy percent of the population using these sites lives in the Lausanne agglomeration during the week. An increase in the use of public transport and soft mobility (pedestrians and cyclists) and a reduction in individual motorized transport have also been recorded. This development is observed for all users, irrespective of their status, age or place of residence. Although car use is in decline, it is still largely responsible for the 30 tons of carbon dioxide emitted for EPFL alone: 88% of the CO² burden comes from exhaust.\nAs the authors indicate, “the two universities’ mobility policy is a success. In a period of strong growth, across all the modes of transport, public transport is on the rise. All the measures taken have enabled the flow of commuters to be contained and managed, in particular using a set of fine measurements”. These measurements include the successful introduction of a quarter-hour time-lag in the start time of courses between the University of Lausanne and EPFL to eliminate the maximum peaks. Similarly, the 4.5% increase in the number of cycle journeys from 2007 to 2010 has been maintained, which is due in particular to the construction of thousands of secure parking spaces, the launch of the first self-service cycle system in Switzerland, the establishment of a cycle station on each campus for repairs and to cycle campaigns such as “Bike to work” and “Mobility weeks”.\nAlthough the elasticity of the existing transport system has so far enabled the strong growth of the campus to be absorbed by many adjustments, it is also observed that a threshold is being reached. Mobility policy questions are therefore a key issue for the universities, the cantonal and regional transport and mobility services and the Lausanne public transport system.\n- ILLUSTRATIONS -", "summary": "No less than 25000 people travel between the University of Lausanne and EPFL in the week, making the two campuses the canton’s second largest city in the daytime.

{"id": 716, "text": "Engineers and software developers around the world are seeking to create technology that lets users touch, grasp and manipulate virtual objects, while feeling like they are actually touching something in the real world.\nScientists at EPFL and ETH Zurich have just made a major step toward this goal with their new haptic glove, which is not only lightweight – under 8 grams per finger – but also provides feedback that is extremely realistic. The glove is able to generate up to 40 Newtons of holding force on each finger with just 200 Volts and only a few milliWatts of power. It also has the potential to run on a very small battery. That, together with the glove’s low form factor (only 2 mm thick), translates into an unprecedented level of precision and freedom of movement.\n“We wanted to develop a lightweight device that – unlike existing virtual-reality gloves – doesn’t require a bulky exoskeleton, pumps or very thick cables,” says Herbert Shea, head of EPFL’s .\nThe scientists’ glove, called DextrES, has been successfully tested on volunteers in Zurich and has been presented at the upcoming .\nFabric, metal strips and electricity \nDextrES is made of nylon with thin elastic metal strips running over the fingers. The strips are separated by a thin insulator. When the user’s fingers come into contact with a virtual object, the controller applies a voltage difference between the metal strips causing them to stick together via electrostatic attraction – this produces a braking force that blocks the finger’s or thumb’s movement. Once the voltage is removed, the metal strips glide smoothly and the user can once again move his fingers freely.\nTricking your brain \nFor now the glove is powered by a very thin electrical cable, but thanks to the low voltage and power required, a very small battery could eventually be used instead. “The system’s low power requirement is due to the fact that it doesn’t create a movement, but blocks one”, explains Shea. The researchers also need to conduct tests to see just how closely they have to simulate real conditions to give users a realistic experience. “The human sensory system is highly developed and highly complex. We have many different kinds of receptors at a very high density in the joints of our fingers and embedded in the skin. As a result, rendering realistic feedback when interacting with virtual objects is a very demanding problem and is currently unsolved. Our work goes one step in this direction, focusing particularly on kinesthetic feedback,” says Otmar Hilliges, head of the  at ETH Zurich.\nIn this joint research project, the hardware was developed by EPFL at its Microcity campus in Neuchâtel, and the virtual reality system was created by ETH Zurich, which also carried out the user tests.\n“Our partnership with the EPFL lab is a very good match. It allows us to tackle some of the longstanding challenges in virtual reality at a pace and depth that would otherwise not be possible,” adds Hilliges.\n The next step will be to scale up the device and apply it to other parts of the body using conductive fabric. “Gamers are currently the biggest market, but there are many other potential applications – especially in healthcare, such as for training surgeons. The technology could also be applied in augmented reality,” says Shea.", "summary": "Scientists from EPFL and ETH Zurich have developed an ultra-light glove – weighing less than 8 grams per finger– that enables users to feel and manipulate virtual objects.

The temporary house was dreamed up, designed, and built by first-year architecture students at EPFL, and assembled in the district of Zurich West where it stayed for nearly a month. Now, three of its modules – the bar, the exhibition area, and the cinema – will be assembled in Malley, at one of the largest undeveloped sites in western Switzerland, at the invitation of the intermunicipal urban development group \nStratégie et développement de l’Ouest lausannois (SDOL)\n.\nLocated beside the \nLa Galicienne\n refreshment stand near the Prilly-Malley train station, the three modules will be open to the public throughout the summer and are expected to liven up the site and set the stage for its future transformation. In addition, a number of events are planned there through the middle of October as part of REPLAY, a joint project between Renens, Prilly, Lausanne, the Canton of Vaud and the Swiss Federal Railways.\nFrom late May to mid-June, HOUSE 2 was on display in Zurich, installed under a railway bridge, near a few office buildings and a tram stop. During the day, passersby looking to escape the sun could relax in the house’s shade, and children out for a walk could cross it from one side to the other. Students at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) next door would have their lunch there and lounge in the hammocks they put up. In the evening, conferences, outdoor movies and concerts livened up the usually deserted area.\nOpening up the space\n“This type of temporary house shows that urban growth and densification are positive things,” says architect, project leader and EPFL professor Dieter Dietz. “We see that opening up the space, where a wide range of activities can take place, makes the area more lively and dynamic. We're infusing life in a place where there was none.” In Zurich, the project was brought under ZHdK's research program, Counter City, which uses design to reinforce the positive message of urbanization.\nFor students, HOUSE 2 has served as an intensive course on becoming an architect. Divided into groups of 15 to 20, they were given just three months to design one of the rooms in the house. Each room had to fit seamlessly with the surroundings in Zurich and be distinct from the neighboring rooms. In addition, every aspect of the room needed to match the rest both aesthetically and structurally. The students then had two weeks to assemble HOUSE 2 in Zurich after a few days’ on-site practice at EPFL.\nHOUSE 1, 2 and 3\nThe project has already caught the attention of a number of architecture journals (see press kit). Last year, students completed the first version of the project, initially erecting HOUSE 1 at EPFL and then at the National School of Architecture of Versailles, where the rooms were designed for campus living.

{"id": 727, "text": "Eliott Guenat, a first year master’s student in mechanical engineering, isn’t \na priori \nall that interested in SUVs and big rigs. But his passion for thermodynamics and his interest in environmental issues have given him a reason to take a look under their hoods. He has emerged with plans for a thermomechanical system that can produce electricity from the waste heat of tailpipe emissions and cooling fluids.\nIn spite of the efforts of automobile manufacturers, nearly 70% of the fuel consumption is dissipated as heat into the environment. The problem is that the temperature of the waste heat is too low to be converted in a useful manner.\nHowever, there is a thermodynamic system that can exploit these differences in temperature to produce electricity: the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). It’s currently only used in recuperating industrial heat (in cement production), biomass production and geothermal energy applications. The ORC operates similarly to a steam engine, except that the water is replaced by an organic fluid such as propane. Pumped within a hermetically sealed circuit, the fluid is heated and evaporated, then passed through a turbine, then condensed back into liquid form to start the cycle over again.\nNone of the car manufacturers have managed to incorporate this kind of system in a commercialized vehicle. Promising research on micro-turbomachinery led Guenat, who is supervised by Jürg Schiffmann in the Laboratory of Applied Mechanical Design (LAMD), to study the possibility of using it in vehicles and explore the conditions in which it could be applied.\nPotential for truck transport\n The theory indicates that micro-turbomachines could be the answer, but not for just any vehicle. “For a compact car like those manufactured today, it’s difficult,” says the student. The biggest obstacle is finding room for the exchangers, which have a 40-liter volume (the size of a big microwave oven). The entire vehicle would have to be redesigned to incorporate them, keeping in mind that the bigger they are, the better they’ll work. In addition, the vehicle must generate enough heat to make the process worthwhile, which would typically only be the case in freeway driving.\nThus the vehicles that would benefit the most from a system like this are big ones like trucks or buses. “The theoretical model shows that with the concept we studied, one could gain 8 energy efficiency points, the equivalent of reducing fuel consumption by a quarter to a third,” says Guenat. The gain could be used to provide more power to the engine, to keep the engine at a constant speed, to air-condition the cab, or to power a refrigerated compartment. “It’s still early days for the development of small-scale low-temperature applications,” says Guenat, who’s spending his summer delving deeper into applications of his research in trucks, in the LAMD.", "summary": "Summer series – student research (1) For his semester project in mechanical engineering, Eliott Guenat studied the best way to recuperate waste heat from a car’s engine.

{"id": 729, "text": "The students positioned themselves at the starting line, holding up signs designed to get their robots to follow them. The winner would be the student-robot tandem that crossed the finish line first.\nThis is the race that 24 Master’s students took part in in early June as part of the Data and AI for Transportation class given by Alexandre Alahi, an assistant professor at EPFL’s Visual Intelligence for Transportation (VITA) laboratory.\nProgramming recognition algorithms \n“We had to program our robot to recognize a visual signal captured by an embedded camera and then follow the signal. That required developing our own algorithm and programming it in the robot,” says Rayan Abi Fadel, a student in the College of Management of Technology. All of the competing teams had to use the same robot – a Segway Loomo – and the same base algorithm developed by two VITA PhD students, Yuejiang Liu and George Adaimi. But they could adapt the algorithm and reconfigure it using deep learning and AI methods.\nThe base algorithm was designed to train a deep neural network to detect an object’s position in any kind of image, with the objective of creating a database of synthetic images obtained by “pasting” the object on random backgrounds. “That let us fine-tune some of the algorithm’s parameters and consequently improve our robot’s performance,” says Alexandre Carlier, a computer science student who came in third place. “For example, since we wanted our robot to follow an object while the student holding it was running, we artificially blurred the background of the images used to train the robot, to simulate the effect of rapid movement.”\nMost of the students who competed in the race already knew how to program, but not all. Those who had to learn along the way included Linah Charif and Sergej Gasparovich, the two civil engineering students who came in first. “It’s great to see that students who come into the class not knowing how to program can pick up that skill and do so well,” says Alahi.\nSome of the main challenges the students had to overcome were screening out the interference caused by other race participants and coping with lighting fluctuations in the room where the race was held. “Turns were another big difficulty. We had to make sure we would always be in our robot’s line of vision so that it could keep following us,” says Carlier.\nMost student teams programmed their robots to recognize an image rather than a face, as image signals are clearer and less susceptible to interference. The images ranged from a red circle or a banana to the Swiss flag, a glass of wine, or even Mickey Mouse.\nTechnology for self-driving cars, and more\nThe algorithms that the students developed are similar to those used in self-driving cars, which enable the vehicles to recognize street signs, traffic lights, pedestrians, and other cars. “Our laboratory aims to develop technology that helps humans and machines coexist,” says Alahi. For applications ranging from drones that deliver packages to robots that help the elderly carry their luggage or groceries, it’s essential that the machines have a basic grasp of human behavior and act with a certain amount of social intelligence. For instance, a robot moving through a crowd needs to be able to follow the right social and ethical conventions for a given situation. This race at EPFL demonstrates that humans and robots can live together in small spaces.\nStudents taking part in the race receive a grade that depends not only on what place they came in. “They are also graded on the work they did upfront on the base algorithm,” says Adaimi. “I hope that the race made our class more interesting and will encourage students to go further in this field of research.”", "summary": "Summer series – student projects – Two dozen EPFL Master’s students recently took part in a unique race where the competitors were tandems of students and robots.

{"id": 731, "text": "Geological, catalytic, biological and chemical processes are driven by surface chemical heterogeneities, electrostatic fields and flow. To understand these processes and to enable the further development of new materials and microtechnology, researchers at EPFL’s  (LBP) have designed a microscope that can track, in real time, three-dimensional spatial changes in the molecular structure and chemistry of confined systems, such as curved surfaces and pores. The microscope was used to image the surface chemical structure of the inside of a glass microcapillary. Surface potential maps were constructed from the millisecond images, and the chemical reaction constant of each 188nm-wide pixel was determined. Surprisingly, this very simple system – which is used in many devices – displayed a remarkable spread in surface heterogeneity. The researchers’ findings have been published in \nScience\n. Their method will be a boon for understanding fundamental (electro)chemical, geological and catalytic processes and for building new devices.\nSecond-harmonic imaging\n Sylvie Roke, director of the  has developed a unique set of optical tools to study water and aqueous interfaces on the nanoscale. She uses second-harmonic and sum-frequency generation, which are optical processes in which two photons of a certain color are converted into a new color. “The second-harmonic process involves 1000 nm femtosecond photons – that is, 0.00000000000001-second bursts of light – being converted into 500 nm photons, and this occurs only at interfaces,” says Roke. “It is therefore ideal for interfacial microscopy. Unfortunately, the process is very inefficient. But by using a number of optical tricks, such as wide field imaging and light shaping, we were able to enhance both the imaging throughput and the resolution, bringing the time to record an image down from minutes to 250 milliseconds.”\nSurprising surface chemistry\n The researchers then imaged the deprotonation reaction of the inner silica capillary/water interface in real time. Silica is one of the most abundant minerals on earth, and its interaction with water shapes our climate and environment. Although many researchers have characterized the properties of the silica/water interface, there is no consensus on its chemical reactivity. Roke continues: “Our data shows why there is a remarkable spread in surface reactivity, even on a very small portion of a capillary. Our data will help in the development of theoretical models that are more effective at capturing this surprising complexity. In addition, our imaging method can be used for a wide variety of processes, such as for analyzing the real-time functioning of a fuel cell, or for seeing which structural facet of a mineral is most chemically active. We could also gain more insight into nanochannels and both artificial and natural pores.\nTop: Phase-contrast image of a microcapillary showing the bulk glass and the bulk water.

The ever increasing amount of information in the world, spread across many different industries and markets, makes this an increasingly difficult task. To make it possible for inventors to sense the inventive signal in this ever increasing amount of noise, AI researchers and software developers at Iprova – the innovation creation firm that came up with the aforementioned inventions – have developed an artificial intelligence platform that includes sophisticated semantic analysis algorithms. Ana Manasovska helped create this program as part of her Master’s degree in computer science at EPFL, in association with the school’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She now works for the company, which is based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, to further develop the software that makes it easier for engineers to invent faster and more disruptively..\nMillions of publications sifted\nMillions of research, industry news and other articles are published around the world every year. One part of Iprova’s artificial intelligence platform works by performing a semantic analysis of the terms in published articles. Manasovska’s thesis on summarization methods contributed to this by testing various phrase recognition methods, which she did by representing individual phrases as vectors. If two phrases have a close virtual spatial location, then their meanings are probably similar. This technique can be used to generate better summaries by measuring phrases’ semantic similarity.\nWhat Manasovska found when comparing the different methods is that the more complicated architectures weren’t necessarily better suited to this task. “Even with a simple architecture, we got excellent results in identifying phrases with similar meanings,” she says. “We also learned that the best way to generate the kinds of summaries that Iprova needs is to approach them from an inventor’s perspective. Most conventional summary-generation methods don’t do that, which is why we wanted to develop our own,” she adds.\nToday Manasovska is working on further improving the semantic recognition and recommendation platform. She works closely with inventors, aiming to find out what kind of data they need and how they plan to use it. She has developed programs allowing engineers to create inventions using input data that they wouldn’t have been able to easily get otherwise. An example of this is the linking of information from inventively relevant, but otherwise disparate, research fields that open up entirely new invention opportunities. “What I really like about my work is that it lets me stay on top of the latest developments in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) – two fields that are advancing rapidly. I have the opportunity to use the latest technology and the power of data to help people spot relevant new findings more efficiently,” she says.\n“Traditional inventors were scientists or engineers with a deep understanding of a specific technical field. This only gave the inventor access to a limited amount of research insight. Even collaborative inventing through teamwork only provides insight into a handful of additional fields, since it’s just a team of specialists. With such approaches to invention, researchers can only dig deeper into specific areas rather than offering genuine innovation by taking the field in a different direction.\nIprova does this on a massive scale – in real-time – by using data from across the spectrum of human knowledge to make connections between ideas from different fields of study.”says Julian Nolan, CEO of Iprova. The company is combining AI with a team of creative scientific minds – the invention developers – to accelerate the development of tomorrow’s products and services.

{"id": 748, "text": "Cities tend to sprawl outwards or expand upwards. Their underground potential is often overlooked or underestimated in master zoning plans. In fact, urban planners may only look below the surface when a subway or underground walkway is being built. This shortsightedness can have dire results, such as underground flooding, polluted drinking water and conflicting uses.\nMichael Doyle, a student in the Laboratory of Environmental and Urban Economics (LEURE), which is headed by Philippe Thalmann, chose this topic for his dissertation. Over the course of four years, he mapped out the ground below three cities with very different political, economic and geological characteristics: San Antonio (Texas), Hong Kong (China) and Dakar (Senegal). He applied the Deep City methodology, which was developed at EPFL by geologist and Honorary Professor Aurèle Parriaux. The Deep City approach is to simplify complex geological maps so that cities can use them to plan below-ground development while protecting the natural resources found there.\nSimplified maps\nDoyle's research built on the Deep City methodology. He spent time in the three cities and developed a coefficient system for each underground resource: groundwater, building space, geothermal energy and geomaterials. His aim was to provide decision-makers with a useful metric to apply in their underground development planning. The simplified maps produced from these coefficients have proven to be relevant in all three cities, irrespective of their economic and political landscape.\nThese maps will also help urban planners develop a more rational approach to underground planning while taking into account below-ground resources: a subway could be built alongside a geothermal system; the risk of groundwater seepage or contamination when building a tunnel could be better assessed; and excavated materials could be usefully recycled. “You don’t get a second chance with below-ground construction,” said Parriaux, who authored the first version of the Deep City method. “It's not like a building, which you can always knock down or renovate. This makes planning essential.”\nMontreal: an economic success \nIn addition to his geological research in San Antonio, Hong Kong and Dakar, Doyle also analyzed the relationship between Montreal’s underground and its downtown. He wanted to see just how much the below-ground structures contributed to the economic success of the city’s commercial spaces. Doyle’s research showed that Montreal could serve as a useful model for other cities: its underground passages see a relatively constant level of traffic throughout the year. “The walkways don't compete with the surface streets, there’s no conflict between the two spaces,” said Doyle, referring to another study on Montreal.\nDoyle’s work on that city consisted in mapping indoor and outdoor commercial spaces and building a spatial econometric model of commercial rents. His map identifies the accessibility criteria and locational advantages that contribute to the economic success of a city with significant underground space. Doyle’s work provides useful insight into the important interaction between above- and below- ground commercial spaces in Montreal.\nDoyle’s dissertation is the fourth to come out of Deep City, an interdisciplinary initiative that was launched in 2005 by the Swiss National Science Foundation Project PNR 54. The researcher looks forward to presenting his work to the City of Lausanne, which has expressed an interest in it.\nReference:\nMichael Robert Doyle, Potentialities of the Urban Volume: Mapping underground resource potential and deciphering spatial economies and configurations of multi-level urban spaces, Deep City Project, Laboratory of Environmental and Urban Economics (LEURE), advisors Philippe Thalmann, Aurèle Parriaux, EPFL Dissertation 7328, December 2016.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher has taken a methodology designed to improve underground urban planning around the world one step further.

{"id": 749, "text": "Over the course of our life, we are continuously exposed to pathogens such as viruses and bacteria, meaning that our immune system is constantly at work. When stimulated by either pathogen or vaccine, the immune system notably mounts what is known as a “humoral response”, which corresponds to the production of antibodies that can help fight infections and provide long-term protection.\nThe intensity of humoral responses differs from person to person. Understanding why, and identifying the specific determinants of this variability could help us improve vaccines, predict a person’s susceptibility to a particular pathogen, or get a deeper understanding of autoimmune diseases.\nIn a  published in \nGenome Medicine\n, , working with the Pasteur Institute in Paris, have examined the humoral responses of 1,000 healthy people to common infections and vaccines. The scientists measured antibody responses to fifteen antigens (molecules that trigger humoral responses) from twelve infectious agents: cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, influenza A virus, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B virus, \nHelicobacter pylori,\n and \nToxoplasma gondii\n.\nIn order to assess the importance of non-genetic factors, the researchers looked at the impact of numerous demographic variables. They identified age and sex as the most important determinants of humoral response, with older individuals and women showing stronger antibody responses against most antigens.\nFor the genetic factors, the scientists performed genome-wide association studies, which allow the exploration of the potential impact of genetic variation throughout the human genome. The studies showed that differences in response to Epstein-Barr virus and rubella associate with variation in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) gene region, which encodes proteins involved in the recognition of foreign antigens.\n“To combat infectious and autoimmune diseases, we need to better understand variation in the healthy immune response”, says Jacques Fellay. “Our study is a necessary first step toward individualized healthcare in infection and immunity”.\nOther contributors\nGenentech\nLund University\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique\nInstitut National de la Recherche Médicale (France)\nInserm\nParis Descartes University\nThe Rockefeller University\nLausanne University Hospital (CHUV)", "summary": "Age, sex, and specific human genetic variants are the key factors behind differences between immune responses among healthy humans, finds a study of 1,000 individuals carried out by EPFL and the Pasteur Institute.", "claim": "Age, sex, and specific human genetic variants are the key factors behind differences between immune responses among healthy humans, finds a study of fifteen individuals carried out by EPFL and the Pasteur Institute.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [26, 26], "noise": false}
{"id": 751, "text": "This discovery will make it possible to improve photoelectrochemical cells. In the same way that plants use photosynthesis to transform sunlight into energy, these cells use sunlight to drive chemical reactions that ultimately produce hydrogen from water. The process involves using a light-sensitive semi-conducting material such as cuprous oxide to provide the current needed to fuel the reaction. Although it is not expensive, the oxide is unstable if exposed to light in water. Research byAdriana Paracchino and Elijah Thimsen, published May 8, 2011 in the journal Nature Materials, demonstrates that this problem can be overcome by covering the semiconductor with a thin film of atoms using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique.\nUnder the supervision of Professor Michael Grätzel in EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, the two scientists achieved this remarkable feat by combining techniques used at the industrial scale, and then applying them to the problem of producing hydrogen. With their process, cuprous oxide can be simply and effectively protected from contact with water, making it possible to use it as a semiconductor. The advantages are numerous: cuprous oxide is abundantly available and inexpensive; the protective layer is completely impermeable, regardless of the roughness of the surface; and the process can easily be scaled up for industrial fabrication.\nA promising technique\nThe research team developed the technique by “growing” layers of zinc oxide and titanium oxide, one atom-thick layer at a time, on the cuprous oxide surface. By using the ALD technique, they were able to control the thickness of the protective layer down to the precision of a single atom over the entire surface. This level of precision guarantees the stability of the semiconductor while preserving all of its hydrogen-producing efficiency. The next step in the research will be to improve the electrical properties of the protective layer.\nUsing widely available materials and techniques that can be easily scaled up brings the “green” photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen closer to the industrial interest.\nSource:\n Highly active oxide photocathode for photoelectrochemical water reduction, Adriana Paracchino, Vincent Laporte, Kevin Sivula, Michael Grätzel and Elijah Thimsen, Nature Materials, 8 mai 2011.\n DOI: 10.1038/NMAT3017\nLinks:", "summary": "Transforming solar energy into a usable form is a real challenge.

{"id": 752, "text": "Making French-speaking culture a vehicle for technological innovation in the context of international scientific competition by bringing together universities in developed and developing countries: such is the ambition of RESCIF, which will link – starting January 2011 – 14 French-speaking universities from developed and developing countries. This approach is unique in its philosophy, scope and linguistic aspects. The aim of the project is to promote collaborative scientific programmes, especially in the areas of water, nutrition and energy management. These domains are crucial, in particular for some countries in the southern hemisphere, subjected to extremely difficult climatic conditions and food safety issues. RESCIF is one of three official initiatives supported by the Swiss government on the occasion of the 13th Conference of Heads of State of French-speaking countries in Montreux.\nThe best French-speaking technology universities\n Started by EPFL, with its 40-year-long experience of North–South scientific partnerships, RESCIF brings together five other French-speaking technology universities from developed countries: Paristech (France), the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), the Polytechnic University of Montréal (Canada), the Ecole Normale Supérieure of Lyon (France) and the Grenoble Polytechnic Institute (France) – and eight French-speaking universities in emerging countries, among the most renowned of the international scientific community, have given their agreement in principle to be finalized by the beginning of 2011: the Ecole Mohammadia d’ingénieurs de Rabat (Marocco), the Ecole Nationale Supérieure Polytechnique de Yaoundé (Cameroon), the Ecole supérieure polytechnique de Dakar (Senegal), the Institut international d’ingéniérie en Eau et Environnement 2IE d’Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), l’Université St-Joseph de Beyrouth (Lebanon) et l’Institut polytechnique d’Ho-Chi-Minh-Ville (Vietnam). RESCIF is also planning to support the rebuilding in Haiti of the State University and the Quisqueya University, which were destroyed during this year’s earthquake. These two universities join the network with a perspective of long-term cooperation.\nThe first projects bearing the mark of RESCIF will begin during 2011. Three objectives have been defined:\n - student exchanges around common trainings\n - establishing of research teams and collaborative laboratories in the developing countries, and\n - development of partnerships with companies\nRESCIF will work in partnership with the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) – the University Agency for French-speaking countries – and to develop a guide to best practices for technological partnerships, intended for all the developing universities of the French-speaking world.\nWater, food, and energy: concrete issues\n The scientific programs will examine areas such as the management of water, food and energy. These areas are important for the Northern countries, but even more crucial for Southern countries, which see their economic growth and food safety threatened by climate changes. Those are priority topics, debated at the Montreux Sommet de la Francophonie.\nA vehicle for scientific and technological innovation\n Common programs will aim in particular to respond quickly to practical concerns. Along these lines, and as an example, cooperation already exists between Swiss universities and those from Burkina-Faso in the area of hydrology. The scientific data is useful for the authorities, who can focus their strategy, and also enables the local populations to adapt their farming practices. Other research projects aim to develop solar technologies for water treatment, or to better manage the links between city planning and pollution. RESCIF sees itself as a catalyst in such projects, by formalizing large-scale technological partnerships, and relying on the French language as a common culture.\nCurbing the brain drain \n For the developing countries, penalized by a significant brain drain, it will also be a question of curbing the phenomenon by increasing the attractiveness of their research institutes. With the creation of RESCIF it is, for the second wave of developing countries, about seizing the opportunity of the scientific and technological co-development on offer, and creating a lasting partnership between “developed” and “developing” universities.\nTurning the French language into a cultural and technological asset\n Although the scientific world is durably affected by the dominance of English, French-speaking universities have an opportunity to position themselves on the international scientific and technological stage if they strengthen their cooperation. Present on all the continents, with 200 million mother-tongue speakers (96 million in Africa) of whom 60 percent are under thirty years of age, French is also one of the languages the most taught in the world.

{"id": 761, "text": "Trouble learning how to write, called dysgraphia, affects some 10% of schoolchildren. This learning disability is often associated with dyslexia and can appear in children to varying degrees, with causes that can differ from one child to the next. A team of researchers at EPFL’s Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction Laboratory (CHILI) has developed software that enables doctors to make highly detailed, personalized assessments of this disability and to accurately identify the letters and numbers that are most difficult and are thus the most discriminative. Their research has just been published in \nNature Digital Medicine.\nWriting is an essential skill for schoolchildren, but it requires an adroit combination of careful concentration, well-developed motor skills and good language comprehension – something that not all children possess. And although writing problems may appear trivial at first, if they are not treated early on, they could quickly snowball into more serious conditions like a lack of confidence, low self-esteem, trouble learning other skills, a high level of fatigue and even behavioral problems. Early detection is therefore key.\nIn French-speaking countries, dysgraphia is currently diagnosed using a standardized writing test called BHK. Ergotherapists or psychomotor therapists use the test to assess a child’s handwriting according to 13 criteria. But according to Thibault Asselborn, a PhD student at CHILI and lead author of the study, the BHK test is limited. “It relies entirely on a therapist’s own observation and is therefore subjective. And it can be six months or more between when a teacher first becomes concerned about a child’s writing skills and when the child is finally taken to a specialist.”\nAnalyzing over 50 different characteristics \nThe test developed at EPFL, called Tegami, which is run using a tablet computer, represents a major step forward in terms of analytical precision and accuracy of input. It was developed from a database of writing samples from 300 children, around 25% of whom suffered from dysgraphia. The program was able to detect the learning disability 98% of the time.\nThe big advantage of Tegami is that it can help pinpoint the cause of a child’s dysgraphia because it analyzes no fewer than 53 different characteristics of a child’s writing, which are measured up to 200 times per second. These characteristics include the angle of the pen, the amount of pressure the child applies to the tablet, how fast the child writes and any changes in that speed, whether the child’s hand trembles and if so, with what frequency, and which letters or characters are most discriminative.\nExample of a disgraphic child's handwriting.\nA dynamic assessment\n“Our software brings a dynamic aspect to the evaluation of a child’s writing. The BHK test lets therapists evaluate a writing sample only after it’s been written. But with Tegami, therapists can analyze the entire writing process and get a clear, comprehensive picture of all of a child’s movements,” says Thomas Gargot, a child psychiatrist, expert in cognitive science, PhD student in computer science at Pitié Salpêtrière teaching hospital in Paris and one of the study’s authors.\nAccording to Gargot, the software also paves the way to classifying different kinds of dysgraphia. The new types of data it collects will enable pediatricians to determine whether there are writing disabilities associated with autism, hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder, and to better understand how teaching methods can be adapted accordingly.\nTegami should also help children with writing disabilities get more targeted treatment. The EPFL researchers are now working with psycho motor therapists and speech therapists to outline remedial measures; for example, if a child shows too much variation in the pressure he puts on his pen, his doctor can prescribe motor-skill exercises. The researchers are also looking into how they can combine Tegami with another program developed at CHILI called CoWriter, where children improve their skills and self-confidence by teaching a robot how to write.", "summary": "Nearly 10% of elementary school students have trouble learning to write, with potentially lasting consequences on their education.

{"id": 763, "text": "For those that doubt that 200 students can work towards a common goal, under pressure and with limited resources, this year’s architecture freshmen have shown that it can be done. The proof is an impressive three-dimensional pavilion, roughly 10 meters across in each direction, made up of approximately 2000 wooden beams. Within the structure, twelve architectural installations invite visitors to experience a variety of sensations as they climb narrow staircases and collapsible ladders from one installation to the next. The structure, located to the east of the Rolex Learning Center, will open several times this summer, to be admired from afar and from within.\nThe structure’s \nraison d’être\n is as a teaching platform for first-year architecture students. Working in twelve design studios, the students first teamed up in pairs to propose projects for rooms that could be integrated into the latticework of the underlying protostructure. The one hundred proposals to emerge were then whittled down to a dozen, one per design studio. These were then further refined and combined into a coherent whole. \nEach module used the same raw material, wooden beams, to manipulate space, creating wildly different atmospheres across the cuboid pavilion. “We initially imagined that the challenges would involve integrating the twelve individual modules into a coherent constellation,” says Agathe Mignon, who coordinated the project at ENAC’s ALICE lab. “While that was far from obvious, we found that the challenge was actually one of efficient collaboration.”\nThe spaces in the pavilion include a theatre that can be viewed from outside the structure, from a balcony within it, and even from a zenithal viewpoint one floor further up. A series of stairs and ladders take visitors to the lung – a module on the second floor that channels air from its windows through a corridor draped with white fabric – and from there, up to a vertiginous lookout directs the view towards the eastern end of Lake Geneva and the mountains beyond.\nTo carry out the project, ALICE teamed up with external engineer Rémy Meylan and several sponsors from the industry. For the students it was a unique, and in many ways eye opening, experience. “It is very rare for students to work on a full-scale prototype so early on into their curriculum and interact with a civil engineer to ensure that their designs are structurally sound,” says Mignon. But with so much to learn, she says, they were always ready to go the extra mile. “I was constantly impressed by the energy they were willing to put into making this project work,” she says. \nGuided visits:\n from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm\nMonday, June 13\n Friday, June 24\n Saturday, July 9\n Saturday, July 16", "summary": "The pavilion combines the outcome of twelve first-year architecture design studios into a single three-dimensional exploration of space.", "claim": "The pavilion combines the outcome of twelve first-year architecture design studios into a single twelve-dimensional exploration of space.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [16, 16], "noise": false}

David Atienza, director of the Embedded Systems Laboratory, experimented this year, for the second time, a method of empirical teaching that finds immediate success among his young students. During the semester that just ended, the sixth of their course, they received a portable Nintendo DS console on loan. The goal: to create, in teams of two students, a program that makes the most of the console’s various features, for instance: by developing a game from A to Z.\nLast week, nine groups of students presented the fruits of their work before a panel of experts. From \"Minesweeper\" to a shooting game and from a naval battle to a puzzle whose solution allows freeing a prisoner, the students showed great imagination and expertise in the creation of their software.\nGiven the quality of this year’s results, the jury could not decide between the two best projects.

The game consists on riding a motorcycle, seen from above, by avoiding obstacles and collecting bonuses. \"The strength of these students was to exploit the Wi-Fi possibilities of the console so that 6 people could play simultaneously,\" said David Atienza.

They will stay at UNIL’s Dorigny campus, in the purpose-built Vortex village which, once the games are over, will become student accommodations. The venues – Lausanne, Les Diablerets, Villars, Champéry and St. Moritz – will host eight sports in total over the two weeks of the games. Alongside traditional disciplines such as alpine skiing, snowboarding, Nordic combined, ice hockey, biathlon, curling, skating and bobsled, the Lausanne games will be the first to feature ski mountaineering, after the sport was recognized by the International Olympic Committee.\nEPFL boasts a longstanding track record in pushing the boundaries of sports innovation. The school will contribute to the 2020 YOG education program, using the games as a testing ground for new technologies developed in conjunction with the UNIL-EPFL Sport and Health Center (CSS) and CHUV. Pascal Vuilliomenet, a project manager at EPFL’s Vice Presidency for Innovation, is intimately familiar with the 30 or so laboratories carrying out sports-related research and development work. It’s his job to create synergies. “The 2020 YOG is a major event,” says Vuilliomenet. “It’s a chance to get everyone working together on applied projects, to strengthen existing collaborative relationships – and to start new ones.”\nSports and technology come together \nHealth and injury prevention in sports\nFor EPFL, UNIL and CHUV, the Lausanne 2020 YOG are a unique opportunity to showcase  an unprecedented and ambitious educational project that combines technology with sports science and injury prevention techniques to promote the benefits of good health for athletic performance.\nAthletes will have a chance to create their own avatar, or digital double. After completing a series of mobility, stability and movement tests, their data will be fed into the system. The results will be collated in an app, developed by EPFL startup Katapult, where athletes will be able to see their personal musculoskeletal and motor profile, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The app will also enable specialists to give athletes tips and advice on improving their performance.\nThe project is a joint effort between researchers and the CSS. “It’s a virtuous circle,” explains Vuilliomenet. “The CSS, which works directly with athletes, tells us what products and services it wants to develop, then we find labs capable of meeting that demand. The CSS tests the prototypes and reports back to us. And in the process, we generate a rich vein of data that can be used in other areas of research.”\nAthletes’ test results are fed into their avatar © Katapult\nParadigm shift\nThe idea behind Health for Performance is to bring about a paradigm shift in sports coaching and training. Whereas in the past the emphasis was on strength, speed and endurance, the project stresses how moving in the right way can help athletes reach their full potential. “These days, everyone wants to trail race, that’s what’s hot,” says Stéphane Maeder, head of the CSS. “And people want to run faster, go further, or lift heavier weights. But what happens? They get injured! We want to change mindsets and place the emphasis on quality. Athletes should stop thinking about how far they can push themselves, and focus instead on how they’re moving their bodies.” Athletes competing in the 2020 YOG will have a chance to use some of the assessment tools developed by Maeder and his team. These same tools will gradually be rolled out at the CSS.\n Once an extension planned for 2021 is complete, the CSS will serve as a one-stop shop for sports technology. “We’ll be equipped to run tests and assessments for people of all ages and mobility profiles – not just athletes,” says Maeder. “We’ll be able to detect and act on issues before they become serious.”\nKnow yourself better to train better\n© Alain Herzog\nAccording to Stéphane Tercier, lead consultant for adolescent sports medicine (SportAdo) at CHUV, “the medical implications of the Health for Performance concept are clear: young athletes wishing to maintain a high level of performance throughout their careers need to stay in good overall health.” This message, which spans all aspects of adolescents’ physical and mental health, features in preventive health materials developed by CHUV and disseminated through EPFL’s innovative communication channels.\n“There’s a link between elite sports and the work we do,” says Olivier Mutter, a project manager at UNIL’s Institute of Sport Sciences (ISSUL) who has been designing sports education programs for many years. “The aim of our work is to promote good public health – physical and mental. We’re building bridges between worlds that traditionally don’t connect: between research, sports and the general population.”\nThe Squaty sensor-filled mat records downward pressure and center-of-gravity displacement © Alain Herzog\nThree experiments at the 2020 YOG\nSquaty\n, developed by EPFL startup Technis, is a sensor-filled mat. The sensors record downward pressure and center-of-gravity displacement as users perform a squat exercise, sending the readings to an app. The smart mat is also connected to cameras that analyze the joints, observing movement compensation.\nBody Lat\n involves measuring range of motion in the muscles and joints and analyzing mobility.\nMotor skills\n analyzes fine motor skills by assessing how athletes maintain balance while hopping on a seesaw-like apparatus, tracking their movements until they regain stability.\nSports health laboratories and startups\nAt the next YOG, competitors will have a chance to try out the avatar they create using the Katapult app, which will be enhanced by various technologies developed by EPFL, UNIL, CHUV and other Smart Move partners. The app will produce ever more detailed results. For instance, athletes will gain insights into how sleep and diet affect their health and performance, and even check their overall state of health by looking at biomarkers in their sweat. The technologies will include contributions from several EPFL labs and startups.\nTracking movement \nThe Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB), led by Professor Pascal Fua, has developed a system that uses one or more cameras to analyze an athlete’s movements. Using algorithms, the system reconstructs the position of the athlete’s body in space and calculates the trajectory of the joints. Prof. Fua and his team are developing versions of the technology that can operate in increasingly complex environments.\nThe lab’s next challenge, working with Swatch Group’s sports watch arm Swiss Timing, is to track competitive divers as they execute their dives. “Our system should help judges score dives more objectively, and improve training,” explains Prof. Fua. “The idea is to overlay dozens of recorded dives, check for consistency of movement, and perhaps even suggest improvements.” The technology has already been used to track soccer and basketball players, and will soon be deployed on the ski slopes.\nIdentifying and tracking individuals\nAlexandre Alahi, a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL’s Visual Intelligence for Transportation Laboratory (VITA), works on the implications of human behavior for self-driving cars. He has developed an app that uses a smartphone camera to detect a person’s movements, posture, body position and direction of gaze, including in the middle of a crowd. The system can identify and continue tracking people even if they temporarily leave the camera’s field of view because it recognizes their behavior, posture, movement and activity profile. The technology works by building a unique, 17-point model of a person’ skeleton (see photo above). “The system could give coaches precise, detailed, real-time insights into athletes’ movements and postures,” says Prof. Alahi.\nEating well to perform well\nHow can marathon runners keep their blood sugar levels stable? How can sprinters gain explosive strength? In theory, science should be able to address questions like these. But the sheer number of variables in play means that, in practice, precise answers are more elusive. “An apple’s origin, variety, whether or not it’s organic – all these factors affect different people in different ways,” explains Chloé Allémann, a scientific assistant who leads the Food and You project at EPFL’s Digital Epidemiology Lab.\nDiet and health are closely related. Likewise, the foods athletes eat impact their performance. “Many health issues can be addressed with a balanced diet and regular exercise,” says Allémann. “In terms of sports, we could develop custom diets for individual athletes.”\nFrom her diet and lifestyle research – spanning aspects such as exercise, sleep, everyday habits, overall health, gut microbiota and blood sugar – Allémann understands that we all react differently to the foods we eat. “Blood sugar levels vary from one person to the next,” she explains. “Eating a banana before exercising is beneficial for some people but not for others.”\nThe research group plans to invite around 20 athletes to a CSS summer camp for observation. “The athletes will spend a week eating exactly the same diet and doing exactly the same exercises,” says Allémann. “We’ll be able to measure how their blood sugar levels vary under similar conditions.”\nDiet plays a prominent role in health and athletic performance © Alain Herzog\nWearable biochemical sensors\nEPFL spinoff Xsensio – working with the Nanoelectronic Devices Laboratory (Nanolab), from which it originated – has developed on-chip sensors that measure biomarkers in sweat. The chip, which measures barely 5 mm\n2\n and is worn on a smart patch stuck to the skin, sends real-time, continuous readings to a smartphone app or other external system. “The sensors can measure variations in electrolyte, metabolite or protein concentrations in an athlete’s sweat,” says Esmeralda Megally, Xsensio co-founder and CEO. “Electrolyte changes, for instance, tell us how dehydrated the wearer is, or how well they’re acclimatizing to heat. Similarly, lactate levels give us insights into muscle activity, while cortisol is an indicator of stress. The data should also be of interest to medical practitioners.”\nWhat sets Xsensio’s device apart is its size: the tiny chip can hold millions of sensors. “Our ambition is to produce a constant flow of biochemical information that’s as accurate as you’d get from a blood test, without the invasive downside,” says Megally. Xsensio’s Lab-on-Skin chip recently scooped a CES Innovation Award in the wearable technologies category. The award ceremony will take place in January in Las Vegas.\nMeasuring biomarkers in sweat with a tiny chip worn on the skin © Xsensio\nTracking athletes, step by step\nCollecting information is only the first part of the process. The data needs to be centralized, delivered to athletes, coaches, physicians, physiotherapists and other team members in a usable format – and kept secure. The Katapult app, developed by the eponymous EPFL startup, is an all-in-one health management hub where athletes can see their test results, get automated, personalized recommendations, and track their progress. The company has been working with the CSS for the past four years. “We tested the app with 2,300 athletes in Buenos Aires in 2018, checking its functionality and robustness,” explains Dan Hafner, Katapult’s director. “Despite power cuts and patchy Wi-Fi coverage, we didn’t lose any data. We’re unlikely to face the same challenges in Lausanne.”\nThe start-up Katapult has developed an application to collect data from athletes © Katapult\nCross-disciplinary approaches in compulsory education\nThe Lausanne 2020 YOG provided the basis for unprecedented collaboration between EPFL’s Education Outreach Department and the Canton of Vaud’s General Directorate of Compulsory Education (DGEO). EPFL and the DGEO spent 12 months developing a cross-disciplinary teaching kit with input from high-school teachers. Every class in Vaud Canton received a copy of the kit.\nWhat makes this new resource different is that it shows how objects in the world around us draw on disciplines that are traditionally taught separately at school. The kit stresses that, while science and technology are important, other subjects – from art and design to marketing, geography and economics – also have a role to play. “The kit also draws links between the curriculum taught in local schools and winter sports,” says Laura Tibourcio de la Corre, from EPFL’s Education Outreach Department. “For instance, downhill skiing can help children learn about Pythagoras’ theorem and how to calculate speed.”\nTwo films were also produced to accompany the kit, looking at the design and manufacture of two pieces of winter sports equipment that will feature prominently at the 2020 YOG: ski helmets and skis. The design of ski helmets touches on issues of biology, research and development. How does the helmet protect against skull fractures? How does it prevent concussion? The helmet film includes footage of EPFL students working on shock absorption systems, as well as physicians from CHUV explaining the mechanisms behind concussion. The second film, on skis, focuses on manufacturing and shows local, cutting-edge companies in action.\n© Alain Herzog\nPublic exhibition\nLausanne’s Malley Sports Center will host an interactive exhibition, housed inside a 300 m\n2\n dome, where schoolchildren and members of the public will have a chance to try some of the athletes’ exercises for themselves.

{"id": 771, "text": "One of the aims of Switzerland’s 2050 Energy Strategy is to increase hydroelectric production. The Swiss government therefore also needs to predict the environment in which these power plants will operate so that the underlying technology can keep pace with changing needs and future conditions. “In Switzerland, the glaciers and snow are melting more and more quickly. This affects the quality of the water, with a sharp rise in the content of sediments,” says François Avellan, who heads the LMH and is one of the study’s authors. “The sediments are very aggressive and erode the turbines.” This undermines the plants' efficiency, leaves cavities in the equipment and leads to an increase in vibrations – and in the frequency and cost of repairs. To top things off, the turbines’ useful life is reduced. Under the umbrella of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research - Supply of Electricity () and with the support of the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), EPFL has teamed up with General Electric Renewable Energy in an effort to better understand and predict the process of sediment erosion. The aim is to lengthen the hydropower plants' life span through improved turbines and more effective operating strategies.\nTiny particles with an outsized impact\nOne of the challenges facing researchers in the field of hydropower is that they cannot run experiments directly on power plants because of the impact and cost of a plant’s outage. They must therefore limit their investigations to simulations and reduced-scale physical model tests. In response to this challenge, the LMH has come up with a novel multiscale computer model that predicts sediment erosion in turbines with much greater accuracy than other approaches. The results have been published in the scientific journal . “Sediment erosion, like many other problems in nature, is a multiscale phenomenon. It means that behavior observed at the macroscopic level is the result of a series of interactions at the microscopic level,” says Sebastián Leguizamón, an EPFL doctoral student and lead author of the study. “The sediments are extremely small and move very fast, and their impact lasts less than a microsecond. On the other hand, the erosion process we see is gradual, taking place over the course of many operating hours and affecting all the turbine.”\nA multiscale solution\nThe researchers therefore opted for a multiscale solution and modeled the two processes involved in erosion separately. At the microscopic level, they focused on the extremely brief impact of the minuscule sediments that strike the turbines, taking into account parameters such as the angle, speed, size, shape – and even composition – of the slurry. At the macroscopic level, they looked at how the sediments are transported by water flow, as this affects the flux, distribution and density of sediments reaching the walls of the turbine flow passages. The results were then combined in order to develop erosion predictions. “It’s not possible to study the entire process of erosion as a whole. The sediments are so small and the period of time over which the process takes place so long that replicating the process would take hundreds of years of calculations and require a computer that doesn’t exist yet,” says Leguizamón. “But the problem becomes manageable when you decouple the different phases.”\nAdapting to the future\nWith conclusive results in hand, the LMH has now moved on to the next phase, which consists in characterizing the materials used in the turbines. Following this step, the researchers will be able to apply the new model to existing hydroelectric facilities. The stakes are global when it comes to retrofitting turbines in response to climate change, as hydropower accounts for 17% of the world’s electricity production. Turbines offer little leeway and have to operate in a wide range of environments – including monsoon regions and anything from tropical to alpine climates. If turbines are to last, changes will have to be made to both their underlying design and how they are operated. “While I was evaluating a hydro plant in the Himalayas, my contacts there told me that if a turbine made it through more than one monsoon season, that was a success!” says Avellan.\nThis study is part of CTI project No. 17568.1 PFEN-IW GPUSpheros.

{"id": 772, "text": "The first effective vaccine against malaria is currently undergoing clinical trials in the US, Europe and Africa, and may soon be distributed to the inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa, especially where the disease in endemic. However, the problem of transporting this vaccine at the right temperature across the dirt roads and long distances in these regions has still not been resolved.\nFlavia Camponovo, a student of life sciences currently finishing her Bachelor’s Degree, is used to humanitarian aid missions. This year, while searching for a project related to her studies, she came across EssentialMed, a start up with the goal of developing medical materials adapted specifically for southern countries. Along with four other students, Damien Huzard, Naig Chenais, Martin Page and Frédéric Michoud, she is now in Tanzania attempting to find a solution.\nEventually, this project seeks to create an enterprise that deals with the logistics of delivering these vaccines in Tanzania, and that could, in the long term, aid with all the cryogenically preserved biological products in Tanzania and other African countries. The goal of this project, which is also headed by Sanaria, the producers of the vaccine, and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, directed by Marcel Tanner, is to come up with a simplified business plan at the end of the students’ stay. “This is truly an innovative concept that we could repeat if the experience provides conclusive results. I am curious to see their findings,” states Klaus Schonenberger, owner of EssentialMed.\nVaccines Transported in Nitrogen\nThe number of deaths caused by malaria in 2010 is estimated by the World Health Organization to be 655,000, with 91% of these deaths occurring in Africa. Mosquito nets and sprays only go so far, and they do not suffice to eradicate the disease. Moreover, the parasites responsible for the disease have become resistant to many of the anti-malaria medications currently in circulation.\nThe new vaccine is the first to be truly effective in fighting the parasite. 80% of people who receive the vaccine become immune to the parasite for 28 months following the vaccination. But, since the vaccine is made up of microorganisms, it must be handled carefully to ensure that it remains effective. To maintain the vaccine’s viability, it must be transported in liquid nitrogen, which is to say under -140° C. Therefore, the students will be confronted with two main problems: the efficiency of the distribution channels, making sure no time is lost in this delicate operation, and the specifics of the containers in which the vaccines are stored and transported.\n“There already exist methods of cold transport in Africa, for products needed in artificial insemination of mammals and bovine vaccines for example. The goal of our project is to adapt these methods, especially to allow the transport of these products to remote villages,” explains Flavia Camponovo. The team has been there since July 19th, and has begun by exploring the existing distribution infrastructure and the various intermediaries to understand the specifics of this process and what changes must be made.\nTanzania seemingly has infrastructure that is already more vital and better organized than most of the Sub-Saharan countries. This includes central, regional and district storage facilities that furnish the shops of medical establishments in the more remote areas. Each stage of the distribution process must be taken into consideration, and the channels of distribution for these vaccines must be adapted to meet very particular requirements.\nA Very Specific Type of Container\nThe distribution containers must be able to maintain a temperature of -140 Celsius for 30 to 35 days. The students have found an example in the prototypes developed by an American company that has already done research on the logistics, markets and prices for this type of transport. The conditions of transport are an additional constraint when considered in a country like Tanzania, where the essential network of roads is not paved. The containers must resist impact and inversion, and be small enough to be transported by motorcycle. They must also possess systems for security and temperature surveillance, making them exceptionally specialized and complex.\nCreating a Business from the Logistics of Delivery\nFlavia is motivated by humanitarian goals, and has already taught at schools in Africa and South America, but hopes that this time, her trip will be more geared toward engineering. After a fruitful meeting with Klaus Schonenberger, she has been enthusiastic about pursuing this project proposed by his company, EssentialMed, and returned one week later with four other students in life sciences. “This project allows us to gain personal, entrepreneurial and logistical experience.

{"id": 776, "text": "How are human behavior and brain activity linked? That question has been eating away at Thomas Bolton ever since he started his PhD. To try and find the answer, he has reviewed and summarized the most recent scientific studies into how the data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) – a technique for monitoring the activity of the entire brain over time – are analyzed. In addition to the lessons learned from his thesis, the PhD student was able to draw on the clinical and technical know-how of his colleagues Elenor Morgenroth and Maria Giulia Preti.\n“Our aim was to see where things stand now and suggest avenues for future research,” says Bolton. “We wanted to pierce the mystery that shrouds cutting-edge analytical techniques and show how they characterize the various aspects of human behavior.” The resulting article has been published in \nTrends in Neurosciences\n.\nBridging the gap between science and users \nBolton, together with Professor Dimitri Van De Ville, reviewed the most recent literature on brain imaging and came up with an original, consensus-based summary for the neuroscience community. “Most new approaches are based on signal processing, machine learning or network modeling,” says Van De Ville. “We have to bridge the gap between these types of data science and current and future users, who may be neuroscientists or clinicians. Researchers are increasingly looking at more subtle human behaviors that change over time, such as emotions. That involves using techniques that can show coherent and spatially distributed fluctuations in brain activity.” Bolton adds: “Rather than expanding on the complex math inherent in the methods described in the articles, we focused on making them understandable.”\nThe replication crisis \nThe two researchers from EPFL’s School of Engineering made several important findings. They discovered that researchers don’t always get equivalent results from similar data. That’s because complex analyses often lead to ambiguous conclusions. As Van De Ville puts it: “You can use several different techniques to answer similar questions. And those techniques are so complex that the hypotheses can become hidden, which makes studies difficult to compare. The data and applications are often made public, but the underlying techniques need to be more understood.”\nRead also:\nAlertness, for instance, is linked to a number of aspects of our behavior and causes widespread fluctuations in brain activity. This doesn’t show up at all with some techniques but can clearly affect the results of others. “So that’s why we sometimes end up with very different findings,” explains Van De Ville. Bolton says: “We hope that in the future, researchers will work more collaboratively and take a more comparative approach. If we’re more consistent in selecting data analysis techniques, it’ll be easier to understand the differences between studies.”\nPicking out trees in a forest\nTheir study also sheds light on the lack of causal approaches. “It’s hard to stimulate or modulate brain activity in humans, so studies still tend to be correlational,” says Bolton. But, according to Van de Ville, “We can now characterize some changes in behavior – like those linked to depression or autism, for instance – based on brain activation, which makes it possible to verify hypotheses about our brain’s overall functioning. It’s a long road, but we’re moving forward one tiny step at a time.” \nFinally, Van De Ville thinks that a better understanding of the work methods involved will give researchers greater insight into which questions can actually be answered: “Data science is a fast-moving field, and it’s sometimes hard for neuroscientists to keep up. This article should make it easier for them to pick out some of the trees in the forest.”", "summary": "In the Medical Image Processing Lab, Dimitri Van De Ville and Thomas Bolton have studied the impact that computational imaging has on cognitive and clinical neuroscience by reviewing more than one hundred articles.", "claim": "In the Medical Image Processing Lab, Dimitri Van De Ville and Thomas Bolton have studied the impact that computational imaging has on cognitive and clinical neuroscience by reviewing two articles.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 29], "noise": false}

{"id": 783, "text": "The brain of a schizophrenia patient shows changes in network connections compared to the brain of a normal individual. That’s what scientists from the EPFL, observed after comparing the topography of affected brain regions and structural connections in a group of 16 schizophrenia patients with a group of 15 healthy individuals. Their results were recently published in the journal Human Brain Mapping.\n“The difficulty with schizophrenia is that it doesn’t seem to produce localised lesions but rather has a highly distributed aspect of neural abnormalities and connectivity deficits,” points out Alessandra Griffa, from the Signal Processing Laboratory 5 (LTS5) and first author of the paper. To identify affected brain networks, the scientists and their collaborators from the Department of psychiatry at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called diffusion spectrum MRI. This allows the diffusion of water in the brain’s white matter to be mapped tracing fiber bundle trajectories between different brain areas. In other words it allows them to map the connectome: the brain’s web of connectivity.\nThe comparison between healthy and schizophrenia brains shows for the first time that in the latter, 26 regions are affected meaning that about 30% of the brain nodes in the entire cerebral network are compromised. Affected areas are found in central as well as peripheral areas and include the frontal-parietal zone, an area involved in cognitive processes. “Even so, we can’t infer a clear association between the affected areas and for example the cognitive problems observed in schizophrenia disorder”, specifies Alessandra Griffa.\nWhite matter alteration\n The scientists were also able quantitate and characterise white matter structure (nerve fibers) and myelin (an insulator of nerve fibers, necessary for proper signal transmission). In afflicted brain areas of schizophrenic patients both these are modified resulting in less efficient nerve fibers connectivity. In effect, to get around damaged areas, connections need to find other paths, usually longer and thereby less efficient. The connection network then is decentralized in patients with the disorder compared to healthy individuals. For the scientists these structural alterations and the decentralized topology of the affected areas could be major mechanisms underlying schizophrenia disorder.

{"id": 787, "text": "We take it for granted, but walking on two feet is an extremely complex task. Reproducing a bipedal gait in a robot or simulating it on a computer is much more complex and involves many more parameters than one would imagine. That’s why humanoid robots or computer avatars often seem stiff and awkward.\nFascinated by neurosciences, recent life Sciences graduate Steve Berger wanted to contribute to research in this field. He was intrigued by this problem, a combination of biology and technology, and made it the subject of his Master’s thesis work. During a first-year class, he was intrigued by an articleabout Carnegie Mellon professor Hartmut Geyer’s research on muscle simulation. Berger immediately decided to do his research in this area.\n“I reproduced one of his projects that consisted of moving a 2D computer character,” he explains. First, he had to put in place all of the character’s (which he named Regis) basic parameters, such as the number of muscles and tendons involved and their length and viscoelastic properties, as well as the intensity of basic reflexes that enabled a rudimentary two-footed gait. Then he adapted and corrected them during the course of experimentation. “In particular, I introduced the idea of energy consumption; Regis was able to optimize his efforts in order to be able to walk for longer periods of time.”\nIn a third phase, the young scientist is developing a model for allowing the humanoid to get over an obstacle placed on the ground. “I got the idea from a study on cats,” Berger explains. “I realized that in order for Regis to fall as little as possible, his muscles needed to be activated in a certain order, with each one exerting the right amount of “force.””\nSubtle coordination\n By doing this research, Berger is hoping to better understand the mechanism of coordinated movement, and to contribute, in the longer term, to the creation of devices and prostheses that would allow handicapped individuals not only to walk again, but also to be able to navigate difficult and uneven ground. “To do that, it’s critical to pinpoint the logic in the biology in order to build robotics that are really robust, functional and adaptable.”\nWalking is a very complex function, the result of a subtle coordination between the brain and the spinal cord. As in any biological system, using simulations is very helpful in understanding the phenomenon. “It allows you to simplify the function by separating out or isolating its components, to make various hypotheses and then test them, and finally to validate them by implementing them in a robot.”\nThe young scientist is continuing his academic career with a PhD. He’ll continue working on bipedal gait, but now his focus will be on its cognitive aspects, particularly consciousness and the image one has of oneself during the action of walking.

They enable the replacement of the fixed manipulation systems traditionally used to grab, touch or direct samples observed under a microscope. No bigger than poker dice, they can perform very precise tasks up to 10 times faster than at present. The user moves them around an object using a joystick or a computer keyboard.\n The robots move by micro-jumps (several thousand per second), invisible to the naked eye, that are generated by piezo-electric motors. Some materials, such as the ceramics used in this case, are deformed mechanically when an electric current is applied to them. The variation in the frequency of the electric signal being used enables these small devices to move at a given speed. This kind of functioning has the advantage of allowing the user to work on samples several millimeters in size, while guaranteeing a movement resolution below 50 nanometers.\n An electric probe, optical fiber, pliers or other miniature tools are fitted at the end of the tiny robot’s arm, rendering it capable, for example, of separating out a carbon nanotube (more than 10,000 times finer than the diameter of a hair) and measuring its electrical conductivity. \n Imina Technologies, founded in March 2009, has already installed several systems for companies in Europe, in leading-edge laboratories of institutes of research in nanotechnology.

{"id": 794, "text": "Many people may not be able to define what a minor mode is in music, but most would almost certainly recognize a piece played in a minor key. That’s because we intuitively differentiate the set of notes belonging to the minor scale – which tend to sound dark, tense, or sad – from those in the major scale, which more often connote happiness, strength, or lightness.\nBut throughout history, there have been periods when multiple other modes were used in addition to major and minor – or when no clear separation between modes could be found at all.\nUnderstanding and visualizing these differences over time is what Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab (DCML) researchers Daniel Harasim, Fabian Moss, Matthias Ramirez, and Martin Rohrmeier set out to do in a recent study, which has been  in the open-access journal \nHumanities and Social Sciences Communications\n. For their research, they developed a machine learning model to analyze more than 13,000 pieces of music from the 15\nth\n to the 19\nth\n centuries, spanning the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, early Romantic, and late Romantic musical periods.\n“We already knew that in the Renaissance [1400-1600], for example, there were more than two modes. But for periods following the Classical era [1750-1820], the distinction between the modes blurs together. We wanted to see if we could nail down these differences more concretely,” Harasim explains.\nThis data visualization based on the researchers’ model shows how four different musical modes – indicated by red, green, purple, and blue – predominated during the Renaissance. © DCML / EPFL\nMachine listening (and learning)\nThe researchers used mathematical modeling to infer both the number and characteristics of modes in these five historical periods in Western classical music. Their work yielded novel  showing how musicians during the Renaissance period, like Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, tended to use four modes, while the music of Baroque composers, like Johann Sebastian Bach, revolved around the major and minor modes. Interestingly, the researchers could identify no clear separation into modes of the complex music written by Late Romantic composers, like Franz Liszt.\nHarasim explains that the DCML’s approach is unique because it is the first time that unlabeled data have been used to analyze modes. This means that the pieces of music in their dataset had not been previously categorized into modes by a human.\n“We wanted to know what it would look like if we gave the computer the chance to analyze the data without introducing human bias. So, we applied unsupervised machine learning methods, in which the computer 'listens' to the music and figures out these modes on its own, without metadata labels.”\nAlthough much more complex to execute, this “unsupervised” approach yielded especially interesting results which are, according to Harasim, more “cognitively plausible” with respect to how humans hear and interpret music.\n“We know that musical structure can be very complex, and that musicians need years of training. But at the same time, humans learn about these structures unconsciously, just as a child learns a native language. That’s why we developed a simple model that reverse engineers this learning process, using a class of so-called Bayesian models that are used by cognitive scientists, so that we can also draw on their research.”\nFrom class project to publication…and beyond\nHarasim notes with satisfaction that this study has its roots in a class project that he and his co-authors Moss and Ramirez did together as students in EPFL professor Robert West’s course, . He hopes to take the project even further by applying their approach to other musical questions and genres.\n“For pieces within which modes change, it would be interesting to identify exactly at what point such changes occur. I would also like to apply the same methodology to jazz, which was the focus of my , because the tonality in jazz is much richer than just two modes.”", "summary": "Researchers in EPFL’s Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab in the College of Humanities used an unsupervised machine learning model to ‘listen to’ and categorize more than 13,000 pieces of Western classical music, revealing how modes – such as major and minor – have changed throughout history.", "claim": "Researchers in EPFL’s Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab in the College of Humanities used an unsupervised machine learning model to ‘listen to’ and categorize five pieces of Western classical music, revealing how modes – such as major and minor – have changed throughout history.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [27, 27], "noise": false}

The two EPFL startups have their sights set on the top prize of 100,000 euros, but they will also make the most of the international visibility that they are gaining.\nTreating neurological disorders by targeting glial cells\nUntil now, glial cells have not been a major focus of neuron research or treatments for neurological and psychological disorders. Yet in the 1990s, imaging techniques gradually revealed the importance of these cells in the brain’s functioning. Not only do they interact with neurons, but they are also necessary for the neurons’ survival, provide them with energy and clear out their waste. Pierre Magistretti, now an honorary professor at EPFL, and his team discovered several mechanisms by which neurons activate glial cells and identified some molecules that play a role in consolidating memory. These discoveries suggest that glial cells could be a useful target in treating psychological and neurological disorders.\nThat’s where Gliapharm comes in. When the company was created in 2016, it already had several molecules of interest to explore. One of them could help treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the degenerative disease that Stephen Hawking suffered from. The company, based on Campus Biotech in Geneva, has now tested it on rodents. It already holds two patents, for molecules used to treat dementia and depression. Gliapharm has a distinct competitive advantage, because treatments targeting glial cells are still rare. Even better, according to CEO Sylvain Lengacher: “Among companies working on glial cells, we’re the only one that’s targeting metabolic pathways, that is, exchanges between brain cells.” After focusing almost exclusively on its research program in 2018, the company intends to enter several startup competitions in 2019 in order to enhance its visibility and set the stage for an initial fundraising round midway through the year.\nLight-sensitive materials to help dentists and surgeons\nWhen it comes to root canals, slipped discs and aneurysms, the medical filler developed by Lumendo, a startup created in 2018, could save dentists and surgeons precious minutes. In a root canal, for example, it normally takes around 30 minutes to fill a hollowed-out tooth, since the material used has to be compressed and dried in stages. Lumendo’s filler, which is applied with a catheter and then hardened with an optical fiber, shortens the time required by a factor of ten.\nIt was during his PhD studies at EPFL’s Laboratory of Biomedical Orthopedics and Laboratory of Applied Photonics Devices that Andreas Schmocker, the company’s CEO, came up with the idea of a medical filler. But if he wanted to develop it for commercial purposes, he needed the right light-sensitive molecule to dry the material extremely quickly. He found what he was looking for at ETH Zurich, in a molecule developed by chemist Mark Bispinghoff, now the company’s CTO.

This promising scenario has been made possible by the innovations accomplished by EPFL’s Institute of Microengineering in Neuchatel. The team of prof. Christophe Ballif, director of the Photovoltaics Laboratory (PVlab), presented their work at the European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition that just took place in Frankfurt.\nThe PVlab specializes in thin film solar cells and has been interested for several years in \"hybrid\" technologies, better known as heterojunction technologies, designed to enhance solar captors’ performance. \"We apply an infinitesimal layer – one hundredth of a micron – of amorphous silicon on both sides of a crystalline silicon wafer,\" explains Christophe Ballif. This “sandwich” conception contributes to increase the sensors’ effectiveness.\nFor this assembly to be efficient, the interface between the two types of silicon requires to be optimized. Antoine Descoeudres managed to achieve this feat together with Stephaan DeWolf and their colleagues. They chose the commonest – and therefore cheapest – crystalline cell (called \"p-doped silicon\"), took care of its preparation and improved the process of application of amorphous silicon. They obtained a 21.4% conversion efficiency, which had never been achieved before with such type of substrates: nowadays, the best quality monocrystalline cells only attain an energy conversion efficiency of 18-19% at best. In addition, the measured open-circuit voltage was 726 mV, which constitutes a first-time accomplishment as well. Last but not least, they broke the 22% efficiency barrier on a less common substrate.\nClose to the market\n These results, validated by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) in Germany, will soon be published by the IEEE Journals of photovoltaics.\n To bring these innovations to a stage of industrialization may only take a few years.

{"id": 804, "text": "Microwaves are ubiquitous: they are part of any cell phones or wireless routers. They are also used in navigation for airplanes and nowadays even in cars. The processing and management of microwave signals requires careful control over the way they propagate. As an example, to hold a microwave signal for a few milliseconds requires hundreds of miles of electrical cable and it causes deterioration in the quality of the wave being held up: it is therefore necessary to amplify the wave regularly as it propagates through the waveguide.\nTogether with the Walther-Meissner-Institute in Garching Germany, researchers from the Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements led by Tobias Kippenberg have developed a new approach for harnessing the propagation of microwave signals. Their conclusions are being published in \nNature Physics\n.\nA miniature vibrating bridge\n Instead of using conventional electrical components such as capacitors or inductors, scientists use a nano-scale mechanical oscillator - a miniature vibrating bridge, 1000 times smaller than a human hair - to delay the microwave signals. This approach succeeded in holding an electromagnetic signal within a circuit for 3.5 milliseconds before releasing it on command, with negligible loss or distortions. This may seem very short, but it is a substantial amount of time in the microwave world. \"Holding up a wave for 3.5 milliseconds before letting it propagate normally would require 600 kilometers of coaxial cable,\" says doctoral candidate Xiaoqing Zhou, lead author of the Nature Physics article. This was all done on a tiny chip measuring only 6mm by 10mm.\nTowards a hybrid technology \n A combination of two devices - a hybrid technology - drives the performance improvement of the new system. The circuit holds a microwave cavity, which looks like a miniature S-shape conductor (see image on right), and a nano-mechanical oscillator (see image below), a tiny vibrating string, which is positioned inside the micro-cavity. A signal that reaches the micro-cavity is reflected around the interior boundaries of the cavity thousands of times. In this way it stays within the device for a short period. The nano-mechanical oscillator allows the cavity to hold the wave even longer. In this way, the two technologies combine to “hold” the wave for several milliseconds. The key point is that the loss of the nanomechanical oscillator is much lower than the electrical components; this increases the performance of the device, allowing long storage times.\nWork as an all microwave-transistor\n More precisely, in practice when a signal arrives in the circuit an additional strong microwave (pump) is used to help to boost the power of the oscillations produced naturally by the nanomechanical oscillator. A reciprocal phenomenon subsequently occurs: the oscillations, which were driven by the microwave, reciprocally provoke a change in the microwave signal itself. In this way, each element in the system affects the other elements: the signal affects the mechanical oscillator, and the oscillator affects the signal, allowing delaying, advancing or switching of microwave pulses. \"By adjusting the pump, one can decide to slow down the signal, to speed it up or even to block it or let it go\", says Xiaoqing Zhou. The circuit can be used for classical signals, but also for quantum signals – signals that are very faint and follow the often counter-intuitive laws of quantum mechanics.\nSuitable for both classical and quantum systems\n The device was produced entirely within the EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMI). For the moment, it only works at very low temperatures- only a tiny bit above absolute zero, due to the fact that the microwave circuit is made from a superconducting material. But the principle could equally be used to develop devices that operate at room temperature.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have succeeded in capturing a microwave pulse within a chip for several milliseconds before releasing it with little loss.

Somewhere midway between homes and hospitals, they have to stimulate social contact and provide privacy, be wheelchair and stretcher compatible yet cozy – and all that on a limited budget. Under a mandate by the canton’s Public Health Department, Bruno Marchand and Marielle Savoyat analyzed, through the eyes of an architect, a dozen nursing homes recently erected in the Swiss canton of Vaud. Their results, published in  that came out in early 2014, give an overview of the history and current trends in the field of nursing home architecture. We sat down with Bruno Marchand to talk about some of the insights gained while writing the book.\nYes, obviously! We can safely assume that architecture is closely related to human behavior – even if there are contradicting theories on the subject. There are a number of issues that are inherent to architecture of nursing homes: comfort, atmosphere and accessibility are fundamental to the wellbeing of elderly people, who are often in a fragile state of health.\nWhat types of challenges do architects face when they design nursing homes? \nNursing homes are complex hybrid organisms, where areas for medical care are intimately linked to residential areas. A major challenge is to give them a strongly humane character. Over the past years, those in charge of nursing homes have endeavored to make the medical component of the facilities as discreet as possible. The residents should feel like they are at home, not in a hospital.\nTell us about the book you just published. \nOur mandate was to analyze a set of nursing homes that opened recently in the canton of Vaud from an architectural perspective. We compared the conception of each project to its ultimate realization and tried to derive lessons in the process. Additionally, we analyzed hundreds of entries submitted to recent architectural competitions in order to uncover the breadth of possible approaches and thus provide architects with both extensive documentation and a foundation upon which they can build when thinking on the subject. We also dedicated a chapter to a historical overview of nursing home architecture.\nPersoneni Raffaele Schärer Architectes, EMS La Clairière, Mies, 2003-2007, view onto the living room, © Michel Bonvin\nWhat makes a nursing home a good nursing home? \nBasically, anything that conceals the institutional character of the establishment. The long hallways are being increasingly replaced by circular ones to minimize a resemblance to hospitals. The rooms and associated elements, such as doors and windows, are given extra care. The entrance to rooms, which marks the transition between private and public – or intimate and collective – spaces, is another essential component. Location is crucial as well: we have to avoid building “secluded oases in the countryside” and instead integrate nursing homes into bustling neighborhoods that are well serviced by public transport and located near shops and restaurants. However, land at such prime locations is unfortunately hard to come by.\nWhat are the most prevalent ways of designing nursing homes today? \nWhen we analyzed the submissions for nursing home competitions, one theme that came out was that of a large house – about the size of a townhouse. Sometimes two rooms share a single window, and the windows are staggered to attenuate the institutional, regular nature of the building. Large establishments are often fragmented into several smaller structures.\nDo other models exist? \nIn Basel, Herzog and de Meuron built a nursing home in a football stadium, provocatively stating that their residents like to watch football… There is no single model, which is what makes this book interesting. Despite these differences, the humanist discourse is becoming more and more prevalent, adapted each time to local cultural and financial circumstances.\nHow are things in Switzerland and particularly in Vaud? \nHistorically, Switzerland has been very mindful of the wellbeing of its elderly population and has therefore become one of the most advanced countries in this area. As is often the case, Switzerland stands out for its very high quality of living and its high quality infrastructure; the same is true for its nursing homes. On top of that, there is a constant sense of progress, with each project bringing a new set of lessons. The members of the canton’s Public Health Department play an important role in guiding these projects and making sure that they keep up with developments in the field.\nP. de Benoit M. Wagner Architectes, EMS Silo, Echichens, 2003-2012, picture of a room\nDid you experience anything particularly fascinating during your research? \nMoving into a nursing home is a difficult step in life, and it is fascinating to see how different people deal with this transition. Some leave behind their past and bring along nothing but their toothbrush. Others try to take their entire lives with them. Because space is limited, this can sometimes be challenging. But what I saw and heard when visiting the homes was generally very positive.

{"id": 811, "text": "A huge volume of digital data has been harvested, stored and shared in the last few years – from sources such as social media, geolocation systems and aerial images from drones and satellites – giving researchers many new ways to study information and decrypt our world. In Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) has taken an interest in the big data revolution and the possibilities it offers to generate predictive statistics for the benefit of society. \nConventional methods such as censuses and surveys remain the benchmark for generating socio-economic indicators at the municipal, cantonal and national levels. But these methods can now be supplemented with secondary, mostly pre-existing data, from sources such as cell-phone subscriptions and credit cards. According to the FSO’s  “The goal of data innovation is to enhance the quality, scope and cost-efficiency of statistical products and to reduce the response burden on households and businesses.”\nAnonymized data\nAgainst this backdrop, a team of scientists at EPFL's Laboratory on Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems () conducted a ground-breaking study on novel uses for the data held by insurance companies. The lab's leading partner company, La Mobilière, provided anonymized data from hundreds of thousands of policyholders. These data included factors such as age, residential postal code, car- and homeownership, and employment status.\n“We wanted to see if we could use these data to predict specific socio-economic indicators – ones that could give us a better picture of the quality of Switzerland’s urban areas. One big advantage of the data held by insurers – provided they’re willing to share it – is that they are cheap to use, since they already exist, and annual surveys can be carried out at no extra cost,” says Emanuele Massaro, a lead author of the study, which was published \nInsurers should consider working more closely with researchers\nEmanuele Massaro\nUsing data-mining techniques, the research team extracted the relevant information and aggregated it to cover the 170 most populated Swiss towns. In all, they obtained nearly 600,000 profiles, each identified by a unique code. “La Mobilière’s dataset is very complete; it contains a wide range of information that enabled us to factor in over 30 variables, which we used mainly to select those variables that best match each socio-economic indicator,” says Lorenzo Donadio, a Master's student in environmental science and engineering at EPFL and the study’s first author.\nA spatial regression model\nThe scientists developed a spatial regression model to accurately predict twelve variables in six categories: population, transport, work, space and region, housing, and the economy. “Of course, our predictions can’t replace official censuses, but they can serve as yearly signposts. We also wanted to show that insurers’ datasets contain a great deal of socially relevant information – beyond what they use for marketing and market research – and that insurers should consider working more closely with researchers,” says Massaro. \nThe team’s statistical model was developed solely for research purposes and has no practical application as such. It could be used to help guide policymakers, but regular census data are still needed. La Mobilière's data are missing certain information, such as for young people under the age of 18, but are nevertheless representative of a large portion of the population. “Our model could be used by city policymakers and government statistical offices, which could incorporate this type of information in their modernization efforts. Insurers' datasets are highly granular because they contain very specific information about their customers,” says Massaro.", "summary": "Using anonymized policyholder data from Swiss insurance company La Mobilière, EPFL scientists were able to predict a number of socio-economic indicators in 170 Swiss towns.

{"id": 813, "text": "In 2015, EPFL researchers led by  published  showing that the bacterium responsible for cholera, \nVibrio cholerae\n, . They identified the spear mechanism to be the so-called “type VI secretion system” or T6SS, also used for interbacterial competition by many other bacteria.\nV. cholerae\n uses its T6SS to compete with other bacteria in its aquatic environment and acquire new genetic material, which the pathogen absorbs and exchanges against some parts of its own genome. This mode of “horizontal gene transfer” leads to rapid evolution and pathogen emergence. The pathogen \nV. cholerae\n has caused seven major cholera pandemics since 1817 and, according to , still kills more than 100,000 people each year and infects up to 4 million others, mostly in poor or underdeveloped countries.\nNow, Blokesch’s group has discovered the extent of DNA that \nV. cholerae\n can steal in a single attack: more than 150,000 nucleic acid base pairs, or roughly 150 genes in one go (the cholera bacterium carries around 4,000 genes in total). The researchers calculated this number by sequencing the entire genome of almost 400 \nV. cholerae\n strains before and after stealing DNA from their neighboring bacteria.\nPrevious studies have tried to establish just how much DNA competent bacteria can absorb and integrate into their genome by feeding them large quantities of purified DNA. However, this does not reflect the natural conditions in which the bacteria live and operate, as long stretches of free DNA are scarce in the environment. \nV. cholerae’s \nT6SS-mediated DNA stealing, however, allows the bacterium to acquire fresly released and long DNA fragments. This bacterial behavior is tightly linked to the chitinous surfaces (e.g. shells) on which the bacterium usually lives in oceans and estuaries.\nVibrio cholerae\n bacteria can acquire large stretches of genetic material from killed neighboring bacteria, which fosters rapid evolution. Credit: Noémie Matthey/Blokesch lab; EPFL\nTo address this, the EPFL researchers studied two unrelated (“non-clonal”) strains of \nV. cholerae \nin co-cultures on chitin. This allowed them to determine the frequency and extent of DNA exchanges between the two strains, under more natural conditions.\nThe study, led by PhD student Noémie Matthey, found that \nV. cholerae\n strains that carry a functional and chitin-inducible T6SS system are much more efficient at transferring DNA than bacteria that don’t. The predatory bacterium acquired large genomic regions from its killed prey – up to the 150,000 base pairs mentioned above.\nThe authors conclude that the environmental “lifestyle” of \nV. cholerae\n enables exchange of genetic material with enough coding capacity that it can significantly accelerate the evolution of the bacterium.\n“This finding is very relevant in the context of bacterial evolution,” says Blokesch. “It suggests that environmental bacteria might share a common gene pool, which could render their genomes highly flexible and the microbes prone to quick adaption”.\nOther contributors\nSwiss Institute of Bioinformatics/Vital-IT", "summary": "EPFL scientists have discovered that predatory bacteria like the cholera pathogen can steal up to 150 genes in one go from their neighbors.

{"id": 817, "text": "With the power-conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells plateauing around 25%, perovskites are now ideally placed to become the market’s next generation of photovoltaics. In particular, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites offer manufacturing versatility that can potentially translate into much higher efficiency: studies have already shown photovoltaic performances above 20% across different solar cell architectures built with simple and low-cost processes.\nThe main challenge for the perovskite field is not so much efficiency but stability. Unlike silicon cells, perovskites are soft crystalline materials and prone to problems due to decomposition over time. In a commercial context, this puts perovskites on a higher price tag than conventional silicon cells.\nThere have therefore been many efforts in synthesizing perovskite materials that can maintain high efficiency over time. This is done by introducing different cations (positively charged ions) into the crystal structure of the perovskite. Although success has been reported by mixing inorganic cations like cesium or rubidium into the perovskite composition, these solutions tend to be difficult and expensive to implement.\nMeanwhile, no organic – and easier to synthesize – cations that can improve both efficiency and stability have been found so far. Now, , with colleagues at the University of Cordoba, has discovered that they can improve perovskite stability by introducing the large organic cation guanidinium (CH\n6\nN\n3\n+\n) into methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, which are among the most promising alternatives in the group today.\nThe scientists show that the guanidinium cation inserts into the crystal structure of the perovskite and enhances the material’s overall thermal and environmental stability, overcoming what is known in the field as the “Goldschmidt tolerance factor limit.” This is an indicator of the stability of a perovskite crystal, which describes how compatible a particular ion is to it. An ideal Goldschmidt tolerance factor should be below or equal to 1; guanidinium’s is just 1.03.\nStability test of the novel MA\n(1-x)\nGua\nx\nPbI\n3\n perovskite material under continuous light illumination compared with the state-of-the-art MAPbI\n3\n. A schematic of the device architecture and the simulated crystalline structure is also provided (credit: M.K. Nazeeruddin/EPFL)\nThe study found that the addition of guanidinium significantly improved the material stability of the perovskite while delivering an average power conversion efficiency over 19% (19.2 ± 0.4%) and stabilizing this performance for 1000 hours under continuous light illumination, which is a standard laboratory test for measuring the efficiency of photovoltaic materials. The scientists estimate that this corresponds to 1333 days (or 3.7 years) of real-world usage – this is based on standard criteria used in the field.\nProfessor Nazeeruddin explains: “Taking a standard acceleration factor of 2 for each ten degrees increase in temperature, an acceleration factor of 8 is estimated for 55 °C as opposed to 25 °C degrees. Hence the 1000 hours at 55°C equivalent would be 8000 hours. Our cells were subjected at 60°C, therefore the numbers could be even higher. Assuming the equivalent of 6 hours full sunlight/day, or 250Wm-2 average irradiance (equivalent to North Africa) the total number of days are 1333, equals to 44.4 months and 3.7 years stability. However, for the standard solar cell accreditation a series of stress tests including temperature cycling and damp heat are also required.”\n“This is a fundamental step within the perovskite field,” says Nazeeruddin. “It offers a new paradigm in perovskite design as further explorations beyond the tolerance factor limit could prevail for cationic blends while preserving a 3D structure with improved stability through increased number of H-bonds within the inorganic framework – a problem that we are now close to solving.”\nContributors\nUniversidad de Córdoba\nAbengoa Research\nHumboldt Universitat zu Berlin\nHelmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie\nFunding \nEuropean Commission Horizon 2020 (SOLEDLIGHT)\nSwiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)\nToyota Motor Europe Technical Center\nMarie Skłodowska Curie fellowship (Horizon 2020 Grant agreement)\nSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness\nEuropean Cooperation in Science & Technology (COST)\nDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)\nReference\nAlexander D.

{"id": 820, "text": "Mosquitos. During the summer months they can be annoying, but in the villages around the southern tip of Lake Gruyere, they can become a real pest – if, that is, they are left unchecked. That is why for the past 20 years local authorities have been culling the mosquito population in interventions timed to hit the mosquito larvae with a natural insecticide when they are most vulnerable. To assist decision-makers in planning these interventions, Max Mentha and Morgan Bruhin, both master’s students in environmental engineering, worked on the development of an online platform that tracks the larval development around the hotspot.\n“You wouldn’t expect this area to be infested by mosquitos,” says Max Mentha, walking on the parched muddy banks at the southern tip of Lake Gruyere, not a single mosquito in sight. “Right now, we are in the middle of a heat wave. The mosquito eggs are waiting for rain to hatch, but once the temperature and water level of the lake are just right, their population will explode, pestering residents in Broc, Morlon, and other towns within their ten-kilometer flight radius,” he says.\nThe perfect storm of conditions leading to the massive proliferation of mosquito larvae only became possible with the construction of the Rossens dam that transformed a section of the Sarine River into what is now Lake Gruyere. Fluctuating water levels, stagnant puddles of water, and the right type of vegetation all contribute to making the area a haven for proliferating larvae.\nDrawing the perfect battle plan\nFor their design project, Mentha and Bruhin rarely set foot on the idyllic shores of Lake Gruyere. Instead, they spent most of their time in computer labs. “Our project focused on upgrading an existing computer program that tracks the development of mosquito larvae around Lake Gruyere and transforming it into an online application,” says Mentha. The platform models the altitude of the lake surface, lake water temperature, and other parameters in a geographical information system, basically a digital map.\n“The goal was to enhance the platform by integrating a three-day weather forecast,” he explains. The online application is part of swissrivers.ch, a website run by Lausanne based environmental consulting firm e-dric.ch, that provides free forecasting information for rivers across the country.\nUltimately, the module that the students worked on will help authorities determine exactly when and where to intervene with a bacteria-based insecticide, typically dispersed from a helicopter once a year. Integrating the weather forecast could buy the authorities enough time to reserve the helicopter required for the operations.\nA natural insecticide\nWhen dealing with mosquitos, the insecticide of choice is not a complex chemical compound, but a bacterium found naturally in most soils: \nBacillus thuringiensis israelensis\n. This bacteria is known to act only on three species of insects, mosquitos, black flies, and fungus gnats, and only during a brief window of their development. By strewing it out of a helicopter when the conditions are just right, a large fraction of the larvae can be killed without further damaging the ecosystem.\n“What we really enjoyed about the project was that it was extremely multidisciplinary, involving geographical information systems, computer science, hydrology, and biology. It also gave us an opportunity to interact with a number of professionals, from ETH Zurich professor Peter Lüthy, who has been managing the mosquito control project for the past 20 years, to the engineers at e-dric.ch, to local residents in the region,” says Mentha.", "summary": "Summer Series on Student Projects: Two EPFL students wrote hundreds of lines of computer code in a war against mosquitos, waged on the shores of Lake Gruyere.

{"id": 829, "text": "Oncologists have STAT3 in their sights. This protein, which plays a role in cell division, is at the heart of a complex series of reactions within the cell. In many cancers, it is overactive – this generally is a negative element in terms of survival, because cells have a marked tendency to proliferate. EPFL scientists have unraveled the chain of events that trigger or inhibit the activity of the protein in healthy cells. Their discovery, published in the journal Molecular Cell, could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets. \n The process begins when a growth factor binds to receptors located on the cell membrane. This event triggers the cell to produce the protein STAT2. Curiously, the cell also simultaneously produces an inhibitor, called PIAS, that deactivates the protein, rendering STAT3 completely dormant. \nWhen the inhibitor is inhibited, STAT3 gets going\nHow is STAT3 activated? The researchers discovered that in certain circumstances a cell regulator, the “endoplasmic reticulum,” releases an inhibitor – to the inhibitor! When the first inhibitor is inhibited, STAT3 is let loose, which will favor cell division. \n “It’s only favorable for the cell to divide when all is well,” explains EPFL professor Gisou Van der Goot, primary author of the study. “We found that if a cell is stressed, the endoplasmic reticulum doesn’t release the inhibitor.” In order to neutralize STAT3 in cancer cells, then, the release of this second inhibitor needs to be prevented. \n STAT3 has been the focus of considerable interest by researchers for several years. They know that when the protein is overactive, cancer tends to produce metastases more easily.

The environment adapts to the user’s hand movements, which are visible. Emotions and sensations felt in the moment actually prompt new virtual elements. Imagined movements are performed by the avatar, as if it were directly connected to the user’s brain. The joystick is officially obsolete.\nMindMaze, an EPFL spin-off developed around a device for the rehabilitation of stroke victims, has used its expertise to launch this new system. Still in the prototype stage, the device goes a step further in advancing gamers’ immersive experience. A combination of cameras and depth sensors placed in the front of the glasses detect the user’s hands, making it possible for the player to interact in an immediate way in the virtual environment. Without employing any game developers, the start-up has so far developed a few simple examples that enable one to playfully test the innovations. One of them makes flames dance on a player’s fingertips. When the player relaxes sufficiently, the fire turns to ice.\nThe second innovation is a cap that uses brain activity detection technology to “read” a player’s mind. It captures waves of certain areas of the brain to detect movement, emotions or even a state of stress or relaxation. “From the moment that there is an identifiable and repeated pattern in the brain, it is possible to match a control system,” says Tej Tadi, the company’s CEO. An avatar can therefore grab a cup or open a door through the thoughts of the gamer. One example of this ability to read thoughts is a game that moves spheres based on one’s alternating states of relaxation and stress.\nMindMaze, which has just concluded a round of financing that raised 8.5 million francs, made an impressive debut in late February at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The company’s goal now is to release software for the development of games adapted to their system. The next improvements are expected to see the cap replaced with a less obtrusive immersion window that contains all the necessary sensors. Tej Tadi hopes to market the device as soon as the end of 2015.\nThe CEO of this young company, founded in 2012, is also today being named among the Young Global Leaders.

Security systems developed to protect the communication privacy between the seller and the buyer are the prime targets for hackers of all kinds, hence making it necessary for encryption algorithms to be regularly strengthened. In universities, research in hacking aim mostly at testing their robustness.\nMost of them rely on \"discrete logarithm problems\" – very complex mathematical operations – to secure data transmissions. \"There are several variants, based for example on prime numbers or other mathematical formulas, explains Arjen Lenstra, director of the Laboratory for Cryptologic Algorithms (LACAL) at EPFL . \"Their complexity is such that they are deemed as impossible to solve.\" Due to their effectiveness, the industry, especially banks, makes use of them for encoding their transactions. \"The danger lies in the fact that these systems are based on principles that we do not fully understand, states Arjen Lenstra. If someone were to find out how to solve them all, the entire system would collapse.\"\nIn fact, a little over a year ago, cracks began to appear. Robert Granger, then at University College Dublin but who has since joined LACAL, showed that surprisingly the problem's first phase can be solved very easily. Antoine Joux, a French Scientist, independently had similar insights, and together with a French team then showed how to make the second and final phase `very nearly' easy. Then, many other cryptographers stepped in.\nHowever, these methods only managed to overcome a very particular type of discrete logarithm. Nothing suggested that they could crack the industrial variants. \n Therefore, an EPFL team, together with Jens Zumbragel from TU Dresden, focused on a \"family\" of algorithms presented as candidates for the next generation of encryption keys, which made use of \"supersingular curves. “We proved that it would only take two hours for EPFL computers to solve a problem of this kind.

{"id": 838, "text": "In developing countries, many hospitals have become cemeteries of medical equipment. Several radiology systems, often sent by international aid, may never be used due to the climatic conditions and the instability of electricity networks. In a matter of weeks, they become useless. Besides, the lack of qualified personnel or spare parts rapidly dispels any hope to make them work. Yet, the lack of access to radiology in many developing countries is a serious public health problem, whether for TB screening or the care of road traffic injuries.\nGlobalDiagnostiX is the first medical radiography device specifically designed for developing countries. Its total cost of ownership, including purchase and maintenance over 10 years, is 10 times cheaper than the existing equipment. A fully functional prototype was unveiled in Lausanne on 9 March 2015. It was designed under the leadership of EPFL’s the Cooperation & Development Center.\nThe Center’s EssentialTech team is in charge of the project and manages its various stakeholders. Indeed, four EPFL laboratories, ten research groups from the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO; fields of health, engineering and design), the Paul Scherrer Institute, CHUV, the EssentialMed foundation and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute worked in close collaboration with the University Hospital of Yaounde (Cameroon), the University Research Center on Energy for Health Care in Cameroon, and other local stakeholders.\nReliable and cheap mechanics\n The device is specifically designed to resist harsh tropical climate and the consequences of high temperatures, humidity and dust. It includes an examination stand which was designed to avoid any electrical controls. It can move up, down, and turn depending on the body part to be X-rayed. It is only composed of mechanical, solid and stainless constituents. A subtle and robust mechanism facilitates its handling while preventing errors that could lead to shocks or bad radiographies.\nKeeping costs as low as possible: a composite image sensor\nThe radiographic image sensor has been completely redesigned to withstand shocks as well as the temperature and humidity. Very cheap, it is based on an array of twelve CMOS sensors whose images are assembled by the machine’s software. These sensors are commercially available and their cost is moderate; thus they can be easily replaced.\nResisting the unstable electrical network: power supply facing the worst conditions\nThe latest development is probably the most important: resistance to often inadequate or undersized electrical networks. Indeed, to operate an X-ray emitter, a power supply whose tension is able to briefly reach 150’000 volts is required! The power module will provide this voltage without overloading the hospitals’ network, whose total consumption in developing countries is often lower than a single X-ray machine’s. It also implements an innovative energy storage system, allowing the entire system to operate for several hours even without an external energy supply.\nAnd the research continues. First objective: raising funds – just under 2 million francs – for testing the first prototype’s reliability and improving its design, aiming at the creation of a second version by next year.\nEntrepreneurial approach, costs divided by 10\nDesigned to specifically meet the needs of hospitals in developing countries, GlobalDiagnostiX must leave the lab and get on the ground. A social business model has been created for this purpose. It will aim to make radiography not only accessible in developing countries but also in a self-sustainable and scalable way. The company’s business model, as well as its industrialization and deployment strategies, were developed with many stakeholders, such as potential customers and partners, in Switzerland and Africa.\nThe project has received the support of Pascal Hundt, head of the Assistance division at the International Committee of the Red Cross. He underlines the enthusiasm of Jeffrey Sachs, economist and Ban Ki-moon ‘s consultant at the UN, for whom “X-ray diagnostic imaging is an essential tool in primary healthcare for diagnosing conditions such as trauma or tuberculosis that represent a great burden in developing countries. Yet X-ray diagnostic imaging is still unavailable to two thirds of humanity.

This vast project, which began twenty years ago, is growing at an exponential rate. Some languages, like English and Swahili, are already largely available.\nMore than a translator, this dictionary delves into the words so that two meanings of the same term can no longer be confused. Take the English word light: in French, the automatic translator will translate it as léger or lumière depending on the context. Yet the chosen meaning is often incorrect, and the text becomes gibberish. The problem is even more pronounced when it comes to less common languages. Kamusi, which is now an NGO, intends to overcome these pitfalls. It includes both definitions and examples. In addition to being ambitious, the project is also a major technological challenge because a massive amount of data needs to be stored, organized and made accessible.\nMore than 1 million words in several months\n This summer, EPFL’s Distributed Information Systems Laboratory added 1.2 million words. Researchers imported the entire participatory translation website Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW), making improvements to the search process and the links between the various meanings of words. The Kamusi website shows, for example, if a translation was done by a computer and if the meaning was confirmed by a human being. It also lets users see groups of words with a similar meaning in other languages along with the expanded entry for each term.\nApart from adding existing databases, the Kamusi team counts on human knowledge as well. People who have mastered several languages are translating as many words as possible. This participatory approach works especially well for little-used languages. So much so that the government of Mali has just invested 5 million CFA francs – around 78,000 Swiss francs – in order to add words from three of its local languages. This money, a tidy sum for that country, will mostly be used locally to use any existing databases or to verify, little by little, the terms added by bilingual people.\nAfrica, Vietnam, Europe: an international dictionary\n “This is the first time that an African government is investing its own money in this project, which is a remarkable sign of confidence,” said Martin Benjamin, who founded the Kamusi project and is currently a researcher at the Distributed Information Systems Laboratory. This agreement also marks the cornerstone of a future collaborative effort to make this universal online dictionary the first electronic tool used by the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN), which is the intergovernmental body of the African Union tasked with promoting and developing the continent’s languages. “Africa’s growth and access to knowledge require a dictionary of this sort so that people can communicate with each other and with the outside world,” said Benjamin. The dictionary is also expanding in Asia and Europe. 200,000 Vietnamese words will be added thanks to a small subsidy provided by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation. And the inclusion of other databases with Bulgarian, Greek, Croatian, Slovene and Swedish words is also in the works.\nHow Kamusi started: In 1995, Martin Benjamin, who now works at the Distributed Information Systems Laboratory, tried to learn Swahili in preparation for an anthropological study in Tanzania. He was unable, however, to find an English-Swahili dictionary. He then came up with the idea of creating a participatory website – at a time when the internet was in its infancy – in order to create a Swahili-English database. Work on this language pair has progressed quite far at this point.

While other vacationers were spending a quiet holiday at the beach, they roamed Ho Chi Minh City and its suburbs visiting... hospitals.\nDuring eight weeks the students conducted their work, subsidized by Ingénieurs du Monde and falling within the framework of the EssentialTech program at the Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV) at EPFL. It builds on the  partnership and focuses on the development of water purification kits specifically tailored to the context of hospitals in emerging and developing countries.\nNot always welcome\n The three Life Sciences and Bioengineering students went to Vietnam to conduct a preliminary - yet crucial - step in this important project. They had to make an assessment of the access to drinking water in hospitals at the capital and its surrounding areas, as well as to estimate their needs. \"We quickly realized that the subject raised rather sensitive points, stated Maxence Dellacherie. The quality control of hospitals’ water is governed by recent legislation and it was not always easy for us to get the required authorization to conduct our analysis ...\"\nIndeed, after visiting the hospitals that did open their doors to our students, they got to the conclusion that, in general, water does not meet the health standards they had chosen to test. \"Patients buy their own bottles of drinking water outside,\" explained Sandra Gribi. Obviously, when it comes to weakened and vulnerable people, access to drinking water is much more important.\nFinding the right people\n Despite several months of preparation with the support of Felippe de Alencastro - from EPFL’s Central Environmental Laboratory - and after making preliminary contacts with Ho Chi Minh City’s University of Technology, the students still had to face some contingencies. \"Identifying the right people to support us during the process and while carrying out the analysis was not an easy task, said Gaëlle Minder. In addition, we did not expect to meet such administrative barriers. I hope that the contacts we made will remain useful in the project’s subsequent phases.\" The three travelers also agree on the necessity of thorough groundwork in addition to simply establishing a contact. “We would have saved a lot of time if some steps had begun before our arrival,\" said Sandra.\nHowever, the students were able to rely on the unwavering commitment of their Vietnamese colleagues. \"I was impressed and touched by their dedication and kindness,\" continued Gaëlle. Bacteriological analyses of the collected samples were carried out in laboratories with equipment described by Maxence as \"surprisingly varied and numerous.\" However, there were significant constraints due to the ambient temperature - over 30 Celsius degrees - and to the lack of air-conditioned spaces, which hindered the conservation of some products as well as the maintenance of the equipment in sterile conditions.\nBack to reality\n \"After spending four years in the Swiss academic environment, adjusting to the reality of the field was not easy, especially within the context of a culture at odds with ours,\" said Gaelle - before adding how the change of scenery has proved rewarding. Vietnamese hospitality undoubtedly accounts for many of their positive memories of the time spent doing the internship. For Sandra it was the impromptu performance of a song in an evening, and for Maxence it was the tasting of a dish of \"mini -chicken\" that later proved to have been made of... rat meat.\nTowards a large-scale project\n The important work carried out by Gaëlle, Sandra and Maxence has laid the groundwork for the realization of the project. The road is still long, and all three would be happy to share their experience with the next candidates for an internship in Vietnam. \"This first step allows us to move forward,\" said Klaus Schönenberger, head of the EssentialTech program at CODEV and originator of the internship. Based on the evidence gathered on site, he was indeed able to obtain, with the assistance of the Dragon Bleu Foundation, the subsidy for a job position to conduct the project’s next phases. \"The issue of access to drinking water in hospital is not unique to Vietnam: it also happens in Africa, he said.

{"id": 844, "text": "Water is the basis of all life on earth. Its structure is simple – two hydrogen atoms bound to one oxygen atom – yet its behavior is unique among liquids, and scientists still do not fully understand the origins of its distinctive properties.\nWhen charged polymers are dissolved in water the aqueous solution becomes more viscous than expected. This high viscosity is used by nature in the human body. The lubricating and shock-absorbing properties of the synovial fluid – a solution of water and charged biopolymers – is what allows us to bend, stretch and compress our joints over our entire lives without damage.\nIn a study published in , researchers from the  at EPFL’s School of Engineering have shed new light on the viscosity of aqueous solutions. They showed that, contrary to the traditional view that repulsive interactions between polymers are solely responsible for the increase in viscosity, a nuclear quantum effect between water molecules also has a part to play.\n“So far, our understanding of charged polymer-water solutions was based on theories that treated the water itself as a background,” says Sylvie Roke, head of the LBP. “Our study shows that water-water interactions actually play an important role. The same could also be true of other physical and chemical processes that influence biology.”\nWhy water is unique\nWater derives its unique properties from hydrogen bonds – short lived bonds between an oxygen atom of one water molecule and a hydrogen atom of another – that break and re-form hundred-thousands of billions of times per second. These bonds give liquid water a short-lived three-dimensional structure.\nIt has long been known that water becomes more viscous when charged polymers are dissolved in it. The viscosity is influenced by the size of the molecule and additionally by the charge. The reason why charged polymers increase viscosity more than neutral ones has been attributed to like charges on the polymers repelling one another. In this study, however, the EPFL researchers found that the electrical charges also interact with the water molecules and alter the water-water interactions, further hindering the flow of the solution.\nThe researchers measured viscosity by recording how long it took different solutions to flow down through a narrow tube. They also used special laser technology, developed at the lab, to probe water-water interactions in the same solutions on a molecular level. They found that the polymers made the hydrogen bond network more ordered which, in turn, correlated with an increase in viscosity.\nThe researchers then repeated the experiments with heavy water (D\n2\nO), a molecule that is almost identical to light water (H\n2\nO) but has a slightly different hydrogen bonding network. They found surprisingly large differences in both water-water interactions and viscosity. Since polymers repel one another in the same way in both light and heavy water, they concluded that these differences must arise from small differences in the way the two molecules interact, meaning that a nuclear quantum effect is at play.\nTheir discovery – that the stickiness of charged polymer solutions partially stems from nuclear quantum effects in water – has fundamental implications. “Water is everywhere,” explains Roke. “It makes up around 60% of the human body. These insights into the properties of water and how it interacts with other molecules, including biomolecules, will prove useful for developing new technologies – not just in health and biosciences, but also in materials and environmental science.”", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have discovered that the viscosity of solutions of electrically charged polymers dissolved in water is influenced by a quantum effect.

One promising approach to this problem is to inject a hydrogel loaded with repair cells or drugs into the damaged area in the hope of stimulating tissue regeneration.\nHowever, commercial hydrogels do not stay put after being applied to the treatment area because of pressure from the body’s movements and the flow of bodily fluids. Doctors therefore use special membranes to keep the hydrogel in place, yet those membranes are attached with sutures that perforate the very tissue the hydrogel is supposed to heal.\nTwo EPFL research groups, led by  and , have created a biocompatible hydrogel that naturally adheres to soft tissues like cartilage and the meniscus. Their hydrogel, which is almost 90% water, can withstand mechanical stresses and extensive deformation and therefore eliminates the need for a separate binding process. Their research has been published in \nACS Applied Materials & Interfaces\n.\n“Our hydrogel is ten times more adhesive than currently available bioadhesives on the market such as fibrin,” says Pioletti, head of the Laboratory of Biomechanical Orthopedics in EPFL’s School of Engineering. “And thanks to its high water content, our hydrogel is very similar in nature to the natural tissue it’s designed to heal.”\nComposite double-network hydrogel\nThe new hydrogel is actually a composite material consisting of a double-network matrix and a fiber network. This structure preserves the material’s strong adhesive capacity by blunting the impact of mechanical stresses. “The double network structure distributes incoming mechanical energy throughout the hydrogel, so that the material shows adhesion improvement when it is compressed or stretched,” says Pioletti. “In hydrogels that lack these damping mechanisms, the mechanical stresses are concentrated on the interface between the hydrogel and the tissue, and the hydrogel comes off quite easily.”\nMartin Broome, who heads the Oral and Maxillo-Facial \nSurgery\n Department at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) and is a co-author of the article, is convinced that this type of hydrogel could make a real difference. “If we build on the hydrogel’s remarkable adhesive properties, that could open the door to a large number of potential applications. One day, for example, it might be used in place of metallic materials like titanium to set bone fractures. More immediately, we may no longer need to use complex sutures on some types of soft tissue.”\nIn its current form, the hydrogel developed at EPFL can adhere to several types of tissue. The next step for the researchers will be to tailor it to specific applications. “Now that our material has demonstrated its superior mechanical properties, we are going to work on loading it with different agents that could help heal a patient’s cartilage or meniscus,” concludes Pioletti.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a hydrogel – made up of nearly 90% water – that naturally adheres to soft tissue like cartilage and the meniscus.

The use of heat pumps to leverage this source of energy is already well established. The piles are connected to thermal exchangers encased in concrete tubes, through which flows a coolant. The hydraulic circuit is connected to a reversible heat-pump system.

{"id": 862, "text": "It is impossible to envision an energy autonomous house without considering the related question of personal mobility. This is not just for the sake of consistency: it's the challenge posed by the Solar Decathlon. In this inter-university competition, teams will design, build and operate a fully autonomous, solar-powered house. The Swiss Team, which includes EPFL, was selected alongside 13 others and is now preparing to present its design in Denver (USA) in 2017. Charles Jeanbart, a Master’s student in civil engineering, is working on the question of mobility, simulating solutions that are both electric and shared and that use fewer vehicles.\nWhat is unique about the Swiss project is that it’s not simply a theoretical exercise. Following the competition in Denver, the house is designed to be brought back to Fribourg and set up there, possibly in the Beaumont neighborhood. It will be connected to existing buildings and readily accessible to the public, with the aim of helping acquaint people with new forms of energy, consumption and mobility. Jeanbart chose the Beaumont neighborhood as the basis for his analysis of how existing vehicles could navigate the energy transition.\nHe began by estimating the number of vehicles in the neighborhood: around 1,670 for 4,000 residents. He then envisioned a scenario of electric or hybrid vehicles needing to be recharged frequently. Jeanbart, who is part of EPFL’s Transport and Mobility Laboratory, factors into his analysis the frequency and length of trips, when they take place during the day and on which day of the week, and he excludes longer trips. For his simulation, he chose two scenarios, one in which the cars can be charged wherever they are parked and the other in which they can only be charged at home with a home charger.\nA step towards smart grids\n“The goal is to determine the electricity demand at certain periods during the day,” said Jeanbart. “The first scenario shows that the peak charging curve corresponds – with a slight gap – to traffic peaks. This is mostly during the day, from 8am to 5pm. In the second scenario, which is more realistic, the peak is at the end of the day and in the evening.\" Not ideal for recharging cars with solar energy.\nJeanbart's work presents a simplified overview of the recharging needs of electric cars in the neighborhood of one city. “The model should be improved, taking the assumptions even further,\" said Jeanbart. “What I have in mind is to build this into a smart grid – an intelligent system that comprises energy production, storage and consumption – in order to make consumption and production more efficient.”\nThis exercise is particularly relevant in the context of the Solar Decathlon, which dovetails nicely with the thrifty, parsimonious vision of the 2000-watt society. Under this vision, individuals use no more than 48 kWh per day, or 2,000 watts in constant power, which is equal to the global average in 1990. The Swiss average is currently around 5,500 watts. “To achieve this, switching to electric cars and reducing the number of cars through car-pooling won’t be enough. We will also have to scale back our mobility needs by developing the local network,” said Jeanbart.", "summary": "Summer series on student projects (5) – Charles Jeanbart's semester project brings the question of mobility into the Solar Decathlon, an inter-university competition to design an autonomous solar house.", "claim": "Summer series on student projects (4,000) – Charles Jeanbart's semester project brings the question of mobility into the Solar Decathlon, an inter-university competition to design an autonomous solar house.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [6, 6], "noise": false}
{"id": 863, "text": "“Switzerland’s Spatial Planning Act states that land should be used more intensively in built-up areas, particularly those already well-served by public transport,” according to the thesis recently completed by Judith Drouilles, who holds a PhD in architecture and works at EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST). “This research shows that peri-urban residential neighborhoods consisting of single-family homes, although they are not a priority in terms of spatial planning, also have a lot of scope for improvement in terms of sustainability.”\nTo find solutions that are acceptable for owners of single-family homes, Drouilles spoke to local stakeholders and sent questionnaires to people living in residential neighborhoods in the Lausanne region, i.e. Chavornay, Assens, Echichens, Savigny and Jorat-Mézières. “Buying a single-family house in Switzerland is often the culmination of a life-long project or the realization of a dream. That’s why it was important to factor in the aspirations of these kinds of owners, to take into account their various viewpoints,” she explains.\nNumerous solutions\nAfter the initial fact-finding phase and after formulating several possible scenarios, Drouilles concluded that a wide range of solutions and awareness-raising initiatives are needed to make these neighborhoods more sustainable, for example through car-pooling and car-sharing, community gardens and shared services. If smaller homes were built for retired people, they would not have the burden of maintaining a plot of land and would be able to maintain their social contacts, while single-family houses would become more densely populated as new families move in.\nNon-renewable fuel prices are also expected to rise in the future, which could seriously affect people in these areas, who depend on their cars to get around and whose energy systems are outdated, particularly when they retire.\nThinking about neighborhoods as systems\nIf these neighborhoods are to become more sustainable, we must therefore stop thinking about them as individual plots of land and start viewing them as interdependent systems interacting within the municipal territory. Also, attracting more people to live in these regions in the next few years is not necessarily the answer, because that would lead to an increase in individual transportation. “From the sustainability point of view, it would be wrong to impose intensive land use uniformly across all areas,” warns Drouilles.\nIn her thesis, Drouilles used BIM, or Building Information Modeling, a collaborative 3D software program that allowed her to factor in numerous parameters at the building and neighborhood level. With BIM, she could apply various development scenarios to her case studies by making simulations over 35 years.\nInsufficient turnover\nDrouilles found that the crux of the matter is the slow turnover of single-family houses, which is hindering progress towards a more sustainable situation. “In Switzerland, half of all single-family houses are currently occupied by retired couples, who don’t have the money or inclination to refurbish their homes and install more sustainable energy systems. So as things stand, the peak annual emissions in these neighborhoods will exceed 2,000 Watt Society targets by more than five tons of CO2 per inhabitant by 2030,” explains Drouilles, who has been studying these issues for the past ten years. To avoid that situation, she is encouraging local authorities to make greater efforts to raise residents’ awareness of them and adopt their own initiatives, in order to drive change within neighborhoods.\nAccording to 2015 figures from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, 10% of Switzerland’s population currently lives in a peri-urban residential neighborhood in which more than 80% of residential buildings are single-family houses. Most people’s day-to-day traveling is done by car, and each inhabitant travels more than 40 km per day on average. The environmental impact of that lifestyle is almost 6.5 times greater than the intermediate targets set by Switzerland as part of its aim of achieving a 2,000 Watt Society by 2050. Given the current climate emergency, achieving change in these neighborhoods is an important goal and a considerable challenge.\nNovel method\nDrouilles wrote her PhD thesis as part of the LIVING PERIPHERIES research project led by LAST with the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation. “Judith’s doctoral research took a novel approach, proposing a range of scenarios for 2050. This allowed her to explore, in a dynamic way, the processes involved in peri-urban renewal and to estimate, using a novel and rigorous methodology, the possibilities and limitations with a view to achieving greater sustainability,” says Emmanuel Rey, the director of LAST, who supervised her thesis", "summary": "If the aim of a 2,000 Watt Society is to be achieved, peri-urban residential neighborhoods – where the average single-family home consumes 6.5 times more power than that target – must adapt.

{"id": 867, "text": "Is there a middle road between producing new materials and recycling them? You bet – reusing them! Researchers at the smart living lab in Fribourg came up with a slightly off-the-wall project based on the idea that the stuff we throw away could be the makings of sustainable construction. Guided by this concept, the researchers collected hundreds of old skis, whose mechanical properties proved ideal for building a collapsible pavilion.\n\"In the construction industry, talk about sustainable building usually revolves around insulation, energy efficiency, materials, recycling and biodegradation,” says Corentin Fivet, who heads EPFL’s Structural Xploration Laboratory (SXL). “But recycling is expensive and biodegradation is not always a feasible option. Another way to avoid producing new materials and use less energy is to repurpose materials as they are.\"\nWe need more research on the topic before ensuring its feasibility. But it could, for example, be paired with other existing building methods. Two examples are prefabrication and nomad architecture which uses support structures that can be repeatedly assembled and disassembled. “In our lab, we’re focusing on the support structures used for buildings because conventional structures – between their foundations and roofs – account for most of the eventual waste.”\nElastic gridshell\nAfter some trial and error with various materials – fishing rods came up short in terms of their mechanical properties and supply – they settled on skis. Like many other types of sports equipment, skis are technological wonders. Fivet says: “Skis typically bring together extensive technical refinements and, even if they’ve outlived their original purpose, should be reused.”\nOne aspect of the project was to determine the structural potential of skis for their new purpose. They had to be flexible in one direction and rigid in the other. They also had to be able to withstand applied loads and perform consistently over time.\n“We tested all types of skis – downhill, slalom, cross-country and freeride – and placed them at strategic points of the pavilion depending on their properties,” says Sofia Colabella, another researcher on the project. “Skis, which are made from high-tech materials, turned out to be almost better than wood, which is more commonly used in this type of structure.”\nColabella specializes in elastic gridshells, which are as flexible as metallic netting but become as stiff as a shell when fastened in place. The trick lies in arranging the individual components in two directions, so that they become a very flexible grid of rectangles. The grid is first built flat on the ground, and then the edges of the grid are pulled in. Because the individual modules are flexible, the center of the grid consequently arches upward. Once the structure has obtained its final shape, it is held in place by attaching other components diagonally in certain spots. This makes it stable and stiff. This structure can be used to cover a large area with small components, and it doesn’t require complicated tools or a formwork.\nHeaded for Lyon this summer\nThe researchers’ nomad pavilion is made out of 210 skis and held in place by 300 bolts – less than a hundred of which are needed for the reassembly. This project was selected for the \nBiennale Architecture Lyon\n, where it will be on display starting this June. The researchers hope to be able to set up their pavilion in different, popular areas of the city over the course of the event.\n“Our goal isn’t to make buildings out of skis. It’s to show that we can use uncontrolled and uncontrollable materials with a sufficient level of confidence in the structure’s safety and performance. It’s an exercise, a manifesto, that shows there are some interesting things to be done in this relatively unexplored field,” says Fivet.\nCorentin Fivet (project investigator), Sofia Colabella (gridshell designer and worksite manager), Bernardino D'Amico (engineering consultant), Claude-Alain Jacot (construction), Jan Brütting (construction), Valeria Didonna (construction), Endrit Hoxha (Life-cycle analysis)", "summary": "Could recovered materials play a key role in tomorrow’s civil engineering?

{"id": 875, "text": "A blow to the chest can have highly contrasting effects. For instance, some baseball players have died after being hit in the chest by a baseball, while patients undergoing fatal cardiac tachyarrhythmias have been saved by an appropriately timed thump to the chest. Scientists know that such blows create rapid strains on heart tissue, but they still don’t fully understand how the blows affect cardiac functioning. Researchers at EPFL’s  and at the Department of Physiology of the University of Bern () have developed an experimental device that lets scientists subject bioengineered heart tissue to highly dynamic strain cycles and measure its electrophysiological response. Their work has been published in \n.\nThe normal heartbeat is the result of an electro-mechanical coupling process. More specifically, electrical impulses invade the entire heart and “order” the heart muscle to contract. With each contraction, blood is ejected from the heart thereby ensuring stable circulation. “This coupling is essential, because that’s what makes our hearts beat at a regular pace,” says Matthias Imboden, a co-author of the study and EPFL post-doc, who performed part of his research at the Department of Physiology. \nUntil recently, scientists believed that the potentially fatal effects of a blow to the chest, or on the contrary, the rescue of patients in cardiac arrest by an appropriately timed thump to the chest, were the result of the strains that interfere with the transmission of electrical impulses, thereby causing disruption of the heartbeat. But no laboratory systems previously existed to test that hypothesis. “We did have methods for reproducing cellular strain, but they created the strain too slowly to truly replicate what happens during a blow,” says Stephan Rohr, a co-author of the study and University of Bern professor. \nReplicating blow effects in the laboratory\nThe researchers’ experimental device can subject cardiac tissue to strain patterns that closely mimic realistic chest impacts. It consists of stretchable, extremely thin gold and carbon electrodes deposited on a silicone membrane. “The carbon electrodes create the strain in the cardiac tissue and the gold ones measure the cellular electrophysiological response,” says Herbert Shea, head of the Soft Transducers Laboratory, a co-author of the study and a professor at the EPFL's School of Engineering. The researchers tested their system on bioengineered strands of rat cardiac cells, which were placed on top of the electrodes and subjected to different strains patterns. \nMuch faster strains\nThe device can generate cellular strains in the order of 10–12%, which is consistent with what occurs during a normal heartbeat. However, it generates that strain up to 100 times faster than what the heart encounters during normal function – just like what happens during a blow to the chest. The researchers’ device is motorless and is the only one to closely replicate the dynamics of blows to the chest, while simultaneously permitting the measurement of strain effects on the electrophysiology of the cardiac tissue.\nFindings that lead in new directions \nThe researchers found that contrary to what other studies had concluded, even very rapid strains do not affect the propagation of electrical impulses. “That means we need to look into other possible explanations of what exactly happens during a deadly blow to the chest,” says Rohr. “The strain sensitive element in the heart may actually not be the contracting heart cell itself but adjacent connective tissue cells.” Their device also paves the way to further research, such the effect of specific drugs or gene therapies having beneficial effects on mechano-electrical coupling in the heart.\nContacts\nEPFL - Prof. Herbert Shea\n021 693 6663\nUniversity of Bern - Prof. Stephan Rohr\n031 631 8746", "summary": "It is still a mystery why a blow to the chest can kill some people yet save others.

{"id": 876, "text": "When given a choice, people generally opt for sustainability. That’s the encouraging conclusion of our latest mobility survey,* carried out among EPFL students and staff in May. This good news comes as some 11,000 students head back to EPFL this week and the EU celebrates its annual Mobility Week. It turns out that the percentage of respondents who walk to school more than doubled between 2003 and 2019 (rising from 5% to 12%), while that of those who cycle grew by 50% (from 14% to 21%). Crucially, the percentage of people who drive fell by 17 percentage points (from 30% to 13%). “These improvements were achieved entirely through voluntary measures backed by targeted incentives and initiatives,” says Luca Fontana, in charge of mobilties at Durabilité EPFL. “That encourages us to continue rolling out our innovative, ambitious mobility plan.”\nAround 30% of EPFL students and staff – or some 4,600 people – responded to the survey (24% of students and 38% of staff). This response rate is up 8.6 percentage points from the last survey, in 2017. We learn, for example, that six out of ten respondents live either in Lausanne, near the Ecublens campus, or in one of the four surrounding towns. And more than half of commuters (54%) arrive on campus between 7:45am and 8:30am. “That’s good to know because it means we should consider measures to spread out the morning commute and therefore alleviate the traffic on roads and public transportation systems,” says Fontana. People tend to leave campus at different times, however – generally between 5pm and 7pm.\nDifferences between students and staff\nThe survey also found that students and staff differ in their commuting habits (see diagram). Among students, the percentage who walk to campus rose from 6% to 15% between 2003 and 2019, while the percentage who cycle grew from 15% to 22% – and those who drive or ride a motorcycle plunged from 21% to 5%. The percentage of students who use public transportation was relatively unchanged at 57%. However, it’s worth pointing out that there was no student housing on campus before 2003.\nRegarding EPFL staff, they are also more likely to use green transportation. The percentage of low-carbon commuters has risen 13 points since 2003; now some 20% cycle to work, up from 11% in 2003. Public transportation has surpassed the car to become the most popular commuting option; usage of the former grew from 32% to 40%, while that of the latter fell from 50% to 30%.\nElectric bikes and the PubliBike system are catching on\nOf course, the transportation method that people use also depends on the weather. Commuters are more likely to cycle in the summer (up 12 percentage points to 27%); most of them usually take public transportation, while some normally drive. The number of bicycles on campus is 70% higher during the summer months – and that of electric bikes doubles (around 15% of total bicycles). The number of cars is 15% lower.\nThe survey also indicates that EPFL’s PubliBike bike-sharing system has been a huge success. Nearly half of respondents use it – with the percentage of students twice that of staff (66% versus 31%) – and over 120,000 commutes were made on PubliBike in under a year. In addition, around 20% of students have used the EPFL Bike Center to have their bikes repaired or to buy a used bike at discounted rates. And 22% of respondents have tried out the Mobility car-sharing service (29% of staff and 15% of students).\nCarpooling campaign\nThese encouraging survey results do not mean the EPFL sustainability team will rest on its laurels. More initiatives are under way, and their effects will be visible from this fall. For instance, electronic discount cards for Lausanne’s public transportation system will be available to EPFL staff starting in October. And 24 electric vehicle charging stations will go into service in September through a partnership with Greenmotion.\nWhile very few students drive to school (3%) – largely because parking is too hard to find – 30% of staff take their car to work. And in the vast majority of cases (77%), the person drives alone. But the survey found that these commuters are open to carpooling. Therefore the EPFL sustainability team will launch a campaign in October to promote carpooling and introduce a new website that puts commuters in touch with drivers. During the campaign, participants will get free parking and their commute home refunded if something comes up.\n*Carried out in association with the Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences (FORS)", "summary": "As classes get under way, our latest mobility survey revealed that over 80% of respondents use public transportation or other clean ways of getting to campus.", "claim": "As classes get under way, our latest mobility survey revealed that ten of respondents use public transportation or other clean ways of getting to campus.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [12, 12], "noise": false}
{"id": 878, "text": "Leprosy is a chronic infection of the skin, peripheral nerves, eyes and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, affecting over a quarter million people worldwide. Its symptoms can be gruesome and devastating, as the bacteria reduce sensitivity in the body, resulting in skin lesions, nerve damage and disabilities. Until recently, leprosy was attributed to a single bacterium,\n Mycobacterium leprae\n; we now suspect that its close relative, \nMycobacterium lepromatosis\n, might cause a rare but severe form of leprosy. EPFL scientists have analyzed for the first time the complete genome of \nM. lepromatosis\n, and compared it to that of the major leprosy-causing bacterium.

But in 2008, a study showed considerable evidence that another species of bacterium, \nM. lepromatosis\n, causes a distinct and aggressive form of the disease called “diffuse lepromatous leprosy”, found in Mexico and the Caribbean.\nStudying the genome of \nM. lepromatosis\n The lab of Stewart Cole at EPFL’s Global Health Institute carried out a genome-wide investigation on \nM. lepromatosis\n.

Because \nM. lepromatosis\n cannot be grown in the lab and animal models for this version of leprosy do not exist yet, the scientists used an infected skin sample from a patient in Mexico to obtain the bacterium’s genetic material.\nAfter extracting the DNA from the entire sample, the researchers had to separate the bacterial DNA from the patient’s. To do this, they used two genetic techniques: one that increased the bacterium’s DNA and another that decreased the human DNA. With the bacterium’s DNA isolated, the researchers were able to sequence it and read it. Once they had the complete sequence of the bacterium’s genome, they were able to compare it with the known genome of \nM. leprae\n, the bacterium responsible for the majority of leprosy cases.\nThe study found that the two species of bacteria are very closely related. The comparative genomics analysis could “backtrack” the history of their genes, and showed that the two bacteria have diverged 13.9 million years ago from a common ancestor with a similar genome structure, and possibly a similar lifestyle. That ancestor suffered a process known as “gene decay”, where over a long period of time and multiple generations, a large number of genes mutated, became non-functional, and eventually disappeared. The study showed that the two new species continued to lose genes but from different regions of their genomes, indicating that during their evolution they occupied different biological roles and mechanisms to ensure survival.\nCole’s team also conducted a study on over two hundred skin samples from leprosy patients in Asia, Africa, and the Americas to determine the geographic distribution of \nM. lepromatosis\n. The results showed that the bacterium is relatively scarce, and seems to be restricted to patients in Mexico. In contrast, the major leprosy-causing bacterium \nM. leprae\n is widespread across the world.\nThe study also discovered that \nM. lepromatosis\n has retained the genes needed to infect cells of the nervous system called Schwann cells. These produce protective sheaths that wrap around the axons of peripheral neurons. Although Schwann cell infection is a hallmark of \nM. leprae\n leprosy, the presence of related genes in M. lepromatosis means that this bacterium could also be attacking these cells. This will become clearer in future investigations, facilitated in part by the resources generated by this work.\nThis genome-wide comparative study offers new and deeper insights into the biology of \nM. lepromatosis\n. By uncovering the evolutionary history of the two leprosy bacteria, it can open up new ways for developing therapeutic strategies.\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Global Health Institute with the University of Tübingen, the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, and the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León. The work was supported by the Fondation Raoul Follereau and the Swiss National Science Foundation (Brazilian Swiss Joint Research Program).\nReference\nSingh P, Benjak A, Schuenemann VJ, Herbig A, Avanzi C, Busso P, Nieselt K, Krause J, Vera-Cabrera L, Cole ST.\n Insight into the evolution and origin of leprosy bacilli from the genome sequence of \nMycobacterium lepromatosis\n.\nPNAS \n23 March 2015.

{"id": 880, "text": "The mission of E2SWITCH will be to develop an ultra-low power electronic system based on Tunnel FET (TFET) heterostructures built on silicon substrates and exploiting a phenomenon of quantum mechanics for operating at voltages up to five times lower than those of the current standard mobile phone circuit. This is a real challenge, especially in light of the explosive growth in independent functions expected for portable devices of the future. The EPFL is coordinating this new European research project, which involves not only six universities and research institutes, but also the companies IBM, CCS and SCIPROM. The project has been funded for up to 4.3 million euros over 42 months.\n\"Our objective is to make the next generation of transistors, which can still operate at voltages below 0.3 Volts and even as low as 0.1V,\" explained Adrian Ionescu, an EPFL professor and the coordinator of E2SWITCH. At this time, the scaling of the threshold voltage impacts not only the autonomy and energy consumption of electronic appliances, but also their compatibility with new technologies for rechargeable batteries and integrated energy harvesters.\nMobile devices of the type 'smart-hub' (e.g. smart phone or smart watch) will of course be the first components to take advantage of such optimized electronics, which minimize thermal dissipation. But the issue goes beyond this. \"Between 125 and 150 degrees, digital circuits begin to lose their functionality. However, our new technology will not only consume less energy, but will be more stable over a wider temperature range, opening the possibility for more robust applications in the automotive and aerospace fields,\" says the researcher.\n\"Cambridge CMOS sensors (CCS) realises the need for ultra-low power, low voltage sensors solution for future wearable, smartphone and automotive applications. Our core technology is based on CMOS process, and working on E2SWITCH project will promote a natural transition to beyond CMOS technology, where this project will enable us to design ultra-low voltage gas sensing platform devices, and experiment with basic building blocks using TFET solutions to demonstrate low voltage sensor signal conditioning circuits for either gas or temperature sensing applications.\" says Foysol Chowdhury, Director of R & D Projects at Cambridge CMOS Sensors Ltd.\nAnother area that will benefit from this new technology are future computing systems also for cloud and big data applications - huge banks of servers, which represent a growing proportion of global electricity costs - which in the long run could benefit greatly from more energy-efficient technologies. This is one of the key points that motivated IBM to join the consortium.\n“Power dissipation is a fundamental challenge for nanoelectronic circuits. Within E2SWITCH we aim to significantly reduce the power consumption of electronics by researching TFETs based on III-V heterostructure nanowires with wrap-around gate and directly integrated on standard silicon substrates.” says Dr. Heike Riel, IBM Fellow, IBM Research - Zurich.\nOn the academic side, E2SWITCH brings together EPFL, the Universities of Udine and Bologna (Italy), IMEC (Belgium), Forschungszentrum Jülich (Germany), Lund University (Sweden) and ETH Zurich (Switzerland). E2SWITCH is funded under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development of the European Union.

During these four days, 2,300 high school students, mostly from western Switzerland, came to get a clearer picture of courses offered at EPFL.\nWhile the first day focused on fields of study, the second gave the opportunity to young people to immerse themselves in the heart of chosen departments. Two days, indeed, were not too much to make this important decision. According to Maya Fruehauf, who was responsible for organizing this open house for the Department for the Promotion of Education: “The goal is to attract new students who have consciously chosen and who will then begin their studies with strong motivation.”\nThe number of students attending the sessions generally reflects the proportion entering these sections in the first year: architecture and life sciences are the most popular. The number of visitors during these days has been relatively stable for the past three years, consistently exceeding 2,000 visitors, and with a significant percentage of girls (35%).\nOne of the highlights of the day, apparently much appreciated by students, remains the reception in the Rolex Learning Center. The information stands for each department, now gathered in the hall of the SG building, give the chance to create bridges to facilitate discussions between the visitors and students or scientists. EPFL students lead guided tours of small groups to discover the campus.\nThe second day allows the more motivated, which comprise more than 80% of the participants, to become immersed in the atmosphere of a class session, to attend workshops, and meets specialists. Experimenting, seeing the laboratories, asking questions about the material being taught – the second day is all about giving these potential students a “hands on” experience.\n“Statistics of previous years show that half of new students feel that this campus visit determined their choice,” says Maya Fruehauf.

{"id": 883, "text": "After nearly two years of work, “Project Matterhorn,” designed by the thirty students from the EPFL Rocket Team, is ready to compete at the 2018 Spaceport America Cup, which will be held from 19 to 23 June in the New Mexico desert. This competition, which pits teams from universities around the globe against each other, is still not very well known on this side of the Atlantic. This year, only two European teams will take part, one from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) and one from EPFL. Last year, students from these two schools and the School of Business and Engineering Vaud (HEIG-VD) competed together as one team and came in eighth out of the 116 teams taking part.\nFor the competition, teams have to design, build and launch a rocket that can reach a set altitude as accurately as possible. Teams are also evaluated on the ingenuity of their design and the relevance of their payload – a requirement for every rocket. “We’re entered in the 10k commercial category – the one in which the most teams are competing – with an off-the-shelf engine,” says François Martin-Monier, head of sponsoring and advertising for the EPFL Rocket Team.\nA high-tech design\nThe rocket is 2.70 meters long and weighs over 20 kilos. It has a diameter of just 120 mm, so it’s very compact – which meant the students had to overcome a number of engineering challenges just to fit in all the components needed to make the rocket work. The rocket will be launched using solid propellants for four seconds, and the remainder of the flight will be ballistic. “We chose an engine that will take the rocket up to about 500 meters above the target altitude,” says Martin-Monier, who is studying mechanical engineering. “The onboard computer will then deploy the airbrakes to correct the trajectory in order to get as close to an altitude of 3,000 meters as possible. We’ll have to adapt to the conditions on the day, particularly the temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind.”\nFor the payload, the EPFL students chose to integrate a muon detector into their rocket. Equipped with its own recovery system, the device was designed to detect enough muons to calculate the speed at which the probe descends. The rocket’s parachute system is also unique: “Most teams use two parachutes, one to slow the rocket’s initial descent and a second one that is released just before the rocket reaches the ground to stop it cold,” explains Martin-Monier. “We’ve brought all that together in one parachute. At an altitude of 250 meters, a rope system will expand the parachute’s surface area.”\nMore than 70 hours of sewing went into making the different versions of the parachute.©Jonathan Burkhard\nAssistance from the experts\nSince the project began in October 2016, experts from various parts of EPFL have helped the team, including the physics and mechanical engineering departments, the Space Engineering Center (e-Space) and the Swiss Space Center. “Their support has been very useful – they’ve lent us lab equipment, helped us check our calculations and given us constructive feedback on our ideas,” says Martin-Monier. There were even some Bachelor’s and Master’s semester projects relating to the rocket. More than one hundred credits have been awarded because of the project.\nAnd what about 2019?

The goal was to compile all the basic knowledge required for the training of electricians and electronic engineers.\nIt was finally achieved in 1974. Since then, the PPUR has developed enormously, and is today among the most important publishers in French-speaking Switzerland, with nearly 900 titles published and one-and-a-half million books distributed.\nA prestigious university “brand”, the PPUR is also the publishing partner of the Institut national des sciences appliquées – National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) in Lyons, the Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL), and naturally of the universities and engineering colleges (UNIL, IDHEAP, HES, etc.). The PPUR publishes manuals and reference documents in a broad range of disciplines (engineering, architecture, management, etc.) in both French and English, under their imprint EPFL Press. It also successfully edits the Collection le savoir suisse, the equivalent of the well-known Que sais-je? books, of which 69 have been published to date.\nAware of the changes taking place in the world of publishing, the PPUR is among the main francophone publishers to offer an impressive and innovative digital catalog, achieved by leveraging synergies with the CRAFT (Center for Research and Support of Training and its Technologies) and the central library, all three organizations being located in the Rolex Learning Center.\nAn increasing proportion of this catalog is available in eBook format on the Izibook and Numilog platforms, as well as through the use of Google book search.

A new type of microscope developed by EPFL spinoff Nanolive shows users the inner workings of cells, such as banana, blood, onions and amoeba. It was designed for researchers, as it offers better resolution than any other commercially available microscope, and it is so easy to use that it could make the sciences more appealing to young people. In a competition organized as part of the upcoming Planète Santé fair, three local high schools will be given the use of one of the microscopes for several months.\nThe company has already been loaning its microscopes to schools in recent months, including several public and private high schools in the Lake Geneva Region. “We loan the microscopes out to schools not so much to make money but rather to provide a service,” said Lisa Pollaro, the COO of Nanolive. “Our loan program for schools is supported by our partner , which will fund the competition prizes.”\nA growing community of users\n Nanolive offers tutorials that make it easy for everyone to understand how the microscope works. In one of the experiments, users can watch starch turn into sugar in bananas as they ripen. Some banana flesh is placed between two tiny plates of glass. After a few focus adjustments, just like on a conventional microscope, the cells appear on the computer screen. Users can then use a software tool to color in the various components. After identifying the starch molecules, they can examine them in detail.\nNanolive, which is based at EPFL's Innovation Park, offers two other fascinating tutorial experiments: observing amoebas in aquarium water and analyzing the various components in a drop of blood. “Our long-term aim is to come up with experiments that dovetail with the schools' curricula, and to create a community of users who will share their experience online,” says Pollaro.\nUsing the microscope may seem like child’s play, but this is a cutting-edge technology. It is used in research laboratories and universities around the world, including Harvard, Stanford and the Mayo Clinic in the United States, and Riken in Japan. It was developed as part of an EPFL doctoral thesis completed in 2013, and the underlying technology is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It takes photos at different depths in the cell, which it then reassembles using its smart holographic software. The software records the phase and amplitude of the wave refracted by the various parts of the cell, which it can then tint different colors.

The name has also been chosen for the architectural project being developed in EPFL’s Atelier de la conception de l’espace (ALICE) or “Space Conception Workshop” at the invitation of the \nSt Prex Classics\n cultural festival.\nUnder the leadership of Dieter Dietz, the director of ALICE, and with the cooperation of several students of this department, the architects Sibylle Kössler and Sara Formery have designed a space for concerts and dance that can be fully disassembled, and has been designed to fit neatly into the Place de l’Horloge facing the clock tower, the entrance to the medieval town of Saint-Prex. “Ao” has been presented to the press last Tuesday, shortly before the opening concert of the 6th series of the \nSt Prex Classics\n, which lasts until August 28th. “We have created a space that is designed to highlight the medieval town, and which transforms the Grand Rue into a pleasant and animated meeting place, while providing both the performers and the audience at the festival with a comfortable concert venue of high quality” summarizes Dieter Dietz. “We also wanted the project to have a high visibility, without adversely affecting the essence of the old buildings”, he adds.\nA floating dome that protects you from the rain\nThe base of the installation, made entirely of wood, takes its inspiration from the famous theatre of Epidaurus that existed in Greece in the 4th or 3rd century BC, in particular the curve of the tiered seating, opposite the clock tower. The seating can normally hold up to 700 people; this is reduced to 500 when the modular stage is enlarged to accommodate large orchestras or choreography.\nAlthough the medieval façade, including the clock tower, remains one of the main features of the new structure, the most spectacular element is actually to be found above it. A vast hemisphere of helium – 25 meters in diameter and visible for miles around – will float above the “arena” and the village. Its white polyamide envelope can be illuminated from the inside or be used as a screen to display projected images. In case of bad weather, this balloon can be lowered to completely cover the stage and seating area, thus forming a dome. A transparent membrane, tightened around its circumference would then transform the square into a closed concert hall, without however being separated from the old walls.\n“This structure will allow us to continue to use the Old Town, while offering an improved level of comfort to the performers and to larger audiences. The cooperation with EPFL has brought an architectural dimension which measures up to the artistic quality of the \nSt Prex Classics\n, and which truly highlights the location’s historic heritage,” enthuses Hazeline van Swaay, founder of the festival.\n“Ao” can be assembled and dismantled in less than a week. Only part of the equipment, including the balloon, will remain at Saint-Prex. The structures forming the base of the tiered seating and the technical ring will be rented each year to specialized companies.\nJean-Claude Mermoud, head of the Cantonal Department for the Economy, has called the project “a remarkable technological innovation, whose spectacular and symbolic aspect will not fail to attract attention”. Francis-Luc Perret, Vice-President of EPFL and a citizen of Saint-Prex, emphasized “the commitment of our School, which has the good fortune, with its professors and students, to develop research and teaching activities in a region enjoying a very rich and stimulating cultural environment. It can thus demonstrate in multiple ways that technology – while offering concrete and useful solutions, can also be imbued with an artistic, aesthetic and expressive dimension”.\nThe new structure should be ready for the 2012 festival.

{"id": 904, "text": "It all starts with a translucent liquid. Then, as if by magic, darker spots begin to form in the small, spinning container until, barely half a minute later, the finished product takes shape. This groundbreaking 3D-printing method, developed by researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Applied Photonics Devices (LAPD), can be used to make tiny objects with unprecedented precision and resolution – all in record time. The team has published its findings in the journal Nature Communications, and a spin-off, Readily3D, has been set up to develop and market the system.\nThe technology could have innovative applications in a wide range of fields, but its advantages over existing methods – the ability to print solid parts of different textures – make it ideally suited for medicine and biology. The process could be used, for instance, to make soft objects such as tissue, organs, hearing aids and mouthguards.\n“Conventional 3D printing techniques, known as additive manufacturing, build parts layer by layer,” explains Damien Loterie, the CEO of Readily3D. “The problem is that soft objects made that way quickly fall apart.” What’s more, the process can be used to make delicate cell-laden scaffolds in which cells can develop in a pressure-free 3D environment. The researchers teamed up with a surgeon to test 3D-printed arteries made using the technique. “The trial results were extremely encouraging,” says Loterie.\nHardened by light\nThe new technique draws on the principles of tomography, a method used mainly in medical imaging to build a model of an object based on surface scans.\nThe printer works by sending a laser through the translucent gel – either a biological gel or liquid plastic, as required. “It’s all about the light,” explains Paul Delrot, Readily3D’s CTO. “The laser hardens the liquid through a process of polymerization. Depending on what we’re building, we use algorithms to calculate exactly where we need to aim the beams, from what angles, and at what dose.”\nThe system is currently capable of making two-centimeter structures with a precision of 80 micrometers, about the same as the diameter of a strand of hair.

{"id": 905, "text": "Because of its low energy density, natural gas has to be compressed or liquefied, which makes it difficult to integrate into vehicles. A popular solution is to store natural gas inside materials with nano-sized pores, and the search for such is often propelled through governmental targets. In a collaborative study, scientists have simulated over 650,000 designs for nanoporous materials, and propose that the best candidates have already been designed, meeting 70% of the US Department of Energy targets for energy storage and making additional research in this area redundant. The study is published in \nEnergy & Environmental Science\n.\nThe urgency to discover materials that can cost-effectively store methane from natural gas into cars is reflected in governmental targets such as those set by ARPA-e, an organization under the US Department of Energy. The organization wants to find a nanoporous material that can store methane with the same energy density of compressed natural gas, and do so at a lower pressure, applicable to car fuel tanks.\nA computer simulation study led by EPFL and the University of California at Berkeley now suggests the best materials have already been found, and can store a maximum of 220 units of methane, which amounts to 70% of the ARPA-e target. The scientists built structure models of 650,000 different materials on the computer and rapidly prototyped them for natural gas storage using molecular simulations. These included the materials that are currently intensely explored in the field.\nThe scientists used the building blocks of these materials and let computers generate novel materials systematically. The performance of these materials was predicted using advanced molecular simulation techniques that were specifically developed to run on processors used in computer games with heavy graphics.\nThe analysis showed that it may be difficult, if not impossible, to reach the ARPA-e target for natural gas storage using nanoporous materials. Specifically, the study suggests that those targets are unrealistically high, and it predicts that the best nanoporous materials can reach an energy density up to 70% of compressed natural gas. “Of course, an interesting question that this work raises is whether one can derive such a radical conclusion based on computer simulations alone,” says Berend Smit, one of the lead researchers and Director of EPFL’s Energy Center.\nThis means that research groups around the world have already found the best nanoporous materials for methane storage. “We feel that future experimental efforts to improve this target will be a waste of time since the ARPA-e target is impossible to reach,” says Smit. “Even if we find a material that is a few percent better, it will be nowhere close to the original target.”\nThe scientists hope that their findings will prevent what might be an unnecessary research effort. As Smit explains: “We always hope that someone will discover a novel chemistry method that can reach this target, but 70% is already a major step forward and may very well be also interesting from a commercial point of view.”\nThis work represents a collaboration between EPFL, the University of California at Berkeley, Rice University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.\nReference\nSimon C, Kim J, Gomez-Gualdron D, Camp J, Chung YG, Martin RL, Mercado R, Deem MW, Gunter D, Haranczyk M, Sholl D, Snurr RQ Smit B. \nT\nhe Materials Genome in Action: Identifying the Performance Limits for Methane Storage.\nEnergy Environ.

They will soon be on the market in the treatment of breast cancer thanks to their effect on the DNA repair of cancer cells. But researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physiology of Integrated Systems, supported by scientists from the Universities of Debrecen (HUN), Strasbourg (FRA) and Weill-Cornell (USA) have discovered their effect on cell metabolism. This discovery makes it possible to envisage the use of this treatment for diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, or other metabolism disorders. Similarly, it paves the way for a new range of drugs for the treatment of other types of cancer. The findings obtained by Johan Auwerx and his team are the subject of two articles published in the April edition of Cell Metabolism.\n Cancer cells have the property of using glucose as an energy source instead of burning fatty acids. The scientists have noticed that Paribs enable their metabolism to be modified so that they begin to use them. This has the effect of weakening them and therefore stopping the progression of the cancer. The cells of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, obesity or oxidation disorders share this characteristic of running on glucose. Health problems associated with the oxidation of fatty acids affect one newborn child in 3000. These troubles can result in muscular lesions, in particular of the heart, if the child does not follow a very strict and demanding diet all her life.\n The role of Paribs is to modify the level of enzymes called PARP1. Mice which had these enzymes removed, genetically or by administering a drug, present biological signs of activation of a specific protein. As a result, the mitochondria responsible for transforming the molecules from food into energy for the cell function more efficiently. They use fatty acids instead of glucose and the protection against metabolic diseases is thereby increased. And there are other types of PARP enzymes whose quantity can potentially be modified. These findings therefore, open the way for new drugs that could be used to treat other forms of cancer and metabolic diseases. According to Johan Auwerx: “It is likely that, five years from now, treatments that target PARP will be part of the basic prophylaxic treatment for every type of cancer”.", "summary": "A new group of anti-cancer drugs may also provide a treatment for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity or fatty-acid oxidation disorders.

{"id": 908, "text": "One indicator that a cancer has started to develop is the presence of biomarkers. These are molecules that are produced by the cancer and pass into the bloodstream.\nResearchers at EPFL's Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI/STI) have developed a new type of sensor that can detect tiny quantities of these markers and thus improve diagnostic accuracy. The sensor comes in the form of a tiny wire and is ten times more sensitive than any other biosensor ever realized. It is therefore capable of detecting cancer at a very early stage so that patients can receive better treatment. The researchers' work has been published in \nNano Letters\n.\nAn electrical component with a memory\n When doctors suspect that a patient has cancer, they look for biomarkers in their body. But it's not easy to detect these molecules in very small quantities – blood is a very dense fluid, full of molecules and cells that get in the way.\nEPFL researchers have managed to get around this obstacle by inventing a new detection technique. The trick is to trap the molecules of interest by the blood sample and then detect them in a dry environment, where measurements won’t be disturbed by all the molecules. To do this, the researchers used a Memristor – a new electrical component that can “remember” all the electrical currents that pass through it. The device has been successfully tested on the biomarker for prostate cancer, known as the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA).\nA nanowire, DNA fragments and an electric current\n To begin with, fragments of modified DNA are grafted onto a silicon nanowire. The DNA is used to trap the molecules. It is modified so that it traps only the biomarkers for prostate cancer.\nThe wire is dipped into a cancer sample for close to an hour, giving the DNA time to get hold of the molecules. It is then dried and an electric charge is first sent through it. If there are molecules on the wire, they create resistance, which alters the wire's conductivity in places. But this alone is not enough to accurately detect the biomarkers.\nIt is only when the same charge is sent through the wire a second time in the opposite direction that the molecules can be properly detected. \"If the wire had no memory, the two currents' curves would be superimposed, which means there's no memory effect,\" said Sandro Carrara, from the Integrated Systems Lab.\nIf the right biomarkers are trapped at the wire surface, then at the exact spot where the current reverse during the phases of sending charges into the wire, there will be a difference in the curve known as a voltage gap. It is this phenomenon that makes it possible to detect the biomarkers with so high sensitivity together with the use of modified DNA to trap the biomarkers.\n\"It's the first time a Memristor has been used to make such type of biosensor,\" said Carrara.\nFor now, the technique has only been used to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer. But it could be used for all types of markers. \"We are also working with the Ludwig Institute and the CHUV hospital, which are providing us with samples and tumor extracts. Our next step is to use the same technique to detect breast cancer.\"\n-----\nProject partners:\nExperimental Oncology Group, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (Lausanne)\n Senology Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, CHUV hospital (Lausanne)\n Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Bath (United Kingdom)\n Department of Informatics and Microsystem Technology, University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern, Zweibrücken (Germany)\nReference:", "summary": "EPFL researchers have used a nanowire to detect prostate cancer with greater accuracy than ever before.

{"id": 923, "text": "Plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe, found mostly in stars and the intergalactic space. However, plasma is widely used in industry to serve a surprising number of everyday applications, including solar cells, fluorescent lights, display screens, and even air-tight food packaging. Despite its enormous benefits, exploiting the properties of plasma can be difficult and can cause problems for manufacturers. One common problem is the formation of plasmoids – localized intense plasma that can spontaneously ignite and damage the plasma reactor, incurring high repair costs and manufacturing downtime. Publishing in Plasma Sources Science and Technology, EPFL scientists have discovered how plasmoids form and propagate, and offer possible solutions for industrial applications.\nPlasma is essentially a hot gas whose molecules become ionized, that is, they turn into charged particles. Though abundant in the universe, on earth natural plasma is limited to lightning bolts, flames, and auroras. However, artificially maintaining plasma is difficult because plasmas readily react with molecules of other materials, and therefore require a vacuum. At the same time, it is exactly this high reactivity that makes plasmas so useful in industrial manufacturing applications, such as metallurgy, plasma spraying and coating, microelectronics etching, metal cutting and welding and even in aerospace engineering.\nHowever, plasma technologies are not without problems. One of them involves the specialized reactors that are used to create and confine plasmas. Given the high temperatures involved in plasma generation, it easy to cause damage to the reactor’s structure. One common problem is the formation of plasmoids, which are intense localized plasmas that can ignite spontaneously and, if not stopped immediately, can melt and destroy reactor components. Plasmoid damage can put a reactor out of commission for a long time, requiring expensive repairs and costly losses in production.\nA team led by Christoph Hollenstein at  has now shown that plasmoids work like a funnel for an intense electrical current. In effect, when a plasmoid forms, it transports electrons through to the reverse side of the reactor’s grid, which is meant to contain the plasma. The study focused on industrial-type plasmas, which are generated with a power supply that runs at a radio frequency (13.56 MHz). The researchers found that plasmoids are actually sustained by this radio-frequency power supply, forming a positive plasma potential on both sides of the reactor’s grid. It is this funneling of electrical current that can cause strong heating of the plasmoid and subsequent damage to the reactor’s components.\nThe research team used a small plasma reactor specifically designed to generate plasmoids that could be observed. By creating several such plasmoids, the scientists were able to study what causes a plasmoid and how it propagates to the point where multiple plasmoids can appear, risking severe damage to the reactor’s structure. The study also demonstrated that the ignition of plasmoids is confined in a small point, meaning that the density of the electrical current that passes through the ‘funnel’ is very high. The authors suggest that this is why the occurring plasmoid can cause such damage.\n\"By discovering the physics behind plasmoid formation, we can propose strategies for plasma industry to suppress them”, says author Alan Howling. By regulating the plasmoid-forming mechanisms of their reactors, manufacturers can minimize or prevent plasmoids altogether.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have uncovered the physics behind the formation of plasmoids – funnel-like, high-energy plasmas that can severely damage industrial plasma reactors, causing millions in repairs and lost productivity in plasma technologies like those used to make display screens and even food containers.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have uncovered the physics behind the formation of plasmoids – funnel-like, high-energy plasmas that can severely damage industrial plasma reactors, causing One in repairs and lost productivity in plasma technologies like those used to make display screens and even food containers.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 29], "noise": false}
{"id": 925, "text": "The future is looking good for drugs designed to combat Alzheimer’s disease. EPFL scientists have unveiled how two classes of drug compounds currently in clinical trials work to fight the disease. Their research suggests that these compounds target the disease-causing peptides with high precision and with minimal side-effects. At the same time, the scientists offer a molecular explanation for early-onset hereditary forms of Alzheimer’s, which can strike as early as thirty years of age. The conclusions of their research, which has been published in the journal Nature Communications, are very encouraging regarding the future of therapeutic means that could keep Alzheimer’s disease in check.\n Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by an aggregation of small biological molecules known as amyloid peptides. We all produce these molecules; they play an essential antioxidant role. But in people with Alzheimer’s disease, these peptides aggregate in the brain into toxic plaques – called “amyloid plaques” – that destroy the surrounding neurons. \n The process starts with a long protein, “APP”, which is located across the neuron’s membrane. This protein is cut into several pieces by an enzyme, much like a ribbon is cut by scissors. The initial cut generates a smaller intracellular protein that plays a useful role in the neuron. Another cut releases the rest of APP outside the cell – this part is the amyloid peptide. \n For reasons not yet well understood, APP protein can be cut in several different places, producing amyloid peptides that are of varying lengths. Only the longer forms of the amyloid peptide carry the risk of aggregating into plaques, and people with Alzheimer’s disease produce an abnormally high number of these.\nA favorite Alzheimer’s target: gamma secretase\nThe two next-generation classes of compound that are currently in clinical trials target an enzyme that cuts APP, known as gamma secretase. Until now, our understanding of the mechanism involved has been lacking. But with this work, the EPFL researchers were able to shed some more light on it by determining how the drug compounds affect gamma secretase and its cutting activity. \n In most forms of Alzheimer’s, abnormally large quantities of the long amyloid peptide 42 – named like that because it contains 42 amino acids – are formed. The drug compounds change the location where gamma secretase cuts the APP protein, thus producing amyloid peptide 38 instead of 42, which is shorter and does not aggregate into neurotoxic plaques. \n Compared to previous therapeutic efforts, this is considerable progress. In 2010, Phase III clinical trials had to be abandoned, because the compound being tested inhibited gamma-secretase’s function across the board, meaning that the enzyme was also deactivated in essential cellular differentiation processes, resulting to side-effects like in gastrointestinal bleeding and skin cancer. \n “Scientists have been trying to target gamma secretase to treat Alzheimer’s for over a decade,” explains Patrick Fraering, senior author on the study and Merck Serono Chair of Neurosciences at EPFL. “Our work suggests that next-generation molecules, by modulating rather than inhibiting the enzyme, could have few, if any, side-effects. It is tremendously encouraging.”\nNew insights into hereditary forms of the disease\nDuring their investigation, the scientists also identified possible causes behind some hereditary forms of Alzheimer’s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer’s can appear as early as thirty years of age, with a life expectancy of only a few years. In vitro experiments and numerical simulations show that in early-onset patients, mutations in the APP protein gene modify the way by which APP is cut by the gamma-secretase enzyme. This results in overproduction of amyloid peptide 42, which then aggregates into amyloid plaques. \n This research illuminates much that is unknown about Alzheimer’s disease. “We have obtained extraordinary knowledge about how gamma secretase can be modulated,” explains co-author Dirk Beher, scientific chief officer of Asceneuron, a spin-off of Merck Serono, the biopharmaceutical division of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. “This knowledge will be invaluable for developing even better targeted drugs to fight the disease.”", "summary": "Next-generation drugs designed to fight Alzheimer’s disease look very promising.

The startup focuses on one of the major challenges faced by the electronics industry: high-speed, low-power connectivity inside and between devices. Its advances have already led to the revision of several industry standards.\nMore than 300 patents in its arsenal\nThe company, which was created in 2011, develops IT components that improve the speed and reliability of communications between electronic devices while keeping their energy consumption to a minimum. So far it has marketed its systems through licenses but is now planning to draw on its portfolio of some 300 patents to launch a series of products for consumer applications.\nThis latest round of fundraising was crucial. It will allow the company to market an important component for the development of USB-C plugs that are compatible with the new USB4 specification. That specification was published on 3 September at the USB Implementers Forum, a group of companies – including multinationals Microsoft, Intel, IBM and HP – that is in charge of keeping specifications such as this one up to date. Under the USB4 specification, data transfer capacity will double, meaning that USB-C plugs will be able to handle two \n4K UHD resolution screens with a 60 Hz refresh rate, charge laptop batteries quickly and improve video processing significantly.\n “This market is huge,” says Amin Shokrollahi, Kandou’s founder and CEO. He is not exaggerating: the new plugs, which will be compatible with previous USB versions, will be everywhere, including laptops, external hard drives, screens and video game consoles.\n“In laboratory tests, our initial prototypes designed for USB-C plugs proved to be extremely fast while consuming very little power,” notes Shokrollahi, who is also a professor at EPFL. Kandou’s product could hit the market as early as summer 2020. This is excellent timing for the company, since new and revised standards can take several years to implement.\nUpping the ante in the microelectronics industry\nThe work done by Shokrollahi, who specializes in information and signal theory, and Harm Cronie, a former postdoc, led to the invention of Chord™ signaling.

The winners receive no monetary reward but get a considerable boost to their reputation and visibility.\nA platform for managing fleets of self-driving cars \nBestmile (#7 last year) developed a platform that lets transportation operators manage autonomous vehicles alongside conventional ones, while ensuring pedestrian safety. Its cloud-based platform uses a series of smart algorithms that allow users to manage car fleets, optimize vehicle use, provide fixed-route and on-demand services, and even monitor power consumption.\nThe company was established in 2014, and this year raised €10 million in funding that will be used to roll out its platform in dense urban areas in Japan, Dubai and Singapore. Bestmile was also named one of the 2018 Technology Pioneers at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nFaster and more reliable tumor diagnoses \nLunaphore, also founded in 2014, provides a microfluidic system that enables fast, reliable diagnoses of tumor cells. The company hopes to drastically increase the number of biomarker tests that can be carried out for each type of tumor. In August it completed a CHF 5.3 million fundraising round, on the heels of a CHF 6 million round in 2017; the proceeds will be used to help launch its first product on the market.\nTwo other EPFL spin-offs were in the top ten: Gamaya and Flyability. The former makes a hyperspectral camera that can be used with a drone and special software to detect the condition of farmers’ crops and suggest targeted treatments. The latter has developed a drone with a unique lightweight cage around it that lets it bounce off obstacles rather than avoiding them. That means Flyability’s drones can explore areas that are dangerous or impossible for humans to reach. Both startups have carried out several successful fundraising rounds.\nMore women in the C-Suite \nAs mentioned in the official press release, this year more women appear in the winning startups’ management teams. In fact, every one of the top three startups – including Bestmile and Lunaphore – was co-founded by a woman.\nThe winning startups – which must be less than five years old – were chosen by a panel of 100 investors and startup experts. Each panel member drew up a list of his or her ten favorite firms based on their market potential, and gave ten points to the top firm on the list, nine points to the second firm on the list, and so on. The points assigned by all the panel members were added up to come up with the final ranking.

{"id": 949, "text": "The MOBiLus consortium has won the call for proposals issued by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) to create a Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) in the field of “Urban Mobility.” MOBiLus – which will be known as EIT Urban Mobility as of 1 January 2019 – brings together 48 partner organizations including EPFL to design, build and implement novel systems for making city transportation more sustainable. Its total research budget is €1.6 billion over seven years (2019–2026); this EU funding will provide €400 million of that, helping make it one of the largest publicly funded initiatives for urban transportation in the world.\nThe consortium dates back to 2015 when four engineering schools – EPFL, the Technical University of Denmark, the Eindhoven University of Technology and the Technical University of Munich – teamed up to create the EuroTech Universities Alliance. “What sets MOBiLus apart is our focus on urban spaces. Our primary strategic objective is to design city transportation systems that enhance these spaces so that they contribute to residents’ quality of life. Everything else stems from that goal,” says Simone Amorosi, deputy director of EPFL’s TRACE Transportation Center and EPFL’s representative in the call for proposals.\nEight challenges\nThe consortium will set out to address eight challenges: sustainable urban growth; transportation network decongestion; interdisciplinary talent; eco-efficient and safe urban transport; data exploitation; mobility industry competition; regulatory and behavioral change; and urban governance. “This is a highly ambitious research initiative that will transform cities and make them more livable,” says Olivier Küttel, head of International Affairs at EPFL and a member of the consortium’s steering committee.\nEIT Urban Mobility will be headquartered in Barcelona and comprise 11 universities, 7 non-academic research organizations, 17 businesses, 13 cities and a wider additional network of 39 affiliated organizations. Their efforts will be pooled to leverage new innovation instruments in what the EIT calls the “knowledge triangle” of research centers, universities and businesses. More specifically, EIT Urban Mobility will use the EU funding to promote educational, industrial and R&D projects carried out by its member organizations in accordance with the consortium’s strategy. City planners will play a key role in the consortium’s approach – undoubtedly a plus in its winning bid.\nTRACE was established in 2010 to coordinate joint research between EPFL labs and public- and private-sector organizations. The center now has 150 projects completed or under way, and it has a clear idea of the in-kind contribution that EPFL can make to EIT Urban Mobility research projects. This type of contribution is essential because the amount of funding allocated to specific projects depends on the in-kind contributions made by the project partners. In the case of EPFL, these contributions are usually journal articles.\nA unique skill set\nEPFL – the only Swiss member of the consortium – brings a unique set of skills to the table, as it is one of the few research institutions to incorporate sociological issues into studies of urban transportation. Some 40 labs at the school work in transportation-related fields ranging from traffic modelling and data analysis to human-computer interaction, infrastructure, materials science, connected vehicles and robotics.\nAbout EIT Urban Mobility\n In addition to the consortium’s core universities, the other schools involved in the initiative are Technion (which will join the EuroTech Alliance on 1 January 2019), Aalto University, the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, University College London, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Czech Technical University and Polytechnic University of Catalonia.

{"id": 958, "text": "By organizing the passage of digital data through a router almost in real time, one can improve the quality of a wireless network. This is accomplished by an algorithm developed by an EPFL PhD student: it tells the data which route to follow. Currently neighboring wireless networks often borrow the same frequency bands and create caps, while other routes remain free. This new system allows better distribution of these packets and thus improves traffic flow. Disadvantages such as slow downloading, untimely cuts in service and slow communication are thereby greatly reduced.\nIn an urban environment where each home has its own wireless access point, delays caused by interference between networks are frequent. The frequency band, or the route through which the data passes, is divided into 13 channels. Routers are programmed so that data travels along some of them. Numerous devices – about one in four – use the same slot. However, when more access points using the same channels are nearby, this creates interference. It follows the same principle as traffic jams that occur when all cars are forced to use the same lane on a highway.\nRouters can use up to eight of these frequency bands simultaneously. To send an email or perform a simple search in a search engine, for example, one or two bands will suffice. This is the genius of the system developed by Julien Herzen, a PhD student at EPFL’s Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory. It automatically shares the channels between different users based on needs at a specific moment.\nAt regular intervals, the system redistributes pathways according to users’ needs. The width of the frequency band is not determined in advance. “It’s about compromise,” emphasizes the doctoral student. “This works best if everyone is using it, but the impact is also positive for a single user.

Two EPFL startups, L.E.S.S. and Flyability, made the podium, while four others also finished in the top ten. A total of 27 companies from French-speaking Switzerland – most of them linked to EPFL – were included in this ranking.\nOptical fibers for the auto industry\nThe top finisher was Zurich-based Ava, which developed bracelets that show a woman the most fertile days in her menstrual cycle.

{"id": 988, "text": "Today’s rising CO\n2\n emissions are changing oceans’ pH levels, making them more acidic. We can already see the harmful effects in the coral reefs. Yet other chemical processes – whose environmental impact is not fully known – are also being affected. A  suggested that ocean acidification is lowering the rate at which nitrous oxide (N\n2\nO), an ozone-depleting greenhouse gas (also known as laughing gas), is being produced naturally. Based on this study, it was thought that acidification decreases the natural production rate of N\n2\nO. However, new research conducted jointly by scientists at EPFL, Tokyo Institute of Technology and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) has discovered that the process appears to work the other way around, as well.\nThe research team took measurements in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Japan, between 2013 and 2016. They discovered that in the subarctic region of the Pacific – near Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands – the water’s lower pH is causing a significant increase in N2O production. Moreover, they concluded that if pH levels keep falling at the current rate, or 0.0051 units/year – assuming there is no decrease in CO\n2\n emissions – the N\n2\nO production rate in that part of the Pacific could rise by 185% to 491% by 2100. And the greenhouse gas effect of N\n2\nO is 298 times greater than that of CO\n2\n. The study has just been published in \nNature Climate Change\n. \nThe scientists collected samples at five different sites off the coast of Japan, from the subarctic region to the subtropical region. Then they lowered the samples’ pH levels, triggering the natural process whereby microbes in the water convert ammonium into nitrate, which generates N\n2\nO as a by-product. The samples showed a decrease in the ammonium-to-nitrate conversion rate, as in the \nPNAS \nstudy, but also an increase in N\n2\nO production. This difference may be due to the impact of pH on the biochemical mechanisms associated with N\n2\nO production.\n“Our study provides additional proof that rising CO2 emissions are disrupting natural biogeochemical cycles, which are highly sensitive to changes in the environment. However, our conclusions are valid only for the part of the Pacific that we examined. Additional research is needed to see whether the same process is occurring in other parts of the world,” says Florian Breider, the study’s lead author and head of EPFL’s Central Environmental Laboratory (CEL).\nBreider, who is a biogeochemist by training and a lecturer at EPFL, believes that by developing models of this process that take into account all environmental variables, scientists could obtain important information for orienting future research. And he suggests that the models address other compounds besides N\n2\nO, since many processes are still unknown. “Our study shows that under the right conditions, one greenhouse gas can increase the production of another, more damaging one. So it’s essential that we keep conducting research in this area,” says Breider.", "summary": "The acidification of the Pacific Ocean in northern Japan is increasing the natural production rate of N\n2\nO, an ozone-depleting greenhouse gas.

After the BlueGene/L, installed in 2005, then the BlueGene/P, which entered service in 2009, the latest addition to the range of IBM supercomputers, the BlueGene/Q, assumed its place at EPFL last November. After undergoing a series of tests, it has been operational since January 28, and has been made available to researchers from EPFL and the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL) through the consortium CADMOS (Center for Advanced Modeling Science), the Geneva center for high performance computing shared by these three institutions.\nWith this new tool, research on complex systems, such as the brain, the climate, or the Earth’s surface, can soar to new heights. Medical research can also benefit by improving treatments for certain illnesses such as cerebral aneurisms.\nWith 1024 computation nodes, the BlueGene/Q has a calculation power of 172.7 teraflops, which means it can do 172,000 billion operations per second. That is four times more than the functioning capacity of BlueGene/P thus far. It is also much smaller, given that it fits in a single cabinet, whereas its predecessor required four. Twenty-five BlueGene/Q are already operational around the world. However, the one from Lake Geneva has a mass storage management system (2.2 petabytes) that is unique in the world today.\nDespite its great power, the BlueGene/Q requires very little energy. Water-cooled, it consumes only 82.2 kilowatts of electricity, the energy equivalent of a mere one-hundred household coffeemakers working continuously. This excellent energy efficiency places it in tenth position in the list of the world’s greenest supercomputers.\nFrom the brain and medical research to the Rhône\nAs the issues scientists face become increasingly complex, their resolution requires ever higher computational power. Twenty teams can leverage the capabilities of BlueGene/Q to make great headway with their research.\nAmong potential supercomputer users are the EPFL plasma physics research center at EPFL. Also, geophycisists of UNIL are trying to simulate the physics involved in plate tectonics. Furthermore, computer scientists of the University of Geneva (UNIGE) are modeling the Rhône River between Geneva and Verbois in an effort to better understand how sediments are deposited. But potential users also include climatologists, astrophysicists, or even experts in biology and computational chemistry who need powerful computers to process large amounts data. Let us not forget the mathematicians who build simulation models of the heart and arteries to predict diseases of the circulatory system.\nBiomedical research, too, could benefit greatly from this supercomputer. This includes notable research by oncologists at UNIL, as well as by researchers at UNIGE who simulate the process of thrombosis in cerebral aneurisms. Their goal is not only to understand biomechanical phenomena at work, but also to help doctors propose the most appropriate treatment for each patient.\nThe acquisition of BlueGene/Q furthermore enables the CADMOS consortium to consolidate its expertise in the field of this family of IBM supercomputers and for scientists of the Lake Geneva region to expand their acquired competencies in scientific calculation. Thereby they will be ready for the next big step, “exa-scale,” which will complete about one billion billion operations per second.

{"id": 993, "text": "Dozens of balloon-borne radiosondes are released into the atmosphere every day. They measure temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and wind direction at different altitudes before eventually falling back to earth. In most cases, this high-tech equipment is never recovered. But a group of five EPFL students,* studying either environmental sciences or physics, could change all that. For their Bachelor’s project, they developed a system that can help guide the radiosonde’s trajectory as it falls to earth so that it can be found and reused. Through a single test flight from the roof of a campus building, they proved the feasibility of their concept.\nRadiosondes are carried aloft by giant helium-filled weather balloons that expand as they rise through the air – in some cases to an altitude of 30 kilometers – until they eventually pop. A small parachute attached to the onboard equipment automatically opens once the maximum altitude has been reached, preventing the radiosondes from causing damage when they touch down.\nThe students’ focused their attention on the parachute release. “Our system controls the exposed surface area of the parachute, directing the radiosonde towards air currents that will guide it to an accessible landing spot,” says Hugo Cruz, a student in Environmental Sciences and Engineering. His classmate Lorenzo Donadio adds: “The main thing is to make sure the radiosonde doesn’t end up on the side of a mountain, at the bottom of a lake or in some no man's land.”\nTheir parachute system is fully automated and run by computer code that the students wrote themselves. It is triggered as soon as the radiosonde starts to fall: a small motor lets out the parachute cords and reels them back in to control the speed of descent. The radiosonde can thus be navigated to an air current that will take it in the desired direction. The system uses up-to-date weather data along with GPS coordinates that are refreshed every 30 seconds relative to a reference point. A tracking device is used to pinpoint where the radiosonde lands.\nAs light as possible\nThe students’ invention, while practical and clever, faced some hurdles. For starters, their parachute system had to be able to withstand all sorts of weather, including extremely high winds. It also had to be as light as possible so that the radiosonde could be easily redirected while freefalling. This seriously limited the instruments and materials that they could use. “We also had to master a number of concepts that we had never studied before, especially in computer science and physics,” says Julie Reznicek, an environmental engineering student.\nThey did a single trial run of their system this past spring, flying their weather balloon to an altitude of around 10,000 meters above Lake Geneva as planned. The equipment was then recovered in a field in Epalinges, just north of Lausanne. While the mechanism used to release and retract the cords worked well, the students noted that the microcontroller lacked the power it needed to record all the data.

With these simple items, around 30 students were schooled in the basics of aerodynamics and space engineering, nothing less.

The group, divided into ten teams, launched their rockets at noon on Friday, 5 June from the fields at the UNIL-EPFL sports centre. The rockets were judged on three criteria: cost, altitude and flight time.\nAll the rockets reached an altitude of 100 to 123 meters, whether following a straight or slightly sinusoidal path. The only mishap came when three rockets lost their parachute, which was meant to ensure a soft landing. The winning rocket reached an altitude of 115 meters and stayed aloft for over 33 seconds.\n“The competition is a fun way to generate interest in space technologies and show that this field is more accessible than one might think,” said Simon Dandavino, a scientist at eSpace and the event organiser. Some thirty students signed up. All the teams came from EPFL apart from a team of four high school students with a passion for technology. “Unfortunately there were no girls!” said Dandavino. “They’re still pretty underrepresented in this field.”\nSolid display of skills\nThe event gave the teams an opportunity to put their heads together on a fun project. But in the end it was a real engineering competition requiring solid math skills and a keen practical sense.\nThe participants were guided throughout the whole process by the experience of the event’s Technical Director, Nickolay Mullin. At the start of the competition, they had one hour to prepare and submit their rocket design. Each team had an equal amount of RocketCoins, or credits, allowing them to purchase the materials needed for their rocket. Before the materials could be selected, however, the teams had to carry out rapid but very precise calculations to assess the impact that various shapes of nose cones and ailerons would have on the stability, trajectory and height of the flight and to estimate how the choice of cardboard or polystyrene foam, for example, would affect the outcome. The teams also had to take a number of factors into account – such as weight, tube length and engine power – in order to pinpoint the centre of mass, which had to be above the centre of thrust.\n“The students became familiar with some core concepts of aerodynamics, which also apply to the design of large rockets,” said Dandavino.

{"id": 997, "text": "Embedded memories play a crucial role in running our digital devices, from computers and smartphones all the way to the internet of things and entire telecom networks. In fact, embedded memory is what takes up most of the silicon surface inside those systems. Manufacturers are therefore looking for ways to shrink the amount of space that embedded memory takes up, so that they can develop devices that are smaller, cheaper and more powerful. A team of researchers from EPFL and Bar Ilan University (BIU) in Israel have taken a major step in that direction with a novel design that slashes the amount of silicon needed for a given amount of storage by 50%, while reducing the power requirement at the same time. They have already obtained seven patents for their work and are in the process of creating a startup, RAAAM, to market their technology to semiconductor-industry heavyweights.\nThe trick is using fewer transistors\nEmbedded memories work through a series of transistors that act like switches; a single chip can hold billions of transistors. The system developed by the EPFL and BIU researchers arranges the transistors in a different way that uses shortcuts to save a considerable amount of space and energy. Their memory – called GC-eDRAM – needs only two or three transistors to store a bit of data, compared with six or eight in conventional SRAM. That frees up space on chips to add more memory, or to make them smaller so there’s more room for other components. It also reduces the amount of power needed to process a given amount of data.\nThe embedded memory from RAAAM © 2020 Alain Herzog\nOver the past decade there have been major advancements in computing logic but no revolutionary developments in embedded memories. “Chip components have become a lot smaller, but in terms of the fundamentals, they’re pretty much the same,” says Andreas Burg, a professor at EPFL’s Telecommunications Circuits Laboratory and one of RAAAM’s founders. Other types of eDRAM are already on the market, “but they aren’t used widely in the semiconductor industry because they aren’t compatible with standard chip-fabrication processes. They require special fabrication steps that are complex and costly,” says Robert Giterman, a postdoc researcher at EPFL and CEO of RAAAM. The GC-eDRAM his team developed is just as small and powerful as other types, but it can be easily integrated into standard processes.\nTechnology that’s already been proven\nThe team has already worked with top-tier semiconductor manufacturers to test their GC-eDRAM, running trials on 16 nm to 180 nm chips containing around a dozen integrated circuits with an embedded memory capacity of up to 1 Mb. “Manufacturers can replace the existing memory on their chips with ours, without having to change anything else,” says Burg from the School of Engineering at EPFL.\nThe startup plans to sell its technology through license agreements. According to Giterman, “our denser embedded memories will let manufacturers cut costs considerably.” RAAAM’s founders – all experts in embedded memory systems – believe their technology can capture a significant share of the hefty embedded memory market. And they aren’t the only ones optimistic about the young firm’s prospects: RAAAM is one of the winners of this year’s >>venture>> awards, in the Industrials & Engineering category.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and Bar Ilan University have developed a new type of embedded memory that takes up half as much space as traditional memory – and uses less energy – to store a given amount of data.

{"id": 998, "text": "Optical fibers carry data in the form of pulses of light over distances of thousands of miles at amazing speeds. They are one of the glories of modern telecommunications technology. However, their capacity is limited, because the pulses of light need to be lined up one after the other in the fiber with a minimum distance between them so the signals don't interfere with each other. This leaves unused empty space in the fiber.\nEPFL's Camille Brès and Luc Thévenaz have come up with a method for fitting pulses together within the fibers, thereby reducing the space between pulses. Their approach, which has been published in Nature Communications, makes it possible to use all the capacity in an optical fiber. This opens the door to a ten-fold increase in throughput in our telecommunications systems.\nFiber optics at a crossroads\n \"Since it appeared in the 1970s, the data capacity of fiber optics has increased by a factor of ten every four years, driven by a constant stream of new technologies,\" says Camille Brès, of the Photonics Systems Laboratory (PHOSL). \"But for the last few years we've hit a sort of ceiling, and scientists all over the world are trying to break through.\"\nThere have been several different approaches to the problem of supplying more throughput to respond to growing consumer demand, but they often require changes to the fibers themselves. That would entail pulling out and replacing the existing infrastructure. Here, the EPFL team took a different approach, looking at the fundamental issue of how to process the light itself, i.e., how best to generate the pulses that carry the digital data. This approach would not entail a need to replace the entire optical fiber network. Only the transmitters would need to be changed.\nTraffic problems on the information superhighway\n In modern telecommunications exchanges, for example when two cell-phones are communicating with each other, the data are transported between the two antennae on optical fibers, by means of a series of light pulses that form codes.\n Simply put, an \"on\" pulse corresponds to the number 1, while an \"off\" pulse corresponds to 0. The messages are thus sets of ones and zeros. These codes are decoded by the receiver, providing the initial message. The problem with this system is that the volume of data transmitted at one time can't be increased. If the pulses get too close together, they no longer deliver the data reliably. \"There needs to be a certain distance between each pulse, so they don't interfere with each other,\" says Luc Thévenaz, of EPFL's Fiber Optics Group (GFO). However, the EPFL team noticed that changes in the shape of the pulses could limit the interference.\nPulses that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle\n Their breakthrough is based on a method that can produce what are known as \"Nyquist sinc pulses\" almost perfectly. \"These pulses have a shape that's more pointed, making it possible to fit them together, a little bit like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle lock together,\" says Camille Brès. \"There is of course some interference, but not at the locations where we actually read the data.\"\nThe first to \"solve\" the puzzle\n The idea of putting pulses together like a puzzle to boost optic fibers' throughput isn't new. However, the \"puzzle\" had never been \"solved\" before: despite attempts using sophisticated and costly infrastructures, nobody had managed to make it work accurately enough - until now. The EPFL team used a simple laser and modulator to generate a pulse that is more than 99% perfect.\nFine-tuning the system\n Practically speaking, the shape of pulse is determined by its spectrum. In this case, in order to be able to generate the \"jigsaw puzzle,\" the spectrum needs to be rectangular. This means that all the frequencies in the pulse need to be of the same intensity. Professors Brès and Thévenaz had this in mind when modulating their lasers.\nSimple lasers are generally made up essentially of just one color - i.e., one optical frequency - with a very narrow spectrum. This is rather like a violin that has only one string. However, a laser can be subtly modulated (using a device called a modulator) so that it has other colors/frequencies. The result is a pulse composed of several different colors, with a larger spectrum. The problem is that the pulse's main color generally still tends to be more intense than the others. This means the spectrum won't have the rectangular shape needed. For that, each color in the pulse needs to be of the same intensity, rather like getting the strings of a violin to vibrate with the same force, but without making any other strings nearby vibrate.\nThe team thus made a series of subtle adjustments based on a concept known as a \"frequency comb\" and succeeded in generating pulses with almost perfectly rectangular spectrum. This constitutes a real breakthrough, since the team has succeeded in producing the long-sought-after \"Nyquist sinc pulses.\" Professor Thévenaz recounts how it all started: \"Camille and I were talking with a Visiting Professor at the University of Leipzig, and we realized that by teaming up we might be able to develop this new approach.\"\nThe technology is already mature\n The new pulses could well generate interest among many telecommunications-industry market participants. The technology is already mature, as well as 100% optic and relatively cheap. In addition, it appears that it could fit on a simple chip. \"It almost seems too good to be true,\" says Prof. Thévenaz.\n-----\nMore information:", "summary": "Two EPFL scientists have shown how to achieve a dramatic increase in the capacity of optical fibers.

That’s why a handful of students has been meeting up almost every day during their summer vacation at either the lakeside headquarters of the Compagnie Générale de Navigation (CGN) – the Lake Geneva ferryboat operator – or the EPFL-UNIL sailing center, to thoroughly test their two prototypes. The  will be held from 2 to 9 September in Saint-Tropez, France. Like last year, three Swiss teams have signed up: EPFL, the Universities of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland in Fribourg (HES-SO Fribourg) and the School of Business and Engineering (HEIG) in Yverdon. The three teams will showcase their boats for the public on 11 August, from 10am to 7pm, at the Parc des Rives du Lac on the  lakefront.\nThe competition is devoted to nautical and maritime energy efficiency, and more than 30 teams will take part this year. Each team will compete with two miniature remote-controlled boats powered by batteries provided by the event organizer. A bit like Laurel and Hardy, one of the boats should be fast and light and run for a long time, while the other, with 200 kg in ballast, is meant to simulate a cargo ship.\nHalf catamaran, half hovercraft\nEPFL has taken part in the event since it was first held in 2014, and this year’s team is going in confident. They believe that their light bifoiler, which was launched in 2016, could win. “We minimized drag by using only two foils, which means our boat can outpace the others. The flip side of the coin is that our boat is more unstable – it’s sort of like flying a drone without a stabilizer,” says Kevin Delizée, a Master’s student in mechanical engineering and vice president of the  association. The trick is to really fine-tune the boat and then pilot it expertly.\nThe EPFL students are also entering a promising new ‘heavy’ boat into the mass transport category, which they have dominated twice in years past. A cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft, their new boat has two sources of propulsion: Archimedes’ buoyancy force acting on the two hulls, and a fan-generated air cushion contained between the hulls by fore and aft skirts.\nValuable partners\nThe upcoming competition will cap off a year of endless hours of work for Delizée, who conceived and designed the new boat as part of two semester projects. “What drives me? It’s just been a lot of fun!” He and close to a dozen other students got out of bed every morning at the crack of dawn for five weeks in order to build the boat in a workshop in Ecublens provided by Décision SA, one of the team’s main partners.\nThe project taught the students many things. In addition to the mechanical and technical know-how they picked up, they experienced some real-world challenges first-hand: project and team management for starters, and then fundraising and the quest for partners. This year, Hydrocontest EPFL Team embarked on a partnership with CGN, which gave them access to a large expanse of open water in the port used by their belle-époque-era ferryboats. “For CGN, this link-up with EPFL is a great opportunity to build bridges in areas that are important to our company and will support our development.

Yet these same technologies can also be hijacked to create potentially dangerous pathogens for which there is no known treatment.\nSo as researchers, we need to ask ourselves what we can do to advance science and technology for the common good while at the same time managing the risks of “dual-use” research, or research that can be turned against people or the environment.\nThe EPFL workshop, which was funded by NATO’s Science for Peace and Security Programme, gave scientists, national and international regulators, security agencies and businesses a chance to pool their expertise in order to clarify the causes and potential consequences of these risks and refine existing response strategies.\nThe working groups formed during the workshop will now turn their discussions into a report and a book discussing the various problems, current and potential future solutions, existing obstacles and recommendations. The workshop participants explored both the failure of well-intentioned researchers to take necessary precautions and the impact of their negligence, as well as the danger that knowledge or material will be used for malevolent purposes.\nWhat is ?\nIRGC was created by EPFL in 2017 to serve as a forum for cross-disciplinary dialogue on complex, uncertain and ambiguous risks – which are often a counterpart to opportunities. Our goal is to give policymakers the information they need to make decisions based on solid scientific and technological foundations.\nMost technologies are aimed at reducing existing risks – think climate change, diseases and natural disasters – and this is something that should be promoted by public policies. It is also essential to create positive incentives through targeted research programs, financial support, and standards that reward performance gains. But new dangers can always arise, and this is where IRGC comes in. Our recommendations are meant to highlight key risks and challenges and help identify possible strategies to deal with them.\nWe have a dual mission. First, we seek to develop widely applicable risk governance concepts and instruments. Risk governance refers to the processes, standards, regulations and structures that come into play when risk-related decisions have to be made. This includes assessing, managing and communicating about risks with the involvement of the various stakeholders. We then issue recommendations, mainly for public policymakers, about how to manage the risks posed by some emerging technologies.\nWhy does EPFL need IRGC?\nAll major universities around the world have an institute or center that studies the link between technology and public policy. The concept of risk is central because it is what justifies public intervention. Yet the risk governance approach that we take encompasses more than simple risk management. For a university like EPFL, it means creating the conditions necessary for new technologies to be adopted. For example, we commonly recommend that new technological applications must not only improve existing performance in some way, but they must also be economically viable and generally responsible, i.e. socially acceptable and environmentally respectful.\nOur role at EPFL is to answer researchers’ questions about such topics. We can also be more proactive in certain areas, such as insisting on the importance of taking cultural differences into account when assessing risk acceptability – in genome editing, for example – and raising awareness of the role and place of ethics in researchers’ work.\nWhat is IRGC currently working on?\nOur work is focused on two of EPFL’s areas of expertise: digitalization and life sciences. In digitalization, this year we are working on deepfakes, which is when text, audio or video content is falsified in order to mislead or manipulate people. We’re looking at what steps can be taken to ensure machine learning is used to improve diagnostics, predictions and decisions without being applied to actually producing deepfakes as well. In the life sciences, we have set up a program to help decision-makers achieve the social, regulatory and economic conditions needed to promote fairness in the burgeoning field of precision medicine.

{"id": 1024, "text": "For weeks, the huge fires that consumed Australia at the beginning of this year were front-page news – and a major cause of global concern. Now, Siberia – Russia’s northernmost region – is experiencing wildfires after record spring heat, with temperatures sometimes exceeding 30 degrees in May and an average of 10 degrees above seasonal standards. In 2019, unusually widespread fires swept through a million hectares of forest in the region. And there are indications that so-called “zombie” fires, which survived the winter, are re-emerging across the Russian Arctic.\nClimate scientists warn that this kind of event will become increasingly commonplace in the future, and studies have even shown that climate change had greatly increased the risk of the massive fire event in Australia. But what about the long-term consequences for the environment, the climate and our health? We asked Athanasios Nenes, who leads EPFL’s Laboratory of Atmospheric Processes and their Impacts (LAPI), for his views. Nenes is one of the world’s foremost experts in atmospheric processes and suspended particulate matter (aerosols). His current research, which is funded by the European Research Council, focuses on the impact of biomass-burning aerosols on health and climate.\nWhat do these new fires in Siberia tell us about how the climate is changing? \n\"These fires are perhaps even more concerning than the ones in Australia. They have the potential to accelerate warming in the Arctic, which is already heating up much more quickly than the rest of the planet. The vast Arctic peatlands, which are sustained by permafrost, are now thawing. This can release huge amounts of carbon back into the atmosphere. Peat is also flammable. Once ignited by a lightning strike, it can burn for weeks to months. The embers can even survive the winter, reigniting a large fire the following summer. Fires have a dual effect: as well as melting permafrost directly, they also darken the surface. This further accelerates the melting of permafrost and ice because a darker surface absorbs more of the sun’s heat. Decaying peatlands can also emit large quantities of methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas.\nHow does the vegetation influence the kind of plumes and gases released into the atmosphere?\nThe vegetation is quite different according to the regions, and variations in carbon content can affect emissions. But combustion temperature is a much more important factor in determining what’s emitted into the atmosphere. We talk about two types of fire: flaming (high-temperature) fires and smoldering (low-temperature) fires. Emissions of toxic compounds, aerosols and precursors tend to be higher in the smoldering phase because the combustion is incomplete. Flaming fires tend to emit more CO\n2\n and black carbon (soot), both of which can warm the climate. Peat fires tend to be smoldering, meaning they can burn for weeks or months on end. The vast amount of smoke they produce causes regional haze, and of course they release large amounts of CO\n2\n and methane – two greenhouse gases – into the atmosphere.\nFire and smoke in Siberia in Summer 2019. (c)Greenpeace Russia\nWe know that these fires release toxic particles that can affect our respiratory systems. Does this mean people might be more vulnerable to the virulent version of the COVID-19? \nAbsolutely. The populations in urban environments and other locations that are exposed to high levels of pollutants are more likely to have compromised respiratory, cardiac and immune systems and even conditions like dementia and diabetes – and are therefore more vulnerable to infection from the coronavirus. Biomass-burning smoke is particularly toxic, containing a large number of carcinogens, as well as compounds that cause oxidative stress upon inhalation. Besides, the effects of smoke aren’t only felt near the source – where’s it most apparent to people – but also much further away, where the particles have become diluted and indistinguishable from the background. So even if you don’t see the smoke, its effects are still there – on both health and climate. A recently published study showed that this old, background smoke can have just as big an effect on climate as freshly emitted smoke.\nIs the next big fire event likely to be in the Amazon rainforest again?\nThe real question is whether climate change will place increasing stress on the planet’s large forested areas. And the answer is yes. The Amazon in particular is suffering from many decades of severe deforestation, which, together with wildfires, is vastly accelerating the rate of loss. It’s estimated that, at some point, the rainforest will collapse because it won’t be able to maintain the rainwater needed to sustain it.\nWhat are the long-term effects of the huge fires we’re seeing in many parts of the world? \nThere are many effects. First, on the ground, these fires can dramatically alter ecosystems. When trees are seriously damaged, they take a long time to regenerate and may never recover. Because forests store water, they act like a buffer. Once they’re gone, that buffer – and the associated water – is eventually lost, leading to desertification. This is certainly possible for Australia, and for other drought-prone parts of the world. And also because of land-use change from human encroachment. We see that a lot in Brazil: after forest fires, the “free land” is used for agriculture, cattle farms and other uses..\nForest fires also release a lot of particulate matter into the atmosphere, where it can remain for weeks on end. These particles are transported all over the world, affecting air quality over vast regions. They contain soot and brown-colored molecules that absorb sunlight, thereby accelerating climate warming. And if they fall on ice and snow – as we’ve seen in the Arctic from fires in Siberia – they can darken these normally highly reflective surfaces and cause them to melt more quickly. Smoke from the fires in Australia turned the surface of some glaciers in New Zealand orangey-brown, and there’s evidence to suggest that it even reached coastal areas of the Antarctic.\nAnd of course, the CO\n2\n trapped in these forests – some of which is relatively ancient – gets released back into the atmosphere. Smoke also contains nutrients like nitrogen and iron. Eventually, these nutrients are deposited on the ground or over the oceans, where they act as a fertilizer. But in general, burning biomass – either in forests or in grasslands – can alter the climate in many different ways. Some are immediate, while others are much more long-term.\nWhy will this kind of event be more frequent in the future?\nBecause of changes in precipitation and temperature, land-use change, and other effects associated with climate change and human activities. Many areas are already experiencing extended droughts and are much more susceptible to vast fires. But fires aren’t always a bad thing. They’re part of the natural cycle of ecosystems, some of which have evolved to need fire to germinate seeds. But the problem is that climate change could throw ecosystems “off balance” and lead to catastrophic fires, like the ones we’ve seen in Australia and Siberia, but also in the Mediterranean, for example. Biomass burning, which is a persistent seasonal feature in the region, will likely get worse.\nCan we offset the loss by planting large numbers of trees?\nForest management can indeed help mitigate some of the effects of climate change. It isn’t an easy task either, and dealing with the disappearance of a forest the size of a city is a very different proposition from one the size of Switzerland. The magnitude of the problem is the big deal here. And these aren’t just onetime events. They’ll happen again and again, and in areas of the world that have rarely seen them before. You only have to look at the Sweden fires in the summer of 2018, or the fires in Greenland, to see the direct consequences of climate change in action.\nThe plumes of smoke are visible on the satellite images. Here, the Australian fires in early 2020. (c)NASA\nHow do the effects differ if the smoke stays in one area or spreads in the atmosphere?\nIt depends how much smoke is produced, and how often. Large fires tend to generate considerable amounts of smoke, which persists for weeks in the atmosphere. You can see it in satellite images. It interacts with sunlight, affects clouds and impacts the climate. Fortunately, particles don’t stay in the atmosphere forever. But if you have more frequent fires, you basically have a lot more particles in the air all the time, with impacts on the climate, visibility, and the health of living beings. In Europe, for instance, sometimes half or more of the particle mass we breathe can be attributed to fires – either forest fires in summer or wood burning in winter. In other words, we’re continuously breathing smoke. Now imagine if forest fires become more frequent and prevalent. That will clearly mean we will breath unhealthier air. For humans and many ecosystems, having more fires is just not a good thing.\"\nTo go further:\nForest fires in 2019:\nGlobal Forest Watch:\nFire Information for Resource Management System:\nEarth Data, Nasa:\n Earth Observatory, Nasa:", "summary": "After Australia, Siberia is burning, indicating that the frequency of such events is on the rise, with myriad dire consequences: devastated ecosystems, risk of desertification, CO\n2\n emissions, toxic particles, further climate impacts...

{"id": 1025, "text": "Do the banks implement changes that would enable them to better confront turbulence in the markets? Not really, according to a study by EPFL’s Swiss Finance Institute, recently published in the journal Social Science Research Network.\nThe researchers analyzed the performance and data of 350 American banks between the two most recent important financial crises: involving the Russian debt of 1998 and then the subprime crisis of 2007-2008. A sample of this study concerns both large and small institutions, and includes investment banks, savings banks, and commercial banks.\n“Those which had performed poorly during the first crisis were also adversely affected during the second”, notes Rüdiger Fahlenbrach, Tenure Track Assistant Professor at the College of Management of Technology, who, with his team, looked into the reasons behind these results.\nThey noticed in particular that the Managing Director in charge at the time had very little influence on the performance of these companies. Neither does it depend on the nature of the two crises, both called “the most serious crisis of the last 50 years”, but caused by very different phenomena. In 1998, Russia was not able to meet its debts, which created a chain reaction, with investors registering big losses and trying to get rid of their shares quickly. In 2007, the crisis was essentially caused by a poor estimation of the risks associated with mortgage debts and the over-estimation of the value of certain investments (mortgage-backed securities).\nRisk-taking in re-financing doesn’t pay\n“Contrary to popular belief, small institutions are often less affected by crises – it’s the big banks that are worst affected”, Rüdiger Fahlenbrach points out. “The determining factor is in fact the business model chosen at the beginning.”\nAccording to this expert, the methods used by banks to finance their debts – which are very difficult to sell off or to re-finance in times of crisis – is crucial. The study confirms that the institutions that use these methods in the short-term, and that have only limited capital, will perform less well in the event of a crisis. Those banks that opt for aggressive growth and excessive risk are also among the more fragile institutions. One reason why these companies are reluctant to change their model is that it serves them well when the markets are booming.\nThe message of the research – based on experimental work and empirical data – is to have more capital and less financing in the short term. Rüdiger Fahlenbrach is now attempting to disseminate these ideas through the publication of his article and by participating in various international conferences.", "summary": "Can the financial sector regulate itself?

And in addition to giving the time, they might offer additional functions such as a telephone, a compass or other kinds of energy-consuming applications. EPFL’s Integrated Actuators Laboratory (LAI), in Neuchatel, has made a major step in this direction with the invention of a new kind of motor whose energy output is three times greater than traditional motors. It will thus satisfy the requirements and developments of the watchmaking industry.\nTo manufacture micro-electronic microsystems, known as MEMS, engineers typically call upon the principles of electrostatics. The LAI scientists, however, are proposing an electromagnetic drive system. Using a fixed magnet and three phases instead of a single phase, this novel device has more than once required its inventors to overcome formidable challenges…\n“To obtain a good motor, you need a minimum of two or three phases, that is to say, two or three copper coils,” explains Yves Perriard, head of LAI. “However, these coils take up room, and thus we were obliged to invent a new configuration and geometry for the motor. And most of all, they’re very expensive to make using traditional methods, which haven’t changed since the 1970s.”\nClean room fabrication \nThe researchers thus opted for a new fabrication process. The method had to be conducted in a clean room and was complicated to set up – a total of 24 operations had to be defined. But it was worth it, because the method makes it possible to manufacture certain components at very low cost. The stators, for example, fixed parts of the motor, are engraved on silicon plates, which means that a large quantity of them can be made simultaneously.\nThey also encountered another difficulty: with three phases, the command electronics had to be redesigned. “To tell time adequately, the motor must be able to locate the rotor, or the rotating part, at any point in time,” explains Perriard. “However, it would be very expensive to equip the motor with sensors to do this. We are thus trying to come up with solutions from signal processing techniques that use the motor’s voltage and current.” It’s a tiny device, but it’s filled to the brim with ideas and inventions…", "summary": "An electromagnetic three-phase motor, invented by EPFL’s Integrated Actuators Laboratory, will enable the watchmaking industry to build watches that are three times more efficient and that can include more applications.", "claim": "An electromagnetic three-phase motor, invented by EPFL’s Integrated Actuators Laboratory, will enable the watchmaking industry to build watches that are two times more efficient and that can include more applications.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [25, 25], "noise": false}

The EPFLoop team has the support of the school’s Senior Management and is being supervised by Professor Mario Paolone at the Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory, with Swissmetro project coordinator Marcel Jufer serving in an advisory role. The team members introduced themselves at an event at the Rolex Forum on Thursday night. “We may be outsiders, but we can bring in a fresh perspective,” says Denis Tudor, the EPFLoop team manager.\nThe Hyperloop Pod Competition was launched in 2015 by billionaire Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX.

{"id": 1044, "text": "Drones are being used for a growing number of purposes. Their designs are ever more efficient, and techniques for flying them are being further refined all the time. But drones still have the same weak point: their battery. This is particularly true of propeller drones, which are popular for information-gathering purposes in dangerous or hard-to-reach regions. These drones can fly for only around 15 minutes at a time because their engines quickly burn through their batteries. One way of addressing this limitation – without weighing the drones down – would be to recharge them while aloft using a power beaming system: an energy-rich laser beam that is guided by a tracking system and shines directly on photovoltaic cells on the drones’ exterior.\nSeveral labs around the world, including in the US, have been working on this idea in recent years. LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off based at Innovation Park, has now demonstrated the feasibility of using a high-power laser for this purpose. What’s more, LakeDiamond’s laser emits a wavelength that cannot damage human skin or eyes – the issue of safety is paramount, since the system is meant for use with civilian drones. LakeDiamond’s technology is built around diamonds that are grown in the company’s lab and subsequently etched at the atomic level.\nWorld record for power\nDespite appearances, standard laser beams are not as straight as they seem: as they travel, they expand ever so slightly, leading to a loss in density as they go. But LakeDiamond’s system produces a laser beam with a wavelength of 1.5 µm that, in addition to being safe, can travel much farther without losing strength. “Systems developed by other companies and labs, often for military applications, employ lasers that are more powerful and thus more dangerous for humans,\" says Pascal Gallo, CEO of LakeDiamond. His company took the opposite tack: their technology transforms the rays emitted by a simple low-power diode into a high-quality laser beam. Their beam has a larger diameter, and its rays remain parallel over a longer distance – in this case up to several hundred meters.\nIn LakeDiamond’s laser, the light produced by a diode is directed at a booster composed of reflective material, an optical component and a small metal plate to absorb the heat. The breakthrough lies not with this set-up, which already exists, but with the fact that the emitted beam is only a few dozen watts strong. The secret is using a small square lab-grown diamond as the optical component, as this delivers unparalleled performance. LakeDiamond's system holds the world record for continuous operation using a wavelength in the middle of the infrared range – it delivers more than 30 watts in its base configuration. “That’s equivalent to around 10,000 laser pointers,” adds Gallo.\nThe lab-grown diamonds’ key properties include high transparency and thermal conductivity. Achieving those things – and mastering the nano-etching process – took the researchers over ten years of development. LakeDiamond grows its diamonds through a process of chemical vapor deposition, an approach that ensures their purity and reproducibility. The surfaces of the resulting tiny square diamonds are then sculpted at the nano level using expertise developed in Niels Quack's lab at EPFL (\n). Thanks to their inherent properties and etched shapes, the diamonds are able to transfer heat to a small metal plate that dissipates it, while at the same time reflecting light in such a way as to create a laser beam.\n“To achieve greater power – say to recharge a larger drone – these lasers could easily be operated in series,” says Nicolas Malpiece, who is in charge of power beaming at LakeDiamond. The company’s remote recharging system works in the lab but will require further development and refinement before it’s ready for field use. What would happen if a drone flies behind an obstacle and is cut off from its laser energy source? Several approaches to this problem are currently being explored. A small back-up battery could take over temporarily, or, for information-gathering missions over rough terrain for example, the drone could simply return to within range of the laser in order to top up its battery.\nThis energy transmission system is also interesting for other areas of application. It can for example be used for charging and transmitting data to satellites.

This combines the enhanced stability of 2D perovskites with 3D forms, which efficiently absorb light across the entire visible spectrum and transport electrical charges. In this way, the scientists were able to fabricate of efficient and ultra-stable solar cells, which is a crucial step for upscaling to a commercial level.

{"id": 1056, "text": "As nuclear power production is phased out in several countries in the wake of the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plants, renewable energy is expected pick up much of the slack. Switzerland expects a 10% increase in its hydropower capacity by 2050 by expanding its existing hydropower installations and authorizing the construction of hundreds of new mini-hydropower plants, leaving few river courses untouched. But what does this mean for the country’s river ecosystems? Under current policy this could lead to a dramatic change of biodiversity, argues Paolo Perona, professor in applied hydro-economics and fluvial morphodynamics. In two recent publications, he outlines how a change in policy could help maintain the natural fluctuations in river flow that are fundamental in driving many ecological processes without hampering the economic productivity of existing hydropower installations. We met Paolo Perona for an interview.\nHow do you expect Swiss hydropower to evolve in the near future? \n Because of Switzerland’s recent decision to abandon nuclear power and expand hydropower, the population will begin to see exploitation touch almost all rivers. This could be a positive development, provided that we proceed with common sense. Mini-hydropower, using installations with a capacity of less than 10 MW, is one component that is expected to increase, especially given that it is faster and less expensive to implement. In fact, since the Federal Offices for the Environment and Energy, and the Federal Council have decided to invest into hydropower, around 800 new projects have been proposed, to be located in valleys all across the country. Many have already been approved and are now going into construction.\nDetail of a small hydropower plant built in 2011 on Aurino river, Aurina valley, Bolzano, Italy.\n Picture provided by Agenzia Ambiente - Ufficio tutela Acque della Provincia di Bolzano\nThat must have quite an impact on the environment.\n To limit the environmental impact, measures have been put in place to ensure that rivers never dry out. But the problem is that these measures kill the natural variability of the river. The challenge is the conciliation of river management from an ecological and an economic point of view. In 1992, the Swiss population voted in a law to protect the environment by imposing a minimum flow on all rivers that are impounded, for instance for the generation of hydropower. Today, this law sets a minimum standard. In many places, for instance, two or more minimum flow rates are imposed, depending on the season.\nWhy is it so important to preserve the natural variability of the river flow?\n A lot of - perhaps even all - river processes are dictated by flow variability initiated by precipitation, and the melting snow and ice within the catchment. Consider sediment transport. Different sediment sizes are moved and deposited by different flow rates. In this way, habitats are moved and created. Through floods, variability also connects the river to its floodplain. This guarantees the renewal of soil moisture, the delivery of nutrients, and the removal of debris, benefitting both flora and fauna.\nWhat happens when we remove this variability? \n In the Maggia Valley, a strongly impounded system that is regulated using a two-threshold minimal flow release approach, we observed and modeled the effect of artificially altered flow regimes. One thing that became clear is that this regulation triggered a change in the vegetation and in its renewal dynamics. The problem with this is, once new trees or other vegetation have settled and grown deep roots, uprooting them is not just simply a matter of going back to the natural flow regime. The trees are too old. So you would need to wait a long time to bring back the system to its original state.\nSo how should we decide how much water to leave to the environment?\n We decided to look at the problem using an approach borrowed from economics, called marginal analysis. As an example, say you have two people that are both thirsty, but you only have two liters of water to offer them. One person may need one liter of water to fully quench his thirst while another may need three liters. Marginal theory says that there is a point where these two liters of water are distributed optimally. That point is reached when both people would attribute the same value to the next sip of water they are offered.\nHow does this apply to river ecosystems? \n Using this approach, we can allocate water among economic users and the environment in such a way that both benefit equally. When we do this using a method we recently published, the flow that is released downstream of a diversion point - water that is provided to the environment - is very similar to the flow in a natural river ecosystem, with similar variability, only with a lower magnitude.\nWhat would be the financial impact of varying river flow rates to mimic the natural situation? \n Of course we are removing water from the economic user. But if we are able to remove the water in the same amount as current law would have it, for example on a two threshold basis, but make it variable, we can preserve its value for business. At the same time, we greatly improve the ecological benefit thanks to the variability that we obtain. To qualify the ecological benefit more accurately, we are currently running field and lab experiments with Alexandre Buttler from the ECOS lab at EPFL.\nHave you been able to test this on a real stream?\n In the Canton of Graubünden, there are some mini-hydropower development projects where they plan to divert water from the river using a proportional distribution – a subset of the theoretical model we developed that has already been put into practice in some neighboring countries, such as Italy and Austria. Lorenzo Golra, a PhD student in my group, ran a case study on one of these projects and published his results in a second paper. He analyzed four different distribution scenarios, the natural scenario, and our optimal scenario. The results show that our approach based on a dynamic redistribution policy performs better than approaches based on minimum flow releases and proportional distribution approaches when we compare a number of economic and hydro-ecological indicators.\nSo will Switzerland be able to expand its hydropower capacity sustainably?\n It depends on how we decide to manage water in these ecosystems. We can exploit a river for 40 or 50 years and then decide that we want to bring it back to its natural state, but we don't know how the ecosystem will respond. Does it make sense to invest a lot of money after 50 years for restoration if we could invest a little now, and perturb the environment less? In contrast, our research sends a message that we can move away from a restoration-based to a preservation-based approach. Let’s exploit the river economically, but if we can do it with less impact, we will save a lot of money in the future. Ecosystems are only resilient to a certain point. But beyond that point, they are unlikely to bounce back promptly by simply restoring the river.\nReferences\nPerona, P., D. Dürrenmatt and G.

{"id": 1072, "text": "If plasmas can be controlled, then it may one day be possible to use nuclear fusion as an energy source. As in stars, however, this ultra-hot material is constantly boiling, which makes it hard to control in a reactor. Instabilities in the plasma create bubble-like “blobs” that, upon bursting, can damage the internal walls of the reactor. Scientists are trying to find ways to stabilize plasmas from the inner core out to the surface. Two CRPP teams have recently made progress in this area by improving our understanding of these instabilities.\nOn the surface\nSurface instabilities appear as filaments. Physicists have observed that these structures originate from waves propagating in the plasma. They worked out the wave dynamics, and then precisely measured the filaments’ properties (electrical, in particular), using instruments capable of taking 250,000 images per second. These measurements represent a major accomplishment, because the filaments, only a few centimeters long, move at a speed of one to two kilometers a second, are at a temperature of nearly 50,000°C and hold the energy of a 10-ton truck going at 80 km/hour. The researchers nonetheless managed to observe that the filaments carried their own current. They thus confirmed the theory proposed by Christian Theiler as part of his PhD research at the CRPP.\nThanks to this discovery, it will be possible to apply voltage directly to the filaments. Ivo Furno, who led the experiment, explains: “It is very difficult to prevent them from forming, but it may be possible to control their speed and trajectory.” Given the plasma’s elevated temperature, it is necessary to act on it without direct contact to control the filaments, which makes this technique particularly promising. The discovery will have a very important impact on research, because filaments appear in all plasmas in “tokamaks”, or nuclear fusion reactors. In fact, controlling the behavior of the filaments in the ITER tokamak is considered a gauge of the project’s success.\nIn the core\nReactors like EPFL’s TCV have a plasma core that is maintained at extremely high temperatures – up to a hundred million degrees – as long as possible, in order to generate fusion reactions. To do this, physicists confine the plasma using magnetic fields. Despite their efforts, hot blobs are still created in the core, and the danger is that several blobs could combine and eventually escape to the surface.\nA group of scientists led by Timothy Goodman has - for the first time - managed to concentrate radiation equivalent to a thousand microwave ovens with a precision of just a few millimeters, using a set of mirrors that can be adjusted in real time. With this powerful beam they were able to prevent the blobs from aggregating, without disturbing the reactions taking place in the plasma core.\n“Like surgeons, physicists must intervene in the plasma in the least invasive manner possible to guarantee its stability,” adds Ambroglio Fasoli, the EPFL Professor responsible for the two teams. This research marks a new step in the journey towards controlling nuclear fusion. And its arrival is timely; not only is conventional nuclear power (fission) under considerable scrutiny, but fusion is also being called upon to provide proof of its potential. “We can’t just sit back and watch. We also have to control the reactions,” concludes the physicist. And so physics takes another step forward.\nLinks:\nArticles:\nDirect Two-Dimensional Measurements of the Field-Aligned Current Associated with Plasma Blobs\n, I. Furno, M. Spolaore, C. Theiler, N.

{"id": 1084, "text": "In January 2010, the earthquake – over 7.0 on the Richter scale – destroyed Haiti, devastating its capital, Port au Prince,causing the deaths of 230,000 people and injuring 300,000. A state of emergency was declared, and over ten thousand NGOs, as well as United Nations personnel, were dispatched to the country. Humanitarian organizations and peace keeping forces provided first aid, distributing drinking water, giving medical care, and clearing the rubble. This phase was followed, nine months later, by an outbreak of cholera. Polluted water, fruit and vegetables which had been watered, or dirty hands caused the disease to be transmitted. Without sewage treatment facilities, everything flowed into the rivers. And in Haiti, rivers are strategic “corridors”: the people wash, play and drink in these places. One-and-a-half years after the catastrophe, the population is still living among the rubble and the garbage.\nA strain unknown in South America\nCases of cholera had not been identified in the country for over 100 years. The population was not prepare\nd for this new twist of fate. Studies have revealed that\n the bacteria was identical to that found in Asia, and which may have infected Nepalese UN soldiers. Before they arrived in Haiti, it’s quite probable that they did not have time to be screened. Since the bacteria strain appeared only after their installation, downstream from their camp, it’s likely that it was spread through their sewage water.\n “If the disease is not treated, it may be misdiagnozed as severe diarrhoea,” explains Melanie Blokesch, Professor at the EPFL and expert in the evolution of the cholera bacteria. “In more severe cases, you can lose up to 20 liters of fluid per day, and children often die within a few hours,” she adds. Absorbing a salt solution enables the prevention of this fatal dehydration. It’s therefore essential to predict how the bacteria spreads in the short term, in order to warn the health authorities and organizations, and protect the population.\nWhen the environment meets the life sciences\nIn the at EPFL, Andrea Rinaldo is undertaking research into the role of waterway networks – real ecological corridors – in the propagation of water-borne diseases. Soon after the outbreak of cholera at the end of 2010, he published a spatial model that enables the prediction of the distribution of pathogenic bacteria, taking into account the time, the place and the movement of populations in Haiti. “We had to improve the model and understand why it didn’t always correspond to the reality, while determining the reasons for unexplained peaks in the epidemic. That’s why we decided to travel to the site of the epidemic and find out what was happening on the ground.” The research group is made up of: Melanie Blokesch, microbiologist; Andrea Rinaldo, hydrologist; and Silvan Vesenbeckh, epidemiologist at the Harvard Medical School.\nA different perspective “on the ground”\n On their arrival, the scientists had to confront surprise after surprise. They discovered that antibiotics were being distributed widely, sometimes as prophylactics. With no clear directives, some NGOs were just winging it, occasionally in contradiction to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which distorted the spatial representation of the probleme\n They noticed that most people have no access to toilets, and relieve themselves wherever they can. During the rainy season, water carries fecal bacteria into rivers and pollutes them, thus increasing the numbers of people exposed to contaminated water. The rain has other unexpected consequences: “The water washes away the paper-based warning posters, and the people then assume that the epidemic has been dealt with, and get out of the habit of taking precautions,” regrets Melanie Blokesch. This helps to explain the return of the epidemic at this time of the year.\nEPFL’s mission was to meet with the various humanitarian organizations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, Terre des Hommes, and also the WHO, in order to take into account all the facts of the situation on the ground. That is now complete. Soon, a new tool will be available to these organizations, to enable them to rapidly put in place the logistical elements of care, in line with Andrea Rinaldo’s conviction that the epidemiology of the future will be based on modelization.", "summary": "Two EPFL laboratories have rallied round Terre des Hommes Lausanne.

{"id": 1092, "text": "The driver ahead suddenly stops, and you find yourself stomping on your brakes before you even realize what is going on. We would call this a reflex, but the underlying reality is much more complex, forming a debate that goes back centuries: Is consciousness a constant, uninterrupted stream or a series of discrete bits – like the 24 frames-per-second of a movie reel? Scientists from EPFL and the universities of Ulm and Zurich, now put forward a new model of how the brain processes unconscious information, suggesting that consciousness arises only in intervals up to 400 milliseconds, with no consciousness in between. The work is \nContinuous or discrete?\nConsciousness seems to work as continuous stream: one image or sound or smell or touch smoothly follows the other, providing us with a continuous image of the world around us. As far as we are concerned, it seems that sensory information is continuously translated into conscious perception: we see objects move smoothly, we hear sounds continuously, and we smell and feel without interruption. However, another school of thought argues that our brain collects sensory information only at discrete time-points, like a camera taking snapshots. Even though there is a growing body of evidence against “continuous” consciousness, it also looks like that the “discrete” theory of snapshots is too simple to be true.\nA two-stage model\n, working with Frank Scharnowski at the University of Zurich, have now developed a new paradigm, or “conceptual framework”, of how consciousness might actually work. They did this by reviewing data from previously published psychological and behavioral experiments that aim to determine if consciousness is continuous or discrete. Such experiments can involve showing a person two images in rapid succession and asking them to distinguish between them while monitoring their brain activity.\nThe new model proposes a two-stage processing of information. First comes the unconscious stage: The brain processes specific features of objects, e.g. color or shape, and analyzes them quasi-continuously and unconsciously with a very high time-resolution. However, the model suggests that there is no perception of time during this unconscious processing. Even time features, such as duration or color change, are not perceived during this period. Instead, the brain represents its duration as a kind of “number”, just as it does for color and shape.\nThen comes the conscious stage: Unconscious processing is completed, and the brain simultaneously renders all the features conscious. This produces the final “picture”, which the brain finally presents to our consciousness, making us aware of the stimulus.\nThe whole process, from stimulus to conscious perception, can last up to 400 milliseconds, which is a considerable delay from a physiological point of view. “The reason is that the brain wants to give you the best, clearest information it can, and this demands a substantial amount of time,” explains Michael Herzog. “There is no advantage in making you aware of its unconscious processing, because that would be immensely confusing.” This model focuses on visual perception, but the time delay might be different for other sensory information, e.g. auditory or olfactory.\nThis is the first two-stage model of how consciousness arises, and it provides a more complete picture of how the brain manages consciousness than the “continuous versus discrete” debate envisages. But it especially provides useful insights about the way the brain processes time and relates it to our perception of the world.\nThis work involved a collaboration between EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute with the University of Zurich and the University of Ulm.

It is the fruit of a twenty-year collaboration of several hundred scientists from around thirty different institutions around the world, all united within the “Sloan Digital Sky Survey” (SDSS), with data collected from an optical telescope dedicated to the project located in New Mexico, in the United States.\nReleased today in the form of more than twenty scientific publications, this latest mapping of the night sky is an unprecedented and ambitious astronomical survey from 2014 until 2020. Resulting from the analysis of several millions of galaxies and quasars, this latest survey builds upon existing data as early as 1998 to fill certain gaps in cosmological history and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the expansion of the Universe.\nEPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) is directly involved in this important project. This latest cosmological survey of the SDSS, called “The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey” (eBOSS), includes more than 100 astrophysicists, of which several are researchers from EPFL. Jean-Paul Kneib, who heads EPFL’s Astrophysics Laboratory (LASTRO), initiated the eBOSS survey and was its principal investigator (PI) for several years.\n“In 2012, I launched the eBOSS project with the idea of ​​producing the most complete 3D map of the Universe throughout the lifetime of the Universe, implementing for the first time celestial objects that indicate the distribution of matter in the distant Universe, galaxies that actively form stars and quasars,” reports Jean-Paul Kneib. “It is a great pleasure to see the culmination of this work today. \"\n Thanks to the extensive theoretical models describing the Universe after the Big Bang, as well as observation of the Cosmic Microwave Backgound Radiation (CMBR), the infant Universe is relatively well known. Scientists have also explored its expansion history over the most recent few billion years from Supernovae distance measurements and galaxy maps, including those from previous phases of the SDSS. “We know both the ancient history of the Universe and its recent expansion history fairly well, but there’s a troublesome gap in the middle 11 billion years,” says cosmologist Kyle Dawson of the University of Utah, who leads the team announcing today’s results. “Thanks to five years of continuous observations, we have worked to fill in that gap, and we are using that information to provide some of the most substantial advances in cosmology in the last decade.”\n“Taken together, detailed analyses of the eBOSS map and the earlier SDSS experiments, we have now provided the most accurate expansion history measurements over the widest-ever range of cosmic time,” says Will Percival of the University of Waterloo, eBOSS’s Survey Scientist. “These studies allow us to connect all these measurements into a complete story of the expansion of the Universe.”\n The finalized map shows filaments of matter and voids that more precisely define the structure of the Universe since its beginnings, when it was only 380,000 years old. From there, the researchers measured the recurring patterns in the distribution of galaxies, thus identifying several key cosmological parameters, including the density of hypothetical dark matter and energy in the Universe, with a high degree of precision.\nTo carry out this survey, the teams involved in the eBOSS project looked at different galactic tracers that reveal the mass distribution in the Universe. For the part of the map relating to the Universe six billion years ago, researchers observed the oldest and reddest galaxies. For more distant eras, they concentrated on the youngest galaxies, the blue ones. To go back further, that is to say up to eleven billion years, they used quasars, galaxies whose super-massive black hole is extremely luminous.\nSlower expansion?\nThis map reveals the history of the Universe, and in particular, that the expansion of the Universe began to accelerate at some point and has since continued to do so. This seems to be due to the presence of dark energy, an invisible element that fits naturally into Einstein's general theory of relativity but whose origin is not yet understood.\nWhen eBOSS observations are compared with studies of the Universe’s early days, discrepancies appear in estimates of the Universe’s expansion rate. The currently accepted expansion rate, called the \"Hubble constant\", is 10% slower than the value calculated from the distances between the galaxies closest to us. It is unlikely that this 10% difference is random due to the high precision and wide variety of data in the eBOSS database.\nTo date, there is no commonly accepted explanation for these disagreements between the different estimations of the speed of expansion, but the fact that a still unknown form of matter or energy from the early Universe could have left traces in our history is an interesting possibility.", "summary": "An international consortium of scientists has analyzed, as part of a vast program of cosmological surveys, several million galaxies and quasars, thus retracing a more continuous history of the Universe and offering a better understanding of the mechanisms of its expansion.

That characteristic is important for certain medical applications, such as diagnosing diseases such as arthritis, locating tumors, and destroying cancer cells in patients.\nDetecting cancer\n The EPFL scientists are looking at three main applications: diagnostics, treatment and elimination of malignant cells. “In practice, iron oxide particles are already used as contrast agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in liver tumor cases,” notes Hofmann. “We are studying how to apply this method to all kinds of tumors and if possible to other diseases, like Arthritis. The latter is the goal of a large EU FP-7 project ().” This is how it works: cancer cells have receptors on their surface, a sort of cellular ID. The covering on the nanoparticles is adapted accordingly (via antibodies, for example), so that once they’re injected intravenously, they’ll only attach to the receptors on the cancer cells. And because an iron oxide particle alters tissue contrast when subjected to a magnetic field, it’s thus possible to pinpoint the exact location of cancer cells using MRI. “So far this technique has only been validated for liver tumors, because for each cancer type, surface elements must be added, which change the particles’ behavior.

Along with MIT and Stanford University, EPFL is one of the few institutions to offer a parallel education in deep bio-science and advanced engineering techniques that focuses on the design and discovery of new molecules and organisms.\nDesign-oriented biology\n “The times enable it, for we have reached a stage of critical knowledge about biology that allows for quantitative, design-oriented biology,” explains Director of at EPFL, Professor Jeffrey Hubbell. \n Thanks to scientific initiatives like the Human Genome Project, there is an expansive amount of new biological information. But this information needs to be classified because it is hard to understand without a quantitative analysis. \n EPFL research in engineering, such as the microfluidic work done by Tenure Track Assistant Professor Sebastian Maerkl, is making this daunting task more manageable. In Maerkl’s lab, biological experiments can be done with programmable fluid microchips containing over 700 valves per square centimeter (see photo). \n This new research tool, which couples engineering and biology, allows researchers to run thousands of experiments with single yeast cells or track genetic promoters expressed by individual proteins in less time and with greater precision than before. This notable progress in technology in turn creates a wealth of information essential for understanding the design principles of nature.\n One example of designing new organisms is the school’s participation in the international genetically engineered machine () competition, where in 2009 they presented work done on light-sensitive proteins. These proteins, when activated by exposure to light, specifically induce the expression of a target gene – an advance that could have important repercussion in the domain of bioreactors by activating or deactivating protein production with a simple light-bulb placed in a reactor.\nA new education model\n The Master in Bioengineering has existed since 2007 alongside the Master in Biotechnology in the School of Life Sciences, but the decision to have the School of Engineering join the steering of this Master reinforces a more fundamental approach to hard technology with several new classes in engineering added to the curriculum.\n “This new program reflects our wish to foster multi-disciplinary approaches to education and research in the life sciences and the adhesion of the EPFL campus as a whole to this philosophy,” explains the Dean of Life Sciences, Professor Didier Trono. “Like their colleagues pursuing a Master in Life Sciences and Technology, the Bioengineering students will receive an in-depth education in the basics of biology, while developing in parallel hard skills in several fields of engineering. They will then integrate this knowledge through concrete projects conducted in laboratories.

A remarkable step was achieved this week by the team led by Dr. Fanny Meillaud and Dr. Matthieu Despeisse with a new world record efficiency of 10.7% for a single-junction microcrystalline silicon solar cell, independently confirmed at Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE CalLab PV Cells), Freiburg, Germany.\n“Deep understanding has been gained these last years in material quality, efficient light-trapping and cell design, which in combination with careful process optimization led to this remarkable world-record efficiency” says Simon Hänni, PhD student at IMT Neuchâtel. Importantly, the employed processes can be up-scaled to the module level. While standard wafer-based crystalline silicon PV technology implements absorber layers with a thickness of about 180 micrometers for module conversion efficiency of 15 to 20%, 10.7% efficiency was reached here with only 1.8 micrometers of silicon material, i.e. 100 times less material than for conventional technologies, and with cell fabrication temperature never exceeding 200°C. Thin-film silicon technology indeed offers the advantages of saving up on raw material and offering low energy payback time, thus allowing module production prices as low as 35 €/m2, reaching the price level of standard roof tiles.\nThe reported progress is of paramount importance for increasing further TF-Si PV devices efficiency and potential, as at least one microcrystalline silicon junction is systematically used in combination with an amorphous silicon junction to form multiple junction devices for a broader use of the solar spectrum. The reported record efficiency clearly indicates that the potential of TF-Si multi-junction devices can be extended to > 13.5% conversion efficiency with a minimum usage of abundant and non-toxic raw material at low costs (TF-Si PV modules implementing in their simplest form two glasses and few microns of zinc and of silicon for an easy recycling).\nWork leading to this result was supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE), the EU-FP7 program, the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI).", "summary": "EPFL’s Institute of Microengineering has reached a remarkable 10.7% efficiency single-junction microcrystalline silicon solar cell, clearly surpassing the previous world record of 10.1% held by the Japanese company Kaneka Corporation since 1998.

{"id": 1124, "text": "“We got the idea by talking with civil engineering students in the United States and at ETH Zürich, and decided that EPFL should participate in the competition as well,” says Charles Jeanbart, president of EPFL’s Civil Engineering Student Association (AEGC), the organization behind the project.\nA team of eight students is spending the semester designing a canoe made of reinforced concrete. An annual Concrete Canoe Competition is already a tradition for many US and Canadian universities and has also been held in Europe – mainly in Germany – since 1986. This year, the “Betonkanu Regatta” will take place in Cologne from 9-10 June. A record 50 universities from around the world will compete on Fühlinger See, an artificial lake in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia\n.\nThe EPFL team has just submitted its engineering design to the evaluation panel, thereby securing its place in the competition. This is crucial for the competition since the most prestigious award goes to the team with the best design, especially in terms of innovation. But even if they don’t win this award, they can still fight in other categories: lightest canoe, heaviest canoe, best-looking canoe, or fastest canoe. There is also a booby prize for the unluckiest crew. The regatta is divided between men and women, and includes a 100-meter stretch and a slalom.\n“Like IKEA furniture”\nDesigning the canoe is the semester project for the eight master’s students who are overseen by Professor Aurelio Muttoni. On top of the engineering challenge inherent in making concrete float, the students must also follow strict design specifications set forth in the competition’s rules and regulations; for instance, the canoes can contain no more than two kilograms of synthetic materials in addition to the concrete. There are also limits on how long and wide the canoes can be. “This is our first time in the competition, so we have to learn everything from scratch,” says Hanne Cloesen, a student on the EPFL team. “We decided to build a five-meter-long canoe made up of three sections that can be taken apart – like IKEA furniture – to make it easier to transport. And we used a bridge-building method called pre-stressing to make sure the whole thing stays together.” Taking a page from IKEA, the students named their canoe Kånöepfl and wrote their design paper as if it were a set of assembly instructions.\nTextile-reinforced concrete and pre-stressing cables\nThe students initially built a 1:5-scale model and tested it in a fountain. Then, when building the real thing, they experienced a few setbacks in applying the concrete layers by hand. “We had to make sure there were no surface defects and that the joints holding the three parts together were watertight. We alternated the layers of concrete with layers of carbon fiber, which has the advantage of being ultralight. It turns the concrete into textile-reinforced concrete,” says team-member Stephan Mühlberg. But the students have another ace up their sleeve: they also used steel pre-stressing cables (typically used in bridges) that compress the concrete and hold the three parts of the canoe in place. The team’s novel approach is what convinced Professor Muttoni to head the project. “In our Structural Concrete Laboratory, PhD student Patrick Valeri is looking into potential applications for textile-reinforced concrete – especially for eco-friendly buildings, since carbon fiber makes concrete corrosion-resistant and therefore cuts the amount of CO\n2\n generated in concrete production,” said Muttoni.\nLooking for more sponsors\nThe students will also be the ones paddling their canoe in the regatta and have already started an intense training program at EPFL’s Viv’Eden gym, which is one of the team’s sponsors. Other sponsors include EPFL’s Educational Affairs office (DAF), the student association (AGEPoly) and the Civil Engineering section (SGC). The Civil Engineering Student Association, which is handling all project logistics, is seeking additional sponsors to cover the expenses, which are estimated at CHF 20,000.\nSemi-finals\nThanks to its strength and agility, the EPFL team was one of 12 – out of 48 in the starting field – to make it to the semi-finals of the three-day regatta in Cologne. Certain design details of EPFL’s canoe, especially the pre-stressing approach, caught the attention of the jury, which also cited the narrow shape of the boat and the fact that it can be disassembled. What’s more, visitors to the competition were impressed by the team’s concept, which they learned about at the EPFL stand.

{"id": 1125, "text": "The widespread installation of photovoltaic panels on building rooftops could play an important role in Switzerland’s transition to a low-carbon energy system. Until now, however, the overall photovoltaic (PV) potential of Swiss rooftops could not be estimated accurately owing to a lack of data about buildings and their environments, along with wide margins of error arising from existing calculation methods. To fill that gap, researchers at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) have developed a methodology combining machine learning algorithms with geographical information systems and physical models to estimate PV potential. And, for the first time, they estimated hourly profiles of PV potential. Their results have been published in \nApplied Energy\n.\nAll roofs have their particularity\n“We’re not just looking at solar radiation, but also at the space available on rooftops. Some rooftops have an unusual shape or contain superstructures such as chimneys that prevent photovoltaic panels from being installed,” says Alina Walch, who led the second phase of the study. Their algorithm takes into account parameters such as the size of the roof, its orientation and whether the building is in a city center or a more isolated location. The results show that solar photovoltaic panels could be fitted to 55% of Switzerland’s total rooftop area. Even if panels were only installed on mainly south-facing rooftops, this could cover more than 40% of Switzerland’s electricity demand.\nSolar panels adapted to the different geometries of the roofs\nAn initial study, using artificial intelligence techniques, had already been carried out in a previous thesis by LESO-PB’s Dan Assouline. It was based on data collected in Geneva and then extended to the whole of Switzerland. “That study explored, for the first time, the use of artificial intelligence to quantify the potential for the large-scale installation of photovoltaic panels on building rooftops,” says Jean-Louis Scartezzini, the head of LESO-PB. “Using new high-resolution data, we have now improved the estimation method and increased the spatio-temporal resolution of the results. This will enable us to model future energy systems that are 100% renewable.”\nUsing the national “SIG-Énergie” geographic information system, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy has created a highly accurate model of Switzerland’s buildings. Using machine learning, estimates were made of the total roof area that could be covered by solar panels, depending on their shape and shading. Estimates were made even more accurate by applying real-world practical installation rules, resulting in PV potential of 24 terawatt-hours (TWh), ten times the capacity of existing installations. That figure’s margin of error is 9 TWh, due to the variability of solar radiation and the methodology used.\nAnnual energy potential\nBut Walch did not stop there: her study also includes the first ever hour-by-hour estimate of PV potential. This allows power generation to be gauged relative to consumption. “We have a surplus of energy in the summer and a shortage in the winter, and no energy at all at night,” she notes. “To address that imbalance, we need to consider other forms of renewable energy to make up for the shortfalls and allow energy to be stored. Hydroelectric power is an attractive way of storing energy, but the content of storage dams varies with the seasons. Wind power, used on a large scale, could fill the gaps.”\nHourly fraction of shaded roof area\nThe results obtained at EPFL could be used to put forward effective policies for installing PV panels on roofs. LESO-PB, the Swiss National Science Foundation, Innosuisse and the Swiss Federal Office of Energy are in talks to develop a platform that will enable cities, cantons and municipalities, but also individuals, to visualize the renewable energy potential of their buildings.\nAt the moment, Switzerland has tapped into only a tenth of its PV potential, which means that another 90% remains to be unlocked.\nApplied Energy \n Alina Walch,⁎, Roberto Castello, Nahid Mohajeri, Jean-Louis Scartezzini\n a Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland\nb Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom\nDan Assouline, Nahid Mohajeri, and Jean-Louis Scartezzini. “Large-Scale Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Technical Potential Estimation Using Random Forests.” Applied Energy 217 (May 1, 2018): 189–211. .", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL are assessing Switzerland’s solar power potential.

{"id": 1128, "text": "Only a small hill called Motty, in Ecublens, divides EPFL from Bertrand Cardis’ Décision boatyard. This geographical proximity is amplified by many technical, scientific and even emotional affinities. Rivages, the Vaud navigator Bernard Stamm’s sleek new sea-creature, will add a new chapter to the nautical history of the EPFL laboratories.\nThanks to support from the Sandoz family’s Foundation, which owns the boat and has special ties with our school, EPFL has brought its expertise to bear in several areas and benefited from productive interaction with the navigator’s technical team. The work involved to optimize the boat’s component materials, for example, were carried out at the Laboratory of Composite and Polymer Technology (LTC), with the objective of meeting the construction requirements as closely as possible.\nThe sails in real time\nAs well as taking this “scientific advisory” role in the actual construction, several teams from EPFL are continuing to follow Bernard Stamm’s adventures in real time. The Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB), in cooperation with the company Space3D, has already installed many cameras on the boat. It will now add some more cameras to observe the sails and model their movements in three dimensions and in real time, to gain a better understanding of the wind-flow patterns and to optimize their adjustments.\nSome other experiments, in particular oceanographic, will be conducted on board. Their interest therefore extends well beyond the sailing world itself. The Audiovisual Communications Laboratory (LCAV), which had already developed the environmental sensors for the SensorScope project, is currently working to produce the lightest possible “minilab”. On the hour, this will take a sampling of water, to make an automatic analysis of several parameters (temperature, salinity, oxygenation, turbidity, and micro-organism content) that it will transmit to land-based centers. Oceanopolis and the CNRS will be able to use the findings immediately as part of a specific study of micro-plankton, and these will also be made available to the scientific community. “The race uses routes that are rarely followed around the Antarctic, so it is an excellent opportunity to collect rare and detailed data and compare them with the measurements obtained by satellite”, explains Guillermo Barrenetxea, a scientist working at LCAV.\nEnergy needs\n A high-tech boat like Rivages needs more than a little wind and fresh water. The extensive electronic equipment required for navigation and – in this case – for all the scientific tasks need electricity. How can it be produced on-site and be managed optimally without weighing down and braking the boat? The Industrial Electronics Laboratory (LEI) is working to find the best solution. As Philippe Barrade, First Assistant, sums it up: “We must not only optimize the instruments to make them more energy-efficient, but also develop an intelligent system to manage the use, the reserves and the battery recharging system”.\n Solar cells, wind and water turbines and a diesel generator are the main candidates for supplying electricity. A combination of these sources will have to meet all the boat’s needs without making too many demands on the skipper’s attention. “Our energy production and management systems will therefore need to be extremely reliable”, adds Philippe Barrade.\nOn 11 November 2012, at Sables-d’Olonne, the starting-boat will give the signal for the Vendée Globe race to begin – this legendary solo race with no stopover or assistance. An impressive 60-foot monohull curved like a seagull, Rivages will then launch its assault on the southern seas.\nEighteen months in preparation\n For the moment, Rivages has just undergone a long voyage by special convoy to La Ciotat, near Marseille, where it arrived yesterday. And this weekend it will receive the traditional dose of champagne as a christening, as well as its mast, its sails and all the equipment still to be added. It will make its maiden voyage at the beginning of May, flying the colors of its sponsor “Cheminées Poujoulat”, and will complete several practice races this year (Tour de l’Europe, Transat Jacques Vabre).\nThese are 18 months of preparation that will be useful both to the navigator and his team, but also to the scientists involved in the project. “This partnership will enable us to advance in many fields”, Bernard Stamm comments happily. “As well as collecting important data, we will be able to improve the boat’s reliability and performance.” At EPFL, the impact of this major project is also being emphasized: “Solving practical questions concerning such a spectacular achievement is highly motivating for both the scientists and the students”, declares Pascal Vuilliomenet, in charge of the Strategic initiatives for the Vice-Presidency for Innovation and Valorization.", "summary": "The navigator from the Swiss canton of Vaud is working with EPFL to equip his new boat, Rivages, designed for the Vendée Globe 2012.

About a century ago, leprosy in Europe virtually disappeared, at least among humans. Examining diseased red squirrels from England, Ireland, and Scotland, scientists at EPFL and the University of Edinburgh have now discovered that the same bacteria that cause leprosy in humans also infect red squirrels. The work is \nLeprosy is an infectious disease that mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. It is caused by the bacteria \nMycobacterium leprae \nand the recently discovered \nMycobacterium lepromatosis. \nOne of the most ancient diseases, leprosy has had an enormous social impact across multiple cultures throughout history. Largely controlled today thanks to antibiotics, there are still over 200,000 new cases of leprosy reported each year worldwide.\nA little-known fact is that leprosy also affects animals, such as armadillos, which have reportedly caused a few cases of animal-to-human (or “zoonotic”) infections. Drawing from this evidence, the labs of  and  carried out DNA tests on 110 red squirrels from England, Scotland, and Ireland. Some of these animals showed clinical symptoms of leprosy, while others did not; nonetheless, most were found to be infected with leprosy bacteria.\nSurprisingly, red squirrels from Brownsea Island, off the south coast of England, were infected with a strain of \nM. leprae\n that is closely related to one found in a skeleton of a leprosy victim that was buried in Winchester 730 years ago, just 70 km from Brownsea Island.\nOn the other hand, red squirrels from Scotland and Ireland and the Isle of Wight (South England) were found to be infected with the other leprosy bacterium, \nM. lepromatosis\n. This species causes leprosy in humans in Mexico, and further analysis showed that the two strains from Mexico and Europe diverged from a common ancestor around 27,000 years ago.\n“It was completely unexpected to see that centuries after its elimination from humans in the UK \nM. leprae\n causes disease in red squirrels,” says Stewart Cole. “This has never been observed before.”\nThe study shows how a pathogen can remain undetected in the environment even hundreds of years after it has been cleared from the human population. “The discovery of leprosy in red squirrels is worrying from a conservation perspective but shouldn’t raise concerns for people in the UK,” says Anna Meredith. \"We need to understand how and why the disease is acquired and transmitted among red squirrels so that we can better manage the disease in this iconic species.”\nBut is there a danger to humans? “There is no reason for panic,” says Andrej Benjak, one of the paper’s lead authors. “Autochthonous leprosy has not been detected in the UK in decades, though we cannot exclude the possibility of rare, unreported or misdiagnosed cases that originated within the UK.” He suggests increasing efforts to monitor the disease, as part of the , where there is still room for improvement.\n“The next logical step after this study is to check the red squirrel population outside the British Isles, and that includes Switzerland,” says Benjak. “Even if there is leprosy in red squirrels in continental Europe, the risk of transmission to people is generally low because of their limited contact with humans, and hunting red squirrels is forbidden in most European countries.”\nThis work was supported by grants to S.T.C. from the Fondation Raoul Follereau, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Thomas O’Hanlon Memorial Award in Veterinary Medicine.\nReference\nCharlotte Avanzi, Jorge del-Pozo, Andrej Benjak, Karen Stevenson, Victor R. Simpson, Philippe Busso, Joyce McLuckie, Chloé Loiseau, Colin Lawton, Janne Schoening, Darren J.

Upon its completion, over 80 researchers and staff will work in a building that will serve both as a research facility and a demonstrator for innovative concepts and technologies for construction and housing.\nWith half of the world’s population residing in cities, the need to reduce the energy needed to build and inhabit urban dwellings is becoming increasingly important. In the face of this urban challenge, EPFL, EIA-FR, UniFR, and the Canton of Fribourg signed an agreement in March 2014 to launch a unique, interdisciplinary, and inter-institutional scientific platform to tackle this question from multiple perspectives, drawing on each institution’s strengths and synergies that will emerge through their cooperation. Following the project’s ratification by Fribourg’s Council of State last May, yesterday’s kick-off meeting marks its official launch.\n“The launch of the smart living lab represents a decisive phase in the development of our  innovation center, destined to become an integral part of Switzerland's National Innovation Park.

Research groups affiliated to EPFL will address fundamental questions, pertaining among others to energy efficiency, urban design and planning, and technological solutions. EIA-FR will emphasize the integration of innovative processes and technologies to transform, upgrade and optimize existing urban areas and buildings. And among other topics, UniFR will address legal and regulatory challenges in place today that slow down innovation in this field and explore new concepts for a low carbon society.\nThe platform’s first task will be to design its own building, to be located at the heart of the blueFACTORY SA, an innovation park run by the City and the Canton of Fribourg, on the former grounds of the Cardinal brewery in Fribourg. The smart living lab’s research building and the technology used in its construction will be the subject of extensive research. Ultimately, the building will be a constantly evolving demonstration platform to showcase budding sustainable technologies, providing its users with an opportunity to test its performance first-hand.\nStudents first\nThe first project spawned by the smart living lab is already well underway – and students from EPFL, EIA-FR, and UniFR have taken the lead. In the smart living challenge, students with backgrounds in science, engineering, architecture, law, and other fields are forming a team to take part in the next edition of the international Solar Decathlon competition. Perfectly aligned with the smart living lab’s objectives, the Solar Decathlon competition asks students from 20 universities worldwide to design and build a full-scale, fully functional, solar powered dwelling. The prototype, which will be developed, assembled, and tested at the blueFACTORY in Fribourg, will be evaluated according to ten criteria, including architecture, energy efficiency, sustainability, urban design, affordability, and public outreach. \n The first researchers from EPFL have already moved into their offices in the EIA-FR premises. A second wave of researchers from the three academic partner institutions is scheduled to move onto the blueFACTORY site in September 2015, once the transformation of the Halles bleues, the former warehouses located at the southern end of the grounds, is completed. While part of these unheated, temporary facilities will be equipped for the development and construction of the Solar Decathlon housing unit, the remainder will host insulated and energetically autonomous wooden boxes that will be used as offices and workshops for the technology platforms.\nThe smart living lab is a unique platform for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration and advanced research on buildings and homes of the future.

They attach to bees, weaken them and end up killing them. “This parasite is the leading cause of bee deaths,” says Alain Bugnon, a local beekeeper. “Left untreated, the hives won’t last a year.” If beekeepers could monitor Varroa mite infestations, they would be able to treat their hives at the right time and save their bees. Bugnon came up with the idea for an app that would provide this information, and teamed up with EPFL’s  (LTS5) to create it.\nBeekeepers currently assess infestations by counting the number of dead mites that land on a wooden board placed below the hives. But this technique is not very accurate: the parasites are barely a millimeter long, and their bodies get mixed up with waste and other material on the board. The process is also time-consuming, especially if a beekeeper has several hives.\nThis was the challenge presented to the students in LTS5, a lab in EPFL’s School of Engineering run by Professor Jean-Philippe Thiran. The students came up with a system – consisting of an app linked to a web platform – that uses artificial intelligence to quickly and automatically count up the mites on the boards. This means that beekeepers can keep close tabs on infestations in order to target their treatments, which are in keeping with Swiss organic farming practices. \nTeaching the app to recognize Varroa mites\nThe technology developed by the LTS5 students streamlines the beekeepers’ task. They still need to put wooden boards under each of their hives, but now they simply photograph the boards and upload the images to the web platform. To develop their app, the students used machine learning – scanning thousands of images into a computer – to teach their program how to recognize the mites. The app can spot and count the dead parasites on the board in just seconds. \n“The first step was to create a database of images of Varroa mites for the computer, so that it could recognize the mites on its own and without making mistakes,” says Maxime Bohnenblust, a Master’s student who has been involved in this project from the start. Several beekeepers regularly submitted photos of their boards to the laboratory and gave the students feedback on their results in order to help them improve the algorithms. \nThe students overcame several hurdles in coming up with their solution: photos taken with smartphones are often not very clear; the light in photos taken outside is very bright; and each board has to be associated with a corresponding hive. In response to the third hurdle, the students programmed their app to generate a specific QR code for each hive. A beekeeper using the program then takes a picture of his board alongside the QR code for his hive and uploads the image to the platform, where it is immediately analyzed. The results – how many mites are detected – are stored and will be used to create statistics and a time profile.\nIn search of mite-resistant bees\nThis system will also make it possible to compile nationwide data in order to produce statistics. No other system of this sort – based on standardized data – currently exists. “The beekeepers didn’t have any shared metric or standard,” says Bohnenblust. “And until now, beekeepers associations have been sending their data to Agroscope, the Swiss government’s agricultural research center, once a year.” Yet if there is to be any chance of saving the bees, timely data is required. “Anti-parasite treatments must be applied at the right time and scaled to the size of the infestation,” says Professor Thiran. \nFinally, the collected data could be used to map out and track Varroa infestations in Switzerland and potentially identify parasite-resistant strains of bees. \nThis project was carried out by the  and beekeeper Alain Bugnon. ApiZoom, a startup founded by Bugnon, will further develop the system and be in charge of distribution.\nContacts\nEPFL – Signals Processing Laboratory 5\nProf. Jean-Philippe Thiran, +41 21 693 46 23, \nBeekeeper\nApiZoom Sàrl, Alain Bugnon,", "summary": "A beekeeper teamed up with the Signal Processing Laboratory 5 and a group of EPFL students to develop an app that counts the number of Varroa mites in beehives.

The student teams have to design, build and launch a rocket, and they’re judged on a number of criteria, including whether their rocket reaches a target altitude, how clever their design is and the craftsmanship used in constructing the payload.\nEPFL was one of 120 universities from around the world to compete at this year’s event. The School’s rocket, called Eiger, came in 12th place overall and fifth place in the 10k-COTS category, where the rocket had to use a commercial off-the-shelf motor and reach an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 meters). “Our category was the most popular, with around 50 teams,” says Albéric De Lajarte, a Master’s student in microengineering and a member of EPFL’s team. “Of course we would’ve liked to end up in the top three, but we’re still really happy with the result. Next time we’ll make it – we know exactly what we need to improve.”\nEiger reached the target altitude with an error of only 6% – a brilliant performance – but had problems on the descent. “The first part of the flight was great with a really straight trajectory. But there was a problem in the second phase of the parachute’s deployment, and the rocket came down faster than expected,” says De Lajarte. That cost the team precious points.\nA launch pad for a career in aerospace\nEiger took nearly 18 months to develop, and the most enthusiastic students spent 20–30 hours a week on it. “We built on the work done by last year’s team for their Matterhorn rocket,” says De Lajarte. “But since our rocket is slightly bigger – three meters long and weighing 23 kilograms – we had to scale up their design. I think we ended up with a slightly more advanced and streamlined rocket. The integrated payload had to be designed from scratch, however. That was an interesting lesson in fluid dynamics – how non-Newtonian fluids can be used as shock absorbers, for example.”\nOverall the team members are pleased with their performance – and with the experience as a whole, which was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “The competition allowed us to develop our skills, meet both volunteers and professionals who are passionate about rockets, and get valuable experience in our fields – all while having fun,” says Jules Triomphe, a Bachelor’s student in mechanical engineering on the EPFL team. De Lajarte adds: “For me it was a chance to get first-hand experience with aerospace engineering through a real-life project. As we went along, I realized this is what I’d like to pursue as a career.

{"id": 1154, "text": "What was so exciting about yesterday's LIGO press announcement?\nThey announced that the LIGO-Virgo Consortium had made the first direct detection of gravitational waves using the Observatory’s advanced technology. Scientists have been trying to track down gravitational waves for decades. In the past, they have found hints of their presence, but through indirect methods of detection. We now have the first direct detection, which means we know for sure that gravitational waves exist. It is very exciting.\nScience is about collaboration – and I find this to be a great aspect of the discovery. Like so many projects in physics today, the detection involved a a large international collaboration: over 1000 members representing 15 different countries have been working together since the beginning of the project in 1997. \nWhat are gravitational waves and why are they so difficult to detect?\nGravitational waves are “ripples” through space-time, which can be caused by violent events in the universe, e.g. the merging of two black holes, or could even be created in early times, just after the Big Bang. Gravitational waves were first proposed by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, based on his theory of gravity – what is known as his theory of general relativity.\nTo detect gravitation waves, scientists use laser interferometers like LIGO’s. These systems bounce lasers over several kilometers and look for tiny, infinitesimal changes in the laser light across the length of the interferometer – think one part in 1021 (that is a 1 followed by 21 zeroes). That would be a sign that a gravitational wave passed through the instrument. It’s an amazing technological challenge, and extremely difficult to measure. \nWhat does the discovery mean for science? How does it change the way scientists observe the universe?\nThis is a breakthrough for science. Gravitational waves will help astrophysicists understand how gravity and black holes work. It also means we now have a whole new window in the universe: instead of observing the universe only with “standard” light (electromagnetic waves, which can be in the microwave, the infrared or the visible parts of the spectrum), we could hopefully now also use gravitational waves.\nWill this affect your own research?\nGravitational waves might also exist in the very early universe, in which case they are called “primordial” gravitational waves. If we can observe these, we can learn more about the very early universe. My colleagues working on the very early universe are thrilled by this discovery.\nWe live in a very special time for science. A hundred years after Einstein worked out his famous theory of gravity, we finally have the technological tools to study the night sky and understand his theory better. There are many things about his theory that scientists are testing today, and its centennial is very exciting for scientists worldwide.\nTo spread the excitement of Einstein’s theory, I collaborated in making a 3-min animation narrated by former “Dr Who” David Tennant on Einstein's theory, with award-winning animator Eoin Duffy and the director Jamie Lochhead.

{"id": 1155, "text": "More than a millennium of cultural heritage will be converted into an open digital archive, which will both preserve it and provide a virtual tool for navigating Venetian history. In a digital humanities project called the ‘Venice Time Machine’, EPFL researchers are developing the infrastructure and technology needed to convert the enormous amount of administrative manuscripts from Venice’s State Archives into a gigantic information system, in collaboration with Ca’ Foscari University. Today in Venice, Fondation Lombard Odier is joining the project as a funding partner. It has selected the Venice Time Machine for its exemplary combination of art, history, and science, and will support the researchers in their effort to develop the project’s digitalization and data exploitation workflows.\nSince the launch of the Venice Time Machine a year ago as part of a broad partnership in Digital Humanities with Ca’ Foscari University and Archivio di Stato, a team of over a hundred researchers and students has put tremendous effort into developing the project’s overall infrastructure, sorting and grouping the State Archives by format, and defining the unprecedented workflow for their mass digitization. The project is now supported by an international board of renowned scholars from Stanford, Columbia, Princeton, and Oxford. This board supervises the efforts of the international community to turn the Venice Time Machine into a fundamental resource for studying Venice and its historical mediterranean empire.\nTHE HERITAGE: 80 km of Interconnected Documents\n The State Archives of Venice contain a massive amount of hand-written documentation in languages evolving from medieval times to the 20th century. An estimated 80 km of shelves are filled with over a thousand years of administrative documents, from birth registrations, death certificates and tax statements, all the way to maps and urban planning designs. These documents are often very delicate and are occasionally in a fragile state of conservation.\nThe diversity, amount and accuracy of the Venetian administrative documents are unique in Western history. By combining this mass of information, it is possible to reconstruct large segments of the city’s past: complete biographies, political dynamics, or even the appearance of buildings and entire neighborhoods. “The documents are intricately interweaved, telling a much richer story when they are cross-referenced”, explains Raffaele Santoro, director of the Venice State Archives: “All of the documents here are somehow interconnected”.\nTHE VISION: Accessing the Venice Time Machine from the Cloud\nAt the moment, historians from around the world have to physically travel to Venice in order to consult a select number of documents in the State Archives. But could these documents be accessed from any computer in the world? Could we search these historical archives using automatically extracted keywords, especially considering that the documents themselves are hand-written? Could we cross-reference architecture plans across the ages and reconstruct Venetian streets and canals as they stood hundreds of years ago?\nThe Venice Time Machine will give the archives a new, virtual existence on the Web. It will reanimate Venice’s past life from them by re-creating social networks and family trees, and visualizing urban development and design. An open digital archive of Venetian treasures will provide an entirely new research environment. “With the Venice Time Machine, we will be able to research topics that were practically impossible before”, says historian Dorit Raines at Ca’Foscari University. Working on the Venice Time Machine, she would like to cross-reference and navigate through an estimated 300,000 inheritance wills to reconstruct the ownership of valuable assets throughout the centuries.\nTHE TECHNOLOGY: Big Data for the Archives\n There are multiple technical challenges associated with converting this unique and vast cultural heritage into a digital archive. An optimal workflow must be established for the accurate text recognition of millions of manuscripts. Mass digitization not only requires the systematic scanning of ancient manuscripts, but also the automatic processing of different hand-writing styles, as well as the analysis of Latin and several other languages as they evolve through time.\nGiven the immense quantity of data, mass digitization also requires the management, mining and classification of big data. The Venice Time Machine is built for this. For example, algorithms for automated text recognition continuously adapt and improve as data increase and databases of Venetian people and places grow larger.\n“The goal is to transform all of these records into a digital information database of the past”, says Frédéric Kaplan, an EPFL professor leading the Venice Time Machine. “The good news is that Big Data is not a problem; it is part of the solution.”\nAs part of the “Fondation Lombard Odier – EPFL venture fund” – dedicated to initiate, fund and develop ambitious EPFL strategic initiatives – the Fondation Lombard Odier is proud to join the Venice Time Machine Project as a funding partner. “This initiative resonates with our history, legacy and care for future generations as an institution established in 1796; it breaks new ground in the realm of Big Data and opens tremendous opportunities that are meaningful to our civilization”, says Thierry Lombard, President of the foundation. According to EPFL President Patrick Aebischer: “This collaboration began as a shared wish to celebrate past and future memories by capitalizing on the digitalization and exploitation of big data.”", "summary": "One of the oldest and most complete historical archives in the world is a step closer to being developed into an open digital archive.

{"id": 1156, "text": "If you tap the neck of a bottle of beer, it overflows with foam. But where do all these bubbles, which did not exist a split second before, come from? Pierre-François Conzelmann, mechanical engineering student specializing in aero and hydrodynamics, carried out his master's thesis on the subject. The young researcher performed various experiments at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities (LFMI) with a high-speed camera capable of recording 35’000 frames per second. He also compared the reactions of beer with those of sparkling water.\nActually, there are very small gas bubbles almost invisible to the naked eye already in the beer before the impact. \"They're called cavitation nuclei, explained Pierre-François Conzelmann. Their origins and exceptional stability are not completely understood yet. They also occupy micro glass cracks or cling to very fine dust particles which act as the nucleation sites originating the bubble columns observed in a glass of soft drink.\" For the experiments, the student tried to minimize the number of such sites by using a sterile container. Then, he artificially created two of them in the form of tiny incisions so he could observe and film the bubbles nesting there.\nPierre-François Conzelmann\nThe stiff blow to the mouth of the container generates a drop in the pressure inside. This causes micro-bubbles to grow, allowing the CO2 dissolved in the beer to penetrate inside them. Soon, they reach a critical point, implode and then break up into thousands of new bubbles that grow larger and rise more quickly to the surface. This is the same principle of cavitation, thoroughly studied in the field of navigation. The movement of boat propellers creates many bubbles, the bursting of which causes many micro-jets that accelerate the erosion of metal parts.\nStabilized surface\nThe same thing happens to sparkling water, said Pierre-François Conzelmann. By using a precision scale, he could establish that the liquid, either water or beer, under similar circumstances loses 20 mg of carbon dioxide with each blow. \"However, in the case of water, the bubbles merge very quickly into a new larger one which then bursts on the surface, whereas in the case of beer, the presence of surfactants prevents smaller bubbles from merging.\"\nSurfactants, also known as amphiphilic compounds, contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. They stabilize the surface tension of each of the bubbles, which as a result are preserved and form a compact cluster. This density, coupled with the heavy pressure exerted by the carbon dioxide towards the top of the bottle, is the reason why even the slightest shock usually provokes the discharge of a large amount of foam.", "summary": "Summer Series - Student Work (6): For his master's thesis, Pierre-François Conzelmann, mechanical engineering student, wanted to understand the reason behind the formation of a “foam volcano” after tapping the neck of a bottle of beer.

Their site, only accessible on the campus at the moment, is becoming a virtual forum for discussions on energy management. It has three objectives: to help consumers become aware of their energy consumption and allow them to share their experience, and to connect suppliers with consumers.\nTaking their cue from Switzerland’s goal of reducing electricity consumption by 35% between now and 2035 while at the same time limiting the impact of electricity generation on the environment, Jean-Charles Fosse, Johann Bigler and Alexandre Ringwald, long-time friends, wondered how consumers could be made to change their habits. “We spent a lot of time on this one question,” said Johann. “Preliminary work demonstrated that if people are aware of how much energy they consume, this alone will encourage them to find ways to cut back.” A sort of personal challenge.\nAnd the website suggests a number of ways to encourage the right mind-set. ThinkEE users can, for example, compare their electricity consumption with that of their neighbors, in addition to interacting and exchanging ideas with them and other users. Something like Facebook focused on electricity consumption.\n‘Experience points’ are awarded not for reducing watts consumed but rather for the useful tips that users share with others. And users can create groups, to ensure the confidentiality of their data. Only general feedback from multiple users is made public.\nMotivated by comfort\n Comfort can also be a source of motivation. Or rather discomfort, such as: an overheated classroom, hallway lights that are always on, and a building that’s cold in winter. “Let's look at EPFL: if a lot of students feel it’s too hot in an auditorium and mention it on our website, the facility management can reduce the temperature, which will at the same time reduce electricity consumption,” said Jean-Charles. Connecting users of the electrical grid will encourage them to propose changes to energy suppliers, to property managers in the case of rental apartments, and to facilities managers in office buildings.\nIn an environment where outlets and devices are equipped with sensors, as is the case in some EPFL buildings, users can see how much energy their devices use in real time. So they can simply have a look at the sensor, modify their behavior and share their observations on the new energy social network. Until this sensor technology makes its way into their homes, people can manually enter the various types of consumption.\nNew developments in 2016?\n The three students, who are now in their internship semester, are thinking about what’s next for their website. Maybe they’ll turn it into a start-up when they come back in 2016.\nFor Alexandre, this project gave them a taste of engineering in the real world. “Taking the initiative, meeting deadlines and working as a team will be fundamental aspects of our future profession.

{"id": 1165, "text": "A closed door is just one of many obstacles that no longer pose a barrier to the small flying robots developed jointly by Stanford University and Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. Equipped with advanced gripping technology – inspired by gecko and insect feet – and able to interact with the world around them, these robots can work together to lasso a door handle and tug the door open.\nThese FlyCroTugs – flying, micro, tugging robots – came out of the laboratories run by Mark Cutkosky, the Fletcher Jones Chair in the School of Engineering at Stanford University, and Dario Floreano, at EPFL’s School of Engineering.\nFlyCroTugs are micro air vehicles that the researchers modified so that they can anchor themselves to various surfaces using gecko adhesives and microspines. Thanks to these mechanisms, FlyCroTugs can pull objects up to 40 times their weight, such as door handles or, in a rescue scenario, cameras and water bottles. Similar vehicles produced by other researchers can tug objects only about twice their weight.\n“When you're a small robot, the world is full of large obstacles,” says Matthew Estrada, a graduate student at Stanford. Estrada worked on this project in Floreano’s  at EPFL and is the lead author of a paper published in \nScience Robotics\n. “By combining the aerodynamic forces of our vehicle and the interactive forces generated by the attachment mechanisms, we were able to come up with something that is very mobile, very strong and very small.”\nThe researchers note that the FlyCroTugs, because of their size, can safely navigate through tight spaces and fairly close to people. This makes them a good candidate for search and rescue missions. And by holding on tightly to surfaces as they tug, the tiny robots could potentially move pieces of debris or position a camera to evaluate a dangerous situation.\nTaking a cue from nature\nFlyCroTugs were inspired by nature. When the researchers began working on an air vehicle that would be fast, small, highly maneuverable and able to move large loads, they first looked at wasps.\n“Wasps fly quickly to a piece of food, and if it’s too heavy to carry off, they drag it along the ground. This observation was the genesis of our approach,” said Cutkosky, a co-author of the paper.\nBy analyzing studies on how wasps capture and transport prey, the researchers were able to identify the ratio of flight-related muscle to total mass that determines whether a wasp carries its prey or drags it. Wasps also inspired them to develop various attachment options depending on where the FlyCroTugs land. For smooth surfaces, the robots have gecko grippers, a non-sticky adhesive that mimics a gecko’s intricate toe structures. They hold on by creating intermolecular forces between the adhesive and the surface. For rough surfaces, these robots are equipped with 32 microspines, a series of fish-hook-like metal spikes that can individually latch onto small pits in a surface.\nIn order to tug a payload, each FlyCroTug has a winch with a cable and either microspines or gecko grippers. Those are its only fixed features; the rest are highly modifiable. The location of the grippers can be moved, depending on the expected landing surface, and the researchers can add parts – such as wheels – for ground locomotion. Packing all these features onto a small air vehicle that weighs just a few ounces was not easy.\n“People tend to think of drones as machines that fly and observe the world. But flying insects do many other things, such as walking, climbing, grasping and building. Social insects can even work together and combine their strength,” says Floreano, the study’s lead senior author. “Through our research, we show that small drones are capable of anchoring themselves to surfaces around them and cooperating with fellow drones. This enables them to perform tasks typically assigned to humanoid robots or much larger machines.”\nInteracting with the world\n At a time when drones and other small flying robots are all the rage, the FlyCroTugs – with their ability to perch, climb, push and pull – really stand out, according to Cutkosky.\nUsing two FlyCroTugs, the researchers were able to open a door. They also had one haul a camera to the top of a crumbling structure to peer inside. Next, they hope to work on autonomous control and the logistics of flying several vehicles at once.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and Stanford have developed small drones that can land and then move objects that are 40 times their weight, with the help of powerful winches, gecko adhesives and microspines.", "claim": "Researchers from EPFL and Stanford have developed small drones that can land and then move objects that are one times their weight, with the help of powerful winches, gecko adhesives and microspines.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [18, 18], "noise": false}

Its construction, which began in August 2014, was carried out by the general contractor Marti Construction SA. Almost half of the 35,5 million franc building, including facilities, was financed using private funds.\n“Beyond its architectural envelope, ArtLab is a research initiative through which EPFL, together with its partners, is setting off to explore a new world: that of digital humanities,” says Patrick Aebischer, president of EPFL. “It’s an emerging field full of scientific questions and challenges that play out at many levels. For example, our projects often produce enormous amounts of data. Merely transforming this big data into something useful and exploitable requires substantial research – it’s extremely stimulating.”\nTechnology for music, art...\nThe ArtLab building, which long went by its project name Under One Roof, is composed of three distinct spaces, all of which are open to the public. At its southern end, the Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL is dedicated to presenting the famous festival’s archives, which are inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. Besides leading the digitization and preservation of the recordings as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, EPFL has designed devices to browse, visualize, and listen to the archives that will be available to the public. In the Montreux Jazz Heritage Lab, visitors will be able to fully immerse themselves into the festival’s concerts. The Montreux Jazz Digital Project, which involved several EPFL laboratories, was made possible thanks to the support of several partners.\n At the center of the building, in an experimental exhibition space, the Gandur Foundation for Art will present its first exhibit organized in partnership with EPFL. Using technology developed by five EPFL laboratories and related startups, the Outrenoirs by Pierre Soulages will be presented in a way never seen before, using approaches such as ultrafast photography and hyperspectral cameras. The exhibit, entitled \"Noir, c’est noir?\" (Is black black?), explores the interaction between light and the French artist’s work.\n... and big data\nFinally, at the building’s northern end, the DataSquare will host a long-term exhibition on big data, represented by two major EPFL research initiatives: the Blue Brain Project and Venice Time Machine. These two complex initiatives have a common denominator in their relationship with data and the need to share their findings with the general public. In the DataSquare, they will be the subjects of highly interactive presentations. The exhibition will also include an innovative interface that visualizes key data about EPFL in which the school itself will be examined through the lens of big data. The DataSquare is funded, in particular, by the watch brand Rolex.\n These three public spaces will enliven life on the campus. The ArtLab building borders Place Cosandey, which stretches from the Esplanade to the Rolex Learning Center. This vast area is being completely reorganized according to plans made by students from the Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE), an architecture lab at EPFL, on the basis of a survey of the campus population.

{"id": 1177, "text": "Superconductors are materials that allow electrical current to flow with no energy loss, a phenomenon that can lead to a vastly energy-efficient future (imagine computers that never overheat). Although most superconductors work close to absolute zero (0°K or -273.15°C), some can operate at higher temperatures (around -135°C) – but how that happens is something of a mystery. Publishing in , Fabrizio Carbone’s  at EPFL has developed a method that can shed light on “high-temperature” superconductivity.\nHow conventional superconductivity works\nWhen electricity passes through a conductor, e.g. a wire, some energy is lost because of resistance. This is not always a bad thing, since it can be used for heat (radiators) or light (light bulbs). But when it comes to things like national energy grids and high-voltage cables, electrical resistance (up to 7% in some grids) can mean money and constant wear.\nThis is where superconductors come in. These are materials that, when cooled down enough, conduct electricity with no resistance – and therefore no loss. How? As superconductors cool below a certain temperature, their atoms fall in line and “nudge” charge-carrying electrons together to make new particles called Cooper pairs. These electron pairs observe quantum physics and form an unusual state of matter (a Bose-Einstein Condensate) that is not affected by electrical resistance.\nSuperconductors can revolutionize the way we use and distribute energy, change modes of transportation (e.g. Japan’s magnetic levitation trains) and give us 100% energy-efficient technology. So why hasn’t that happened yet? The problem is temperature: Most superconductors only work when they are cooled close to the forbidding absolute zero. The solution lies with those that work at higher temperatures.\nA new method for exploring high-temperature superconductivity\nRecently, the lab of Fabrizio Carbone at EPFL addressed the issue by developing a novel method that can advance our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) show promise because they can operate at temperatures around -135°C – still low, but considerably cheaper and more feasible than for conventional superconductors. However, progress in HTS is limited because, even though we know that Cooper pairs are involved in high-temperature superconductivity, there is no consensus as to how they are formed.\nCarbone’s group was able, for the first time, to directly observe the formation of Cooper pairs in real time in a superconducting HTS and determine how the process affects the optical properties of the superconductor. Using a novel approach, the scientists cooled an HTS to its superconducting temperature and then repeatedly fired laser pulses on it to break up the Cooper pairs back into single electrons. As the Cooper pairs broke and re-formed, they caused a periodical change in the color spectrum of the superconductor. By measuring the color change, the researchers were able to directly study what happens in a superconducting HTS. What they discovered was that Cooper pair formation follows a completely different path than in conventional superconductors.\nCarbone’s findings mark the first direct observation of Cooper pair formation in HTS superconductivity. They also provide scientists with a powerful tool to observe the phenomenon in real time. The hope is that by extending this innovative approach to different materials, we can begin to understand how high-temperature superconductivity really works.", "summary": "Superconductors can radically change energy management as we know it, but most are commercially unusable because they only work close to absolute zero.

The beta version of this software program will be available online starting today.\nCreating a 3D scenario ten times faster\nImverse’s time-saving technology could come in handy in a wide range of fields, such as real estate, architects, graphic designers, decorators and photgraphers – engineers could even use it for certain kinds of modeling. But the EPFL spin-off is initially setting its sights on the movie, medias and video game industry, where its software could be used for such tasks as sketching out scenarios in 3D, previewing movie sets and how they could change during a film and mapping out the locations of cameras and actors. “Producers can use it to take a photo of a real set, convert the 360 degrees image into a 3D environment and then, using virtual reality, edit it in order to visualize the scene before they film it. And they’ll be able to do these things ten times faster than with conventional programs,” says Javier Bello, the startup’s co-founder and CEO.\nSetting its sights on the movie industry from the start may seem ambitious, but the company has done its homework. Imverse’s founders have already begun feeling out the industry and making contacts, including at Sundance – the largest independent film festival in the US – early this year, and then later at the Cannes Film Festival. “Our first target market is the entertainment industry, because people who work there are already familiar with the types of software used for visual effects and motion capture. They can quickly grasp how our program can simplify their work and save them time,” adds Bello. What’s more, going after the movie and game industry will put them into contact with heavyweights like Intel, Microsoft and Oculus.\nA voxel-based, high-potential technology\nImverse is also aiming high for another reason: the technology on which its software is based can be used for many other applications. The company’s powerful voxel-based rendering engine obviates the need for those notorious polygon grids so familiar to video-game and animated-film makers. Voxels are not new, but until recently they required too much computing power to be feasible for real-time rendering.\n“This technology was developed over the past 12 years at EPFL’s Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, for use in neurology research.

{"id": 1188, "text": "In 2012, EPFL announced its intention to design and launch CleanSpace One, a satellite whose mission is to begin to clean up the thousands of bits of jettisoned rocket and satellite components orbiting Earth at speeds of more than 28,000 km/h. The mission is crucial for the future of the space industry. Now Swiss Space Systems – S3 has joined the project. The Swiss company is developing a new method to launch satellites weighing up to 250 kg, and will take charge of CleanSpace One’s launch, now scheduled for 2018. EPFL and S3 announced their partnership publicly on September 10, 2013. \nCleanSpace One, a satellite to clean up Earth’s orbit\nThe debris orbiting Earth is accumulating. Although collisions with functioning satellites are rare, each collision can generate several thousand new bits of debris. The problem is becoming increasingly serious and making space missions more complicated. \n CleanSpace One’s mission is to grab hold of a piece of space junk – in this case an out-of-commission Swiss nanosatellite measuring 10cm on each side – and thrust it into the atmosphere, where it will burn up. Navigating to and seizing the ex-satellite is a formidable feat of engineering. \nA three-phase launch\nSwiss Space Systems – S3 is now the Prime partner in this project. The company, headquartered in Payerne, Switzerland, is developing a new launch method for small satellites up to hundreds of kilograms in weight. A small shuttle rides piggyback atop an A300 jetliner. When the plane reaches cruising altitude, this Suborbital Reusable Shuttle (SOAR) lights its engines and takes off upwards. When it reaches an altitude of 80km, it ejects a vessel, which after reaching an altitude of 700 km, releases the satellite into Earth’s orbit. Both the Airbus and the shuttle are reusable and use standard fuels, making the system very cost-effective.\n The goal of this three-phase process is to make space more accessible – it cuts launch costs by a factor of four. And to make sure that this doesn’t end up putting even more space debris in Earth orbit, S3 will ensure that all the elements in the chain – including the satellites – include their own re-entry systems. In this context, their partnership with CleanSpace One makes perfect sense.\n “You can’t democratize space access without having a responsible attitude,” says Pascal Jaussi, CEO of Swiss Space Systems. “If we don’t deal with the problem of orbiting space debris and its accumulation, future generations’ access to space will be compromised.”\n The company will take care of launching CleanSpace One, which in 2018 will be the first satellite launched into orbit using the new method. All told, Swiss Space Systems will invest at least CHF 15 million in the project – CHF 10 million for the launch itself and CHF 5 million for assembling and testing satellite components and ground-based command operations.\nThe satellite design is on the right track \nAt EPFL, the project has made considerable progress since its public announcement in 2012. The design is slightly different – it’s a bit bigger than originally planned, and will weigh about 30 kg. Scientists have tested many technologies that could potentially be integrated into the satellite, some that are already on the market, and others still in the development stages in companies and universities.\n Finally, as part of a partnership with the European Space Agency, researchers are developing many key technologies targeting space debris – propulsion, navigation and reconnaissance systems and, above all, a device that can anchor itself to pieces of debris. ETH Zurich, CSEM and the Swiss Universities of Applied Science are participating in this as well.

{"id": 1189, "text": "Multicolor fluorescence microscopy is an important tool for the life sciences to study the relative arrangements of cellular structures or the interactions of different proteins. However, conventional microscopes, the workhorses for many biological studies, can only resolve details on the order of the wavelength of light. In the past two decades, several super-resolution microscopy concepts helped researchers to overcome this diffraction limit and to make new discoveries. These new methods are only slowly finding their way into routine biological applications. For some of the new techniques, this is due to complex microscope hardware, but also increased demands on sample preparation and fluorescent labels pose significant hurdles. The requirements for successful super-resolution imaging are even more challenging to meet for multicolor applications.\nEPFL’s Laboratory of Biomedical Optics headed by Theo Lasser has been extensively working on Super-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) to increase the spatial resolution and sampling in 2D and 3D. SOFI is an alternative to Single-molecule Localization Microscopy techniques such as STORM and PALM. It analyzes higher order spatio-temporal statistics of a time-series of blinking fluorophores and does not require the isolation of individual fluorophores′ emissions. SOFI is compatible with a wider range of labeling and imaging conditions, which simplifies fluorophore selection and experiments. In their new study, researchers in the School of Engineering led by Theo Lasser and Aleksandra Radenovic (head of the Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology) extended the statistical analysis into the spectral domain to pave the way towards a new approach for multicolor super-resolution imaging.\nThe number of colors is not limited by the microscope’s spectral channels or Exploiting spectral crosstalk\nThe idea behind the multicolor SOFI approach is the following. In classical multicolor imaging crosstalk between different spectral channels of the microscope should be avoided. Here, the researchers exploit the crosstalk for generating additional color channels. They apply cross-cumulant analysis between multiple simultaneously acquired spectral channels. The statistical analysis allows them to supplement the physical detection channels provided by the microscope with additional virtual spectral channels. “Only the signals that are spatially and temporally correlated in the different spectral channels will appear in the virtual channels. We are picking up exactly the crosstalk that everyone else wants to get rid of.” explains Kristin Grußmayer, one of the lead authors of the study. The additional computationally generated spectral channels together with linear unmixing allow the imaging of more distinct fluorophore colors than recorded physical detection channels.\n The publication provides the theory behind spectral cross-cumulant multicolor SOFI and includes a framework to optimize the spectral channels of the microscope for a given combination of fluorophores that should be imaged. Simulated datasets helped the team to verify that their new multicolor approach should work for a wide range of labels with different photophysical properties, even for those with strongly overlapping emission spectra. “We could show that our approach works for three color imaging in fixed and in living cells for a variety of dyes and fluorescent proteins. The imaging can be performed using commercial widefield setups with two-channel image splitting units that are widely available. In principle, we are not limited to 3 colors.” says Kristin Grußmayer.\nInstructions for performing multicolor spectral cross-cumulant SOFI analysis are available on the webpage of the Laboratory of Nanoscale biology under https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lben/sofi-packages/ and the software package can be downloaded at", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have developed robust and easy-to-implement multicolor super-resolution imaging.

{"id": 1197, "text": "A number of studies have compared various energy-transition scenarios for Switzerland in terms of CO\n2\n emissions and final energy and electricity consumption. But few studies have looked at the economic impact of the country’s energy transition. Researchers at EPFL have addressed this shortcoming by looking at how three realistic scenarios would affect Switzerland's energy situation in 2050.\nUnder the first, “status quo” scenario, the federal government's 2011 energy policy remains in place with no additional measures. The second scenario looks at what the situation will be like in 2050 if measures recently adopted by the Federal Council are fully implemented. And the third scenario is based on the federal government's new 2050 energy policy (a vote on the first round of measures already took place, on 21 May 2017).\nUsing , the online calculator developed by  and the Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering (IPESE) laboratory, the researchers analyzed the impact that each of these scenarios would have in terms of jobs, energy-related costs and Switzerland’s energy independence.\nRenewable energy and increased energy efficiency boost energy independence\nThe third, “new energy policy” scenario turned out to be the best in terms of Switzerland’s energy independence. The use of locally sourced renewable energy – such as solar, wind, hydro and wood-based power – combined with an improvement in the energy efficiency of cars and buildings would result in a sharp decrease in energy imports such as heating oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas. The country’s energy independence would increase from 26% today to around 72% by 2050 under this scenario. With the second scenario, in which the Federal Council's energy measures are brought in, the level would increase to just 46%. And unsurprisingly, Switzerland’s energy independence would remain at 26% under the first, “status quo” scenario (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Energy independence \nEnergy efficiency creates jobs\nThe energyscope.ch calculator also now includes a new tool for analyzing the impact of energy-efficiency measures on jobs, recently developed by the Energy Center and the Laboratory of Environmental and Urban Economics (LEURE).\nThe results show that there would be 35% more jobs in Switzerland’s energy-related sectors under the “new energy policy” scenario than under the other two scenarios. “This is mainly because new measures to increase energy efficiency would create jobs, particularly when it comes to building renovation, where a large part of the value added would be generated by local companies in Switzerland,” says Professor Philippe Thalmann from LEURE. “The other scenarios rely more heavily on fuel imports, which would account for a larger proportion of costs and produce fewer jobs locally” (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Employement \nWhat’s more, under the “new energy policy” scenario, the number of jobs in the transport sector would increase as the focus shifted more towards public transportation. However, the rise in the number of electric cars, which require much less maintenance than gasoline- and diesel-powered cars, would probably result in fewer jobs in the automobile sector.\nIn their study, the researchers looked at each sector directly linked to energy production and distribution. They used an input-output model to estimate the number of jobs created as a result of the energy transition, looking at the structural impact on the economy based on current energy prices.\nSimilar costs for all three scenarios\nUnder all three scenarios, the calculator put the annual costs of each energy system at around 24 billion francs (excluding taxes). This figure includes infrastructure costs (such as the power grid, production units, etc.), the costs of enhancing energy efficiency, and the cost of importing petroleum products, natural gas and electricity.\nThe investment needed for the three scenarios varied by less than 10% (see Figure 3). So after factoring in a margin of uncertainty, no one scenario stands out as being more expensive than the others. However, the future costs of the scenarios that rely more heavily on fossil fuels are more uncertain; such energy systems are exposed to oil and gas prices, which are more difficult to forecast over the long term than clean tech prices are.\n“This is not really all that surprising,” says Professor François Maréchal from IPESE. “Renewable energy, coupled with greater energy efficiency, would of course require additional investment, but this would be offset by the decrease in fuel imports. On top of that, renewable energy – and especially photovoltaic solar power – and energy-efficient solutions like electric cars will keep getting cheaper.”\nFigure 3: Costs", "summary": "A handful of EPFL laboratories teamed up to compare three energy-transition scenarios that vary in their use of fossil fuels and renewable energy and their energy efficiency.

This is due to, for example, insufficient knowledge or expertise to install the device, missing electrical cables, or the absence of qualified personnel. And the remaining 30% often can no longer be used when it becomes necessary to order accessories or spare parts. The vast majority of the inhabitants of these countries has no access to such essential equipment as X-ray machines, incubators for newborn babies or equipment for anesthetics. EssentialMed, a start-up established in September 2010 at the Science Park at Ecublens, is working to improve this situation.\n This is indeed a vast project since, to be effective, the device must be adapted to the context in which it is to be used. “This means we have to completely re-think each device, integrating in its design effective solutions to the recurring problems in these countries. These can include: an electricity network that is often defective, resulting in excessive voltages that damage the device; a lack of financial resources for the purchase of the device and the accessories necessary for its functioning; complexity of utilization for poorly trained personnel; or theft”, emphasizes Klaus Schönenberger, one of the founders, who has spent around ten years in the management team of a multinational company manufacturing medical devices. This is the context to the signing of a cooperation agreement with EPFL.The cooperation unit and the UNESCO chair in technology for development are working in close collaboration with this rather special start-up, which is constituted as a foundation and is a not-for-profit organization. “We must not only support progress, but also access to these inventions”, insisted Patrick Aebischer, President of EPFL, at the launch of the start-up in the Science Park. \n Three EPFL laboratories involved\n The first target is an X-ray machine. “We often speak about infectious diseases when we’re thinking about health problems in developing countries, but road accidents are unfortunately among the main causes of death or handicap. In fact, 90% of these accidents take place in the southern hemisphere”, explains Klaus Schönenberger. Two-thirds of humanity has no access to medical imaging equipment, although it is obviously essential in such circumstances. The development work has been broken down into different “technological modules”: the X-ray source (the tube), the X-ray detector (creation of the image), the electric power unit, the mechanical stand, the image-treatment system, and the user interface. The device will include a solution that will enable it to continue functioning in spite of frequent electricity cuts. It must also be robust and require only a minimum of maintenance, while enabling the creation of images in high temperatures, as well as high levels of humidity and dust.\n Three EPFL laboratories are providing their know-how to respond to some of the challenges involved: the Laboratory of Industrial Electronics, the Laboratory of Composite and Polymer Technology, and the Audio Visual Communications Laboratory. The Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen is providing know-how in X-ray technology, and is treating the project with high importance. The HEIG-VD school in Yverdon will also be contributing to the project, as will the Institute of Tropical Medicine and Public Health in Basel. “The objective is to create a prototype that can be operational three years from now. However, the foundation is still looking for financial partners – foundations, sponsors or philanthropists – who are equally motivated by the challenges of this project.” The goal is to ensure that the device is adapted to developing countries, but also to reduce its price and that of its accessories by a factor of ten.

That record has been held since 2012 by the Vestas Sailrocket 2, skippered by Australian Paul Larsen, which achieved an average speed of 65.45 knots (121.1km/h) over a distance of 500 meters. EPFL’s team of sailing fanatics is aiming for 80 knots (148km/h), hence , the name of the project on which they have been working for almost a year now. \"If we're going to set a new record, we may as well aim high,\" laughs Benoît, a third-year mechanics undergraduate.\nGaudiot, van den Broek and Lepercq got to know each other at EPFL through the Hydrocontest competition. They each chose to come to EPFL because they were inspired by projects such as Alinghi and . When they first met, the conversation turned to kitesurfing, sailing, speed and winter sports: they quickly realized they had a lot in common, and their complementary skills have resulted in the SP80 project.\nAll three men are French. Van den Broek, who hails from Brittany, works as a scientist in EPFL's  (LPAC). He’s a very experienced sailor, having started when he was a boy. Impressively, he crossed the Pacific Ocean in summer 2019 as skipper of the . Gaudiot, originally from Toulon, is a talented kitesurfer with a taste for speed. In 2015, aged 17, he finished third in the  competition. Xavier Lepercq, from Lyon, is the team’s “mad scientist,” as his colleagues affectionately call him. He works as an engineer in the R&D department of , a producer of composite materials that played a part in the success of the Alinghi and Solar Impulse 2 projects. Around seven years ago, he bought a boat and taught himself to sail, just as he taught himself kitesurfing.\nOvercoming cavitation\nWith their diverse skill set, the trio behind SP80 have designed a kiteboat capable of beating the world speed record. The carbon-fibre boat is seven meters long and six meters wide, and it weighs 150kg. It features superventilating triangular hydrofoils and is pulled by a kitewing. “We based our design on the foil technology used by Vestas, which allows us to overcome the cavitation phenomenon. Since there was little on this in the scientific literature, we built our own kiteboards and tested various shapes of hydrofoils last summer,” explains van den Broek. Gaudiot, the kiteboat’s designated skipper, adds: “In the most recent test, I reached 41 knots [around 76km/h]. We were surprised to find that the boat’s profile became more stable at speed.”\nConfident that they are on the right path, SP80’s three founders have started to refine the technology and the boat’s design using a sailing simulator developed by Lepercq. “Beating a speed record is a marathon, not a sprint,” emphasizes Gaudiot. Since fall 2019, the three founders have been supported by a team of 16 current and former EPFL students. “We’ve got an incredible team, in which everyone contributes their expertise,” notes Robin Amacher, an engineer at LPAC and coordinator of the SP80 project. “Gradually, the team has come together and the people involved complement each other very well, with a wide range of skills in areas such as performance composites, hydrodynamics and onboard electronics.” This summer, SP80 received support from EPFL via the , set up by the Vice Presidency for Education. The projects supported by MAKE not only receive financial support but can also use workspaces featuring cutting-edge equipment, as , and they benefit from professional support and guidance. “SP80’s core naturally consists of our design team and the student club, but we shouldn’t forget the laboratories that are contributing their expertise, the MAKE network – including industry workshops – and our partner companies. All parts of the team are pulling in the same direction and creating an exceptional environment for our project,” says Amacher, who worked on the Hydroptère.\nEPFL’s support also means that the students’ work on SP80 will count as a semester project or a Master’s project. Sailing enthusiast Aurore Kerr, the team’s community manager, is one of SP80’s four students who have taken this option. She is completing her Master’s project in EPFL’s  on the subject of superventilating hydrofoils. “We can use the cavitation tunnel to test various hydrofoil profiles,” she says. “The technology was tested several times during the Cold War, but as time has gone on, the more we see only digital simulations being used.”\nThe team is also gaining recognition in the sailing community, to its great satisfaction. “We have a credible project, which has already allowed us to hold discussions with some very high-level teams, ones that really inspire us,” says van den Broek. With a target budget of around 1,6 million, SP80 raised enough money to develop a prototype in 2020, which it will test on Lake Geneva in 2021 before seeking to break the speed record in 2022. Yet they are not the only ones in the running: a French team is also eyeing the record. As a quirk of fate, Gaudiot’s brother – who completed his Master’s at EPFL’s LMH – is working on the rival project. “We know the other team, and the fact that there are two teams taking up the challenge is a big motivation,” says Gaudiot.

The event was held on Saturday, 21 November and attracted more than 6000 visitors. They streamed to the school’s Ecublens campus starting at 9:30am, where they were met by 250 EPFL staff members and students. The visitors made the rounds of the festival, checking out the laboratories, taking part in the workshops and attending the conferences, while children joined in a treasure hunt, collecting the various parts of a solar gadget that they could assemble and take home. Visitors quenched their thirst for knowledge at the “How it works\" space, where an interactive exhibition staffed by scientists meant that everyone found answers to all their questions.\n“It was a real success, and we are obviously very pleased,” said Farnaz Moser, the head of EPFL’s Science Outreach Department, which organized the festival. In addition to the public’s curiosity about EPFL in general, “the large turnout also reflects people’s strong interest in the sciences,” she said. “Energy is an issue that affects all of society but has particular importance for the younger generation. It is encouraging to see that young people really want to understand the issues and challenges that await them.”\nScientastic follows in the footsteps of the Robotics Festival, an event that regularly drew large crowds to EPFL. Like its forebear, Scientastic organizes edifying activities for the public – young and old alike – but covers a broader range of topics and interests. The end goal remains the same: to inform the wider public of social issues that scientific research may be able to help solve, as well as to encourage a career in the sciences. “Our country’s brain power is still our number one resource, and we need to cultivate it,” said Ms. Moser.\nPlanning for the 2016 Scientastic has already begun.

{"id": 1209, "text": "EPFL's fifth annual robot competition drew a sizeable crowd to the Salle Polyvalente this past week. Who were the stars of the show? Five autonomous robots, developed by EPFL students, which took turns strutting their stuff in the arena. Their mission was to collect recyclable plastic bottles scattered around the floor and deliver them to a collection point, while navigating around various obstacles. Each bottle represented a certain number of points depending on its position in the arena.\nThe robot named Baby won with pizzazz: it shot the bottles directly at the collection point with its integrated cannon while AC/DC music pumped in the background. Baby racked up 100 points, using its four sensors - three at ground level and one on top - to tell the bottles from the obstacles. Its approach is simple. When it encounters a bottle, its adhesive mechanical arm swings down, picks it up and drops it into its bin. Then, it shoots the bottles through the air towards the collection point with a cannon. \"The robot has an electronic compass to aim its cannon,\" said Chiara Ercolani, one of Baby's designers. \"And the power of the cannon is adjusted for the distance between the robot and the collection point.\" Antoine Tardy added: \"We thought it would be a waste of time for the robot to go back and forth to the collection point. And the idea of a cannon was really cool.\"\nOnce it had won, Baby had to face off against last year's winner, Conchitor. That robot, with its caterpillar tracks, collected 97.5 points. Not bad, but not enough to beat Baby.\nThe award for the \"coolest\" robot went to Système D, which changed color depending on whether its bin was full or empty.

{"id": 1217, "text": "In early October 2019, when an unknown caller rang EPFL professor Johan Gaume’s cell phone, he could hardly have imagined that he was about to confront one of the greatest mysteries in Soviet history. At the other end of the line, a journalist from New York asked for  into a tragedy that had occurred 60 years earlier in Russia’s northern Ural Mountains – one that has since come to be known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. Gaume, head of EPFL’s  (SLAB) and visiting fellow at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF, had never heard of the case, which the Russian Public Prosecutor’s Office had recently resurrected from Soviet-era archives. \"I asked the journalist to call me back the following day so that I could gather more information. What I learned intrigued me.\"\nA sporting challenge that ended in tragedy\nOn 27 January 1959, a ten-member group consisting mostly of students from the Ural Polytechnic Institute, led by 23-year-old Igor Dyatlov – all seasoned cross-country and downhill skiers – set off on a 14-day expedition to the Gora Otorten mountain, in the northern part of the Soviet Sverdlovsk Oblast. At that time of the year, a route of this kind was classified Category III – the riskiest category – with temperatures falling as low as –30°C. On January 28, one member of the expedition, Yuri Yudin, decided to turn back. He never saw his classmates again. \nDyatlov's group on February 1st on their way to Kholat Syakhl. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation\nWhen the group’s expected return date to the departure point, the village of Vizhay, came and went, a rescue team set out to search for them. On 26 February, they found the group’s tent, badly damaged, on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl – translated as “Death Mountain” – some 20 km south of the group’s destination. The group’s belongings had been left behind. Further down the mountain, beneath an old Siberian cedar tree, they found two bodies clad only in socks and underwear. Three other bodies, including that of Dyatlov, were subsequently found between the tree and the tent site; presumably, they had succumbed to hypothermia while attempting to return to the camp. Two months later, the remaining four bodies were discovered in a ravine beneath a thick layer of snow. Several of the deceased had serious injuries, such as fractures to the chest and skull.\nI was so intrigued that I began researching this theory more deeply\nJohan Gaume\nWhat exactly happened?\nThe Soviet authorities investigated to determine the causes of this strange drama, but closed it after three months, concluding that a “compelling natural force” had caused the death of the hikers. In the absence of survivors,  is unclear to this day, and has led to countless more or less fanciful theories, from murderous Yeti to secret military experiments.\nThe tent as it was discovered by the rescue group, on 26 Feb 1959. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation\nThis is the mystery that Gaume was confronted with. “After the call from the American reporter, I began writing equations and figures on my blackboard, trying to understand what might have happened in purely mechanical terms,” he says. “When the reporter rang back, I told her it was likely that an avalanche had taken the group by surprise as they lay sleeping in the tent.” This theory, which is the most plausible, was also put forward by the Russian Public Prosecutor’s Office after the investigation was reopened in 2019 at the request of the victims’ relatives. But the lack of evidence and the existence of odd elements has failed to convince a large portion of Russian society. “I was so intrigued that I began researching this theory more deeply. I then contacted Professor Alexander Puzrin, chair of , whom I had met a month earlier at a conference in France.”\nThe Dyatlov Pass mystery has become part of Russia's national folklore. When I told my wife that I was going to work on it, she looked at me with deep respect!\nAlexander Puzrin\nGaume, originally from France, and Russian-born Puzrin worked together to comb through the archives, which had been opened to the public after the fall of the Soviet Union. They also spoke with other scientists and experts in the incident, and developed analytical and numerical models to reconstruct the avalanche that may have caught the nine victims unaware.\nDyatlov group monument erected in 1962 in Mihaylovskoe cemetery, Sverdlovsk. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation\n“The Dyatlov Pass mystery has become part of Russia's national folklore. When I told my wife that I was going to work on it, she looked at me with deep respect!” says Puzrin. “I was quite keen to do it, especially because I had started working on slab avalanches two years earlier. My primary research is in the field of landslides; I study what happens when a certain amount of time elapses between when a landslide is triggered and when it actually occurs.” According to Gaume and Puzrin, this is what happened in 1959: the hikers had made a cut in the mountain’s snow-covered slope to set up their tent, but the avalanche didn't occur until several hours later.\nOne of the main reasons why the avalanche theory is still not fully accepted is that the authorities have not provided an explanation of how it happened\nJohan Gaume\nBridging the gaps in the investigation\n“One of the main reasons why the avalanche theory is still not fully accepted is that the authorities have not provided an explanation of how it happened,” says Gaume. In fact, there are a number of points that contradict that theory: first, the rescue team did not find any obvious evidence of an avalanche or debris. Then the average angle of the slope above the tent site – less than 30° – was not steep enough for an avalanche. Also, if an avalanche occurred, it was triggered at least nine hours after the cut was made in the slope. And finally, the chest and skull injuries observed on some victims were not typical of avalanche victims.\nConfiguration of the Dyatlov group’s tent installed on a flat surface after making a cut in the slope below a small shoulder. Snow deposition above the tent is due to wind transport of snow. \n© \nGaume/Puzrin\nIn their investigation, published in \nCommunications Earth & Environment\n – a new journal by Nature Research – on\nJanuary 28, Gaume and Puzrin attempt to address these points. “We use data on snow friction and local topography to prove that a small slab avalanche could occur on a gentle slope, leaving few traces behind. With the help of computer simulations, we show that the impact of a snow slab can lead to injuries similar to those observed. And then, of course, there’s the time lag between the team cutting into the slope and the triggering of the event. That’s the main focus of our article. Previous investigators have been unable to explain how, in the absence of any snowfall that evening, an avalanche could have been triggered in the middle of the night. We had to come up with a new theory to explain it,” says Gaume.\nSimulation of the dynamics of a snow-slab avalanche and its impact on a human body. \n© \nGaume/Puzrin\nOn the night of the tragedy, one of the most important contributing factors was the presence of katabatic winds – i.e., winds that carry air down a slope under the force of gravity. These winds could have transported the snow, which would have then accumulated uphill from the tent due to a specific feature of the terrain that the team members were unaware of. “If they hadn’t made a cut in the slope, nothing would have happened. That was the initial trigger, but that alone wouldn’t have been enough. The katabatic wind probably drifted the snow and allowed an extra load to build up slowly. At a certain point, a crack could have formed and spread, causing the snow slab to release,” says Puzrin.\nJohan Gaume and Alexander Puzrin making a proof of concept of the Dyatlov case in Davos, Switzerland. © Jamani Caillet\nBoth scientists are nevertheless cautious about their findings, and make it clear that much about the incident remains a mystery. “The truth, of course, is that no one really knows what happened that night. But we do provide strong quantitative evidence that the avalanche theory is plausible,” Puzrin continues.\nThe two models developed for this study – an analytical one for estimating the time required to trigger an avalanche, created by ETH Zurich, and SLAB’s numerical one for estimating the effect of avalanches on the human body – will be used to better understand natural avalanches and the associated risks. Gaume and Puzrin’s work stands as a tribute to Dyatlov's team, who were confronted with a “compelling force” of nature. And, although they were unable to complete their treacherous expedition, they have given generations of scientists a perplexing enigma to solve.\nOf the ten experienced hikers, only Yuri Yudin, who fell sick at the outset and had to return, survived. \n© \nCourtesy of the Dyatlov Memorial Foundation", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and ETH Zurich have conducted an original scientific study that puts forth a plausible explanation for the mysterious 1959 death of nine hikers in the Ural Mountains in the former Soviet Union.

{"id": 1218, "text": "What impressed you about NeighborHub?\nThe whole project fascinated me. I learned about it after the Swiss team’s “famous” victory in Denver, and had the honor of taking Germany’s president on a tour of the building during his visit to Switzerland. NeighborHub’s success shows that a cross-disciplinary approach can be highly effective for resolving complex issues – and that such an approach is one of the strengths our country can leverage. The project brought together experts in fields ranging from energy and ecology to design, mobility and even food production. The project also shows the added value in bringing together EPFL, the University of Fribourg and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Each one added essential skills and experience to the project.\nHow can this type of research initiative help foster progress in your department’s areas of focus?\nEvery field of research has not only its own body of knowledge, but also its own methods. This type of cross-disciplinary approach can bring fresh ideas to discussions that experts from the same field might have among themselves. Also, we’re interested in tangible results, and that’s something NeighborHub delivers. We can market the building and integrate it into our society. This is the kind of initiative that can help effect change.\nWhat advice would you give to the current generation of students?\nThat they need to take a proactive role if they want to advance their fields. According to EasyPark’s Smart Cities Index – which ranks cities according to criteria such as mobility, sustainability, energy, quality of life and digital infrastructure – Zurich comes in fourth place and Geneva, ninth. So we’re not on top, and still have progress to make in the areas that today’s youth are concerned about.\nHow important is the research done by Switzerland’s specialized universities for public policymakers?\nYou are our gems! You do excellent work that bolsters our country’s economy and global reputation. The Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne and Zurich are ranked among the best universities in Europe. You drive innovation and are at the forefront of the latest developments. For us it’s very important to stay updated on what your researchers are doing – what international projects they’re working on. We need to bring initiatives like NeighborHub out into the spotlight. They harbor useful new technology that should be shown and promoted to small businesses and society in general. Our talks with universities are a source of inspiration for us and point the way forward, including in terms of funding.\nTransportation – especially by air – isn’t exactly good for the environment, but people today are traveling more than ever. What are your priorities for responding to this growing need? Planes, trains or automobiles?\nI believe it’s dangerous to set priorities for specific means of transportation. Today’s lifestyles are shifting towards multimodal systems, and that trend is set to accelerate. Our strategy is to identify investment opportunities in various forms of transportation and infrastructure based on their environmental impact, energy use and the number of people they carry. Trains are clearly the best choice for long-distance travel, but when it comes to visiting other countries, flying is an inexpensive, quick and easy solution. All we can do there is question whether those low fares are appropriate or disconnected from the market. And there are the issues of CO\n2\n emissions and the use of kerosene-based versus gasoline-based fuel.\nSwitzerland is behind other countries such as Norway when it comes to electric vehicles. Do you have any measures planned to encourage EV use?\nWe do fairly well when compared with other European countries. Norway clearly comes out on top, but that’s thanks in large part to subsidies – something we want to avoid. Our country’s car importers have set themselves the target of having 10% of new cars be electric by 2020 [the figure is currently 0.4%]. We could do more, but that would depend on three key variables: the vehicles’ range, their cost – which is increasingly in line with that of standard cars – and our country’s charging station infrastructure. We are in the process of building that infrastructure, but we need the support of cantonal and municipal governments as well as the private sector. The Swiss Federal Roads Office is encouraging the installation of charging stations at highway rest stops. For now, electric cars in Switzerland are exempt from taxes and duties, except for the highway pass. But given that these cars are driven on our roadways, it would make sense to eventually ask their drivers to contribute to the cost of maintaining those roadways. However, the timing for that is still very much up in the air.\nDoris Leuthard during one of her visits at EPFL, in 2013. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL\nHow do you feel about self-driving cars? Do you think they could help alleviate traffic congestion and bottlenecks?\nI’m not sure if they could be part of the solution, but I do know that the technology is advancing at a rapid pace. In any case, those cars still need road infrastructure, so that doesn’t change our plans or investment objectives. It will be interesting to see the day when all cars on the road are autonomous. But in the meantime, as long as there’s a mix of driver and driverless cars, that won’t change traffic flows, speeds or safety. Plus there’s a number of legal and ethical issues that still need to be sorted out.\nThis summer EPFL students will compete in the Hyperloop competition. Do you see a future for this technology?\nI see it as a visionary concept, like Solar Impulse. These ideas typically strike us as eccentric, or even unrealistic, but sometimes we need to think outside the box. Such large-scale programs usually result in many smaller projects that churn out genuine solutions. In research, including at EPFL, you need vision and a sense of daring. It would be a mistake to focus only on research where we know the outcome. We have to push boundaries, conceive the unconceivable. But that’s harder in politics, where we have to be pragmatic.\nAnd how do you feel about the planned underground freight system?\nWe’ve been behind this project from the start. There are clear benefits to reducing the amount of freight traffic on our national highways, especially if the funding comes from the private sector. The idea seems feasible and I think the costs can be managed. Now it’s up to the project investors to decide – they will have to submit their plans to the Swiss Federal Council since a special law would need to be passed for the project to go through.\nThe days for nuclear power as we know it are numbered. But Switzerland still has five operating nuclear plants that will need to be decommissioned. Do you think there’s much of a future for careers in nuclear engineering?\nNuclear engineers, physicists and other such experts are still very much needed, and the dwindling appeal of this field is worrying. A nuclear power plant can run for 50 years and takes ten years to decommission, meaning we’ll need qualified personnel for our Leibstadt plant, for example, until 2045. That’s a long career for someone just starting out. But on top of decommissioning, there’s also R&D. We’re still involved in the ITER project because who knows – maybe we’ll see a major breakthrough ten years from now. Not to mention the possible applications in healthcare.\nYou’ve had a lot of success championing various political issues. Which were you the most enthusiastic about?\nProbably Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050. That was especially tough in the months right after Fukushima. I asked myself a lot of questions – what should we do? What’s feasible? Do I have the courage to go through with it? To help find the answers, I worked with businesses, cantons and cities, as well as EPFL and ETHZ, which was all extremely interesting. The EPFL and EPFZ scientists did a lot to support us, providing expertise in areas like energy efficiency, renewable energy and economic feasibility studies. As a politician, I often have a hard time getting my head around the technical details, so it was nice to be able to draw on that network. Thanks to their support, I had the courage to stand behind the strategy, knowing that experts have confirmed that our plans are technically feasible. That left me with the political part of the job – getting the various parties, the Swiss parliament and eventually the Swiss people on board.\nWhat do you plan to do after you leave the Swiss Federal Council?\nThere are a lot of things I’m interested in, but the first thing I plan to do is take some vacation. I promised my husband we’d go on a long trip and get a closer look at the wonders of this planet.\nAfter you go, there could be just one woman remaining on the Federal Council, down from four in 2010. Does that worry you?\nYes, because in politics, as elsewhere, women are underrepresented. I plan to continue to defend women’s issues after I step down from the Federal Council. It’s true that there may be just one or two women on the Federal Council for a while. But I think there is already pressure to change that, especially on the PLR and the UDC which each have two seats. The women are there, but we shouldn’t look only at the federal level; there are also many female political leaders at the cantonal level who could serve on the Federal Council. Parliament just needs to elect them.\nBrief bio\n1963\n Born in the Canton of Aargau\n1991\n Admitted to the bar\n2006\n Elected to the Swiss Federal Council\n201\n0 & 2017 Served as president of Switzerland\n2017\n Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050 approved in a referendum", "summary": "Doris Leuthard, head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, takes a hands-on approach.

{"id": 1226, "text": "Twenty years ago, each research laboratory within the Chemistry Department trained its own technician, which was a drain on resources. So it was decided that a joint training unit for preparative and analytical chemistry would be created in order to improve efficiency and ensure consistency. Francis Perritaz, now head of technician training at EPFL, was put in charge of setting up the training lab. Four budding young technicians made up the first class in 1997, and each year since 2006 there have been 24 trainees across the three years of the course.\nCéline Henzelin runs the Training Laboratory now and also trains the first-year students. \"They're taking their first steps as lab technicians – they’re rookies, so they’re curious and have a fresh perspective. They can easily get hooked very quickly and go far.\" Her colleague, Luke Harris, takes the second-year trainees under his wing, while the third years work with the various research groups.\nHenzelin studied at the University of Lausanne. She completed her doctoral thesis at EPFL before going to work in the pharmaceutical industry. Later on, she did a teacher training course and then applied for the job at the Training Laboratory six years ago. \"What first interested me about this job was being at EPFL and the importance placed on practical training.\"\nBeing a chemistry lab technician is a very demanding job that requires great rigor and strong technical skills. Trainees specialize in preparative and synthetic chemistry. They have to be able to synthesize and characterize known and new molecules for therapeutic or research purposes. They also have to be able to use their know-how in other laboratories, which is what they learn when they work with the research groups for their third-year internships.\n\"Our relationship with the professors, doctoral students and post-doctoral students is very important. We are in regular contact with them so that we know what they'd like us to improve in our training. That way, when the trainees arrive in the laboratory for their final year, they are already autonomous and prepared to further strengthen their skills,\" explains Henzelin. Trainees come out of the course with versatile skills and the know-how they need to work in the chemistry industry.\nAnd even if the training is conducted in an academic setting, the two trainers are always thinking ahead to what the industry will need: \"Both Luke and I know that world well because we came from there.\"\nSo what do the trainees do once they've finished the course? It may sound surprising but the Training Laboratory is also a stepping stone to further studies: a third of trainees end up enrolling in an engineering school and around 2% go on to EPFL or another university – some even finish by doing a PhD. \"One of the first trainees who went through the program is now a research and teaching associate in the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering,\" says Henzelin. \"In each year, there's at least one trainee who goes on to study at the university level.\"\nThe Training Laboratory's 20th anniversary is also an opportunity to look to the future. Starting this September, the laboratory will offer new training prospects for young lab technicians. They will be able to do an in-company internship lasting between six months and a year in the UK, Ireland or elsewhere in Europe to fine-tune both their linguistic and their technical skills once they've earned their qualification.\nSo what's next? Céline Henzelin has a ready answer: \"Keep training motivated young technicians who love their work. And here's to the next 20 years!\"\nAlec Gagnebin, Sarah Mikami and Xavier Volet are in their second year. Their week is divided up into two days of classes and three days in the lab – they all say they prefer the practical training to the theory.\nAlec enjoyed math and wanted to learn more about chemistry. He couldn't really see himself staying in school, sitting in class five days a week. What does he like best about the training program? Making new things and contributing to research.\nSarah decided to follow the training program after doing a chemistry internship. Once she's qualified, she hopes to spend a year doing an internship abroad. She then wants to go to engineering school to become a biotech engineer.\nXavier is hoping to go straight into a job in the industry.", "summary": "The Technicians Training Laboratory at EPFL’s Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering (ISIC) has trained more than 100 chemistry lab technicians since it was opened in August 1997.

{"id": 1227, "text": "EPFL experts have offered the Canton of Bern three solutions to preserve the Sutz-Lattrigen archaeological site on the shores of Lake Biel: a submerged dike, a breakwater or a protective flexible concrete mat. All three options are intended to prevent waves from eroding the objects, stilts and other remains of a civilization that dates back to the Neolithic period. The experts were commissioned by the Canton of Bern in 2015 and will present their final report to various representatives of the cantonal government on 31 October.\n\"Our task was to look at ways of protecting the lake bed and shoreline in the most discreet way possible,\" explains Azin Amini, a specialist in coastal projects and director of the study conducted by the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH). With this in mind, the members of the laboratory organized several meetings with those concerned, including environmental, forest and landscape conservationists, representatives from the cantonal archaeological service, and engineering firms already involved in other projects on Lake Biel. These meetings helped the experts to set criteria regarding the extent to which the site and the shoreline should be protected, how sustainable the solution needed to be, and the desired impact on the landscape and the environment, both during the construction phase and afterwards.\nDuring big windstorms, the archaeological remains, which include wooden stilts, weapons, jewelry and other household objects, get washed away by the waves. Once this happens, the items are considered to be lost. The LCH lab came up with three ways of ensuring that the site would be protected in the event of very strong winds and looked at the impact each solution would have for events, which have a return period of 50 years. They had to create a numerical model to examine how the waves propagate and dissipate.\nThree options\n The three options put forward by Amini's team were designed specifically for Lake Biel. The first option involves constructing a submerged dike, surrounding the archeological site, a few hundred meters from the shoreline in order to tame the current. In the inner part of the dike gravel-based material would be spread over the underwater site, forming a protective layer. The advantage of this option is that the dike would be 20 centimeters below the low-water level, which means it would be barely visible. The shore line would then be further stabilized using biological engineering techniques involving plants. The second option consists of building a breakwater all the way around the site so that almost no current or waves can pass the barrier and erode the site. The barrier would be 340 meters long and visible from the shore.\nThe lab's third and final proposal tackles the erosion directly by installing a protective mat over the site. A geotextile or stainless steel net would be held down with blocks of concrete, making the whole structure look like a flexible bar of chocolate. The covering could be removed if needed. biological engineering techniques would also be used to protect the shoreline.\nTraces of the pile dwellers\n The site near Bern provides rare insight into how our first sedentary ancestors lived on the shores of our lakes more than 5,000 years ago. Pile-dwelling remains were initially discovered when the levels of the three lakes in Jura Canton were lowered at the end of the 19th century. These prehistoric pile dwellings are found in only six European countries – France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria and Slovenia. Sixteen Swiss cantons appear on UNESCO's World Heritage list, with the entire Sutz-Lattrigen site added in 2011.\nIn 2014, a protective covering held down with gravel and a supple geotextile was placed over the underwater village. But the strength of the lake’s waves meant that this was not a viable long-term solution. \"In recent years, the erosion observed at Sutz-Lattrigen has been much greater than that seen at other UNESCO pile-dwelling sites, so an in-depth study was needed. The EPFL report is very important because it helps us to understand exactly what's happening,\" says Marianne Ramstein, archaeologist and deputy head of the Canton of Bern's underwater and prehistoric archaeology unit. \"The next step will be to find the most realistic solution and do the costing.\"", "summary": "An EPFL study commissioned by the Canton of Bern has come up with three possible ways of protecting the Sutz-Lattrigen archaeological site, which offers a rare insight into the lives of pile dwellers.

{"id": 1241, "text": "Twice as much electricity for the same surface area: that sums up Insolight's solar panels. The company, which is based in EPFL’s Innovation Park, has developed a prototype with a yield – the quantity of electricity produced from the light energy received – of 36.4%, while solutions currently available on the market offer throughput of only around 18-20%. These results, which could represent a world record, have just been validated on a prototype by the Fraunhofer Institute, an independent lab based in Germany.\nFocusing all the sun’s rays on a super cell\nHow did they reach such a high yield? A transparent, flat and very thin optical system made from plastic directs the sun’s rays to the tiny surface area of very high performance cells. These cells, which boast a yield of 42%, are made up of a number of layers that were specially designed to capture differing wave lengths. Because they are expensive to produce, these super cells are only used in certain sectors – like space – at this point. So the startup took another tack. Instead of working to increase the yield of the solar panels themselves, the company uses lenses to focus light waves on small segments of the super cells – segments that are only several square millimeters in size. “It’s like a shower: all the water goes down one small drain, there’s no need for the drain to cover the entire floor of the shower,” says Laurent Coulot, CEO of the startup.\nThe crux of the innovation lies in the microtracking system, patented by the startup, that captures 100% of the sun’s rays regardless of the angle of incidence. The transparent plate, which is injection-molded, is equipped with an array of millimetric lenses, which act as a small network of magnifiers. It is moved several millimeters during the day by a metallic frame. This slight movement, which takes place in real time as a sensor detects the sun’s position, maximizes the yield. The company developed its innovation in the Laboratory of Applied Photonics Devices under one of EPFL’s Innogrants, which go to promising startups. The system takes up such a small amount of space that it can be installed like any solar panel. Christophe Moser made space for the team in his lab and provided them with crucial expertise, as he was developing a solar concentrator for a project to produce hydrogen using sunlight. Insolight's modules could be of interest in that field as well, according to Moser.\nMaking solar energy more competitive\nSimilar systems are being developed in several labs around the world, but the EPFL startup pulled off a considerable feat in rapidly producing a system that was nearly market-ready. “All the components were designed from the start to be easily mass produced,” says Mathieu Ackermann, the company’s CTO. The startup’s three young founders are EPFL alumni who all worked in industry before creating their own startup. They began by fleshing out their idea in their spare time before setting up their company. “Working in industry gave us what we needed to reach our goal, which was to develop solar panels that could be rapidly brought to market at a competitive price.”\nThe founders are convinced that their solar panels will lower the price per kWh paid by consumers. The system will probably be a little more expensive to buy, “but this will be quickly offset by the additional energy that will be generated,” says Florian Gerlich, COO. “The price of solar panels has dropped sharply in recent years, but not enough to produce electricity at a competitive cost,” he says. “For residential systems, solar panels accounted for less than 20% of total installation costs in the United States in 2015. Even if the solar panels were free, this would not always offset the system’s cost. Currently, most of the margin earned by solar energy developers comes from subsidies. Yet these subsidies are declining.”\nBy combining efficiency and ease of installation, the founders of the startup hope to shake things up by making photovoltaic systems competitive with fossil energies. “Insolight has designed a highly innovative system, and these initial prototypes show an impressive yield in external assessments,” says Christophe Ballif, Director of EPFL's Photovoltaics Laboratory. “They now need to test the limits of their concept, show how a commercial-sized system can perform, and prove the product’s economic potential.”", "summary": "With a 36% yield, the solar panels developed by startup Insolight could deliver up to twice as much energy as traditional panels.

{"id": 1244, "text": "Peptides are biological molecules, made up of short sequences of amino acids. Because they are easy to synthesize, show low toxicity and high efficiency, peptides such as insulin and other hormones can be used as drugs. But peptides are quickly cleared by the kidneys, which means that we can only use peptide drugs that act within minutes. This problem can be overcome by connecting peptides to ligands that bind blood-serum proteins such as albumin, allowing the peptide to linger in the bloodstream longer. EPFL scientists have now developed such a ligand, which is easy to synthesize and has a high afﬁnity for human albumin. Published in \nNature Communications\n, the new ligand could potentially extend the half-life of peptides from minutes to several days. \nPeptides combine a number of attractive features for drugs: low toxicity and immune reactions, high affinity and efficacy for their targets, and accessible chemical synthesis. The only problem is “renal clearance”: peptides are generally cleared by the kidneys within a few minutes of entering the patient’s blood. For example, one of the most common peptides, insulin, has a bloodstream half-life of only 4-6 minutes. Another hormone, oxytocin — given intravenously to induce or accelerate labor — has a half-life of 10-15 minutes.\nSuch short timeframes imposed by renal clearance severely limit the therapeutic potential of these potentially ideal drugs. One promising way to increase the half-life of peptides is to “piggy-back” them onto blood-serum proteins, such as albumin, which is the most abundant protein in the blood serum and has a half-life of nineteen days. This however, requires an intermediate ligand molecule that can be attached to the peptide during synthesis, and also have a high affinity and selectivity for human albumin.\nThe lab of  has now developed such a ligand, which has a high affinity for human albumin and — more importantly — is easy to synthesize and attach to a peptide. The ligand is made by fusing a fatty acid with another peptide. The resulting molecule is referred to as a “chimera” and combines the best of two worlds from the field of albumin ligands. \nPrevious efforts built ligands based on either fatty acids or peptides, and have tried them on insulin. But whereas fatty acids somewhat extended the half-life of insulin, they generally didn’t bind albumin very strongly. On the other hand, peptide-based ligands bind albumin well, but showed low solubility, meaning it didn’t distribute insulin in the blood very well.\nThe new ligand literarily brings together the advantages of both fatty acids and peptides. The researchers searched for an amino acid sequence that would complement the fatty acid’s weak binding of albumin. Using an elegant “iterative” synthesis and screening method they discovered a peptide sequence that increases the binding of the fatty acid twenty-seven times. The final chimera ligand binds human albumin with high affinity (Kd = 39 nM), is highly soluble, and can be appended to peptide drugs using standard synthesizing techniques.\nThe researchers demonstrated \nin vivo \nthat the ligand prolongs the half-life of several bioactive peptides more than 25-fold. They then appended the ligand to an actual peptide developed to treat pathogenic thrombosis, which has a notoriously impractical short half-life. The ligand was shown to extend the effectiveness of the peptide by several hours, inhibiting the disease in rabbits.\n“We expect that the tag presented in our work will interest a larger research and business audience because it is applicable to virtually any peptide moiety, including small proteins,” says Heinis. “The ligand can be appended to any peptide during solid-phase peptide synthesis on standard synthesizers, making it easily accessible for academic and industry labs.”\nThe innovative technology can potentially also be applied to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of bicyclic peptides developed by , a startup co-founded by Christian Heinis and  in 2009, and of which EPFL is a shareholder. On June 1 this year, Bicycle Therapeutics r. The company's focus is the bicyclic peptide (Bicycle\n®\n) product platform, which combines properties of several therapeutic entities in a single modality: exhibiting the affinity and selective pharmacology associated with antibodies; the distribution kinetics of small molecules, allowing rapid tumor penetration; and the “tuneable” pharmacokinetic half-life and renal clearance of peptides.\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation \nReference\nAlessandro Zorzi, Simon J.

{"id": 1248, "text": "In response to a request from the French-speaking Switzerland chapter of the Swiss Architects’ Federation (FAS), EPFL agreed to study how to better protect architectural heritage even outside of Switzerland. The School launched a project where around 150 first-year architecture students took a fresh look at the Lake Geneva region as a whole from both an environmental and heritage standpoint, with a particular focus on two sites: Patrick Bouchain’s La Grange au Lac, dedicated to the cellist Rostropovitch, and La Buvette d’Evian, which was built in 1957 by French architect Maurice Novarina, structural engineer Serge Ketoff and builder Jean Prouvé.\nBringing La Buvette back to life\n Under the project, the students first spent the winter semester learning about the role architects can play in helping to preserve a local ecosystem. Then in the spring semester, they built the wooden structures that will be assembled near the two heritage sites in Evian. The students’ architectural designs include stages, a projection screen, a garden, a lookout area, a greenhouse, water swings and a bird wall. The project is being spearheaded by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE) with the goal of reviving the La Buvette refreshment area, which, despite being listed as a French historical monument, has been lying abandoned for nearly 30 years. \n After successfully testing their designs in Switzerland, the students will cross Lake Geneva on 27 May to build the structures on site. The structures will be inaugurated at a ceremony on 28 May attended by representatives of the City of Evian, FAS and Evian Resort. In addition, concerts by Zéphyr and Tuorka – two quartets from the Lausanne Conservatory, a play entitled “Paysages Impossibles” by Sébastien Grosset and a sound performance by Louis Jucker on the subject of landscapes will be held on 28 and 29 May.\nPart of a broader initiative \n The French-speaking Switzerland chapter of FAS has been studying options for renovating La Buvette d’Evian since 2014. “Through this renovation project, which EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM) had already worked on, students from ALICE are contributing to a broader initiative to redevelop the whole site. The initiative includes Lausanne’s and the Lake Geneva region’s bid to host the International Union of Architects’ 2023 World Congress, as well as the 2020-2023 Leman Architecture Connection (LAC) – a Franco-Swiss program carried out in association with the Haute Savoie office of architecture, urban planning and the environment. Each of these projects has its own strengths and aims to turn La Buvette and the surrounding area into a high-caliber cultural center that forms an integral part of the Lake Geneva landscape,” say Jeanne della Casa and Sarah Nedir, the two presidents of the French-speaking Switzerland chapter of FAS. \nUntapped cross-border potential \n According to Dieter Dietz, an architecture professor at EPFL and the director of ALICE, the renovation of La Buvette, an icon of modern architecture, could also help forge closer ties between Switzerland and France. “I don’t see the “La Buvette” project as specific to Evian, but rather as part of an infrastructure that encompasses the whole Lake Geneva region. La Buvette could help strengthen ties that, while they do already exist, are not very visible. Things may have changed since the 1970s, when each side of the lake clearly represented two separate countries, but this relationship could still be taken much further. Through our various partnerships on this project, we are trying to build a coherent cultural and territorial narrative,” says Dietz.\n The City of Evian is proud to be a part of the project. “By hosting students from EPFL and showcasing their work, we hope to illustrate how the two sides of the lake are in fact connected. For us, it is important to protect our unique cultural and architectural heritage and enable people to enjoy it – which is the essence of the La Buvette project,” says Evian Mayor Josiane Lei.\nThe evolving nature of architecture \n The work of EPFL’s students in Evian is part of a new ALICE project called Becoming – a three-part exploration patterned on the HOUSE 1, HOUSE 2 and HOUSE 3 series of wooden homes constructed in turn in Lausanne, Zurich and Brussels. With Becoming, Dietz advocates a concept of architecture in constant flux and that upholds the new value system our society must adopt if we are to save our planet. “Our goal now is to learn how we can situate ideas and spatial constructions, in relation not just to our society but to life in general and our natural resources, and how we can anchor architecture so that it can both be and ‘become’ – hence the name for this new three-part series,” he says. \n (pictures and program)\nFrom June 29 to July 6, the Rencontres musicales d'Evian will take place in the structures built by EPFL.

{"id": 1252, "text": "One of the main culprits of global warming is the vast amount of carbon dioxide pumped out into the atmosphere mostly from burning fossil fuels and the production of steel and cement. In response, scientists have been trying out a process that can sequester waste carbon dioxide, transporting it into a storage site, and then depositing it at a place where it cannot enter the atmosphere.\nThe problem is that capturing carbon from power plants and industrial emissions isn’t very cost-effective. The main reason is that waste carbon dioxide isn’t emitted pure, but is mixed with nitrogen and other gases, and extracting it from industrial emissions requires extra energy consumption – meaning a pricier bill.\nScientists have been trying to develop an energy-efficient carbon dioxide-filter. Referred to as a “membrane”, this technology can extract carbon dioxide out of the gas mix, which can then be either stored or converted into useful chemicals. “However, the performance of current carbon dioxide filters has been limited by the fundamental properties of currently available materials,” explains Professor Kumar Varoon Agrawal at EPFL’s School of Basic Sciences (EPFL Valais Wallis).\nNow, Agrawal has led a team of chemical engineers to develop the world’s thinnest filter from graphene, the world-famous “wonder material” that won the Physics Nobel in 2010. But the graphene filter isn’t just the thinnest in the world, it can also separate carbon dioxide from a mix of gases such as those coming out of industrial emissions and do so with an efficiency and speed that surpasses most current filters.

The membranes that the EPFL scientists developed show more than ten-fold higher carbon dioxide permeance at 11,800 GPUs, while their separation factor stands at 22.5.\n“We estimate that this technology will drop the cost of carbon capture close to $30 per ton of carbon dioxide, in contrast to commercial processes where the cost is two-to-four time higher,” says Agrawal.

{"id": 1255, "text": "Imagine a solar panel more efficient than today’s best solar panels, but using 10 000 times less material. This is what EPFL researchers expect given recent findings on these tiny filaments called nanowires. Solar technology integrating nanowires could capture large quantities of light and produce energy with incredible efficiency at a much lower cost. This technology is possibly the future for powering microchips and the basis for a new generation of solar panels.\nDespite their size, nanowires have tremendous potential for energy production. “These nanowires capture much more light than expected,” says Anna Fontcuberta i Morral about her research, published on 24 March 2013 in .\nNanowires are extremely tiny filaments–in this case able to capture light–with a diameter that measures tens to hundreds of nanometers, where a nanometer is one millionth of a millimeter. These miniscule wires are up to 1000 times smaller than the diameter of human hair, or comparable in diameter to the size of viruses.\nWhen equipped with the right electronic properties, the nanowire becomes a tiny solar cell, transforming sunlight into electric current. Anna Fontcuberta i Morral and her team built a nanowire solar cell out of gallium arsenide, a material which is better at converting light into power than silicon. They found that it actually collects more light than the usual flat solar cell–up to 12 times more–and more light means more energy.\nThe nanowire standing vertically essentially acts like a very efficient light funnel. Even though the nanowire is only a few hundred nanometers in diameter, it absorbs light as though it were 12 times bigger. In other words, it has a greater field of vision than expected.\nFontcuberta’s prototype is already almost 10% more efficient at transforming light into power than allowed, in theory, for conventional single material solar panels. Furthermore, optimizing the dimensions of the nanowire, improving the quality of the gallium arsenide and using better electrical contacts to extract the current could increase the prototype’s efficiency.\nArrays of nanowire solar cells offer new prospects for energy production. This study suggests that an array of nanowires may attain 33% efficiency, in practice, whereas commercial (flat) solar panels are now only up to 20% efficient. Also, arrays of nanowires would use at least 10 000 times less gallium arsenide, allowing for industrial use of this costly material. Translating this into dollars for gallium arsenide, the cost would only be $10 per square meter instead of $100 000.\nFree to the engineer’s imagination to mount these nanowires onto a variety of substrate panels, be it lightweight, flexible or designed to withstand the harshest of conditions. In a world where energy consumption is on the rise, these nanowires may one day power everything from your favorite gadget to space missions to Mars.\nRelated Articles", "summary": "Capture up to 12 times more light to produce more energy?

The program, which was officially launched today in Zagreb, was developed by EPFL, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Croatian Ministry of Science and Education, the Croatian Science Foundation (CSF) and various academic institutions in Croatia. This ambitious program, which has a budget of 4.7 million francs, aims to drive innovation in Croatia and limit brain drain.\nFollowing a selection process that began in March, four young and highly promising Croatian researchers will be awarded tenure-track professor status. They will each receive a budget of one million francs to set up a laboratory, hire a team and put a research program in place – all within four to five years.\n“Not only do we want to encourage the talented pool of Croatian scientists living abroad to return home, but we also want to give young researchers a real chance, responsibilities and future prospects in their own country so they will no longer need to go abroad in order to have a successful career,” says Olivier Küttel, head of International Affairs at EPFL. To achieve this, the program will offer a package that includes a team, equipment, lab space, administrative support and, most importantly, a free hand in managing these resources. If, after four years, the pilot program is a success and the researchers live up to expectations, they will be given tenure.\nTome Antičić, State Secretary for Science and EU funds at the Ministry of Science and Education, describes the importance of this project for his country: “Croatia is home to very talented scientists, and we must offer the best of them career prospects so that we can retain them. The tenure-track program proposed by EPFL, funded by Switzerland and implemented by the Croatian Science Foundation is a very promising model, and we as a Ministry will closely monitor its success. In fact, the Ministry is in the process of establishing a new research system based much more on international excellence, and this model could form the basis for a much larger initiative in the near future.”\nSuccessfully tested\nThe idea dates back four years, right after Croatia joined the European Union. The project, which was even more ambitious at the time, was submitted to the European Commission for funding through the Horizon 2020 program. Then, on 9 February 2014, the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative passed in Switzerland, and the project had to be re-thought and scaled back. In the end, the project will be funded through the one billion francs that Switzerland has contributed to the EU for Eastern European countries. The Croatian government will cover 15% of the project's cost in addition to providing appropriate research facilities.\nThis pilot program presented EPFL’s Senior Management with an opportunity to promote its widely hailed tenure-track system. EPFL is one of the only universities in Europe to use this system, which it put in place in 2000. A total of 171 people have benefited from this status at EPFL, and many of them have won ERC Starting Grants, which are the most prestigious awards bestowed on young researchers by the European Council.\nEPFL experts have played an active role in designing Croatia’s pilot project from the outset. They are also closely involved in evaluating the applicants. The winners will be announced this fall.\n“This initiative is meant to attract and retain the best scientific minds. We also hope that it will have a multiplier effect over the longer term,” says Küttel. “These talented young scientists will certainly attract others like them, create jobs and startups, and ultimately give Croatia’s economy a real boost. And since it’s a pilot project, it could be quickly rolled out in other European countries.”", "summary": "Under a pilot project that draws on EPFL’s expertise, four highly promising young Croatian researchers will be awarded tenure-track professor status and receive a million francs to set up a research program in their country.

It’s a risky operation for even the best surgeons. The robot, developed by Szymon Kostrzewki, Philippe Bérard and other researchers from the group “Virtual Reality and Active Interfaces” (VRAI) led by Charles Baur at the Robotic Systems Laboratory (LSRO2) at EPFL, has demonstrated a precision of 0.5 mm for this operation. Right now, trials are being done on bodies donated to science at the CHUV, and a start-up, KB medical, is being created.\nA Guide to Penetrate the Vertebrae\n The robot is compact, in the form of a small box, and is maintained by a passive structure on top of the operating field. The secret: a design that combines high precision mechanics and automatic control, giving the robot irreproachable accuracy. This level of reliability is not possible without the most discerning vision. An optical tracking camera, developed by Atracsys, another spin-off of VRAI at LSRO2, allows for following the trajectory of this medical drill precisely and in real-time. The information gathered is then transmitted to software that allows the robot to constantly reposition itself according to the trajectory pre-established by the surgeon.\nEven the Vibration of the Drilling is Corrected\n As with all operations on the spine, a preliminary x-ray is required. With this image, the surgeon sets about virtually simulating the best placement for the screw and the appropriate positioning of the robot. Once the patient is properly placed for the surgery, the practitioner aligns on the real robot and its virtual image on the screen. Neuroglide, the drill’s guide, maintains the desired position to one-tenth of a millimeter during the drilling, compensating for even the slight displacement linked to the vibration of the drill. “In the end, the operation does not last but one or two minutes longer than the current manual methods that are already computer-assisted,” says Szymon Kostrzewski, “due to the time necessary for placing the robot.” In the future, the operating time will be considerably reduced thanks to a percutaneous procedure.\nOptimal Placement is Evaluated at 68%\n After an accident, a herniated disc or osteoporosis, placing a screw to bind together cervical vertebrae may become necessary to spare the patient excess and uncomfortable pain. About 400,000 screw placements in the spinal column are performed every year in Europe. According to the International Journal on Medical Robotics and Computer-Assisted Surgery, around 4% of manual operations on the second cervical vertebra present neurological complications. The occurrence of arterial injury hovers between 4% and 8% and the optimal placement of screws is marginally above 68%. Philippe Bérard highlights the fact that, “The world market for spinal fusion equipment is worth many billions of dollars.”\nClinical trials in Autumn 2013\n KB Medical, the start-up being created by Szymon Kostrzewski and Philippe Bérard to commercialize the system, hopes to finish a second prototype in a year and proceed to clinical trials in Autumn 2013.

Tri- for three legs and -bot for robot, this super-light critter fits in the palm of your hand, is cheap to build, runs on less than one watt of power, and may one day be deployed in mass for search and rescue missions.\n“Hundreds of Tribots could be dropped from the sky into remote areas, and reach places using their three types of locomotion that more expensive and larger robots cannot,” explains EPFL scientist Jamie Paik, head of the Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory. “It only weighs a few grams, so it’s the perfect robot when weight is a constraint.”\nLike a Swiss Army knife, tribots are multi-functional : they crawl, roll, and hop to get around obstacles ­– with a prototype jumping repeatedly as high as 25 centimeters, seven times their size.

{"id": 1269, "text": "Terahertz (THz) waves fall between microwave and infrared radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, oscillating at frequencies of between 100 billion and 30 trillion cycles per second. These waves are prized for their distinctive properties: they can penetrate paper, clothing, wood and walls, as well as detect air pollution. THz sources could revolutionize security and medical imaging systems. What’s more, their ability to carry vast quantities of data could hold the key to faster wireless communications.\n THz waves are a type of non-ionizing radiation, meaning they pose no risk to human health. The technology is already used in some airports to scan passengers and detect dangerous objects and substances.\nDespite holding great promise, THz waves are not widely used because they are costly and cumbersome to generate. But new technology developed by researchers at EPFL could change all that. The team at the \n, \nled by Prof. Elison Matioli, built a nanodevice (1 nanometer = 1 millionth of a millimeter) that can generate extremely high-power signals in just a few picoseconds, or one trillionth of a second, – which produces high-power THz waves.\nThe technology, which can be mounted on a chip or a flexible medium, could one day be installed in smartphones and other hand-held devices. The work first-authored by Mohammad Samizadeh Nikoo, a PhD student at the POWERlab, has been published in the journal \nNature. \nHow it works \nThe compact, inexpensive, fully electric nanodevice generates high-intensity waves from a tiny source in next to no time. It works by producing a powerful “spark,” with the voltage spiking from 10 V (or lower) to 100 V in the range of a picosecond. The device is capable of generating this spark almost continuously, meaning it can emit up to 50 million signals every second. When hooked up to antennas, the system can produce and radiate high-power THz waves.\nThe device consists of two metal plates situated very close together, down to 20 nanometers apart. When a voltage is applied, electrons surge towards one of the plates, where they form a nanoplasma. Once the voltage reaches a certain threshold, the electrons are emitted almost instantly to the second plate. This rapid movement enabled by such fast switches creates a high-intensity pulse that produces high-frequency waves.\nConventional electronic devices are only capable of switching at speeds of up to one volt per picosecond – too slow to produce high-power THz waves.\nThe new nanodevice, which can be more than ten times faster, can generate both high-energy and high-frequency pulses. “Normally, it’s impossible to achieve high values for both variables,” says Matioli. “High-frequency semiconductor devices are nanoscale in size. They can only cope with a few volts before breaking out. High-power devices, meanwhile, are too big and slow to generate terahertz waves. Our solution was to revisit the old field of plasma with state-of-the-art nanoscale fabrication techniques to propose a new device to get around those constraints.”\nAccording to Matioli, the new device pushes all the variables to the extreme: “High-frequency, high-power and nanoscale aren’t terms you’d normally hear in the same sentence.”\n“These nanodevices, on one side, bring an extremely high level of simplicity and low-cost, and on the other side, show an excellent performance. In addition, they can be integrated with other electronic devices such as transistor. Considering these unique properties, nanoplasma can shape a different future for the area of ultra-fast electronics”, says Samizadeh.\nThe technology could have wide-ranging applications beyond generating THz waves. “We’re pretty sure there’ll be more innovative applications to come,” adds Matioli.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a nanodevice that operates more than 10 times faster than today’s fastest transistors, and about 100 times faster than the transistors you have on your computers.

EPFL startups had an excellent year in 2020 when it came to fundraising – they attracted a record CHF 293 million, and four of them raised over CHF 20 million each. What’s more, 21 startups completed their first fundraising round with proceeds of CHF 1–5 million. Also in 2020, 25 new EPFL spin-offs were created, which is close to the previous year’s figure. In addition, 34 business plans are in the works by EPFL researchers who have already received first funding. André Catana, the head of EPFL’s startup unit, says: “The startup world is a unique microcosm where the payoff is long term. And it held up well in 2020 despite the economic fallout from the pandemic, although we did see a decline in the CHF 5–20 million funding range.”\nThe CHF 293 million – which rises to CHF 351 million if the total includes companies that are based on campus but not direct spin-offs of the School – was collected by around 30 young businesses, including four that brought in over CHF 20 million each. These four include Kandou, a maker of high-speed data transfer systems that raised CHF 32 million on top of an already successful round in 2019, and Sophia Genetics, a fast-growing company that develops data-driven medicine technology and that signed up CHF 100 million at the end of the year – the most of any Swiss business in 2020. Other EPFL startups raised a hefty CHF 5–25 million each, such as Lightbend, Lunaphore, CREAL and Insolight. Clearspace also deserves special mention, as it won a CHF 93 million contract from the European Space Agency to conduct further development work on its space debris removal system.\nThe rest of the CHF 293 million went to the 21 firms that carried out their first fundraising round in 2020, bringing in CHF 1–5 million each. This underscores investors’ confidence in and appetite for deeptech startups, which could require many years before the technology they develop in a lab is turned into a market-launched product. “This funding comes in when the businesses have just been spun off, and provides a solid foundation for them to grow and attract more investors,” says Catana.\nA total of 410 startups have come out of EPFL labs and accelerators in the past 50-odd years. Many of them received assistance from the various programs run by the School’s startup unit within the Vice Presidency for Innovation. This assistance includes not just financing to help the engineers reduce risk, accelerate their path to market and build teams but also advice, training, networking opportunities and forums for sharing their experience. The goal is to quickly teach them the ins-and-outs of starting a business and give them a boost in getting their ideas off the ground. 25 new EPFL spin-offs were created in 2020, down slightly from the previous year (27) but not far from the record set in 2018 (29).

Over a third of EPFL startups created in 2020 had at least one female founder. This trend is also reflected in the many startup awards that women have won recently. For example, Depoly and Oxyle (from ETH Zurich) won the >>venture>> startup competition in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and Xsensio won a 2020 CES Innovation Award at the CES trade show in Las Vegas.\nCleantech and sustainability\nMajor technological advancements have been made in critical areas such as sustainability, the environment, energy and social responsibility. Nearly a third of the EPFL spin-offs created in 2020 (seven of the 25) are developing solutions to address these global challenges.

The longest building in Europe – 1.5 km – today houses some 6,500 people.\nBut the entire architectural design, audacious at the time, no longer meets current energy consumption standards. The 100,000 square meters of thin exterior “curtain walls” have no structural role; they only protect apartments from climatic extremes, but at a level that is now considered substandard. Because they are a fundamental element of the building’s character, however, it was unthinkable to change their outward appearance when it became necessary to update the buildings’ insulation.\nThe government of Geneva and the Lignon property owners’ group thus approached EPFL to study options that would improve the buildings’ energy consumption while still preserving its unique character.\nTwo variants\n Franz Graf, head of EPFL’s Laboratory of Techniques and Preservation of Modern Architecture (TSAM), led this extensive research project, which began in May 2008. “We were lucky to be able to do this in a very systematic and in-depth manner, to reunite all the stakeholders around the same table, and to outline various scenarios,” he explains.\nOf the four options initially considered – from simple maintenance work to complete replacement of the curtain walls – two were seen as feasible: overhauling the existing facades while increasing the level of insulation and replacing windows, for energy savings of about 33%; or their complete renovation, which would involve installing brand new insulation on the opaque panels, for energy savings of 38-40%.\nThese results, delivered in mid-2011 and compiled in an impressive book*, allowed the property owners to make an informed decision about the way they chose to renovate. Above all, since the work had to be done from inside the buildings, they were able to plan the work in the way they saw fit. Over the next six months, 23 apartments will be renovated.\nCommunal areas – hallways and entrances – will also undergo a facelift. And the installation of solar collectors on the roofs will enable the complex to reach a level of energy efficiency compatible with the Minergie standard, as well as reducing CO2 emissions by thousands of tons. Graf hopes that this undertaking will “serve as a model for renovating other buildings like this.”\n* \nLa cité du Lignon, 1963-1971.

Two Bachelor’s students at EPFL decided to address this problem by developing an open-source kit called Showerloop that lets people in arid parts of the world take a full and proper shower.\nTheir device consists of a closed-loop system where the first 10 liters of water are purified and recirculated throughout the shower, which can consequently last 10, 15, 20, 25 minutes – as long as you want. The students have been awarded a grant for their project and in September will install three Showerloop prototypes at a university campus in Colombia.\n10 liters is all you need \nThe Showerloop needs just 10 liters of water to operate, instead of the 100 liters used on average. When you take a shower with Showerloop, the necessary amount of water comes out of the showerhead, and the dirty, soapy water exits through a drain at the bottom just like in a conventional shower. But the water then goes through three different types of filters to be purified.\nThe first type is a mesh filter that blocks particles like hair and dust that could plug up the pipes. The second contains sand and activated carbon to remove pollutants. And the third uses ultraviolet light to sterilize the water and kill harmful bacteria and other pathogens. The purified water is then fed back into the showerhead, and the loop begins again. At the end of the shower, the 10 liters of water are discharged into the regular wastewater system.\nSwiss materials\nThe two EPFL Bachelor’s students behind the project – Judith Capron in civil engineering and Jean-André Davy-Guidicelli in environmental engineering – were inspired by a standard open-source eco-friendly shower kit that a Finnish engineer, Jason Selvarajan, presented at the COP 21 Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015.\nCapron and Davy-Guidicelli took Selvarajan’s model and created a version using materials available in Switzerland. They carried out their work at the Student Kreativity and Innovation Laboratory (SKIL), a new facility offered by the School of Architecture, Civil, and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) where students can design and build their own prototypes. Constructing their Showerloop turned out to be more challenging than expected, since neither Capron nor Davy-Guidicelli is a natural-born do-it-yourselfer. But that made them even more proud of the end result.\nNew version\nThey also wanted to make a version of the Showerloop that could be used on a larger scale than Selvarajan’s, which requires taking down an existing shower in order to be installed. Rather, they envisioned a system that would require simply adding new parts to an existing shower. So they made the necessary adjustments to Selvarajan’s model with materials they found right here at home.\nThe students calculate that a Showerloop would pay for itself quickly thanks to cost savings on both electricity (since water would not have to be heated continuously) and water (since consumption would be slashed by 90%). According to their initial rough estimates, installing a Showerloop would cost 1,000 francs and have a payback period of around 11 months, depending on the price of electricity. The system’s filters last 1 to 2 years and cost around 40 francs to replace.\nThree prototypes in Colombia\nCapron and Davy-Guidicelli have just been awarded a Development Impact Grant created by the Coopertion and Devlopment Center (CODEV) from EPFL to further their research. These grants fund projects that contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. And the Showerloop fits that bill – it targets major water consumers like public institutions and hotel chains and could represent an important step towards Goal 6, “Ensure access to water and sanitation for all.”\nThe students will use the grant money to develop, test, and install three Showerloop prototypes in the sports centers’ locker rooms of Universidad del Valle in Colombia when the school year starts this September. They chose Universidad del Valle because it’s located in a water-poor part of the country, and because their project fits in with a sustainable development program at the university, which is eager to test this kind of shower on its campus.\nA journal publication \nTo carry out the tests in Colombia, Davy-Guidicelli will team up with Marisa Boller, also a Bachelor’s student in environmental engineering at EPFL, rather than with Capron. That’s because Boller and Davy-Guidicelli will already be spending the 2018–2019 school year in the country for their required internship year, where they will work on a water treatment system for a cassava processing plant. In parallel, they will develop a version of the Showerloop suited to the materials available in Colombia and to other local constraints, and perform a complete life-cycle analysis of their device.\nTheir goal will be to make the Showerloop as attractive as possible from an environmental and financial perspective, and to publish an article illustrating its cost benefits in order to attract interest from businesses and organizations. Selvarajan, the engineer behind the very first Showerloop, fully supports the students and will be following their progress closely.\nBut the student’s plans for the Showerloop don’t stop there. Once back in Lausanne in September 2019, they intend to draw on the lessons learned in Colombia to roll out their system across the EPFL campus as part of their Master’s studies.\n (Copyright: © Jamani Caillet / EPFL 2018)", "summary": "Summer series.

Making matters worse, women are frequently assaulted when they have no other choice but to relieve themselves in the open. These observations spurred Marc-Edouard Schultheiss and Alexandre Bouchet, two students in the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), to head to India for a three-month humanitarian project supported by Engineers of the World, a student association at EPFL.\nOnce there, they focused on teaching villagers – especially women – how to build a shower and toilet connected to a pit. But the two students quickly ran into illiteracy problems and the language barrier: it simply wasn’t possible to provide instructional videos in 18 different dialects. “And since the women never went to school,” said Marc-Edouard, “understanding a diagram and using numbers – even for measuring things out with a meter stick – was a challenge for them.”\nTo resolve this dilemma and enable the women to pass along their skills far into the future, they came up with a surprising idea: that of using LEGO blocks to create a model. The kit comes complete with bamboo sticks and strings with colored markers to use as a measuring instrument. “We also prepared an animated drawing to remind them of the key steps in the building process,” said Alexandre.\nThis fun and innovative project has been undergoing testing since the summer by other volunteers on the ground. But it has already caused a buzz among humanitarian organizations, and Marc-Edouard and Alexandre were invited to present their idea in early July at a conference organized by the United Nations Academic Impact in New York. “We were able to go to New York thanks to the support of our School, and Silvia Hostettler of EPFL’s Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV) described our work in front of 500 people,” said the two students.

The dot colors are inferred biological states; Red dots are the menses; black dots are the most likely day of ovulation; blue dots are the follicular phase days; yellow dots are the luteal phase days. Credit: L. Symul (EPFL/Stanford)\nFor many women of reproductive age, the most common way of assessing their menstrual health and fertility means regular visits to a gynecologist or another clinician. When it comes to evaluating changes in fertility, menstrual health, and quality of life, these visits typically rely on remembering, which can lead to significant inaccuracies in evaluation.\nOn the other hand, many women today are turning to so-called “fertility awareness method” (FAM) apps to support them in tracking their menstrual cycles. There is a multitude of such apps available, which only demonstrates how popular they’ve become in recent years.\nBut how accurate are FAM apps? What do users track? Can they help them and their gynecologists? These are hard to answer for a simple reason: Neither visits nor app use have been systematically studied on a population level to determine and compare their accuracy in evaluating menstrual health and fertility in a meaningful way.\nThis is what Laura Symul at EPFL’s  has done. Working with Stanford University (), Symul led a large-scale study on 200,000 users of two FAM apps, Sympto and Kindara. Both apps support the “Sympto-Thermal Method” and facilitate the identification of the fertile and infertile times of a woman’s menstrual cycle by taking into account recordings of cervical fluid, body temperature at wake-up, and other biological signs.\nThe scientists tracked more than 30 million days of observations from over 2.7 million menstrual cycles. The overall study had two aims: First\n,\n to see how and what users voluntarily track on FAM apps. Second, to find out if these records allow an accurate detection and estimation of ovulation timing.\nIn terms of user demographics and behavior, the study found that the typical FAM app user is around 30 years old, lives in a western country (in Europe or Northern America) and has a healthy BMI. App users log their observations more frequently when they also log sexual intercourse, and when you look at them on a population level, reported fertility awareness body signs exhibit temporal patterns that follow very closely those that have been found in small-scale clinical studies.\nAnalyzing the data, the scientists found that women who were seeking pregnancy recorded Sympto-Thermal measurements every single day for up to 40% of their menstrual cycles. Then, by modeling the data, they found that the average duration and range of the follicular phase, which begins the menstrual cycle and ends at ovulation, were larger than previously reported. In fact, the modeling showed that only 24% of ovulations occur at days 14 to 15 of the cycle. On the other hand, the data showed that the duration and range of the luteal phase – the latter part of the menstrual cycle – matched previous studies.\nThe findings offer an affordable means for studying the interactions between the menstrual cycle and other physiological systems on a large scale. “Our study provides a common ground for users and their doctors to incorporate digital records in their visits, evaluate their own menstrual patterns and compare them with the statistics we report,” says Laura Symul.\nShe continues: “New technologies, and in particular self-tracking, are changing the way we perceive our bodies and health. Both users and doctors wonder about the opportunities and the usefulness of digital self-tracking. Our study shows that users voluntarily track their menstrual cycle and fertility-related body signs very frequently, and what they track is aligned with what is expected in the vast majority of cases. While these measurements and observations are noisy and not perfectly regular, they provide valuable information for inferring the underlying hormonal changes and timing of ovulation in a way that is scalable both in time and in number of participants.”\nMarcel Salathé, director of the Digital Epidemiology Lab adds: “The digital epidemiology approach presented here can help to lead to a better understanding of menstrual health and its connection to women’s health overall, which has historically been severely under-studied.”\nOther contributors\nUniversity of Geneva", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and Stanford have carried out an analysis of the largest datasets from fertility awareness apps.

But EPFL now counts three listed startups that were founded to market technology developed at the School,” says Hervé Lebret, head of EPFL’s startup unit. “These exits are the icing on the cake, since EPFL startups usually end up being acquired by other companies, as we saw with Faceshift, Lemoptix and most recently Darix.” Since being founded in the UK in 2009, Bicycle has raised nearly $116 million.\nBicycle Therapeutics develops cancer drugs that are made from chains of amino acids, called peptides, which form in two loops – hence the company’s name – in order to stabilize their geometry. They are unique in that they can bind to just about any biological structure, including proteins, and change their function. And because they can act on diseased cells while leaving healthy cells intact, they can attach to the protein of a tumor cell, for example, and prevent it from growing without affecting the neighboring tissue. Bicycle’s drugs have a vast range of possible therapeutic applications: cancer; respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; psychiatric disorders; and hemophilia. The company is based in Cambridge, UK, and leverages technology licensed from EPFL.\nChristian Heinis, today an EPFL professor, came up with the idea while performing post-doc research at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge . He developed a molecular structure that enables proteins to form bonds similar to those of antibodies, but much smaller, so that they can be diffused through tissue efficiently and produced by chemical synthesis. Heinis also worked with Sir Gregory Winter, a retired University of Cambridge researcher who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, to develop a method for isolating bicyclical peptides that can bind effectively to a clinically important range of target cells.

The work of Majid Jaidi and Hugo Lakshmanan has highlighted the impact of this activity on urban, economic, human, environmental and architectural development resulting from the rise of the Alang port on the west coast of India.\n“As we haven’t been able to go there, we’ve gathered hundreds of pages from numerous theses, and from information based on the reports of NGOs on the ground, we extracted a huge amount of data,” said Majid Jaidi. While on the trail of steel, he uncovered the mechanisms of this spontaneous city that has been built along the sea due to the 14.4 km long dismantling site.\nMetal is the anchor of this research. Many questions and multiple avenues of exploration all revolve around it. What is the origin of the 270 ships that are cut up each year? How is the recovery, processing and redistribution of the steel organized? What are the causes and conditions of employment for those 25,000 to 50,000 required personnel, depending on the season, who are responsible for the proper functioning of this industry? A number of points analyzed by civil engineers provide the first answers.\nThe Alang shipyard, built 30 years ago, has had a significant impact on neighboring villages. They have rapidly prospered, and their people were the first to invest in ship-breaking. Steel is a developing economy for India. It constitutes up to 90% of the vessels, and the rest of the pieces – down to the door hinges – are also recycled in local markets. The steel is used as is or can be fused to produce structural components.\nAll the removed metal heads for the domestic market. Alang shipyard alone provides 4% of India’s steel. However, the environment pays a heavy price for this rapid and chaotic development. Ships are full of heavy metals, asbestos or organic waste that are handled incorrectly and pass, for the most part, directly into the sea.\nToday, Alang is the fastest growing city in India. Its residents also benefit from the migration of tens of thousands of workers. This workforce, which sometimes\nEven without having gone to the other side of the world to carry out this project, Majid Jaidi retains a strong impression of the collected data and his analysis of it: “I could see that this industry is 100% dependent on humans, and yet they aren’t treated well.

On January 28, the European Commission supported this vision, announcing that it has selected the HBP as one of two projects to be funded through the new FET Flagship Program.\nFederating more than 80 European and international research institutions, the Human Brain Project is planned to last ten years (2013-2023). The cost is estimated at 1.19 billion euros.The project will also associate some important North American and Japanese partners. It will be coordinated at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, by neuroscientist Henry Markram with co-directors Karlheinz Meier of Heidelberg University, Germany, and Richard Frackowiak of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL). The Swiss Contribution Switzerland plays a vital role in the Human Brain Project. Henry Markram and his team at EPFL will coordinate the project and will also be responsible for the development and operation of the project’s Brain Simulation Platform. Richard Frackowiak and his team will be in charge of the project’s medical informatics platform; the Swiss Supercomputing Centre in Lugano will provide essential supercomputing facilities. Many other Swiss groups are also contributing to the project. Through the ETH Board, the Swiss Federal Government has allocated 75 million CHF (approximately 60 million Euros) for the period 2013-2017, to support the efforts of both Henry Markram’s laboratory at EPFL and the Swiss Supercomputing Center in Lugano.

This building will also be supported by the Swiss Confederation, the Rolex Group and third-party sponsors.The selection of the Human Brain Project as a FET Flagship is the result of more than three years of preparation and a rigorous and severe evaluation by a large panel of independent, high profile scientists, chosen by the European Commission. In the coming months, the partners will negotiate a detailed agreement with the Community for the initial first two and a half year ramp-up phase (2013-mid 2016). The project will begin work in the closing months\n of 2013.\nA scientific portrait of the Human Brain Project\n The Human Brain Project will provide new tools to help understand the brain and its fundamental mechanisms and to apply this knowledge in future medicine and computing. Central to the Human Brain Project is Information and Computing Technology (ICT). The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior. A novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and\n to speed up the search for new treatments.\nFinally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems. The HBP will fund independent scientists to use the new platforms for their own research, reserving a substantial part of its budget for this purpose.

{"id": 1311, "text": "Imagine being able to track the development of diseased cells in real time, simply by having patients drink a glass of water containing millions of tiny electronic biosensors. Once the microscopic sensors have been ingested, they would travel to diseased tissue in a patient’s body and send out a continuous stream of diagnostic data via telemetry.\nThat’s the ambitious goal that Sandro Carrara from EPFL’s Integrated Systems Laboratory (School of Engineering/ Computer and Communication Sciences) and Pantelis Georgiou from Imperial College London have set for themselves. Such technology seems now possible thanks to advancements in nanofabrication processes for integrated circuits. Berkeley researchers had discussed a  where they suggested to sprinkle CMOS circuits into the human cortex to monitor neural activity.\nAt EPFL, the researchers intend to use body dust for a more general purpose. They have already shown how a CMOS cube of around 10 µm on each side could theoretically be created. They presented these findings at the . The theoretical feasibility of the concept has also been discussed in a preprint on .\nThe scientists hope to revolutionize diagnostic methods and give doctors a better understanding of diseases like cancer. “Today doctors give drugs to cancer patients and wait to see whether the tumor cells go away. But having continuous feedback on how the cells respond to a given treatment would be of unprecedented value,” says Carrara.\nThe microscopic sensors would be cube-shaped and have three complementary electrodes on their surfaces. After a patient swallows them, they would pass through the intestinal walls via the natural process of endocytosis. But that process can happen only if the patient’s body thinks the sensors are bacteria or red blood cells. So the scientists plan to cover the sensors with a special coating and shrink them to 10 µm on each side. Once the sensors enter the blood stream, they would travel to the affected area and attach to diseased cells using targeted ligands such as antibodies. From there they could track the disease’s progress.\nThe sensors would act like spies, supplying information on a cancer cell’s metabolism, for example, or on the local concentration of a drug that had been administered. “The electrodes on the sensors’ surfaces would be able to identify the right protein or drug molecule they come into contact with, because each type of molecule would alter the current in a different way,” says Carrara. The data would be collected using a wireless energy transmission system. “An electromagnetic field or ultrasound waves would be generated outside a patient’s body to charge the sensors and collect data. The sensors won’t contain batteries,” adds Carrara.\nTo flesh out their idea, the scientists drew from concrete examples in the literature, such as glucose sensors of around 10 µm that use CMOS circuits, and a simple glucose sensor with a diameter of just 2.5 µm. In addition, a 10 mm telemetric diagnostic device that is covered with a biocompatible epoxy resin was successfully already tested on mice in 2016. However, the research team still has considerable hurdles to overcome. First, the scientists must shrink the sensors to below 10 µm on each side, so that they are about the same size as red blood cells. Then they will have to demonstrate the feasibility of both their technology and the charging system.\nWould these miniscule sensors have any side effects? For now, it’s too early to say. The scientists believe the sensors could be easily eliminated from a patient’s body, either when the tumor itself is removed or, if it turns out there is no diseased tissue, then through the patient’s urine or stool.\nThis research project brings together scientists from universities across Europe: Catholic University of Leuven, University of Glasgow, Politecnico di Torino, Imperial College London and EPFL.", "summary": "Thanks to an unorthodox approach being proposed by EPFL researchers, patients may soon be able to track their illness simply by drinking a solution containing millions of tiny electronic sensors disguised as bacteria.", "claim": "Thanks to an unorthodox approach being proposed by EPFL researchers, patients may soon be able to track their illness simply by drinking a solution containing three of tiny electronic sensors disguised as bacteria.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [26, 26], "noise": false}
{"id": 1316, "text": "A 30-strong group of EPFL students came up with an impressive array of inventive ideas during the pilot , with the goal of making our campus – and society – greener and cleaner. Their ideas included an “Eco-Score” to rate the environmental impact of meals served at EPFL restaurants, a new digital currency and platform called Karma for exchanging goods and services within the EPFL community, and a web browser add-on called Web Citizens to combat misinformation and encourage critical thinking.\nThe event was organized by a team of around a dozen students along with representatives from EPFL’s Vice Presidency for Academic Affairs, Vice Presidency for Innovation, Vice Presidency for Responsible Transformation, ENAC and College of Humanities. During the five-day event, students from different disciplines worked in groups to develop systems in line with the circular economy. Because today, our economies are anything but circular – supply chains are pretty straight and then hit a dead end. Raw materials are extracted from the Earth and processed into a consumer good, which is packaged, shipped, used up and thrown away. In some cases a handful of materials are recycled, but most of the used products end up in a landfill. And since around 45% of global CO\n2\n emissions come from producing everyday consumer products (according to a ), we can do a lot to save our planet by extending products’ lifetimes and recycling them to a greater extent.\nChallenging the problems \nThe student groups were called on to think creatively about sustainable, actionable solutions that have a positive impact on the climate, the environment and our society. “We want our event to foster collaboration and cross-disciplinary thinking, which is why we didn’t make it a competition,” says Michka Mélo, CSAW coordinator. “The goal was to encourage cross-fertilization among different projects, leverage synergies with existing technology and encourage participants to form networks whether in academia, the non-profit sector or the companies. This pilot version went very well and we’re really pleased – most participants were actively involved right up to the end.” He adds: “We weren’t sure how it would go since it was held just before the start of the semester, included a weekend and was entirely online. It was hard to find the right format so that participants could interact smoothly and effectively.”\nThe groups consisted of two to five Bachelor’s and Master’s students from different EPFL sections. Participants first had to learn the fundamental concepts of sustainability and the circular economy, before then thinking about how they could best put their architectural and engineering skills to work. “We wanted students to focus more on the problems that need to be addressed than the solutions to develop,” says Eric Domon, a project officer at EPFL Sustainability and one of the CSAW organizers. “So we allocated a substantial amount of time to helping them understand the problems through a systemic approach.” Mélo adds: “The idea was to prompt students to challenge the problems put in front of them and how those problems are formulated.”\nThe event included talks from EPFL professors and outside speakers who discussed concrete projects they have worked on related to the circular economy. By the end of the event, the student groups had created seven “pretotypes” of their inventions.\nProjects to be explored further \nOne such invention was Plast’Impact – a machine that can be installed at food shops for customers to scan products and find out how much microplastic they contain. The data would be displayed through an application, helping to draw consumers’ attention to the prevalence of these plastics. “In an ideal world, the government would pass a law requiring food producers to list the microplastics contained in each of their products. But for now our system can be designed to use averages,” says a member of the Plast’Impact team. The machine would work in tandem with a reward system for customers who purchase the least microplastic. An awareness-raising approach similar to the Eco-Score idea, which is based on calculating carbon footprints but also factors in the conditions under which meal ingredients were produced.\nSeveral of the students’ projects related to reducing waste and encouraging the reuse of old objects through sharing. One group had the idea of creating an object library for the Vortex dormitory, which would be run by the . Another group imagined an app that lets users swap clothes they don’t wear anymore and coordinate community events, such as for giving new life to old outfits. And a third was behind the Karma platform, which “could one day become a feature included in the EPFL Campus app.”\nBuilding awareness about the circular economy was the goal of one group, which designed a board game called Circle It. The game is intended to familiarize all age groups with the concept of the circular economy in a fun, educational manner. In a similar vein, the Web Citizens add-on aims to make internet users aware of misinformation and train them to think critically about what they read, such as by looking at the comments at the bottom of an article, checking several different news sources and seeking out diverse viewpoints. Digital citizens could contribute to the initiative as volunteers.\n“All the student groups thought about how their ideas could be taken further once the week was over, through either a semester or Master’s project or .

{"id": 1320, "text": "foresees to design and implement advanced new digitisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to mine Europe’s vast cultural heritage, providing fair and free access to information that will support future scientific and technological developments in Europe\nOne of the most advanced Artificial Intelligence systems ever built\nThe Time Machine will create advanced AI technologies to make sense of vast amounts of information from complex historical data sets. This will enable the transformation of fragmented data – with content ranging from medieval manuscripts and historical objects to smartphone and satellite images – into useable knowledge for industry. In essence, a large-scale computing and digitisation infrastructure will map Europe’s entire social, cultural and geographical evolution. Considering the unprecedented scale and complexity of the data, The Time Machine’s AI even has the potential to create a strong competitive advantage for Europe in the global AI race.\n“Time Machine is likely to become one of the most advanced Artificial Intelligence systems ever built, trained on data from wider geographical and temporal horizons”, explains Frederic Kaplan, Professor of Digital Humanities at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Coordinator of the Time Machine Project.\nCultural Heritage as a valuable economic asset\nCultural Heritage is one of our most precious assets, and the Time Machine’s ten-year research and innovation program will strive to show that rather than being a cost, cultural heritage investment will actually be an important economic driver across industries. This constant source of new knowledge will be an economic motor, giving rise to new professions, services and products in areas such as education, creative industries, policy making, smart tourism, smart cities and environmental modelling. For example, services for comparing territorial configurations across space and time will become an essential tool in developing modern land use policy or city planning. Likewise, the tourism industry will be transformed by professionals capable of creating and managing newly possible experiences at the intersection of the digital and physical world. These industries will have a pan-European platform for knowledge exchange which will add a new dimension to their strategic planning and innovation capabilities.\nA new age for Social Sciences and Humanities\nTime Machine will mark a new age for Social Sciences and Humanities, as it will offer open access to Europe’s past via unified data and new AI services. This will give “super powers” to researchers by revolutionising the individual researcher’s search capabilities, drastically raising the overall scale and scope of social sciences and humanities research. The resulting knowledge will enable the field to effectively contribute to the development of strategic answers to major pan-European challenges such as sustainable growth, social welfare, migration and integration of migrants, and the safeguarding of European democracy.\nTransforming education\nEducation is a crucial factor for the social and economic well-being in Europe and the world, and Time Machine will help transform it by creating a dynamic new industry for the production of educative digital material based on aligned massive datasets. The resulting online courses, materials, simulations and other experiences will promote active engagement with our combined cultural heritage and make continuous learning more accessible and inclusive.\nA unique alliance and a network of cities\nTime Machine promotes a unique alliance of leading European academic and research organisations, Cultural Heritage institutions and private enterprises that are fully aware of the huge potential of digitisation and the very promising new paths for science, technology and innovation that can be opened through the information system that will be developed, based on the Big Data of the Past. In addition to the 33 core institutions that will be funded by the European Commission, more than 200 organisations from 33 countries are participating to the initiatives, including seven national libraries (Austria, Belgium, France, Israel, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland), 19 state archives (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary,Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland), famous museums (Louvre, Rijkmuseum), 95 academic and research institutions, 30 European companies and 18 governmental bodies.\nTime Machine is also a growing network of cities. The project is based on a “franchise” operation model grouping scholars, cultural heritage organisations, government bodies and large groups of volunteers around specific integrated projects focusing on cities. The engagement of a large number of volunteers, often local citizens, in these Local Time Machine initiatives is another key element to ensure their long-term sustainability of the project. Local Time Machines are currently being developed in Venice, Amsterdam, Paris, Jerusalem, Budapest, Regensburg, Nuremberg, Dresden, Antwerp, Ghent, Bruges, Naples, Utrecht, Limburg and more. In the next 12 months, Time Machine is expected to grow as a large community of communities, sharing a standardised platform, with more empowering tools.\nBackground\nIn early 2016, the European Commission held a \n of the research community to gather ideas on science and technology challenges that could be addressed through future FET Flagships. End of 2016, Commissioner Oettinger hosted a \n event with high-level representatives from the Member States, industry and academia. They agreed on three major areas where promising grand science and technology challenges could be addressed by the FET Flagships: \n\"ICT and connected society\", \"Health and the life sciences\" \nand\n \"Energy, environment and climate change\"\n. As a result, a \n for future research initiatives was launched in October 2017 as part of the .

{"id": 1328, "text": "The school is participating in the international quest for the controlled fusion of hydrogen, a virtually inexhaustible source of energy. On the 15th and 16th September, Swiss, European and American scientists submit more than 80 projects that propose sharing the use of EPFL’s Tokamak. This imposing confinement chamber enables the heating of hydrogen to more than 170 million degrees, at which temperature the gas can potentially fusion. The international teams are preparing in particular to use the  experimental fusion reactor.\nAbout thirty Tokamaks are in use in Europe, Asia and North America. The principle is broadly the same for all of them. Confined in a round chamber, in the form of a donut, a cloud of hydrogen is maintained in suspension by an intense magnetic field. The procedure allows the heating of the gas to extreme temperatures. Like at the heart of the sun, isotopes can fusion into helium, a reaction that produces an enormous quantity of energy.\nModeling a hydrogen cloud\n Plasma physics is a well-organized world of its own. Each Tokamak has its own particularities in terms of power, flexibility of use or heating system. Because of this, physicists regularly exchange usage slots, to test their models in different conditions.\nEPFL’s Tokamak has some interesting features. In particular, it’s by far the most flexible one in the world, in terms of how it creates the shape of hydrogen plasma – hence its full name, Variable Configuration Tokamak (TCV). This is a crucial factor in terms of performance.\nH mode: to prepare ITER\n Among the projects submitted to EPFL by the international teams, many of them concern “H mode”. This is sort of recipe for obtaining the ideal plasma that will be mainly used in ITER. Temperature, density, heating system and the shaping of the plasma are all elements that need to be minutely measured to achieve this result.\n“Mode H is a little like insulating a house,” explains Yves Martin, assistant director at the Plasma Physics Laboratory at EPFL. “If you add a layer of insulation, you need less power to maintain a high temperature. But you also need kinds of valves through which the resulting helium can be evacuated, so that it doesn’t stifle the reaction.”\nThe challenge is a highly complex one. The TCV uses a microwave heating system, which is calibrated to transfer its energy to the electrons. By targeting small zones to be heated, the physicists influence the circulation of the electric current inside the plasma, which subsequently impacts the stability and requires adjustments to the magnetic field. “All the parameters are linked, and must be recalculated in real time, which requires a large computing infrastructure,” adds Yves Martin. “That’s the price we have to pay for improving performance.”\nOther more experimental modes, like the IC mode (improved confinement mode) will be tested on the TCV. With approximately 1500 discharges of two seconds per year, EPFL’s Tokamak is designed to provide European and American teams with the possibility to test their models and prepare the era of ITER which, in 2019, will need to maintain plasmas for more than 400 seconds at a stretch.", "summary": "This week, physicists from 15 American and European universities are sharing EPFL’s Tokamak to develop the future of hydrogen fusion.", "claim": "This week, physicists from more than 80 American and European universities are sharing EPFL’s Tokamak to develop the future of hydrogen fusion.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 7], "noise": false}
{"id": 1329, "text": "Switzerland has launched a broad-ranging  on the energy transition (NRP70). Two researchers from EPFL will be heading two joint research projects. Christophe Ballif, from EPFL's  will direct \nPV2050\n, which aims to improve photovoltaic technologies and transfer them to the construction industry. Emmanuel Rey, from the , will direct \nActive Interfaces\n, which will identify and solve problems related to the integration of photovoltaic systems into buildings. Combining two complementary perspectives, the two projects will bring together developers, engineers, architects, and end-users.\nWe met with the two researchers to discuss what lies ahead.\nTogether, you are responsible for a large portion of the new national research program. What are your objectives? \nChristophe Ballif: \nThe main objective of this program is to develop tomorrow’s solar cell technology. We’ve seen dramatic progress in this field, but we would like to continue pushing the envelope. First, we aim to increase the efficiency of solar panels: we would like to develop a new class of devices that can reach 30% efficiency. Today the limit is close to 25% for terrestrial setups. This will be particularly interesting in Switzerland, as it is a small country and a large portion of its roofs would have to be covered to supply only one fifth of its electricity needs. But the higher the efficiency of the solar panels, the smaller the surface needed. As part of this aim, we will also assess the impact of these future technologies on domestic power production. The second objective will be to incorporate new photovoltaic technologies into the façades of buildings, which would increase the available area.\nEmmanuel Rey: \nOnly a small fraction of photovoltaic potential is currently being exploited in today’s buildings, and we cannot take successful implementation of photovoltaic technologies as a given. Our first mission will be to understand the obstacles and bottlenecks in the way of their integration into buildings. There is a gap between end-user demand and available products, as well as other considerable challenges in terms of their architectural integration.\nTo what extent can we improve existing buildings? \nER:\n One of our goals is, in fact, to better integrate photovoltaic panels in urban renewal projects. Many of today’s buildings will be renovated in the coming decades, and we have to make these renovations coincide with the energy transition. Design and technology have to be closely linked and coupled with social and cultural considerations to ensure that projects incorporate solar technologies harmoniously. This is still largely absent today.\nYou plan on working together closely to combine your expertise in technological development and architectural integration. What do you expect to gain from such a multidisciplinary partnership?\nCB:\n We engineers and manufacturers have made tremendous progress in terms of the fabrication of solar panels and their cost, which is why we are often \nER: \nBy adopting an interdisciplinary and coordinated approach between engineers and architects, we bring together elements from both worlds. One is predominantly focused on efficiency, the other on aesthetics and integration. If we include these new technologies early on, we can transform the project into a form of “raw material” that can help the architecture evolve. The premise is no longer to just attach a solar panel onto a building’s façade; instead, a photovoltaic panel could replace an entire element of it. This qualitative and quantitative challenge forces us to work more closely together as designers and technological experts.\nWhat can be done to further increase the efficiency?\nCB:\n We hope to develop new setups with improved efficiencies by adopting new approaches – specifically, stacking multiple layers of solar cells, each able to absorb a different part of the solar light spectrum. This requires coupling together completely flawless components for which we have yet to develop compatible production procedures. Each layer can also be sensitive to temperature, humidity, or structural flaws, so we are up against a considerable challenge.\nBut it seems that are other aspects that have to be improved as well to continue to develop the industry…\nCB: \nThe potential of photovoltaic technologies is immense. But because their energy production is intermittent, managing it leads, in the short term, to a number of problems that can be overcome by adopting smart grids, dams, or local storage solutions. Then there is the challenge posed by the seasons. But drops in energy production during winter could be mitigated by integrating solar panels directly into building façades. In this case, electricity could still be generated at the levels of the summer months.\nER:\n The challenge is to speed up the transfer of academic research to the people implementing the technologies on the actual construction site. We are planning to model actual projects and submit them to those interested for evaluation. We would like to forge ties between various disciplines to grow a new culture in Switzerland. Getting there will require improving the aesthetic integration of projects and developing the best designs for each element. Today, the technology provides us with panels in a wide range of colors, including white. To meet our objectives, we will have to work on color options, but also on finishing elements, construction details, the size of the modules, and even the texture of the solar panels.\nWhat are the limits of solar power or the technical, social, cultural, or economic challenges that will have to be met? \nER:\n Simply installing solar panels on rooftops can lead to blockages, particularly from municipalities that are, rightly, afraid that their townscapes would be defaced. Integration is therefore essential. That is why our ambition is to develop new paths to achieve both qualitative and quantitative improvements, without losing the identity of our cities.\nCB: \nCommunication between engineers and the other construction-related professionals sometimes just doesn’t exist. Let me cite an example of this that I experienced myself, where we had to remove the all the gravel from a brand-new rooftop just to set up the support structure for solar panels, simply because there had not been enough coordination or effort into the integration during the early stages of the project. Generally, I think that people are still reluctant, for all kinds of reasons – good and bad. But the change will come; buildings with lower energy requirements will all have photovoltaic setups. In the Canton of Vaud, all new buildings are by law required to produce some of the power their residents will consume. So now, all of the trades involved in construction will have to face up to this reality.", "summary": "Fifteen joint research projects have received funding to prepare Switzerland’s energy transition.

In partnership with the Bühler Group and the Junior Enterprises of EPFL and ETH Zurich, you’re invited to come up with ideas for limiting the losses and waste that occur between the field and consumers. \n A third of the world’s food supply never makes its way into human stomachs. Losses and waste occur all along the production chain, from farms to households. If this situation persists, arable land will not be able to support the 8 billion humans that will populate the Earth by the year 2025.\nThe family-run Bühler Group, a major supplier of food processing solutions, soon to be present in EPFL’s Innovation Park, would like to innovate and re-think the food value chain to solve this pressing problem. At the end of the online Fusebox challenge, the best “ideators” will be invited to company headquarters in Uzwil to participate in a workshop that has a CHF 10,000 prize at stake. Fusebox has given itself a facelift for the occasion, with a more engaging interface. This challenge will be an opportunity to bring EPFL and ETH Zurich together, and because of this the contest will be run in English.\nFrom farm to plate the food chain is long and fraught with difficulties. Conditioning, storage, transport, processing of agricultural commodities into food products, management of the flow between suppliers and consumers via retailers – these are some of the stages on a journey in which innovation is necessary in order to reduce loss. How can storage be improved? Will new information technologies allow us to manage stocks better? How can we re-value losses? How can we reduce the amount of transport needed or encourage more local production and consumption?\nFive times the surface of India\n Losses all along the value chain lead to the disappearance of a third of all the food that is produced agriculturally in the world.

{"id": 1335, "text": "After more than two years of intense preparation, the Swiss team can be proud of the performance of its students. All in all, over 250 students contributed in the design and construction of their solar house called , big winner of the international sustainable housing competition . The 44 solar decathletes surpassed themselves on the competition site in Denver to build and show visitors around their house. «During the construction phase, I was impressed by the team’s determination. It was really hard, we were wet, tired, and cold, but everyone was driven by the project, because deep down, we believed in it.», says Florian Meyer, telecommunications student. The house travelled over 10'000 kilometers through the ocean, rail and road; a perilous route made even more difficult by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Architecture students, Axelle Marchon and Sarah Sauthier, say: «At the beginning we were scared because of the missing container. During the construction phase, we were in survival mode. And finally, regarding the community house concept, we thought we could either make it or completely break it! We started believing in it when the first results were announced. At that moment, the house was up and running, and we said to ourselves that we are really participating in the competition!»\nA risky bet that paid off\nThe NeighborHub, a solar community house, convinced the jury, and was awarded eight contests out of ten - six of them in the first place! One interesting conclusion about the competition is the fact that the juries either loved our unusual concept and granted us awards for it or considered it off-topic and penalized it. As a reminder, the Swiss team made the audacious bet of coming up with a different concept, proposing a house at the service of a community, rather than a family home. Most members of the jury appreciated the boldness of the concept, by granting the first place on the following contests: architecture, water management, health and comfort, home life, energy, and engineering, that is to say, six contests out of ten! The team was awarded the second place in appliances, and the third place in communications.\nThe bet is won, and the Swiss team wins the competition with a solid lead of 50 points. «Such a big gap is rare!», says Linda Silverman, Solar Decathlon 2017 director.\nTeam cohesion, the greatest triumph\nA natural explanation of this great success, would be the synergy and convergence of people from different backgrounds towards a shared goal: architects, engineers, as well as communicators and economists. Joëlle Baehr-Bruyère, civil engineering student says: «Everybody was curious about one another’s disciplines. There was a strong intellectual energy! This dynamic, this emulation, was extremely rewarding».\nThey all looked for and found a common language. That was the greatest challenge during these three years of co-creation : «It took time to put in place a common language, but once we made it, everything started flowing, even though there was over 40 of us working together!», says Marin Thaller, architecture student. «Everybody struggled to make themselves heard and to have a chance to bring what mattered to them in the project. So yes, we all had to make concessions, but now we are all very proud, because the project is consistent, everything is well integrated, and everything’s been pushed to the limit», adds Alexandre Rychner, architecture student.\nValues put to the test\nThis adventure could not have been possible without the expertise provided by the four partner schools (EPFL, HEIA-FR, HEAD and UNIFR), the unfailing support from 48 partners with their expertise and know-how. Students were well aware of their chance to have such generous partners. Marin Thaller, architecture student, explains: «We made powerful connections with our partners, and that may lead to employment.»\nThe strength of the Swiss team consists in its multidisciplinary cohesion; everybody went along with it, regardless of their background. Joëlle Baehr-Bruyère, civil engineering students says: «We worked together, and we succeeded together. We helped and carried each other.» The Swiss team applied the NeighborHub values all the way through by making the sharing element the key of their success.\nThis project also provided the students with a unique, unforgettable, and inspirational learning opportunity. Xavier Tendon, environmental sciences and engineering student, is full of enthusiasm when it comes to speaking about the practical skills acquired: «I have learned to build a solar thermal system from A to Z. I’ll install one at home later, that’s for sure!»\nThe  will be long remembered as a pioneering project providing a unique learning and sharing framework for its students, a real school of life.

{"id": 1344, "text": "A promising avenue for the future of clean energy is to store it in the form of carbon-based fuels produced from renewable sources, effectively enabling the clean use of liquid fuels such as gasoline. A first step is the electrolysis of carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide, which can be subsequently be transformed into liquid fuels. But current CO-forming catalysts are either not selective enough or too expensive to be industrially viable. EPFL scientists have now developed an Earth-abundant catalyst based on copper-oxide nanowires modified with tin oxide. A solar-driven system set up using this catalyst was able to split CO\n2\n with an efficiency of 13.4%. The work is , and is expected to help worldwide efforts to synthetically produce carbon-based fuels from CO\n2\n and water.\nThe research was carried out by the lab of . Grätzel is known worldwide for the invention of dye-sensitized solar cells (“Grätzel cells”). The new catalyst, developed by PhD student Marcel Schreier, postdoc Jingshan Luo, and several co-workers, is made by depositing atomic layers of tin oxide on copper oxide nanowires. Tin oxide suppresses the generation of side-products, which are commonly observed from copper oxide catalysts, leading to the sole production of CO in the electroreduction of CO\n2\n.\nThe catalyst was integrated into a CO\n2\n electrolysis system and linked to a triple-junction solar cell (GaInP/GaInAs/Ge) to make a CO\n2\n photo-electrolyzer. Importantly, the system uses the same catalyst as the cathode that reduces CO\n2\n to CO and the anode that oxidizes water to oxygen through what is known as the “oxygen evolution reaction”. The gases are separated with a bipolar membrane. Using only Earth-abundant materials to catalyze both reactions, this design keeps the cost of the system low.\nThe system was able to selectively convert CO\n2\n to CO with an efficiency of 13.4% using solar energy. The catalyst also reached a Faradaic efficiency of up to 90%, which describes how efficiently electrical charge is transferred to the desired product in an electrocatalysis system like the one developed here. “The work sets a new benchmark for solar-driven CO\n2\n reduction,” says Luo.\n“This is the first time that such a bi-functional and low-cost catalyst is demonstrated,” adds Schreier. “Very few catalysts — except expensive ones, like gold and silver — can selectively transform CO\n2\n to CO in water, which is crucial for industrial applications.”\nThis work was carried out in collaboration with Jeremy Luterbacher’s Laboratory of Sustainable and Catalytic Processing at EPFL.

{"id": 1348, "text": "Some of the most promising solar cells today use light-harvesting films made from perovskites – a group of materials that share a characteristic molecular structure. However, perovskite-based solar cells use expensive “hole-transporting” materials, whose function is to move the positive charges that are generated when light hits the perovskite film.  EPFL scientists have now engineered a considerably cheaper hole-transporting material that costs only a fifth of existing ones while keeping the efficiency of the solar cell above 20%.\nAs the quality of perovskite films increases, researchers are seeking other ways of improving the overall performance of solar cells. Inadvertently, this search targets the other key element of a solar panel, the hole-transporting layer, and specifically, the materials that make them up. There are currently only two hole-transporting materials available for perovskite-based solar cells. Both types are quite costly to synthesize, adding to the overall expense of the solar cell.\nTo address this problem, a team of researchers led by  at EPFL developed a molecularly engineered hole-transporting material, called FDT, that can bring costs down while keeping efficiency up to competitive levels. Tests showed that the efficiency of FDT rose to 20.2% – higher than the other two, more expensive alternatives. And because FDT can be easily modified, it acts as a blueprint for an entire generation of new low-cost hole-transporting materials.\n“The best performing perovskite solar cells use hole transporting materials, which are difficult to make and purify and are prohibitively expensive, costing over €300 per gram, preventing market penetration,” says Nazeeruddin. “By comparison, FDT is easy to synthesize and purify, and its cost is estimated to be a fifth of that for existing materials – while matching, and even surpassing their performance.”\nThis study was led by EPFL’s Group for Molecular Engineering of Functional Materials, in collaboration with the Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie Molecolari del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (Italy), Panasonic Corporation (Japan), EPFL’s Laboratory for Photomolecular Science and Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, and the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute.

{"id": 1350, "text": "Talking to Maryna Viazovska, you get the sense that her brain operates on a higher level. Mathematical dimensions are her playthings. For Viazovska, the problem of sphere packing in 8 and 24 dimensions might be akin to a 30,000-piece jigsaw puzzle for a normal human brain. She solved that problem, coming up with a brilliant – and elegant – solution. Viazovska is one of the brightest and well-known mathematicians in the field of numbers theory.\nThe 35-year-old native of Kiev seemed destined for a career in mathematics. “I've liked mathematics since school,” Viazovska says. “It always seemed like the most straightforward subject. And since I liked it, I spent more time on it, and I became better at math than at other subjects. So then I liked it even more, and so on.” As her career developed, she delved ever further into an exploration of the most fascinating dimensions of her chosen field of study. Her aim in pure mathematics – in addition to problem solving – is to understand things that she finds intriguing “so that I can connect them to other problems.”\nIt was as part of her postdoctoral research at the Berlin Mathematical School and at Humboldt University of Berlin that she took on and resolved a question that had stumped mathematicians for more than four centuries: how to pack spheres as close together as possible. It was in 1611 that Johannes Kepler posited, without proof, that the best solution for packing spheres in a three-dimensional space was in the shape of a pyramid. That hypothesis was finally proven in 1998.\nElegant and optimal\nWith the third dimension resolved, it was time to move on to other dimensions. “What's hard is that each dimension is different, and the optimal solution depends very much on the dimension,” says Viazovska. Why did she focus on 8 and 24 dimensions? “Because these are special dimensions, and the solutions are particularly elegant.” That’s because the ways the spheres are packed is remarkably symmetrical in these particular dimensions using the E8 and Leech lattices, respectively. When it comes to optimization, this is close to perfection – to one billionth of a percent, according to the findings of Henry Cohn and Noam Elkies, mathematicians in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nBut Viazovska wanted to prove it, suspecting that an auxiliary function existed that could provide the right answer and match the density of the E8 and Leech lattices. For this, she drew on modular forms – the focus of her dissertation. Modular forms are mathematical functions with a high level of symmetry. After two years of work, fueled by creativity and intuition, she came up with the right function for 8 dimensions. She published her results in March 2016. Her proof filled 23 pages. Concise, for mathematicians; impenetrable, for the uninitiated. Henry Cohn congratulated her and immediately suggested that she extend her method to the Leech lattice in 24 dimensions. Viazovska, Cohn and two other colleagues posted an analogous theorem for 24 dimensions online one week later.\nLingering mystery\nThis proof was cheered by the mathematical community and has earned Viazovska a number of prestigious distinctions that are listed on her Wikipedia page (which even has a short version in Hindi). In December 2016, she accepted EPFL’s offer to become a tenure-track assistant professor. Just one year later, in January 2018, she was promoted to full professor. “I really like the fact that at EPFL there’s not just pure mathematics, but also a lot of people working in very applied fields.” A good sign that her feet are firmly planted on the ground.\nViazovska continues her work on 8 and 24 dimensions, delving deeper into both sphere-packing and the ‘universal optimality’ of the E8 and Leech lattices. “These configurations appear in other optimization problems and topics in combinatorics – probably because they always work best, not only for packing spheres but also in explaining energy expenditure, for example,” she says, adding: “That’s rather unusual.” Another mystery to solve.\nBio\n1984\n: born in Kiev\n2013\n: earns PhD from the University of Bonn\n2016\n: resolves the problem of stacking in 8 and then 24 dimensions\n2016\n: hired as a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL\n2018\n: appointed full professor at EPFL", "summary": "Summer Series: A calling for research.

What’s required? A 360-degree 2D photo taken with any commercial camera, and a pair of off-the-shelf virtual-reality glasses. The software is similar to photo editing software allowing the users to freely explore and modify the environment created from the picture in real time.\nFaster and cheaper\nImverse’s software delivers professional results and has a wide range of potential uses. Javier Bello Ruiz, the CEO of Imverse, which got its start at Campus Biotech Innovation Park, is initially targeting virtual-reality studios that work with real-estate agencies, advertisers and the media. “Take a real-estate agent who wants to sell a house that’s in need of a little work. The seller could show a prospective buyer the end result by modeling the house in 3D using a 360-degree photo and then modifying the interior in real time – even collaboratively together inside the virtual environment – suggesting various options that the buyer could tweak freely using the virtual-reality glasses.”\nThe program is so simple that even non-experts can use it, and licenses will be available early next year. “Just like with photo editing software, all you need is a little training to begin developing interactive content,” said Javier. This will save users significant time and money. The underlying technology was developed in part at the lab run by Olaf Blanke, the director of the Center for Neuroprosthetics located at Campus Biotech. The software will soon be tested by potential customers and will be presented this week at the World VR Forum in Crans-Montana. “Switzerland is known for its cutting-edge technology, and the Lake Geneva region has an excellent virtual-reality ecosystem. So we’re hopeful that we’ll meet potential customers and partners and stir up interest among investors,” Javier added.\nThe project engineers are already at work on the next step: full immersion of a user’s body so that the user can interact with the virtual environment in real time.

{"id": 1355, "text": "A number of books have already been written about EPFL, recounting our School’s history and achievements. But EPFL President Martin Vetterli – as passionate about photography as he is about research – wanted to create something new: a sophisticated book of photographs, or rather photographers, that capture EPFL as it stands today. The result, \nPerspectives on EPFL\n, has just been published by EPFL Press, in association with EPFL and the Musée de l’Elysée. The museum’s director Tatyana Franck chaired the committee that selected the photographers, and subsequently the photographs, for the book.\nFree rein for three photographers\nLeutenegger – originally from Lausanne and winner of the Prix Culturel de la Photographie (awarded by the Fondation Vaudoise pour la Culture) and Swiss Federal Design Awards – takes us behind the scenes for an unorthodox view of scientific research. Konopka, who in 1998 won the second Vevey International Photo Award given by Festival Images, took still-life images of EPFL’s buildings. And Christinat – also from Lausanne – captured the simple, subtle gestures that constitute campus life. Christinat is known for being one of the 28 photographers featured in \nPhoto Suisse\n, an international production by the Swiss broadcasting corporation (SSR SRG Idée Suisse) that included a series of artist documentaries, a book and a travelling exhibition.\nThese three photographers had free rein to depict our School as it is currently and how they see its future. Throughout 2018 they crisscrossed our campus, going behind closed doors and exploring all the angles to capture rare, revealing moments. In addition to the book \nPerspectives on EPFL\n, their work will also be presented in a contemporary exhibition titled \nInfinity Room I.\nInfinity Room I\n: an augmented version of the book\nInfinity Room I\n is inspired by the book as well as the mathematical concept of boundlessness, especially in the context of scientific exploration and innovation at our School. It will be held in the ArtLab building from 12 April to 28 July.\nThe exhibition will invite visitors to experience the three photographers’ works from new perspectives, which spring both from the unique staging developed by Professor Sarah Kenderdine, director of ArtLab and head of EPFL’s Laboratory for Experimental Museology (eM+), and from the visitors themselves. “The idea was not to take the book and put it on the walls, but to augment the book, and to work with each photographer to reframe their images,” explains Kenderdine. “\nInfinity Room I\n opens up the space for interpretation and contextualization in different ways, but the real interpretation resides in the viewer.”\nThree artists, infinite perspectives\nVisitors will enter the exhibition by “walking through” the pages of a giant book. On one side will be displayed Konopka’s black-and-white portraits of EPFL’s iconic buildings from the Lausanne, Fribourg, Neuchâtel, Valais-Wallis and Campus Biotech sites. These photographs will be displayed in the wall-mounted format of traditional photography museums.\nFurther along in the exhibition, visitors will discover Christinat’s images, which capture the energy and emotion of study, research and life at EPFL. To convey the complexity of campus life, his images will be presented on a 30-meter movie screen stretched along the ArtLab’s southwest wall, like a window onto EPFL.\nFor her contribution to the book, Leutenegger ventured inside some of EPFL’s laboratories to capture images – from the digital to the microscopic – that bring EPFL research into focus. To contextualize the complexity of research spaces, she employed augmented reality technology: a panoramic video, spherical gigapixel images that allow visitors to “explore” the labs captured in her photographs, and an augmented animation of a blood sample from Professor Vetterli himself. A walk-in “aquarium” will also provide information on the ethical implications of using animal subjects, such as zebrafish, in scientific research.\nA second part of the exhibition, \nInfinity Room II\n, will open in September. This part will focus on EPFL research, and will feature interactive augmented reality installations and full-dome data visualizations, as well as an image archive in honor of our School’s 50th anniversary.\nPerspectives on EPFL\n, published by EPFL Press, will be available at Librairie La Fontaine starting today and in all bookstores from 23 April.

{"id": 1357, "text": "As it turns out, the theme of the second edition of IGLUNA – “A remote-controlled space habitat” – was aptly fitting under the current circumstances. Coordinated by the Swiss Space Center, as part of the European Space Agency’s  initiative, IGLUNA focuses on designing technologies that will help astronauts live in space.\nStarting in September 2019, 150 students from 10 European countries put their expertise and creativity to the test. They worked on topics such as how to design living spaces, produce oxygen, food and electricity, navigate and communicate with Earth, maintain physical and mental health, and conduct scientific experiments.\nA special year\n“For 2020, we raised the bar by introducing remote-controlled operations,” says Tatiana Benavides, project manager at the Swiss Space Center. “This reflects the reality of space exploration: missions to the moon will begin with robots that are remotely controlled from Earth.”\nThe students were originally scheduled to meet up in Luzern from 10 to 19 July. To simulate extreme environments like the Moon, their prototypes and experimental designs were to be installed on Mount Pilatus and piloted from a control room at the Swiss Museum of Transport.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, however, forced the team to rethink the event. “We were caught off guard and had to learn as a group how to organize a virtual campaign,” says Benavides. She and her team provided support for participants as things changed, giving them advice and tips for their presentations.\nThe new format, however, had a silver lining: the online presentations not only allowed everyone to take part, but also fostered greater student involvement. “In 2019, due to time constraints and the distance between the two campaign sites in Zermatt, some people were unable to see the other projects,” says Eva Buchs, IGLUNA communications officer. “This year, the teams could connect via YouTube live chat and see what everyone else was up to!”\nOutstanding results \nEach team was given one hour to present its project to the general public as well as aerospace professionals. The  team from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences unveiled its system for growing plants without soil, a technique known as hydroponics, or soilless culture. The students used human waste to provide plants with necessary nutrients, while a closed loop ensured that water was used sustainably. They developed customizable LED lighting and created an environment conducive to plant growth, all of which is monitored by sensors and controlled by an intelligent system.\n“We believe the time has come to reuse satellites, in the same way as rockets,” says Mayank, head of the  project. At the Technical University of Berlin, Mayank and his team have been developing their own antennae and satellites fitted with a communication system that is operable in space and that can be remotely reconfigured for various missions.\nIs there life in outer space? To find out, the  team from the University of Bern has been working on ORIGIN, a compact, lightweight and easy-to-use instrument that detects biosignatures and performs chemical analyses of planetary surfaces. The team also built the rover that will carry ORIGIN and installed a cryogenic cooling system on the device to simulate the extreme conditions of space.\nRounding out the 2020 edition, three teams were honored during the IGLUNA Space Awards ceremony. ,  and  distinguished themselves by the excellence of their accompanying documentation, their ability to find sponsoring, their team spirit, the structure of their presentations and their involvement across the ten days of the campaign.\nBack to the future\n“Students take part in IGLUNA not only for the experience, but also with an eye to their own future,” says Benavides. “There is the educational side, as well as a chance to network with aerospace professionals, and lastly, technology transfer.” For example, the Celestial team just launched a startup, and  (now an EPFL association) has been fine-tuning its prototype – a robot that grows and harvests plants automatically and without human intervention – since last year.\nIGLUNA 2021 will be even more demanding, with an expanded “business” component.

Riding on this wave in medicine, Jurgi Camblong, Pierre Hutter and Lars Steinmetz have founded a start-up to securely store this data, which promises to be considerable (one genome contains 3 billion letters or nucleotides!). Reading the data will be made easier with new software.\nLaunched in September 2012, this new bioinformatics tool is already being used by a dozen hospitals and laboratories in Switzerland.

{"id": 1364, "text": "Growth continues in the student numbers enrolled at EPFL. The new academic year started last Tuesday in the atmosphere of a heartening increase in the number of enrollments for the fourth consecutive year—a record. Across all the study courses, the new enrollments recorded on September 9th are 9.5% higher than for the same period in 2010. Because of inevitable withdrawals resulting from multiple enrollments or accommodation problems, particularly acute this year, the final figures will not be established till the end of October.\nThe provisional figures show that 1467 new students, 28% of whom are women, have been accepted on to one of the Bachelor’s courses.\n In parallel, 296 students (+11%) coming from other institutions or the higher education college (HES) pathway, 30% of whom are women, will begin a Master’s course at EPFL. There they will rub shoulders with the 636 students who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree at EPFL this summer and are continuing their program of studies here.\nAll these newcomers to the lecture-halls are joining students who are following a continuous program at EPFL. Their total for the academic year 2011–2012, allowing for probable disenrollments, will exceed 8000 students (an increase of around 10% on the final figures for last year). The Bachelor’s students will increase by around 10%, those on Master’s courses between 10% and 20% and, finally, there will be 5% to 10% more doctoral candidates than in 2010–2011.\nAn increase in almost all the courses\nAlmost all the Bachelor’s courses are anticipating an increase in their student numbers. At this stage of enrollments, it’s mainly courses in civil engineering (+67 students, +75% on the final figures for 2010), mathematics (+29 students, +38%) and mechanical engineering (+32 students, +30%) that account for the increase in the number of new faces that will be seen at EPFL this year.\nAt the Master’s level, despite the risks of making comparisons given the small numbers, there is evidence of a strong attraction for students from outside EPFL to the computer science section (+21 students, +48.8%). The College of Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship also has a full house, with 25 new students enrolled (+400%). Finally this year 20 students, 17 of whom are from other institutions, are starting the new Masters in Energy Management and Sustainability, which they will partly attend at EPFL Middle East in Ras Al Khaimah (United Arab Emirates).\nWorking in small groups is becoming standard in the first year\nThe students who are starting at EPFL this year will benefit substantially from an innovative educational system specific to this institution: the “tutorial” principle, designed to reinforce the supervision of exercise sessions in the analysis and physics lessons. In this system, a group of eight students is presented with exercises to solve under supervision of a “tutor” recruited from the more advanced students. The emphasis is on problem solving, which the participants debate together. “This system, which we tested out four years ago, has proved its merits”, states Nadine Stainier, Teaching Advisor for Pedagogical Research and Support (CRAFT). It gives the students the opportunity to be much more active in seeking solutions and teaches them to argue their standpoint with their colleagues. It helps them to build their network and to integrate into the academic community.’\nAnother new feature is the requirement for Master’s students on engineering courses to carry out a minimum of eight weeks’ work experience in a company to obtain their diploma. This means they are confronted very early on with the realities of the working world.\nThese two examples demonstrate EPFL’s dynamism also in terms of its primary mission, teaching. They occur in the context of a major review that will ultimately lead to a fundamental reorganization in Bachelor’s courses.

{"id": 1367, "text": "One of the eight research projects, involving personalized medicine, stands to revolutionize treatment options for cancer patients. It is being carried out by EPFL’s  (LTS4) in association with  (CHUV). The project scientists are using advanced machine-learning algorithms to analyze images of tumor cells and identify the distinguishing features of each type of tumor. That will enable doctors to better categorize patients’ tumors and select the most effective treatment for each one, broadening the range of personalized therapies available. This type of information, which has not yet been widely exploited, will be obtained by automatically analyzing vast amounts of data. “Personalized medicine is a rapidly growing field, thanks largely to high-speed sequencing,” says Olivier Michielin, chief physician of the analytic personalized oncology division at the CHUV. “Today, oncologists choose cancer treatments based in part on the shape of the tumor as seen under a microscope.” And while shape can be useful for initially classifying a tumor, the information generated from sophisticated, interpretable algorithms – combined with human judgment – can allow for a much more granular diagnosis.\nDeveloping personalized treatments\nDrawing on their expertise in machine learning, the EPFL scientists will develop automatically-run algorithms to process the data. These algorithms will train computer models to spot key tumor features based on a large data set. The goal is to develop methods that doctors can interpret and use to evaluate the results obtained from a computer. “If the model classifies a tumor in a given category, we need to know why – what aspect of the tumor’s architecture led to that decision,” says Michielin. “Machine learning, and especially the architecture currently used in deep learning, can give good predictions in many applications, but it’s not always easy to understand their results in detail,” says Pascal Frossard, head of the Signal Processing Laboratory. But when it comes to patient treatments, doctors must be able to thoroughly comprehend why a given conclusion was reached before they make any major decisions.\nFor this research, the project team will focus on melanoma, the most aggressive kind of skin cancer. They aim to be able to predict how the tumor will respond to immunotherapy, which is a treatment method that involves stimulating a patient’s own immune system to fight the cancer cells. “This type of treatment can be highly effective – but not on everyone. We want to understand why, and what tumor characteristics are typically associated with a positive outcome. That will help doctors select the best treatment for a particular patient,” says Michielin.\nDrawing on several disciplines\nAnother Swiss Data Science Center project being carried out in association with EPFL involves developing an electronic platform to house data collected as part of the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) project and to make that data available to the general public. During this expedition, some 150 scientists studied phenomena in the Antarctic to better understand how climate change is affecting the Southern Ocean and what that means for our entire planet.

{"id": 1371, "text": "Today, those who had taken part in the \"internet for girls\" course organized by the Science Outreach Department were on campus to receive their certificates. This 23rd edition of the ceremony had some distinguished guests, with Suzan LeVine, the US ambassador to Switzerland, and Martin Vetterli, the next EPFL president, both taking part.\nA total of 148 schoolgirls aged between 9 and 12 took part in IT courses organized in Lausanne and Porrentruy in recent months. Over 11 half-day sessions, they learnt how to create their own website. \"Don't lose that curiosity that led you to the course,\" urged Suzan LeVine. During her speech, the ambassador, who herself has a scientific background, told the audience about her unusual career path, which took her from studies in aerospace and English to volunteering to work for Barack Obama’s election campaign in the area of social media. She's a real source of inspiration for young girls.\nAnd yes, it was a course just for girls. In fact, the Science Outreach Department organizes a whole series of activities aimed at sparking an interest in information and communication technology in young girls. The proportion of female students in this field at EPFL, for example, was still only 14.5% in 2015. \"We need to give young girls more confidence in their capacties and ensure they get proper training so that later on they will consider entering these fields at university and professionally,\" said Farnaz Moser, Head of the Science Outreach Department, who has been organizing these courses for 13 years.\nEleven weeks to build a dog robot\nCertificates for the robotics courses were also awarded today. Some 50 11-to-13-year-old boys and girls have been learning how to build and program a robot since March. \"The aim is to build a robot that looks like a dog on a lead; it can bark, turn its head and doesn't bang into walls,\" explained Jonathan Lutz, an EPFL Masters student and Department assistant. He came from Jura Canton every week to share his passion with the younger generation.\n\"We'll see you all at the start of 2022 academic year!\" joked Martin Vetterli to the 200 9-to-13 year olds who quite possibly discovered a new passion or a future career during the sessions. And even if they didn't, the workshops will have taught them new skills that they won't get to learn at school. So, mission accomplished. The ceremony was followed by a \"science discovery day,\" with the children and their parents coming from Jura Canton by bus to learn more about various scientific experiments.\nThe Science Outreach Department organizes other courses, camps and workshops for young children and teenagers.

{"id": 1373, "text": "A joint study by EPFL, ETHZ and the CHUV has identified a pathological process that takes place in both mice and humans and causes one of the most common diseases that people face in the industrialized world: type 2 diabetes. \nThis work was conducted in Johan Auwerx’s (EPFL) and Ruedi Aebersold’s (ETHZ) laboratories, and succeeded thanks to the combination of each team’s strengths. The relevance of their discovery, published today in Cell, results from their joint effort.\nIn Lausanne, the researchers at EPFL and CHUV carried out a detailed study of the genome (the genetic make-up of an organism) and the phenome (the set of all observable phenotypes, or clinical traits) of a family of 183 mice. \"By comparing the metabolism of twins subjected to different life conditions and different diets, it is possible to exactly assess the influence of the environment on the expression of certain genes and the way this affects clinical features and the risk for developing diseases\", explained Auwerx, Director of the Laboratory of Integrative Systems Physiology (LISP) at EPFL.\nUp to this moment, the combination of the genotypic and phenotypic information had already proved to be enlightening. In this instance, researchers added a new analytical layer obtained through new spectrometry technology developed at ETHZ, making it possible to quantify the presence of hundreds of proteins from a single sample and establish what experts call each individual’s proteome, or set of expressed proteins.\nBy combining each mouse’s genome, phenome, proteome and metabolome (the set of other chemicals found in a lab sample), the scientists were able to identify a particular gene located on chromosome 2 of the mice whose presence plays an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\"The mice with a diet high in fat are more or less likely to develop diabetes depending on whether this gene is active or not\", said Evan Williams, a LISP PhD student and the Cell article’s co-first author. \"By combining our various layers of information, we were able to establish exactly the process that leads from the presence of this gene to an increased risk of diabetes.\"\nAnother interesting fact is that diabetic mice have low urinary levels of a specific metabolite called 2-aminoadipate. Its concentration varies significantly depending on the presence of the identified gene, but not in relation to the rodents’ body fat. For researchers, this proves that it is indeed the gene, and not the diet, that regulates the expression of this protein.\n\"The strength of this correlation prompted us to ask ourselves whether it would also occur in the case of humans,\" said Williams. To find out, the researchers relied on the work of the Lausanne cohort (CoLaus) study, led by the CHUV, which recently published the results of tests from nearly 1,000 individuals. The facts were clear: in patients with type 2 diabetes, the rate of 2-aminoadipase was lower than in the rest, just like in mice\n\"Thanks to this innovative approach that connects several layers of information, we were able to identify a urinary marker that can easily detect the presence of a case of diabetes,\" said Johan Auwerx.\nOther approaches like this will certainly help to develop new diagnostic tools applicable to other diseases. \"It is very exciting to see that we can now translate research results from one species to another. To me, a new age for biology, and soon medicine, has just begun,\" Auwerx concluded.", "summary": "By using novel analysis tools, researchers from EPFL and ETH Zürich identified a gene in mice involved in the development of type 2 diabetes.

{"id": 1377, "text": "Tracking individuals in a large group, be they ants or humans, is no trivial task. By applying statistics to mobile phone signals picked up in a large crowd, Master’s student Elisaveta Kondratieva developed a way to more accurately follow and understand the behavior of the individuals that make up the crowd, revealing the potential and the pitfalls of this new approach. For her semester project, she evaluated an extensive dataset gathered at the 2010 Paléo music festival in a campaign entirely planned and carried out by researchers in the research groups of Patrick Thiran and Martin Vetterli in collaboration with Olivier Dousse at Nokia.\nEvery year, the Paléo music festival attracts well over 40,000 music aficionados per day. Many carry mobile phones with activated bluetooth devices. In 2010, ten “agents” were part of the crowd, equipped with special mobile phones programmed to pick up and store the identity of all detectable bluetooth devices in their vicinity. The data they gathered provides a list of all of the detectable bluetooth devices surrounding each of the walking agents at any given time throughout the evening.\nOften, these data are not enough to discriminate between different nearby locations. Were the detected individuals at the Asian food stall, the stand right next to it, or were they on the way to their next concert? Detecting the presence of bluetooth signals narrows down the position of the mobile phone that emits it, and that of its owner, to a radius around 10 to 20 meters around the agent. The inaccuracy of the agent’s GPS adds up to 10 more meters of uncertainty. Furthermore, many devices were only detected a handful of times in the course of the evening.\nThis is where statistics come in handy. “Using an approach based on Bayesian statistics, that is by taking into account certain pieces of available information, the accuracy of the outcome can be improved,” she says. Concert schedules, a detailed map of the festival grounds, and other sources of information can help fill in the gaps between separate detections and provide likely estimates of the exact locations of the individuals.\nFor such an approach to work, a significant fraction of the audience have to have their bluetooth devices set to be detectable. Fortunately, this turned out to be the case: fixed detectors at the entrance to the festival  - just over 8% of the 40,500 people that attended the festival that day.\nThe quality of the results depends largely on how effectively the agents fan out across the festival grounds. “Two of our agents basically spent the entire evening at the festival together,” says the student, “so the data they obtained overlapped. Also, none of our agents ever went to one of the more remote stages.” To fix these loopholes, future campaigns could involve a larger number of fixed detectors and mobile agents. Additionally, a similar approach could be adopted to follow individuals using their WiFi signals.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES (4) - For her semester project, an EPFL Master’s student applied a different approach to tracking the flow of the crowds at the Paléo music festival – using cell phone data and statistics.", "claim": "SUMMER SERIES (Two) - For her semester project, an EPFL Master’s student applied a different approach to tracking the flow of the crowds at the Paléo music festival – using cell phone data and statistics.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [3, 3], "noise": false}

They will participate in the \nACE Maritime University\n, a 25-day voyage that will bring them to Cape Town, South Africa. The aim of this initiative, organized under the auspices of the Russian Geographical Society, is to give Master’s and early PhD students with an interest in the natural and marine sciences the opportunity to expand their knowledge and work on interdisciplinary projects.\nFollowing this transit voyage, the ship will head off on the \nAntarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE)\n. This major expedition was organized by the EPFL-based Swiss Polar Institute, which is set to leave Cape Town on 20 December. Some 50 researchers from 30 different countries will take over from the students on a three-month circumnavigation of Antarctica. They will conduct 22 research projects during this voyage. The projects will touch on a wide range of fields, such as glaciology, climatology, biology and oceanography, and the overall aim is to measure and quantify the impact of climate change and pollution in the Southern Ocean.\nA demanding program\nThe \nACE Maritime University \nwill be anything but a pleasure cruise. Every morning, the students will take intensive classes followed by practicals on deck in the afternoon. The students, grouped by area of interest, will become familiar with handling and calibrating basic instruments in oceanographic, atmospheric and biological analysis. They will also learn about trawling for samples and analyzing the data that they collect. In addition, each of the students will work on an individual project, choosing a topic related to the research being carried out on the ship. In the evening, the participants will gather to present and discuss their work.\nAll these activities will be run under the guidance of some 15 researchers, who will remain on board for the ACE expedition, and three coordinators. Manon Fruschti, a laboratory technician in EPFL’s Environmental Microbiology Laboratory, is one of the coordinators. “The program will be demanding and our schedule will be packed, but there will also be the challenge of being at sea, which means living in a compartmentalized space, far from loved ones, and in constant motion,” says Fruschti, who already has several marine expeditions under her belt. The coordinators will have to deal with whatever problems arise, including seasickness, which will affect many participants, and homesickness.\n“For me, it’s really an extraordinary opportunity in terms of practical experience, contacts and multidisciplinary work.” Oriane Etter is one of six Swiss students who were selected for the Maritime University, and the only one from EPFL.

While the theme changes, for both CHIC and INSSINC the ultimate goal is to explore new problem-solving and pedagogical approaches in different cultural contexts.\nCurrently, Laperrouza and his colleagues are documenting and analyzing the educational outcomes of the INSSINC pilot via student evaluations, in collaboration with UNIL. He says that in light of its success thus far, there are plans to continue the program, potentially in other countries.\nSwiss-Indian partnership\nINSSINC is a collaboration with a local partner in India, the , which works to bring sustainable energy solutions to under-served communities.

Moreover, from SELCO’s perspective, I observed that the co-creation process with EPFL students greatly contributed to helping them understand the communities in a more holistic manner,” observes Tech4Impact project collaborator Beatrice Scarioni.\nAeberli also emphasizes that at both the student and partner level, the process of developing the prototypes is one of the program’s most valuable aspects.\n“The sweet spot is reaching our learning objectives and creating value for the partners. The prototypes allowed us to develop a more sustainable relationship with SELCO by exchanging knowledge, and by bringing fresh perspectives to problems through discussions with our students,” he says.\nDesigning innovative learning experiences \n The INSSINC pilot program and China Hardware Innovation Camp are part of a wider initiative that also integrates several courses in the EPFL College of Humanities  (SHS) program. This initiative, summarized below, aims to design new learning experiences and explore different teaching formats.\nInterdisciplinarity\n: Students from different disciplines, universities, and countries work together. In mixed teams, students from engineering, design, and social sciences experience how different perspectives, strengths, and tensions can be beneficial in grasping volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous realities.\nA project-based approach, in the field, with real life applications\n: Students are encouraged to always keep reality in mind. Partners (investors, companies, NGOs and other organizations) provide briefs, problem statements, reality checks and feedback. Students must test their ideas, pitch, make a live demo or even negotiate. They are encouraged to consider their project from an end-to-end perspective, from problem scoping to implementation.\nHuman-centered design\n: Students are incentivized to alter their points of view to create through the eyes of someone else. Using designers’ research methods, students are asked to observe contexts, question people and exercise empathy. Their assumptions are challenged, pushing them to reframe problems and opportunities.\nPossibility to fail\n: An environment is created to make failure acceptable and productive.

{"id": 1382, "text": "Inside the cell, DNA is tightly wrapped around proteins and packed in a complex, 3D structure that we call “chromatin”. Chromatin not only protects our genetic material from damage, but also organizes the entire genome by regulating the expression of genes in three dimensions, unwinding them to be presented to the cell’s gene-expression machinery and then winding them back in.\nInside the 3D chromatin structure there are certain regions called “topologically associating domains” or TADs. These contain DNA sequences (thousands to millions of DNA bases) that physically interact with each other, suggesting that the genes in these domains may be working together. Discovered in 2012, the functions of TADs are not yet fully understood, but it is known that disrupting TADs disrupts gene regulation, and this can be a mechanism that cancer cells use to alter gene expression.\nNow, scientists led by , in collaboration with , have discovered that a mutation of a particular gene leads to modifying interactions within TADs. The gene is called EZH2 and is normally involved in the repression of gene transcription – the first step in gene expression. In fact, EZH2 mutations play key roles in the initiation of tumors and can be used as marker for diagnosing several different types of cancers.\nThe scientists studied what is known as a gain-of-function mutation of EZH2. These types of mutations exacerbate the gene’s function and help tumor cells to grow. Here, the researchers found that EZH2 does not act randomly across the genome but rather preferentially within specific TADs.\nMutated EZH2 shuts down entire domains, turning off genes that normally suppress tumors. In their study, the loss of multiple genes synergistically accelerated the development of the tumors. And when the researchers inhibited mutated EZH2 with a drug, all the functions were restored.\nThe study is the first to show that mutated EZH2 affects not individual genes but entire chromatin domains, changing the interactions and expression of tumor-suppressive genes contained in those domains.\n“The study highlights the importance of considering the 3D organization of the genome in the nucleus to better understand how mutations in cancer cells exploit this organization to support tumor growth,” says Elisa Oricchio. “Pharmacological inhibitors that block EZH2 oncogenic activity are currently in clinical trials, and this study provides further insight on their therapeutic potential.”\nProfessor Oricchio’s lab is part of the  within the .

{"id": 1389, "text": "Solar cells using colorant, invented by Professor Michael Grätzel, represent one of the most promising solutions for the production of renewable, clean and inexpensive solar-cell energy. However, the most efficient Grätzel cells (yielding more than 11%) require the use of a liquid electrolyte, and may be subject to toxic leaks and corrosion. It has been proved that the use of solid organic materials can attenuate this problem, but the energy yield drops significantly. In an article recently published in ACS Nano, Dr. Nicolas Tétreault and his colleagues at EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, in cooperation with Dr. Endre Horváth and Dr. Arnaud Magrez and the scientists from the Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter, propose a new solution – an electrode created by the auto-assembly of titanium oxide nano-fibers. The scientists have demonstrated a level of efficiency three times greater than comparable electrodes so far developed. The result is a robust Grätzel cell that is capable of converting 5% of solar energy.\n“We were able to reach an almost-record level of efficiency using a new material that facilitates a faster and simplified synthesis. The objective has been attained by enabling efficient energy transfer, and an improved management of the light”, explains Dr. Tétreault.\nThis new electrode in titanium oxide nano-wire allows us to slightly increase the current in the cell. It provides a better conductivity and a much lower resistance. What’s more, we were able to increase the surface roughness of the electrode by nearly 60%. This roughness in turn enables a larger surface in contact with the colorant, and therefore an increased production of current. Lastly, this fiber network contains large pores, which allow an efficient diffusion of the light, while enabling better interaction with the colorant.\n“The electrode is completely auto-assembled from a pure and inexpensive solvent solution, such as isopropanol. In the case of this new three-dimensional fiber network, the titanium oxide nano-wires auto-assemble in an almost perfect interconnected crystalline network. The procedure takes about 15 seconds, which represents a simplification that can yield a significant reduction in production costs”, concludes Dr Horváth who developed the synthesis of the nano-wires by hydrothermal treatment.\nThe editors of ACS Nano confirm that this fiber network presents new opportunities. Thanks to the ongoing collaboration between the group of Pr Grätzel and the group of Pr Forró, it is likely that this new electrode will enable flexible solar cells to reach new levels of efficiency very soon.", "summary": "Grätzel cells now incorporate a new electrode made from titanium oxide nano-wires – three times more efficient.", "claim": "Grätzel cells now incorporate a new electrode made from titanium oxide nano-wires – one times more efficient.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [15, 15], "noise": false}

The global cost in terms of lost productivity and energy consumption runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars a day.\nLike the tried and true VHS videocassette, the proposed solution involves data recorded on magnetic tape. But the similarity ends there; in this system the tape would be a nickel-iron nanowire, a million times smaller than the classic tape. And unlike a magnetic videotape, in this system nothing moves mechanically. The bits of information stored in the wire are simply pushed around inside the tape using a spin polarized current, attaining the breakneck speed of several hundred meters per second in the process. It’s like reading an entire VHS cassette in less than a second.\nIn order for the idea to be feasible, each bit of information must be clearly separated from the next so that the data can be read reliably. This is achieved by using domain walls with magnetic vortices to delineate two adjacent bits. To estimate the maximum velocity at which the bits can be moved, Kläui and his colleagues* carried out measurements on vortices and found that the physical mechanism could allow for possible higher access speeds than expected. Their results were published online October 25, 2010, in the. Scientists at the Zurich Research Center of IBM (which is developing a racetrack memory) have confirmed the importance of the results in a . Millions or even billions of nanowires would be embedded in a chip, providing enormous capacity on a shock-proof platform. A market-ready device could be available in as little as 5-7 years.\nRacetrack memory promises to be a real breakthrough in data storage and retrieval. Racetrack-equipped computers would boot up instantly, and their information could be accessed 100,000 times more rapidly than with a traditional hard disk. They would also save energy. RAM needs to be powered every millionth of a second, so an idle computer consumes up to 300 mW just maintaining data in RAM. Because Racetrack memory doesn’t have this constraint, energy consumption could be slashed by nearly a factor of 300, to a few mW while the memory is idle. It’s an important consideration: computing and electronics currently consumes 6% of worldwide electricity, and is forecast to increase to 15% by 2025.\n For more information:\n Mathias Kläui, EPFL, Laboratory of Nanomagnetism and Spin Dynamics.

However, as a colony, they can use complex strategies to complete sophisticated tasks and evade larger predators.\n At EPFL's School of Engineering, robotics researchers in Professor  have reproduced this phenomenon, developing tiny robots that display minimal physical intelligence on an individual level but that are able to communicate and act collectively. Despite being simple in design and weighing only 10 grams, each robot has multiple locomotion modes to navigate any type of surface. Collectively, they can quickly detect and overcome obstacles and move objects much larger and heavier than themselves. The related research has been published in \nNature\n.\n(photo: Marc Delachaux / EPFL)\n Robots inspired by trap-jaw ants\n These three-legged, T-shaped origami robots are called Tribots. They can be assembled in only a few minutes by folding a stack of thin, multi-material sheets, making them suitable for mass production. Completely autonomous and untethered, Tribots are equipped with infrared and proximity sensors for detection and communication purposes. They could accommodate even more sensors depending on the application.\n “Their movements are modeled on those of Odontomachus ants. These insects normally crawl, but to escape a predator, they snap their powerful jaws together to jump from leaf to leaf,” says Zhenishbek Zhakypov, the first author. The Tribots replicate this catapult mechanism through an elegant origami design that combines multiple shape-memory alloy actuators. As a result, a single robot can produce five distinct locomotion gaits: vertical jumping, horizontal jumping, somersaulting to clear obstacles, walking on textured terrain and crawling on flat surfaces – just like these creatively resilient ants.\n Roles: leader, worker and explorer\n Despite having the same anatomy, each robot is assigned a specific role depending on the situation. ‘Explorers’ detect physical obstacles in their path, such as objects, valleys and mountains. After detecting an obstacle, they inform the rest of the group. Then, the ‘leader’ gives the instructions. The ‘workers,’ meanwhile, pool their strength to move objects. “Each Tribot, just like Odontomachus ants, can have different roles. However, they can also take on new roles instantaneously when faced with a new mission or an unknown environment, or even when other members get lost. This goes beyond what the real ants can do,” says Paik.\nZhenishbek Zhakypov and Jamie Paik. (Photo : Mac Delachaux / EPFL)\n Future applications\n In practical situations, such as an emergency search mission, Tribots could be deployed en masse. And thanks to their multi-locomotive and multi-agent communication capabilities, they could locate a target quickly over a large surface without relying on GPS or visual feedback. “Since they can be manufactured and deployed in large numbers, having some ‘casualties’ would not affect the success of the mission,” adds Paik.““With their unique collective intelligence, our tiny robots can demonstrate better adaptability to unknown environments; therefore, for certain missions, they would outperform larger, more powerful robots.”\nThis work is the result of a joint collaboration between EPFL and Osaka University\n In April, Jamie Paik has presented her reconfigurable robots at the TED2019 conference in Vancouver.

These findings were published recently in the journal \nPNAS\n. The paper is co-authored by Professor Andrea Rinaldo, who heads EPFL’s Laboratory of Ecohydrology (ECHO), and scientists from the Polytechnic University of Milan, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, the University of Zurich and the University of Padua.\n“We can conclude that the drastic measures taken by the Italian government have had a decisive effect, preventing the country’s healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed,” say the authors.\nCaption:\n Chart showing the expected number of hospitalizations under different scenarios.

Gatto et al., PNAS, 2020\nMathematical model\nThe researchers modeled the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic – which has since been declared a pandemic – in Italy, looking at the number of people hospitalized with the disease and the number of reported deaths between the outbreak in Italy and an arbitrary cut-off date of 25 March. What makes this study both important and unique is its spatial resolution. The disease-spread geography is modeled in 107 provinces and metropolitan areas – the most granular level of detail available.\nThe team calibrated the model to account for human mobility, using census data from Italy’s National Institute of Statistics to estimate pre-epidemic mobility, and the findings of an independent study based on cell phone geolocation data to ascertain the extent to which the government-imposed restrictions had reduced people’s movements.\nAfter confirming the model’s accuracy by comparing the map of infections with observed data, the researchers used it to study the effects of the early containment measures.\nCaption:\n The map on the left shows the spread of the epidemic as simulated at the municipal scale. The other two maps show the geography of the epidemic as simulated by the model at the province scale (center) and as observed in data (right). / M.

They also suggest that better contact tracing and localized restrictions could help stop the spread of the epidemic while limiting social and economic disruption.\nIntervention strategies\nAndrea Rinaldo, a recipient of a European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant Fellowship and a full professor at EPFL, has over a decade’s experience in epidemic modeling. His past research findings have been used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to develop intervention strategies to limit the spread of cholera and other waterborne diseases.\nProf. Rinaldo was keen to get the COVID-19 study up and running as quickly as possible, so he reached out to colleagues who had previously worked at his lab. “I recruited former PhD students and postdocs and a visiting professor virtually overnight,” he explains. “By repurposing technologies we’d worked with in the past, we were able to develop the new model in next to no time. Our paper demonstrates that the model is a reliable evidence base for emergency planning. But that’s only the start.

{"id": 1417, "text": "A decrease in sea ice, changing vegetation, reduced biodiversity, plastic pollution and altered atmospheric processes: these are just some of the climate-change topics that the 40 scientists participating in the GLACE expedition will tackle. Organized by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) and supported by the Swiss Polar Foundation, this expedition will circumnavigate Greenland clockwise for two months between the end of July and the end of September 2019 (see inset below for details).\nFifteen research projects were selected to be run onboard. One of them, which will study how airborne particles influence the Arctic environment, is being led by EPFL. Athanasios Nenes, the principal investigator on that project and a professor at EPFL’s Laboratory of Atmospheric Processes and their Impacts (LAPI), tells us about this important research.\nWhat is the Arctic atmosphere made of? \nThe Arctic is a unique environment. It is one of the most climate-sensitive regions on Earth, warming twice as fast as the global average. This accelerated warming is thought to be driven by complex interactions between ice, the atmosphere, the biosphere and the ocean, and airborne particles – also known as aerosols – are thought to play a significant role in this. Much of how the particles interact with the Arctic atmosphere and climate is still unknown.\nWhat exactly will you study during the expedition?\nWe will study where the particles found in the Arctic come from – forest fires, biogenic and other natural sources as well as anthropogenic emissions – and how they impact the local climate by absorbing or reflecting sunlight and by affecting clouds. For example, we will look for specific types of molecules that persistently remain dark and absorb sunlight for very long periods of time – including well after they have fallen from the sky and been deposited on ice, which can accelerate melting. The goal is to understand which particles exacerbate the rapid climate change experienced in the region and which tend to help cool the climate.\nDo air particles play an especially important role in the Arctic? \nYes – numerous roles, in fact. Some serve to warm the climate, while others reflect sunlight and, in so doing, can cool the region. Yet others may carry nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorous, iron and copper; when these nutrient-rich particles fall into the Arctic Ocean, they can act as a fertilizer and promote phytoplankton growth. Phytoplankton is at the bottom of the food chain and absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis – so it is very important. We would also like to see if there are significant amounts of airborne biological particles – that is bacteria, viruses and biological debris from both ocean and land activity. Compared to other types of aerosols, there are few biological particles, but some of them are extremely good at triggering ice formation in clouds. When this happens, clouds can rapidly precipitate, and this can greatly affect the amount of sunlight hitting the Earth’s surface. If the cloud cover in the Arctic changes systematically, then we may see rapid changes in ice cover and the local climate.\nWhat can such tiny air particles teach us about global warming? \nAir particles are a key component of the Arctic environment, a complex and rapidly changing system. Studying them is difficult, however, because they act in so many different ways: they can affect clouds, warm or cool the air, melt ice, lead to changes in the biosphere, and the list goes on. If this were not enough, these effects are subtle yet ongoing in ever-changing processes. This opportunity to go to the Arctic and precisely characterize the sources, properties and functions of Arctic aerosol is critically important for our ability to understand current and future changes in the region and around the world.\nForty scientists head to Greenland to study climate change\nThe Arctic ice sheet has been melting at unprecedented rates as a result of global warming. The Greenland Circumnavigation Expedition (GLACE) is a unique opportunity for researchers to study this rapidly changing environment. The expedition will depart from Kiel, Germany on 30 July 2019 and return to the same port on 29 September 2019.\nGLACE is a scientific expedition organized by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI), which is based at EPFL and supported by the Swiss Polar Foundation. The expedition’s integrated scientific program consists of 15 research projects selected by an international panel of scientists. Six of the projects – in oceanography, atmospheric sciences and ecology – will be Swiss-run. The rest will be headed by leading international scientists active in Arctic research.\nA total of 44 scientists from many different countries will spend two months on the Russian research vessel \nAkademik Treshnikov\n. The ship will land at six \nsites around Greenland, allowing the scientists to carry out their research on land, on the ice and along the coastline. They will have access to remote and understudied areas. A nuclear-powered icebreaker will support the research vessel along the North Greenland coast, breaking the thick multi-year ice. This new adventure is the SPI’s second major project, following the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition in 2017.\nSource: SPI press release", "summary": "This summer, 40 international scientists will participate in the GLACE expedition around Greenland in order to study the effects of climate change in that region.

{"id": 1442, "text": "One out of two CHESS satellites\nDesigning a satellite and launching it into space is no run-of-the-mill project. Rather, it’s one that forever marks the early careers of the students who take part – just ask the EPFL students who designed the SwissCube, a 1U CubeSat (a small standardized unit measuring 10 cm x 10 cm) launched in 2009. Today, a new group of students, the EPFL Spacecraft Team, is taking on a new challenge. With the support of the EPFL Space Center (eSpace), they are developing a constellation of two satellites, called CHESS, that will be launched in two years. The team is currently seeking additional members and sponsors.\nThis ambitious project has already signed on six universities, three companies, 15 professors and 53 students.* The two satellites will work in concert; each one will be a 3U CubeSat bearing primary and secondary payloads. They will orbit at different altitudes – one will travel in a circular orbit at the low altitude of around 550 km, and the other will travel in an elliptic orbit at an altitude oscillating between 400 km and 1,000 km. The constellation will be launched in March 2023 and remain in flight for at least two years.\nThis project will give the students who participate each year a chance to learn about complicated space technology and gain experience working on a cross-disciplinary team. “It’s a way to learn the real-world skills required in our industry, like team management, coordination, communication and fundraising,” says Emmanuelle David, the deputy director of eSpace. “These are skills you can’t learn only from a book. And they will let the students become operational as soon as they start their first job or when and if they decide to start their own business.”\nOne satellite will be placed in a circular orbit at around 550 km, while the other will travel in an elliptic orbit between 400 km and 1,000 km.\nUnderstanding the exosphere’s chemistry\nIn addition to giving students valuable experience, the CHESS mission will have several other objectives. The first is scientific. As the two satellites orbit around the Earth, they will collect detailed information about the exosphere – the outermost layer of the atmosphere, starting at 400 km above the planet’s surface. Since the satellites will follow separate orbits, they will collect complementary spatial and temporal datasets.\n“The last time this layer of the atmosphere was analyzed in detail was nearly 40 years ago,” says Dr. Rico Fausch, a physicist at the University of Bern’s Space Research & Planetary Sciences Department. “So these updated data will be very useful in helping us better understand the exosphere’s chemistry and how it has changed over time, especially in light of global warming. They will also let us check whether the upper layers of the atmosphere are indeed cooling as recent studies have suggested – which would be another direct consequence of the accumulation of greenhouse gases around our planet.”\nThe satellites will collect detailed data on the various gases in the exosphere – nitrogen, oxygen, ozone, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium, etc. – and their isotopes. The overall goal is to study temperature fluctuations, the processes and mechanisms by which atmospheric gases escape into space, and how many free-floating electrons and ions there are in the exosphere. Molecules are much harder to find at high altitudes than low ones, since individual particles collide and bind together much more slowly.\nTechnological advancements\nThe CHESS mission also aims to spur technological innovation. The satellites will be equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, such as the new mass spectrometers being developed jointly by the University of Bern and the company Spacetek Technology AG – two pioneers in this field. The spectrometers will be used to identify specific compounds and their chemical structures by taking mass measurements, and will be lighter and more efficient than the ones used back in the 1980s.\nNew technologies will be tested thanks to the CHESS mission.\nThe satellites will also feature next-generation Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers that are lighter, less expensive, and more accurate than existing models. These receivers are being developed jointly by ETH Zurich and u-blox. They will not only record extremely precise data on the satellites’ positions (on the order of ±1 cm), but also measure air density and the number of free-floating electrons. In addition, the CHESS mission will perform \nin situ\n tests of a new kind of solar panel designed specifically for spacecraft, based on technology developed at RUAG. And because the two satellites will send radio communications to ground stations, they will help create a Swiss-wide X-band network – a communications network using an ultra-high-frequency radio band.\nSwitzerland’s growing space industry \n“I was lucky enough to work with the team that designed, built and launched SwissCube – which is still operational today, some 11 years later,” says Muriel Richard, an aerospace engineer and the co-founder & CTO of ClearSpace. “I’ve been following the CHESS project closely for the past two years, and I see that these students are just as skilled, smart and motivated – and are worth believing in and investing in. They’ll send these satellites into orbit, that’s for sure!”\nCHESS forms part of a broader trend of growing interest in space-industry R&D, both at EPFL and in Switzerland as a whole. The project will help train the next generation of aerospace engineers, pull together skills from a wide range of fields, expand the existing space-industry network and forge ties among the scientific community.\n*\nPartner organizations\n: University of Bern, Hochschule Luzern, HES-SO Valais-Wallis, ETH Zurich, Haute École ARC, Spacetek, u-blox and RUAG\nPresskit\n: \nIllustrations\n:\n ©E.Nardini /EPFL Spacecraft Team", "summary": "The EPFL Spacecraft Team has set itself the ambitious goal of launching two satellites by 2023.

{"id": 1446, "text": "“Where is He who has been born King of the Jews, who has just been born? For we saw His star when it rose…” The Gospel according to Matthew is the only one to mention the presence of a bright star that guided the Three Magi to the stable where Jesus was born. This statement is the starting point for our inquiry: was there an extraordinary astronomical phenomenon around year 1 that could be identified with the biblical text?\nThe Bible itself already provides a few clues. Firstly, we can read that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod. Yet, the latter died shortly after a lunar eclipse which happened in the year 4 B.C. Secondly, the census commanded by Cesar, and which was the reason Marie and Joseph fled toward Bethlehem, took place in the year 8 B.C. Thus Jesus’ birth is calculated as being between years 8 B.C. and 4 B.C.\nDid something extraordinary happen in the sky during those four years?\nA supernova, a violent explosion of a star at the end of its life, could provide a good explanation. Unfortunately, these explosions are very rare in our galaxy, and do not remain visible for very long – just two to three weeks. And yet the legend states that the Magi set off after they had observed a luminous phenomenon. They observed the same phenomenon a few weeks later in the sky over Jerusalem, which guided them toward Bethlehem. The unique characteristic of a supernova gives little credence to this hypothesis – it’s estimated that there are only three per century in our galaxy.\nComets have the advantage of coming back in a recurrent manner, since they orbit around the sun. It is a spectacular event which could therefore have made an impact on observers. Besides, according to some Chinese texts, two comets were visible to the naked eye in 5 B.C. and 4 B.C. But if the Christmas star was indeed a comet, why not describe it as such?The scriptures make clear reference to a star, discrediting the theory of the comet.\nThere remains the hypothesis of a conjunction: that is, the apparent convergence of two bodies in the sky. When two planets are practically in the same line of vision, the eye is no longer capable of distinguishing them, and only sees one object, but brighter. A simple astronomic calendar software enables us to see that during the year 7 B.C it was possible to observe, on three occasions, conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn. These triple conjunctions are particularly rare. In the year 7 B.C., they happened on May 29, October 6 and December 1. At the time of the first conjunction, the Magi would have set off on their journey, at the second, they would have visited King Herod, and at the third, they would have been guided toward Jesus in Bethlehem. Should we celebrate Christmas on 1 December?\nWe are left with a fourth hypothesis, perhaps the most credible – the Christmas Star never existed and all this is just a charming legend.", "summary": "Is the Christmas star, that is believed to have guided the Three Kings to Jesus, a scientific reality?

The ship’s arrival in this small city, at the southern tip of South America, marked the end of the expedition’s second leg. The \nTreshnikov\n left Cape Town, South Africa at the end of December on a 90-day voyage around Antarctica. The ship is carrying 50 international researchers who are conducting 22 research projects.\nThe second leg of the journey, which began on 22 January in Hobart, Australia, was action-packed and filled with scientific discoveries. It’s the only leg with a stop on the continent itself, on the Mertz Glacier. This glacier lies to the east of Antarctica, and its tongue reaches into the Southern Ocean – where an 80-kilometer-long chunk of ice broke off in 2010.\nWhile some teams took ice cores on top of the glacier in order to find out more about our climate’s history (owing to the presence of gases and other particles), others had a look at the glacier’s underbelly. Operating a submersible equipped with cameras and robotic arms, the researchers saw what was hidden below the glacier tongue and collected various samples. By analyzing these organisms – sponges, plankton, brittle stars and krill, to name just a few – scientists hope to learn more about how these ecosystems evolve and adapt to climate change.\nThe researchers also ventured onto several totally uninhabited islands, including the Balleny Islands and tiny Scott Island, where they took numerous samples and conducted both cartographical and ornithological surveys.\nAll did not go as planned during this leg, however. The scheduled stop on Macquarie Island was cancelled because of a storm, and the visit to Peter I Island had to be cut short. To make up for this, an impromptu stop was made on Siple Island, a volcanic island located close to the continent and partly embedded in its ice. This island is rarely visited and not well documented, which made the measurements and samples taken there even more valuable.\nOne more leg, three more islands \nThe \nTreshnikov\n reached Punta Arenas on Wednesday and will head back to sea tomorrow for the third and final leg of the expedition. The submersible is no longer on board, and there are no plans to stop on the continent. Most of the projects will nevertheless continue: visits to three subantarctic islands will give the researchers plenty of opportunities to take both ocean and land measurements.\nThe first island, South Georgia, is the largest of the three to be visited. This mountainous island is a British territory. The second island is actually a group of volcanic islands: the Sandwich Islands. The flora and fauna on these two sites are of significant scientific interest, and these islands are important nesting grounds for many bird species.\nThe third stop will be on Bouvet Island, a Norwegian dependency. This 50-square-kilometer island, entirely covered in ice, is one of the most remote places on earth. It is inhabited by elephant and other seals, birds and penguins and can only be reached by helicopter.\nOn 19 March, the ACE expedition will reach Cape Town, completing its trip around Antarctica. But the work will not stop there. A recap of the expedition and preliminary scientific results will be presented to the press the following day. And other, more extensive results will be discussed in conferences throughout the year.\nKeep up with the expedition on .\nSpecial envoy in the heart of the action\nEPFL’s communications team jumped at the chance to send one of its journalists to join the expedition at the edge of the world.

Equipped with a notebook, camera and motion sickness pills, she will report back on how the researchers and crew members spend their time during the three weeks of the expedition’s final leg.

{"id": 1455, "text": "Researchers from EPFL and the AN Bach Institute in Moscow have discovered a new and extremely promising antibiotic for tuberculosis, especially effective against multi-resistant strains of the disease, which are on the rise in Eastern Europe. The drug, developed as a European FP7 project, has proven very effective against the disease. In an article published in EMBO Molecular medicine, the researchers show that, when combined with other drugs, the new antibiotic, called “PBTZ169”, can take down even the most resistant strains of tuberculosis bacteria. Following the publication, the researchers formed the IM4TB Foundation on their campus. Supported by EPFL, the foundation aims to bring the new treatment to the market. This unusual step was taken because traditionally, technology transfer from academia to the pharmaceutical industry doesn’t work well with tuberculosis: development costs are too high and the affected countries are often barely able to maintain their own healthcare infrastructures. \n With the IM4TB Foundation, EPFL intends to pick up the slack in the limitations of the industrial model. “The development of antibiotics is increasingly expensive and the countries most affected by tuberculosis are still emergent,” says Benoit Lechartier, co-author of the PBTZ169 study. “The recent closure of the AstraZeneca research center in India illustrates the extent to which it is difficult for the pharmaceutical industry to invest in infectious diseases.”\nHuman trials in 2015 \nLocated on the EPFL campus, the IM4TB Foundation plans to move onto human trials within a year, in collaboration with the University of Lausanne Hospitals (CHUV). \n PBTZ169 shows much promise. It attacks the bacterium’s strong point – the cell wall, which forms an impenetrable shield against antibiotics and the patient’s immune system. “Our molecule makes the bacterium literally burst open,” explains Stewart Cole, director of the study and head of EPFL’s Global Health Institute. \nA cheap but formidable weapon against resistant strains \nThe researchers showed that PBTZ169 is extremely effective in tri-therapy, where it is combined with a standard drug, pyrazinamide, and a more recent one, bedaquiline – and both these drugs have already been approved by the EU and the FDA for multi-resistant strains. “This could be the winning strategy”, says Cole. “These molecules attack different targets in the bacterium. By combining them, we drastically reduce the risk that it will mutate into more resistant forms.”\n As a treatment, PBTZ169 has many advantages. It is not expensive to produce, since it is relatively easy to synthesize. Initial tests have shown good compatibility with other anti-tuberculosis treatments and it is expected to be equally compatible with antiretrovirals used to treat AIDS, as HIV-positive individuals are particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis, and cases of cross-infection are on the rise. \n This molecule is the culmination of many years of research. The preliminary versions were formidable in the laboratory, where they decimated bacteria in culture. However, their effectiveness in vivo was limited. New technologies like structural biology enabled researchers to redesign the molecule so that it could be more rapidly absorbed. “Thus we were able to improve its pharmacodynamics,” explains Cole. “Tuberculosis is often wrongly considered a disease of the past, but in order to fight it, we needed to employ 21st century technologies.”\nMore than 1.5 million deaths per year\nTuberculosis still kills more than 1.5 million people every year. It is uncommon in Europe, although certain countries such as the Ukraine are experiencing a resurgence of patients infected with multiresistant strains. The EU is leading a program that aims to eliminate the disease.

{"id": 1456, "text": "In January 2015, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that it would abandon the currency floor of 1.2 Swiss francs per euro. In one day, the franc reached parity with the euro, and the Zurich stock market lost 9% of its value. One year later, economists from EPFL and the University of Geneva completed the first academic analysis of the real impact of this event. The results confirm a number of widely accepted beliefs. These include the problem of rising production costs for Swiss exporters. But the study also sheds light on two key points: the seismic event continues to weigh on the economy, and the offshoring of production appears to be on the horizon.\nThe researchers analyzed data from some 200 Swiss companies listed on the stock exchange, as they are required to publish detailed financial results. They then sorted these companies by whether they produce and sell in Switzerland or abroad.\nMade in Switzerland and sold abroad? Bad idea\nExporting companies have been hardest hit. They produce their goods in Switzerland and make their money abroad, largely in the eurozone. The study shows that the SNB’s move had significant and immediate effects: in the following six months, exporters’ revenues declined by 16.3% on average and net profit fell by 20.4%. “Their costs are in francs and their revenues are in euros,” said Rüdiger Fahlenbrach, a researcher at EPFL's Swiss Finance Institute and co-author of the study. “When the Swiss franc is more expensive, their costs go up, their margins shrink and their international competitiveness is damaged.”\nSince the exchange-rate peg was removed, exporters also reduced investments by 30%. At the same time, the proportion of their acquisitions abroad – mainly infrastructure and production sites – increased from 45% to 63%. Such transactions are often the precursor to a shift in production to other countries and at the same time betray a certain level of urgency, according to Fahlenbrach. “Rather than building a production site, you buy an existing one. It’s faster.”\nThe financial press has widely reported on the acquisition of such sites, which include Bobst in Italy, Comet Group in the United States and Sonova in Germany. “It is difficult to determine whether a given company is investing abroad in reaction to the strength of the franc or in line with a long-standing strategy,” said Fahlenbrach. “But the rapid and widespread rise in the number of deals leaves little doubt that many of them are correlated with the removal of the exchange-rate floor.”\n Swatch is another exporter that has felt the sting. “It is hard to imagine this company massively shifting production abroad and abandoning the ‘Made in Switzerland’ label. But they too have seen their margins shrink – something that also bodes poorly for jobs.”\nA better bet: based in Switzerland, made the world over\nCompanies that the researchers consider ‘international’ are less exposed to the perils of a strong franc. Consider Nestlé and Novartis. “They are headquartered in Switzerland, but they manufacture around the world. If you make yogurt in France and sell it in the same country, your production costs and revenues are denominated in the same currency. This means no exchange-rate losses.”\nHowever, companies’ net profits have to be repatriated. So they too have suffered from the exchange rate, but significantly less than exporters have. “They are in a more enviable situation,” said Fahlenbrach. “And this is confirmed by our observations: exporters are trying to develop an international model by shifting their production abroad.”\nHow are small and medium-sized businesses faring?\nTwo thirds of jobs in Switzerland are with small or medium-sized companies. But the researchers were not able to include them in their study – because they are not publicly listed, they are not required to publish detailed financial statements.\n“Without going out on a limb, we believe that most small and medium-sized businesses in Switzerland are in the most exposed category, that of exporters,” said Fahlenbrach. “A typical example is a company in the machine-tool sector. Switzerland is too small of a market for this type of firm.” These companies probably do not have the money needed to move production abroad. And this does nothing to resolve their revenue problem or, in the longer run, the threat to jobs, according to Fahlenbrach.\nRecently, the Swiss franc has shown some signs of weakening. This has to do with its role as a buffer, according to Fahlenbrach: “Because it’s expensive, the franc is hurting economic activity, which in turns weakens the franc.” The researcher does not, however, foresee a sharp drop in the value of the franc. “I'm afraid that some companies will not survive without automating production and laying off employees.”\nDespite its high cost, Switzerland is one of the most industrialized countries in Europe. The euro was worth 1.60 francs in 2009, but the country had little trouble navigating the shoals until the exchange-rate floor – set at 1 euro for 1.20 francs – was jettisoned. Is the current situation a result of the sudden removal of the exchange-rate floor, or have we in fact reached a critical threshold? “That’s the million dollar question!” said Fahlenbrach. “Time will tell, but the results of our study are not very promising.”\n---\nReference\nEfing, Matthias, Rüdiger Fahlenbrach, Christoph Herpfer, and Philipp Krueger, 2016, How do investors and firms react to an unexpected currency appreciation shock?, Swiss Finance Institute Working Paper 15-65. Download the article here: \nContacts\nRüdiger Fahlenbrach, EPFL researcher,  or +41 79 592 05 65\nCarole Bonardi, head of communication for Management College at EPFL,  ou +41 79 795 32 66\nLionel Pousaz, EPFL Press Service,  or +41 79 559 71 61", "summary": "Swiss companies may be preparing to shift production out of the country after the franc was unpegged from the euro.

{"id": 1457, "text": "Most renewable power technologies are weather dependent. Wind farms can only operate when there’s a breeze, and solar power plants rely on sunlight. Researchers at EPFL are working on a method to capture an energy source that’s constantly available at river estuaries: osmotic power, also known as blue energy.\nOsmosis is a natural process whereby molecules migrate from a concentrated to a more dilute solution across a semi-permeable membrane in order to balance the concentrations. At river estuaries, electrically charged salt ions move from the salty seawater to the fresh river water. The idea is to harness this phenomenon to generate power.\nResearchers from EPFL’s  (LBEN), which is headed by Professor Aleksandra Radenovic at the School of Engineering, have shown that the production of power using osmosis could be optimized using light. Reproducing the conditions that occur at estuaries, they shined light on a system combining water, salt and a membrane just three atoms thick to generate more electricity. Under the effect of light, the system produces twice as much power as it does in the dark. Their findings have been published in .\n In a 2016 paper, a team from the LBEN showed for the first time that 2D membranes represented a potential revolution in osmotic power production. But at the time, the experiment did not use real-world conditions (see inset).\nIons passing through a nanopore\nThe addition of light means the technology has moved one step closer to real-world application. The system involves two liquid-filled compartments, at markedly different salt concentrations, separated by a molybdenum disulfide (MoS\n2\n) membrane. In the middle of the membrane is a nanopore – a tiny hole between three and ten nanometers (one millionth of a millimeter) in diameter.\nEvery time a salt ion passes through the hole from the high- to the low-concentration solution, an electron is transferred to an electrode, which generates an electric current.\nThe system’s power generation potential depends on a number of factors – not least the membrane itself, which needs to be thin in order to generate maximum current. The nanopore also has to be selective to create a potential difference (a voltage) between the two liquids, just like in a conventional battery. The nanopore allows positively charged ions to pass through, while pushing away most of the negatively charged ones.\nThe system is finely balanced. The nanopore and the membrane have to be highly charged, and multiple identically sized nanopores are needed, which is a technically challenging process.\nHarnessing the power of sunlight\nThe researchers got around these two problems at the same time by using low-intensity laser light. Light releases embedded electrons and causes them to accumulate at the membrane’s surface, which increases the surface charge of the material. As a result, the nanopore is more selective and the current flow increases.\n“Taken together, these two effects mean we don’t have to worry quite so much about the size of the nanopores,” explains Martina Lihter, a researcher at the LBEN. “That’s good news for large-scale production of the technology, since the holes don’t have to be perfect and uniform.”\nAccording to the researchers, a system of mirrors and lenses could be used to direct this light onto the membranes at river estuaries. Similar systems are used in solar collectors and concentrators – a technology already widely employed in photovoltaics. “Essentially, the system could generate osmotic power day and night,” explains Michael Graf, the lead author of the paper. “Output would double during daylight hours.”\nNext step\nResearchers will now pursue their work by exploring possibilities to scale up production of the membrane, addressing a range of challenges such as optimal pore density. There is still a lot of work to do before the technology can be used for real-world applications. For instance, the ultra-thin membrane needs to be mechanically stabilized. This could be done by using a silicon wafer containing a dense array of silicon nitride membranes, which are easy and cheap to manufacture.\nThis research, led by LBEN, is being conducted as part of a collaboration between two EPFL labs ( and ) and researchers at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nBack in , researchers from the LBEN reported that, for the first time, they had produced osmotic power across 2D membranes measuring just three atoms thick. The experiment was an important demonstration that nanomaterials may indeed represent a revolution in this domain, with direct application envisioned for renewable energy and small, portable sources of energy.\n At the time, to achieve high power generation, the researchers had to operate in an alkaline environment, with high pH levels that are far from the values found in estuaries.

This system is about to be tested on preemies at University Hospital Zurich (USZ-CH). The underlying technology was developed by ,  and  as part of the Swiss research program .\nThe camera system was developed to improve the way babies’ heart rates and breathing are monitored. “Skin sensors placed on the babies’ chests are so sensitive that they generate false alarms up to 90% of the time, mainly caused by the babies moving around,” said Jean-Claude Fauchère, a doctor at USZ’s neonatal clinic. “This is a source of discomfort for the babies, because we have to check on them every time. It’s also a significant stress factor for nurses and a poor use of their time – it distracts them from managing real emergencies and can affect quality of care.\"\nWith the camera system, no physical contact is required. The baby’s pulse is detected by analyzing its skin color, which changes ever so slightly every time its heart beats. Breathing is monitored by measuring movements of its thorax and shoulders. At night, infrared cameras take over, which means that monitoring can be carried out non-stop.\nThe optical system was designed by the CSEM researchers, who chose cameras that are sensitive enough to detect minute changes in skin color. They teamed up with researchers from EPFL to design algorithms used to process the data in real time. CSEM focused on respiration, while EPFL worked on the heart rate. “We ran an initial study on a group of adults, where we looked at a defined patch of skin on their foreheads,\" said Sibylle Fallet, a PhD student at EPFL. “With our algorithms we can track this area when the person moves, isolate the skin pixels and use minor changes in their color to determine the pulse. The tests showed that the cameras produced practically the same results as conventional sensors.”\nUniversity Hospital Zurich will soon be testing the system on premature babies. Virginie Moser, the CSEM researcher in charge of the set-up at USZ, said: \"We plan to take measurements on as many preemies as possible to see whether, under real-life conditions, the results we get from our algorithms match data collected using on-skin sensors.”\nIf so, the camera system could one day replace skin sensors. In addition to cutting down on false alarms, it would also be more comfortable for the babies.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and CSEM have developed a contactless and wireless camera system to continuously monitor the vital signs of premature babies.

{"id": 1465, "text": "A virtual escape game awaits visitors to Forum EPFL\nWhen visitors attend Forum EPFL’s Start-Up Day tomorrow at the SwissTech Convention Center, they will be challenged with questions to answer, riddles to solve and people to meet. This will all take place during a 30-minute virtual game that, according to its developers, is a cross between Pokemon Go and an escape game. For Codex D., the EPFL spin-off behind the app, this game is just the beginning; the company already plans to introduce a new scenario next spring, taking place in historical Paris.\nTo play the game at Forum EPFL, visitors simply need to install the app on their smartphone and launch it whenever they want. As they go through this virtual treasure hunt, they will learn interesting facts about each start-up’s business as well as anecdotes about them. Users will be asked questions along the way, which they can answer by photo or text. Automatic recognition programs will analyze the answers and, if they’re right, send out the next challenge.\n“This game is only the first of a whole series of adventures,” says Stefan Rotarus, one of Codex D.’s founders. He and the other founders – Jeremy Bensoussan and Paul Renauld – are already brimming with ideas. Several new scenarios are in the works, all taking place at various tourist destinations – starting with Paris in 2019. The scenarios are interactive and structured as gamebooks where the story unfolds according to choices that the user makes along the way. Codex D.’s target market is young people and techies, although a family version without time limits is also planned. The scenarios will be designed to provide a fun way of learning interesting details and anecdotes “without having to schedule a session ahead of time, as is the case with conventional escape games,” says Rotarus.\nPlayers writing their own scenarios\nJust like with any online game, the key to success is building a community. Codex D. will aim to engage with the most creative users first through an app that enables them to create their own scenarios – taking place at any location they wish – and post them online. No special programming skills required. Other users will then be able to vote on the scenarios and a ranking will gradually be established of the best ones.\nThe ideal opportunity for applying theory learned in class \nCodex D.’s founders didn’t wait until they had their EPFL degrees in hand to launch their business. Currently third-year students at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, they are big fans of escape games as well as history, programming and even philosophy. This new business venture lets them combine the skills they learned in class with their hobbies and entrepreneurial spirit. According to the founders: “Being at EPFL gives us a chance to launch our start-up without risking anything but our time and energy. And it’s the perfect opportunity for applying all the theory we’ve learned.”\nJust a few months after they created Codex D., they received funding from the XGrant program which also includes training for entrepreneurial-minded students. They likewise received support from the European Venture Program, which brings together universities from across Europe and gives the Codex D. founders an international perspective.\nIn late September the founders launched a crowdfunding campaign (\n) to raise the CHF 9,000 needed to design graphics for characters for their new scenarios, purchase libraries for their scenario development app, hold real-world events to expand their user community and put together advertising campaigns in Paris and eventually other cities. “We hope that this venture will give users a new way of experiencing tourism and their favorite destinations.

That’s why it was selected as one of the challenges that students tackled in the first edition of the Kitchen-Inspired Engineering contest. “The idea behind this engineering challenge was to give Bachelor’s students experience working on an entire project, from developing a design and running simulations to performing tests and building a prototype,” says John Kolinski, head of EPFL’s  (EMSI) laboratory. “Each of the three teams participating in the contest decided which kitchen problem it wanted to solve and came up with its own ideas.”\nThe teams, which consisted of four to five students each, met once a week during the spring semester. They worked closely with their professors and postdoc researchers to develop functional designs that address the specific problem they selected. One team came up with a system for pouring the perfect beer, while another created a device that makes the perfect poached egg. “Those students had to figure out how to deal with eggs of different ages and how to keep the water clean so that the device could be used over and over again. It was impressive to see how effectively the students worked together,” says Kolinski.\nThe beer foam manager project team © EPFL\nFood science on campus and beyond\nFood preparation is an important part of our everyday lives, which is what prompted four EPFL professors – Kolinski, Tobias Schneider (), Pedro Reis () and Selman Sakar () to set up the contest. “We sat down and discussed how we could explore the idea of kitchen-based engineering in a fun, engaging way. It’s a field with tangible applications and could be a vector for bringing food-science teaching and research onto our campus, in association with our talented, smart, ambitious and curious undergraduate students,” says Kolinski.\nEncouraged by the success of this first Kitchen-Inspired Engineering contest, the four professors plan to continue it in the coming years. They hope to create more opportunities for students from different EPFL schools to work with each other and with students from other institutions; one student team taking part in the competition has already contacted the Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL). Such joint projects allow students to learn from each other’s knowledge and experience.\nFrom education to innovation\nIn addition to providing a learning opportunity, the contest can also give rise to marketable innovations. “One of the ideas presented at the competition turned out to be so promising that the team is now looking into filing a patent for it,” says Kolinski.\nEPFL’s  (IFNC) brings university researchers together with food industry professionals. “The Center’s wide range of contacts can provide a solid basis for students to seek out interesting problems and find solutions that make a real impact,” says Kolinski.

One of the student teams in the Kitchen-Inspired Engineering contest developed a system for doing this by using a compression machine and a razor blade to create a fissure in the eggshell, which is then propagated to crack open the egg.\nAs eggs get older, the protein in their whites decomposes and becomes watery. That’s what creates flakes in the cooking water when poaching an egg. The students’ system therefore includes a dynamic filtering system to prevent flakes from entering the cooking water so that the device can be used again. The system consists of a slotted ramp that eggs can be slid onto so as to eliminate any residue and then be dropped gently in the water.\n The final step is to keep the cooking water at the generally recommended 80°C.

Amélie Béduer, the CEO of Volumina Medical, won over the spectators and the jury with her company’s injectable implant. This biomaterial is designed to reconstruct soft tissue, following breast cancer surgery for example. It is injected with a syringe and represents a potential alternative to existing, more invasive, treatments. The product is currently in preclinical testing.\nFor these entrepreneurs, who are all in search of funding for their companies, the visibility they gained from their pitch last night was capital. The aim of this annual event, which is put together by EPFL Alumni, Innogrants (EPFL’s startup support fund) and Venturelab, is to forge ties between the School’s graduates and up-and-coming firms. It’s a networking initiative that keeps gaining momentum, based on the fact that graduates and successful entrepreneurs are investing more and more in the next generation of companies.\nBoth current and future entrepreneurs in attendance Thursday night drew inspiration from the keynote speakers. Steve Anavi, an EPFL graduate, described how he went from being an engineer to a serial entrepreneur. And Madiha Derouazi explained how she created her cancer-vaccine startup in 2012 and grew it into a company with some 15 employees – while raising 37 million francs along the way. “If you want to start a business, you need strength, endurance and boundless enthusiasm,” she said.\nFollowing the pitches, the audience shortlisted four companies: Wakeit, Resistell, Volumina Medical and SwissDeCode. The four finalists were then asked the following question: “What keeps you awake at night?” Amélie Béduer clinched victory with her response; the jury particularly appreciated her “sense of duty and responsibility.” Steve Anavi added: “What’s more, the product she is developing builds on something that exists already – and that will facilitate buy-in among users.”\nFor Béduer, this was the first time she presented her work to such a large group of people. But she has faced tougher challenges as an entrepreneur: “Time pressure is much greater in business than in academic research. In order to start bringing in money, you need to develop your product quickly and make the right decisions. There’s no margin for error.

Martin Odersky, Professor in the Laboratory of Programming Methods at EPFL, is one of them. This fall during seven weeks, he gave the first MOOC –Massive Online Open Course – organized by the school on the platform, Coursera. With the subject of the computer programming language, Scala, that he created himself, his course enjoyed enormous success. More than 53,000 people enrolled and 9'700 earned the certificate of completion. The course will certainly be renewed in Autumn 2013. Martin Odersky is even thinking of doing a second part.\n– Did you expect such a success?\nNot of this magnitude, even if previous experiments at some universities, such as Stanford or certain institutions in Australia, have shown the potential for this form of instruction. What surprised me most was the involvement and motivation of these people, and ultimately the success rate. Close to 10'000 students obtained this certificate in only two months, that’s more than in my entire career!\n– Could you provide a profile of these students?\nAccording to a survey we conducted, they come from all parts of the world – the United States, Russia, England, and Germany, just off the top of my head. Emerging countries such as India or Brazil were also well represented. The same was true for Switzerland with a few hundreds of students, 140 from EPFL. But more importantly, 85% of these people already have a university degree, and who therefore already have a real interest in the subject.\n– For you, what is very different from traditional teaching?\nAlone in front of the computer, without an audience, it’s really something else! On a daily basis, the preparation and the management of these MOOCs generates a lot of work for my team and me. And then, it had to be invented and adapted along the way. For example, we realized after a few weeks that it was necessary to hire an editor, someone who could bring an external point of view and indicate what wasn’t working, what wasn’t understandable, and to bring our attention to points in need of improvement.\n– Does the lack of direct contact with a professor pose a problem?\nWith the help of my doctoral assistants, we have established a system of emails and internet forums. The students can also respond to each other. To date, 2,800 discussions have been started, creating almost 12,000 posts! It is true that initially, the use of these forums meets with some resistance, because it requires seeing learning from a new angle. For example some regret not being able to immediately ask the professor questions. But those who don’t are often happy to find that they receive satisfactory and rapid responses through the Internet.\n– Do you believe we are moving toward generalized online studies?\nI think that the direct contact remains very important, that the professor acts as a role model for students. The challenge is to find the best way to combine these two methods of teaching, each with its own benefits.\n– What do you think are the main benefits of these MOOCs?\nMOOCs open, for example, new opportunities to many of our listeners from countries where this kind of knowledge is not easily accessible or is not up to date. I also hope that these discussions in the forums create a large network and function as a kind of “pot” of knowledge, where students as well as other professors can come share or seek new ideas.

{"id": 1485, "text": "What do multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes and food allergies have in common? All these conditions are caused by an abnormal immune response; white blood cells that attack their own body cells or overreact to external elements. In EPFL’s Innovation Park, the start-up company Anokion is developing an extremely promising technology to treat autoimmune conditions and other maladies. The first clinical trials are planned for 2017.\nAnd the range of applications isn’t just limited to autoimmune disease. The body also develops immune reactions to many protein drugs used to treat hemophilia and cancer, for example, and Anokion’s approach may be able to prevent these reactions as well. Now, a group of venture capitalists specializing in pharmaceuticals (Novartis Venture Fund, Novo Ventures and Versant Ventures) has recognized the potential and injected 33 millions Swiss francs (37 millions dollars) into the young company. \nHow to trick the immune system\nAnokion’s technology takes advantage of a behavior exhibited by white blood cells that is still not very well understood. These cells, the advance guard of the immune system, tend to calm down in the presence of cells that are dying normally at the end of their life cycle. Their cousins, the red blood cells, do just that in healthy individuals, turning over en masse on the order of 200 million per day.\n The researchers developed a technique to attach the protein responsible for triggering the immune response onto these red blood cells. A bit like Pavlov’s dogs, who learned to associate the sound of a bell with the appearance of food, the white blood cells associate the “foreign” protein with the millions of calming messages released every day by the red blood cells as they expire. The undesirable immune response disappears. In 2012, the EPFL laboratory led by Jeffrey Hubbell used this technique to prevent disease in mice that were developing type I diabetes. The research was published in PNAS and received an enormous amount of attention. \n “The technology delivers proteins, be they autoimmune antigens or protein drugs, in a manner that re-trains the immune system to accept them as the body’s own,” explains Hubbell “We are delighted that leading biotech venture funds have recognized the value of our approach, providing the necessary financial means to move forward.”\n Anokion’s mission is to commercialize this discovery so that it can move out of the lab and into use as a treatment for disease. For now, the researchers are concentrating on a specific kind of white blood cell, T lymphocytes, that are implicated in many autoimmune and allergic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes. \n The technology has a far wider potential, however. Protein drugs are used to treat diseases such as cancer and a number of genetic diseases such as hemophilia. Despite their effectiveness in treating these diseases, the body frequently recognizes these proteins as foreign and mounts an immune response against them, sometimes even after one or a few doses. After this, the body neutralizes the protein drugs that have been developed to heal it. \n Using Anokion’s technique, the drug could be administered over a much longer period by teaching the immune system to leave it alone. Multiple therapeutic molecules that trigger immune reactions have been withdrawn after clinical trials due to these immunogenicity challenges. The researchers think that many of these could be rehabilitated if the immune response of the T-cells during treatment could be controlled. \n Anokion is planning clinical trials for 2017. They will initially test their technology in conjunction with a drug known to trigger strong immune reactions before moving on to autoimmune diseases.", "summary": "EPFL start-up Anokion has the immune system in its sights.

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) will grant nearly 18 million francs over a 4 years period to this new project led by EPFL, renewable twice. EPFL, as well as the rest of the partner institutions, has committed to complete the funding.\nSimulating and testing before producing\nThe new NCCR will be led by Professor Nicola Marzari and will aim to trigger a revolution in the field of materials design and discovery. “At this point, the power of supercomputers combined with our knowledge of quantum mechanics allow us to imagine innovative materials and simulate their characteristics and behavior without having to first create them in the lab, he said. In this manner, we can progress much faster than we used to, avoiding costly trial-and-error efforts.”\n The development of novel materials will attract many players in various domains, starting with the energy industry. “Breakthroughs are required in order to harvest energy, convert it, and store it in an efficient and economically viable manner,\" continued Nicola Marzari.\nAnd this is not all: advanced and consumer electronics, basic science and experimental research, and even the pharmaceutical industry need materials’ understanding and innovation. The Nobel prizes on graphene and on high-temperature superconductivity are good examples of new science coming from newly discovered materials. \"Last, do not forget that all of electronics would not exist had we not started by understanding and engineering a material - silicon,\" explained the scientist.\nMARVEL’s approach for designing and developing new materials will allow to accelerate research in this field at the same speed as the progress in computing. \"Currently, the Piz Daint (CSCS) Swiss supercomputer can analyze 500 materials per minute. According to Moore's Law, which forecasts a doubling of computers’ capacity every 14 months, we will be analyzing 500’000 materials per minute by the end of the NCCR program in 2026. \"\nHarvesting of skills\n In order to move beyond the simulation stage and direct its research towards practical applications, MARVEL has assembled the best talent found across the entire country. In addition to EPFL, the partnership includes researchers from ETH Zurich, the universities of Geneva, Basel, Fribourg, Zurich and Svizzera Italiana (the Italian speaking part of Switzerland,) IBM Zurich and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre CSCS; experimental synthesis and characterization of the new materials will be in the hands of the Paul Scherrer Institute and the Swiss Federal Laboratory for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA).\nTherefore, the researchers working for this new NCCR – more than twenty group leaders – will cover the entire national territory. \"Europe, and Switzerland in particular, are world leaders in the areas of materials’ simulations.

{"id": 1489, "text": "‘Cell migration’ is a broad term for all the processes associated with the movement of cells from one location to another. It lies at the core of biological processes like embryonic development, immune responses and wound healing, but also autoimmune diseases and metastasis of cancerous cells. Cell migration is achieved through the movement of the cell’s membrane, which is powered by the action of a protein network inside the cell. However, this interaction is affected by the cell’s overall shape, but exactly how this takes place is unclear. Publishing in Current Biology, EPFL scientists have discovered an unexpected link between the 3D shape of the cell and its migration efficiency, and have explained its physics using a simple model of a liquid droplet.\nThe first step in cell migration occurs when the cell extends its front edge – a process called ‘protrusion’. This is driven by the growth of the filaments of the protein actin, which push the cell membrane from inside. Simultaneously, membrane tension controls protrusion by providing resistance protecting the cell from over-extending. But physical laws (e.g. Laplace’s law) dictate that the shape of the cell membrane must play a role in the balance between force exerted by actin and the resisting membrane tension. However, this was not taken into account in previous studies, which used simplified 2D models of migrating cells.\nNow, Chiara Gabella and Alexander Verkhovsky at EPFL have determined the relationship between cell protrusion, shape and membrane tension. Using a model cell type taken from fish scales, the researchers developed a fast and simple way to evaluate the 3D shape of migrating cells by observing them in a chamber filled with a fluorescent solution. By applying various treatments to swell, shrink, or stretch the cells, they were able to observe their impact on membrane tension, shape, and protrusion velocity. The treatments only affected the cells’ shape and migration speed, but not membrane tension. The overall conclusion was that that the more spherical the cell, the faster it moves.\nIn order to interpret these unexpected findings, the researchers modeled a migrating cell as a liquid droplet spreading on a surface. “It is well known that a droplet’s shape and, in particular, the contact angle that it makes with the surface are determined by the tension forces between the droplet, its environmental medium (e.g. air or a different liquid) and the surface on which it moves”, says Gabella. The researchers considered the protruding edge of the cell as such a triple interface, but also added the tension from growing actin filaments inside the cell.\n“From this point of view, a more spherical cell means less load for actin filaments to overcome, and therefore faster actin growth and migration”, explains Verkhovsky. In support of this idea, the researchers found that the cells were also sensitive to the surface’s characteristics just as droplets would be, by slowing down or being pinned at ridges.\n“The emphasis of many studies has been on discovering and characterizing individual cellular components”, says Verkhovsky. “This is rooted in the common belief that a cell’s behavior is determined by intricate networks of genes and proteins”. In contrast, this work shows that, despite their enormous molecular complexity, cells can be described as physical objects. The findings point to a new relationship between a cell’s shape and its dynamics, and may help to understand how cell migration is guided by the cell’s 3D environment.\nThis work was performed in the EPFL Laboratory of Cell Biophysics (LCB), directed by Jean-Jacques Meister, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPCM).\nReference\n Gabella C, Bertseva E, Bottier C, Piacentini N, Bornert A, Jeney S, Forró L, Sbalzarini IF, Meister JJ, Verkhovsky AB.

{"id": 1494, "text": "If we wanted to count the number of people in a crowd, we could make on the fly estimates, very likely to be imprecise, or we could ask each person to pass through a turnstile. The latter resembles the model that EPFL researchers have used for creating a “DNA reader” that is able to detect the passage of individual DNA molecules through a tiny hole: a nanopore with integrated graphene transistor.\nThe DNA molecules are diluted in a solution containing ions and are driven by an electric field through a membrane with a nanopore. When the molecule goes through the orifice, it provokes a slight perturbation to the field, detectable not only by the modulations in ionic current but also by concomitant modulation in the graphene transistor current. Based on this information, it is possible to determine whether a DNA molecule has passed through the membrane or not.\nA thickness of one third of a nanometer\n This system is based on a method that has been known for over a dozen years. The original technique was not as reliable since it presented a number of shortcomings such as clogging pores and lack of precision, among others. “We thought that we would be able to solve these problems by creating a membrane as thin as possible while maintaining the orifice’s strength”, said Aleksandra Radenovic from the Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology at EPFL. Together with Floriano Traversi, postdoctoral student, and colleagues from the Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures, she came across the material that turned out to be both the strongest and most resilient: graphene, which consists of a single layer of carbon molecules. The strips of graphene or nanoribbons used in the experiment were produced at EPFL, thanks to the work carried out at the Center for Micro Nanotechnology (CMI) and the Center for Electron Microscopy (CIME).\n“Through an amazing coincidence, continued the researcher, the graphene layer’s thickness measures 0.335 nm, which exactly fits the gap existing between two DNA bases, whereas in the materials used so far there was a 15 nm thickness.” As a result, while previously it was not possible to individually analyze the passage of DNA bases through these “long” tunnels – at a molecular scale –, the new method is likely to provide a much higher precision. Eventually, it could be used for DNA sequencing.\nHowever they are not there yet. In only 5 milliseconds, up to 50’000 DNA bases can pass through the pores. The electric output signal is not clear enough for “reading” the live sequence of the DNA strand passage. “However, the possibility of detecting the passage of DNA with graphene nanoribbons is a breakthrough as well as a significant opportunity”, said Aleksandra Radenovic. She noted that, for example, the device is also able to detect the passage of other kinds of proteins and provide information on their size and/or shape.\nThis crucial step towards new methods of molecular analysis has received an ERC grant and is featured in an article published today in .", "summary": "One of the methods used for examining the molecules in a liquid consists in passing the fluid through a nano-sized hole so as to detect their passage.

{"id": 1495, "text": "Water is simple and complex at the same time. A single water molecule (H\n2\nO) is made up of only 3 atoms. Yet the collective behavior of water molecules is unique and continues to amaze us. Water molecules are linked together by hydrogen bonds that break and form several thousands of billions of times per second. These bonds provide water with unique and unusual properties. Living organisms are for 60% composed of salty water. Deciphering the interactions between water and ions is thus fundamentally important for understanding life.\nNot 100 but 1,000,000 molecules are influenced\n Researchers at EPFL's Laboratory for fundamental BioPhotonics, led by Sylvie Roke, have probed the influence of ions on the structure of water with unprecedentedly sensitive measurements. According to their multi-scale analyses, a single ion has a small but measurable influence on millions of water molecules, that is 10,000 times more than previously thought. In an article appearing in \nScience Advances\n, they explain how a single ion can \"twist\" the bonds of several million water molecules over a distance exceeding 20 nanometers, causing the liquid to become \"stiffer\". \"Until now it was not possible to see ions influence more than a hundred molecules (a distance of around 1 nm). Our measurements show that water is much more responsive to ions than we thought,\" said Roke, who was also surprised by this result.\nWater molecules line up around the ions\n Water molecules are made up of one negatively charged oxygen atom and two positively charged hydrogen atoms. The Mickey Mouse-shaped molecule therefore does not have the same charge at its center as at its extremities. When an ion, which is an electrically charged atom, comes into contact with water, the network of hydrogen bonds is perturbed. The perturbation spreads over millions of surrounding molecules, causing water molecules to align preferentially in a specific direction. This can be thought of as water molecules \"stiffening their network\" between the various ions.\nFrom atomistic to macroscopic length scales\n Water's behavior was tested with three different approaches: ultrafast optical measurements, which revealed the arrangement of molecules on the nanometric scale; a computer simulation on the atomic scale; and measurement of the water's surface structure and tension, which was done at the macroscopic level. \"For the last method, we simply dipped a thin metal plate into the water and pulled gently using a tensiometer to determine the water's resistance to pulling,\" said Roke. \"We observed that the presence of a few ions makes it easier to pull the plate out, that is, ions reduce the surface resistance of water. This strange effect had already been observed in 1941, but it remained controversial and unexplained until now. Through our multiscale analysis we were able to link it to ion-induced stiffening of the bulk hydrogen bond network: a stiffer bulk results in a comparatively more flexible surface.\"\nTesting different salts and different \"waters\"\n The researchers carried out the same experiment with 21 different salts: they all affected water in the same way. Then they studied the effect of ions on heavy water (D\n2\nO), whose hydrogen atoms are heavy isotopes (with an additional neutron in the nucleus). This liquid is almost indistinguishable from normal water. But here the properties are very different. To perturb the heavy water in the same way, it required a concentration of ions six times higher. Further evidence of the uniqueness of water.\nNo link with water memory or homeopathy\n Roke and her team are aware that it might be tempting to link these stunning results to all sorts of controversial beliefs about water. They are however careful to distance themselves from any far-fetched interpretation. \"Our research has nothing to do with water memory or homeopathy,\" she said. \"We collect scientific data, which are all verifiable. \"To prove the role of water in homeopathy, another million-billion-billion water molecules would have to be affected to even come close, and even then we are not certain.\"\nThe new discovery about the behavior of water will be useful in fundamental research, and in other areas too. The interaction between water and ions is omnipresent in biological processes related to enzymes, ion channels and protein folding.

{"id": 1497, "text": "Is antivirus software already dead? That’s certainly what George Candea believes, and he’s not the only computer security expert who says so. “Large enterprises and government agencies often deploy antivirus software to satisfy legal obligations or to meet contractual requirements, not because they really believe that the software can defend them,” says George Candea. Together with some of his former PhD students, the EPFL professor founded , a startup that is developing a brand new approach to computer security. And their results are promising. In a third party test, their solution warded off all 144 cyber attacks that had been hand-crafted by professional penetration testers, whereas security products so-called heuristic modern caught just over 20 of them. As for the best classic antivirus software tested, it only caught one. “I think it just got lucky!,” muses the researcher.\nSince it was founded in early 2015, Cyberhaven has had revenues of 640,000 dollars. This is encouraging for such a young company, and it enabled them to raise more than two million dollars in a first round of financing from Accomplice, one of the most active early-stage venture capital firms on the US East Coast. Cyberhaven will use the funds to set up its office in Boston and fuel the growth of its R&D team in Switzerland, at the EPFL Innovation Park.\nCyberhaven’s solution is marketed mainly to enterprises and government agencies, which are all targets of sophisticated cyber attacks. Cyber criminals develop targeted malware that is unique to each of their attack campaigns. As a result, most of today’s security products are not effective against such new attacks. So organizations try to have defense perimeters within defense perimeters to build up so-called “defense in depth\". “Information security officers eventually reach the point where their infrastructure is so complex that they simply cannot manage it anymore,” says George Candea.\nDefending “data in operation” against attack\n The team of EPFL researchers developed a completely novel approach to defend sensitive documents against cyber attacks in a way that significantly simplifies an organization’s security infrastructure. The approach complements what is perhaps the most effective security tool today, namely encryption – available in a wide variety of programs we use daily, including Microsoft Office.\nAlas, encrypting documents is not enough to safeguard them. When opening an encrypted file, such as a text document, the application must first decrypt it in order to operate on it. As a result, the document’s data is \"in the clear\". By exploiting vulnerabilities in applications like the Word text editor, malware hijacks them and steals all the documents that the application can access and decrypt. This is a real Achilles’ heel of enterprise security, and encryption cannot solve it.\nCyberhaven’s solution safeguards sensitive documents together with the relevant applications in a safe haven. “Only documents that are safe for these applications can enter the safe haven, and that also protects the integrity of the applications. Our defense technology is based on deep application analysis and has nothing to do with heuristics-based solutions that try to guess malicious behavior. We literally analyze every instruction, we never guess.” Developing the technology took seven years of research at EPFL and is protected by four EPFL patents that have been licensed to Cyberhaven.\nNeutralize malware instead of trying to keep it out\n Unlike traditional defense techniques, Cyberhaven does not aim to keep all malware out of the enterprise but instead prevents it from acting. “Instead of building a fortress with many weak walls, we protect individual workflows that correspond to users’ activities, such as the preparation of a quarterly financial report or the negotiation of a new inter-governmental agreement. By combining document encryption with Cyberhaven, it will no longer be necessary to use dozens of different security products to protect yourself; this will make your security infrastructure simpler and stronger.”\n“Expanding into the USA enables us to continue growing in Switzerland”\n According to George Candea, fundamental academic research with novel perspectives is required to solve today’s computer security problems. “Sometimes the industry can be stuck in a rut, so I believe it is up to researchers to rethink the problems from the ground up and come up with solutions.” And, to fulfill their mission, this team of researchers is taking the execution of their vision in their own hands: Cyberhaven’s leadership is entirely composed of former PhD students from George Candea’s lab at EPFL.\nCyberhaven now has eight full-time employees in Switzerland. One of the co-founders, Vova Kuznetsov, has taken over the reins and is setting up the company’s headquarters in Boston. “Switzerland has exceptional talent and quality infrastructure, but it is also a small market. By expanding into the US, we make it possible to grow our R&D in Switzerland, explains George Candea. And the US is not just a huge market, it is also an opportunity to compete with the very best, and that pushes us to become better.”\n---\nCyberhaven leadership: Dr. Vova Kuznetsov, CEO / Dr. George Candea, Chairman / Dr. Cristian Zamfir, COO / Dr. Radu Banabic, VP of Engineering / Dr. Vitaly Chipounov, Chief Architect\nContacts\nLionel Pousaz, EPFL Press Service, l\n or +41 79 559 71 61\nGeorge Candea, EPFL researcher, \n or +41 79 822 70 15", "summary": "Cyberhaven is developing a new concept for information security.

{"id": 1498, "text": "Biological molecules like proteins contain thousands of atoms that form extremely complex 3D structures. Being able to identify such structures is important because they directly affect how a molecule behaves in cells, and can often make the difference between life and death; for example, mad cow disease is caused by the misfolded version of an otherwise harmless prion protein. Determining 3D structures can be challenging, because biological molecules can be made up of the same atoms connected in the same order, but have radically different structures and therefore radically different effects. In a  that made the cover of\n Angewandte Chemie\n, EPFL scientists used a new method based on infrared and UV lasers to more accurately determine the structure of biological molecules.\nProteins and peptides tend to have extremely complex three-dimensional structures. The problem is complicated by the fact that they often exist as isomers, i.e. they have the same sequence of atoms but different 3D structures. That means that simply knowing what a molecule is made of is not enough to understand what it looks like in three-dimensional space. More information is needed, and that comes in the form of molecular “fingerprints” – characteristics of a molecule that reflect its 3D structure. Clearly, two isomers would not share the same structural characteristics, meaning that more fingerprints would make it easier to distinguish them.\nWorking out the structure of biological molecules begins by making several theoretical predictions of what a molecule would look like, and then matching them to experimental data. Currently, one of the new and promising techniques providing such data is Cold Ion Laser Spectroscopy, which has been developed for over a decade at EPFL’s . Molecules are ionized, cooled close to absolute zero and then shot with infrared and UV lasers at different energies, each producing a different number of molecular fragments. These fragments are then measured by a mass spectrometer, which tells scientists about energy levels within the molecule.\nEPFL scientists have now extended this approach to include a new fingerprint, greatly increasing the accuracy of structure determination. ’s team at LCPM discovered the way to measure precisely how much light a molecule can absorb, which is another fingerprint of its 3D structure. The atoms in a molecule are not at rest; rather, they vibrate at frequencies that depend on how the atoms are structured in space. As there are three vibrational frequencies for every atom, large biological molecules like proteins can have hundreds to thousands of frequencies that together provide a unique fingerprint of the molecule’s 3D structure.\nBy analyzing how Cold Ion Laser Spectroscopy works, the scientists came to the idea of how to measure what is called the absolute absorption intensity for each vibration of a molecule, creating a whole new fingerprint to work with. This makes it possible to identify the molecule’s 3D structure with more certainty, because it is unlikely that two isomers will have the same vibrational frequency and light absorption pattern at the same time.\nThe researchers first tested their new approach with a known antibiotic molecule made of 176 atoms. When that proved successful, they pushed the boundaries of spectroscopy and recorded the first ever “vibrational spectrum” for a protein called cytochrome c, which is critical in processing oxygen in our cells. Their breakthrough two-fingerprint approach advances structural chemistry and can allow scientists to faster and more accurately determine the structure of large biomolecules like polypeptides and proteins, which can have tremendous implications for biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, epidemiology (e.g. prion diseases), molecular biology and genetics, and wider biological endeavors.", "summary": "3D structures of biological molecules like proteins directly affect the way they behave in our bodies.

{"id": 1499, "text": "Widespread drying as a result of climate change is driving an increase in forest fires around the world. By the end of the 21st century, Switzerland is expected to experience many more fires between May and November than it does today. According to experts, the worst-affected areas will be the Aare valley and lowland areas of Bern Canton. Moderate increases are predicted in Ticino Canton and the Engadin, while larger areas of Valais Canton will likely be set ablaze. These fires could trigger erosion and compromise the protective role played by forests. “Forest fires will become commonplace in Switzerland,” predicts Johan Gaume, who heads EPFL’s Snow and Avalanche Simulation Laboratory (SLAB). “The good news is that, unlike with other climate-change impacts, we’re looking at fairly long timescales.”\nIn 2018, a fire destroyed six hectares of trees in Les Voëttes, a forested slope in the Diablerets mountain range in Vaud Canton. Gaume and Xingyue Li, a postdoctoral researcher at SLAB, were keen to learn more about whether and how the damage might have affected the forest’s ability to protect against avalanches in the winter. So they asked two Master’s students in environmental engineering to examine the case for their Design Project, working directly with Vaud Canton’s Environment Department (DGE).\nMap of the position of trees after forest fires © SLAB/EPFL\nMapping avalanche risk\nUsing a digital model developed at SLAB, the students produced a new avalanche risk map to inform the DGE’s reforestation strategy. They found that, although future avalanches will move faster down the slope at Les Voëttes, the relatively shallow gradient will stop them from reaching the houses below. The expanded avalanche risk zone only includes one extra chalet that was previously outside the boundary.\nThe students made two recommendations for the DGE: to plant dense clusters of trees in highly localized spots in order to improve stability, and to employ random planting patterns across the rest of the forest to provide enhanced protection. “Smaller, non-hazardous avalanches play a key role in supporting biodiversity,” says Francesc Molné, one of the two Master’s students who worked on the Design Project. “In ecosystems like these, plants and wildlife are adapted to these types of event, so it’s important that they continue.”\n“Our findings were broadly in line with what we expected, but they’re less alarming than the DGE’s own predictions,” says fellow student Clara Streule. “We know that trees hold back some of the snow during an avalanche,” adds Molné. “The EPFL simulation model factors in the spatial distribution of trees to a high degree of accuracy. The model the DGE uses” – the RAMMS model developed at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF – “isn’t quite as accurate on that front. Perhaps that’s where the difference lies.”\nMultiple parameters\nThe engineering students fed multiple parameters into the model, all of which influence how quickly an avalanche travels and how it behaves. These included the precise position and layout of surviving and damaged trees, the exposure and topography of the terrain, and different types of snow (fresh snow, wet snow, and packed and densely packed wind slabs). Molné and Streule used a drone to take aerial photographs of the area, which they combined using photogrammetry. They also scoured historical records for the region, using the heaviest snowfall figures for the past 100 years in their model.\n“What I found most interesting was putting our faith in a digital model to come up with effective solutions, while recognizing the model’s limits and understanding how different factors influenced the end result,” says Molné. Streule notes: “The complex terrain made the topographic survey challenging. Programming the drone’s flight path put our math skills to the test – I really enjoyed rolling up my sleeves and applying the theory we’d learned in class to a hands-on problem.” She adds: “Making recommendations for Vaud Canton also taught me an important lesson about my future career. If we can’t reverse climate change, a big part of my job will be finding ways to adapt our lifestyles and shield ourselves from its worst effects.”\nMore collaborations to come\nThe students’ method could be applied to protection forests across Europe. “This pilot study was a chance to test our digital model,” says Gaume. “Now we’re keen to see how far we can take it.” His enthusiasm is shared by Vaud Canton. “This research gives us new insights into how forested slopes protect against avalanches at low altitude and will help improve our forest maintenance strategy,” explains Jean-Louis Gay from the DGE’s Forestry Inspectorate Division. “We’ll be working with EPFL again at other sites in the Canton.” A scientific paper based on the students’ work is also in the works.\nLes Diablerets, in Vaud Canton. © iStock", "summary": "Two EPFL students have compared the ability of a forest in Vaud Canton to protect against avalanches before and after it was ravaged by fire in 2018.

According to Ford, “the goal is within reach thanks to recent advances in the areas of cryptography, verifiable computing and homomorphic encryption.”\n\"There is actually no necessary tradeoff between security, availability and privacy\", explains Ford. \"We do have the required knowledge and technologies. What we need is further development as well as incentives.\"\nThis field of research is of growing importance for companies. In 2015 the global information security market was worth more than 75 billion dollars, and the spread of cloud solutions in particular suggests that this market will show strong growth in future years.\nAt a time when demand is accelerating and solutions are quickly rolled out, technology transfer from research institutes to business and government must keep pace. \"The stakes are high both for the economy, for society and for individual citizens,” said Daniele Tonella AXA Tech CEO and Sponsor of this research program. “The future of companies, individual privacy, civil liberties and questions of data security are all in the balance. We’re very proud and excited to support Bryan Ford, who will bring his leadership on this research field to one of the most dynamic European institutions in basic and engineering sciences.\"\nFord has worked in three key areas of research: decentralized and distributed systems, security/privacy, and anonymous communication. He will continue his work at EPFL with the support of the AXA Research Fund (to know more visit his ).\nCurrently, AXA’s financial commitment to Swiss research institutions amounts to EUR 6.3 million. In addition to the EPFL professorship, this contribution is used to support 18 other life sciences, socio-economic and environmental projects. Antimo Perretta, CEO of AXA Winterthur, adds: \"We are convinced that a better knowledge and understanding of the risks facing societies is crucial and that it is our responsibility to ensure the protection of the general public. That is why we are proud to support 18 research projects in Switzerland“.\n---\nEUR 200 Million Dedicated to support Risk Research\nThe AXA Research Fund was created in 2007 to boost scientific progress and discoveries that contribute to understanding and better preparing for environmental, life and socio-economic risks. With a commitment of EUR 200 million until 2018, the Fund supports 492 projects led by researchers of 51 nationalities, working in 269 universities in 33 countries. The AXA Research Fund also helps scientists share their knowledge with a wider audience, in order to inform decision-making and actively promote public knowledge about the risks that threaten our societies.\nMore information: \n---\nContacts\nAXA Research Fund\n Noelani Menei \n +33 1 40 75 47 34\n Lorie Lichten \n +33 1 56 03 1212\nAXA Winterthur\n +41 58 215 22 22\nEPFL\n Service de presse EPFL\n +41 21 693 22 22", "summary": "Bryan Ford, a world-renowned expert in information security, has been named an Associate Professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland with the support of the AXA Research Fund. The Fund engaged 1.5 million euros to support this 12 year-project.", "claim": "Bryan Ford, a world-renowned expert in information security, has been named an Associate Professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland with the support of the AXA Research Fund. The Fund engaged one euros to support this 12 year-project.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [39, 39], "noise": false}
{"id": 1503, "text": "EPFL hasn’t missed its rendez-vous with History. Discovered during the preparatory phase of the site of the School’s future Congress Center, the vestiges of an imposing Roman building will be rendered spectacular thanks to the competencies of two start-ups resulting from two laboratories.\nIn order not to delay the building work unduly, the archeologists commissioned by the Canton to work on the site have had to proceed sector by sector. As soon as they had finished recording information about a “block”, the excavators swung into action. “As such, the foundations that we uncovered didn’t justify keeping,” explains Christophe Henny, in charge of the digs performed by the company Archéodunum. At no time it has been possible to have a complete overview of the Roman villa which may have belonged to Dorinius, a landowner whose existence was assumed by archaelogists because of the place name “Dorigny”.\nThanks to Sensefly and Pix4d, two start-ups resulting from EPFL laboratories, this inconvenience will however be short-lived. In fact, Jean-Christophe Zufferey, director of Sensefly and scientist at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems , regularly sent his “swinglet CAM” drones over the excavation site. These entirely automated flying wings, equipped with a camera, have thus been able to immortalize in high definition each stage of the discovery. Pix4d, a company in the process of being created out of the Computer vision laboratory (), is specialized in image compilation. Its ultra-powerful algorithms will thus be capable of faithfully piecing together the plan of the villa in its entirety, and with its outbuildings, as if it had been possible to take a single aerial photograph.\nJean-Christophe Zufferey, director of Sensefly, about to launch one of his drones. © Alain Herzog - EPFL\nA villa and its outbuildings\n These discoveries – most of which have already disappeared – deserve however that we give them some special attention. Three elements probably dating from the High Empire (between 1st century B.C. and 3rd century A.D.) have been clearly identified.\nOn the south-east side was a barn (25m x 22m) with three small closed off units and a large room taking up most of the surface of the building. Part of the ground was probably covered with flooring, presumably since burned, as witnessed by the blackness of the ground over a three-meter wide strip along two of the walls. The archeologists have also found pits, whose use is yet unknown – perhaps for blacksmithing activities. They may even date from before the time of this building, as evidence of a previous occupation has also been found.\nFurther north-west, there was the main building, housing the living quarters. An imposing building in the shape of a ”T”, whose facade extended over 27 meters, included at least one wing, whose foundations have been found on the left-hand side of the building. “Some elements may lead us to presume a symmetric plan, with one wing of the same type on the right-hand side”, suggests Christophe Henny. The whole was centered around a courtyard. With everything taken into account, the front of the house could have extended over a width of 80 meters.\nA third rectangular building (12m x 10m), whose use has not yet been identified, was added to the site in the direction of Morges.\nChristophe Henny, archaeologist in charge of the excavations, shows the remains of a barn. © Alain Herzog - EPFL\nThese elements provide the first evidence of settlement in this area, the built-up area (vicus) of Lousonna ending two kilometers further to the east, on the Bourdonnette side. “It’s a reasonable distance at which to build a villa, in relation to the graves which indicated the west end of Lousonna. It’s quite normal to leave a zone of countryside between the two”, recognizes Thierry Luginbühl, director of the Archeology section of the University of Lausanne.\nThe ground on which today stand the Lausanne universities has so far turned out to be poor in archeological vestiges. Only a water-collecting system, equipped with a pipe dug out of a tree felled in 166 A.D., has been recently uncovered, during the building of the Starling Hotel to the south of the EPFL campus.

{"id": 1504, "text": "The symbolic first stone of the Under One Roof building was laid today, six months after the start of a construction project to be completed by autumn 2016. About half (CHF 18 million) of the total cost of the future building (39 million) is financed by the Swiss Government, while the balance is provided by sponsors including the Rolex watchmaking firm, the Fondation Gandur pour l’Art and a group of partners involved in the Montreux Jazz Digital Project.\n The sleek, spectacular building still referred to under its project name (Under One Roof) was designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma and is being built by general contractor Marti Construction SA. It will fuel the heart of EPFL with new dynamics around the three areas brought together under its roof, close to 250 metres long. Each of these spaces aims to bridge science, art and society in its own way.\n To the north of the new complex, \nthe first space will be dedicated to promoting key EPFL research projects\n. In a spirit of knowledge sharing and interaction with the general public, the goal of this area is to stage the major scientific, technological and societal issues addressed by these projects through an ambitious exhibition design. Opening out onto the Esplanade, this main campus meeting point intends to provide a new Agora open to all. Supported by Rolex, it will initially host two projects of international scope – an exhibition on the Human Brain Project, in which the watchmaking brand is also involved, and the Venice Time Machine. The support by Rolex for this space is an extension to that which it already provides via the Rolex Learning Center. According to Bertrand Gros, Chairman of the Board of Rolex SA, “The Rolex Learning Center offered a bold setting to the learning sciences. We now accompany the EPFL towards a new frontier of knowledge at a crossroads between technology, cultural heritage and society. We look forward to help make major science ventures of today and tomorrow accessible to a wide audience.” \nA museum research and experimenting area \nwill fill the second space at the centre of the development. Serving as a lab to experiment exhibition designs of the future, it will allow the many research projects in digital humanities to test museum innovations in situ. “Creating novel interactions between the visitors and exhibits, enriching the experience, fostering the historical and symbolic understanding of a work of art… Such are the objectives of this space aiming at making museums more accessible, easier to understand and closer to the visitors”, says Jean Claude Gandur, Chairman of the Fondation Gandur pour l’Art (FGA). In addition to providing funding for this pavilion, the FGA will also contribute to developing its content by designing exhibition programmes in close cooperation with the EPFL, exhibiting artworks from its collections, and via research conducted in the framework of the newly announced Fondation Gandur pour l'Art Chair. Dedicated first and foremost to experimentation, the pavilion will be open to the public and form future partnerships with other institutions.\n Finally, t\nhe Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL\n will occupy the southern part of the complex overlooking Lake Geneva. More than just a food hall, and thanks to the support of Audemars Piguet SA, the Café will also be a hub of experimentation dedicated to enhancement of the Montreux Jazz Festival audio-visual archives digitised by the EPFL, which include over 5,000 hours of recordings (part of the UNESCO Memory of the World register since 2013). The public will be given opportunities to discover these, in particular via immersive visualisation and navigation devices developed at EPFL. These digitisation and enhancement operations were performed in the framework of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project thanks to support by Audemars Piguet as well as other partners who joined the initiative – Logitech SA for developing the demonstrators, the Ernst Göhner Foundation, Amplidata, the Fondation Lombard Odier, Loterie Romande as well as private sponsors.", "summary": "Last August, a public-private partnership enabled the launch of construction of the Under One Roof building, designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma to house three areas dedicated to interactions between science, art and society.", "claim": "Last August, a public-private partnership enabled the launch of construction of the Under One Roof building, designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma to house two areas dedicated to interactions between science, art and society.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [28, 28], "noise": false}
{"id": 1506, "text": "The tension was palpable throughout the room. Slowly, doing their best not to tremble, the participants gradually added weights, then nails, to the bucket attached to their ephemeral work: a model bridge. Its fatal destiny that night was to collapse from the load. Above the stage a giant screen enabled the spectators – and especially the competitors – to catch every second of the spectacle.\nLast Monday was the second time that the “Cardboard Bridge Contest” was organized by EPFL, with the support of the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). “We plan to repeat it each year,” says Alexandru Moraru, director of the 2012 edition. Previously, a similar contest had been hosted by the school’s alumni association, A3.\nThe competition is open to all, even if it is spearheaded by the interest of students in the ENAC School – architects and civil engineers leading the pack. The principle is simple: to construct a bridge whose expanse reaches exactly one meter, using only white, brown or gray cardboard, along with white glue. The final weight of the bridge must not exceed 100 grams.\nAt the competition, the teams place their construction on a support, hang a bucket, then proceed to add weight until the breaking point. “We measure the resistance by dividing the supported weight by the weight of the bridge itself,” explains Alexandru Moraru. “An ultra-light structure therefore has a good chance of success.” A jury ranks the bridges as well for their aesthetic value.\n“Qu'à cela ne tienne”, from Vincent Nadeau and Simon Pracchinetti, took 1st Place for Aesthetics. © Alain Herzog / EPFL\nOver 27 Kilos on the Scale!\n “The Tourists” stole the show this year. Valerio Santoni and Ken Jun Triponez, both architecture students, improved upon an idea presented at last year’s competition. They did well to adopt it: their work, weighing 93 grams on the scale, bore a load reaching 27.67 kilos before collapsing – representing nearly 300 times its own weight!\nIn addition to being fun, this contest is genuinely worthwhile pedagogically. It permits, at hardly any cost, to experiment with audacious structures and forms and to open minds to new approaches in building and construction.

{"id": 1507, "text": "From mobile telephones to supercomputers, and including laptops and television sets, the number of electronic devices is growing alarmingly together and, in parallel, their energy consumption. To respond to this trend, a large-scale initiative involving several major research institutions from the academic world and industry, and led by EPFL, has been launched. Nicknamed STEEPER, this project aims to cut down by a factor of 10 the energy consumption of these devices when they are functioning, and to virtually eliminate any energy consumption when they are in passive or standby mode.\nWith support from the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission (FP7), scientists will be able to explore innovative modules on the nanometer scale for electronic chips, to bring down their operating voltage to less than 0.5 volts; this means lowering their electricity consumption by approximately 10-fold.\nBy reducing power consumption, STEEPER is taking a first step towards the “zero-watt” PC – “the Holy Grail of electronics”, as Adrian M. Ionescu, Professor at the EPFL Nanolab and project coordinator, calls it. The long-term objective of this scientist is a form of electronics that is virtually autonomous, taking its energy from external phenomena such as solar, thermal or electromagnetic sources. This ambitious project, called NanoPCo, is scheduled for submission to Brussels, as a candidate for the research program FET Flagship.\nEnergy waste, the biggest challenge\n“Energy waste is about to become the biggest challenge in electronics today, and in particular in the computer industry.” This is the conclusion of Dr Heike Riel, researcher in charge of the nanoelectronic group at IBM Research in Zurich, and also involved in the project.\nThe development of innovative devices, such as steep slope transistors (hence the project name) can enable a much shorter transition between the “off” and “on” modes than is possible with the current 60mV/decade limit of metal-oxide-semiconductor, field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) at room temperature.", "summary": "Thanks to the Steeper project conducted by EPFL, electronic devices should in future consume 10 times less energy when functioning, and almost nothing when in standby mode.", "claim": "Thanks to the Steeper project conducted by EPFL, electronic devices should in future consume less than 0.5 times less energy when functioning, and almost nothing when in standby mode.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [15, 17], "noise": false}
{"id": 1510, "text": "The future of the Earth’s poles is critical. In the coming decades, major international negotiations will focus on the polar regions, which are bearing the brunt of global warming. Switzerland, intent on having its voice heard and making a contribution in a field in which it already has solid expertise, today announced the creation of the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI). This new interdisciplinary center will be devoted to researching the Earth's poles and other extreme environments. The SPI, based at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), is a consortium of Swiss universities – EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, ETH Zurich and the University of Bern – and was cofounded with Editions Paulsen. Officially supported by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), the SPI is a Swiss initiative with a decidedly international mission.\nPolar explorer Frederik Paulsen is proud to be involved in this initiative: “The Swiss Polar Institute will help drive research in extreme environments, contribute to progress in the field of polar science and promote cooperation among public and academic institutions, industry and private-sector partners.”\nTo mark its launch, the SPI is organizing a major project: the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) will be the first scientific expedition to fully sail around the southernmost continent. The purpose of this expedition, with key logistical support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals, will be to measure and quantify the impact of climate change and pollution in the Southern Ocean.\nMore than 50 researchers \n At the end of December 2016, some 50 researchers from around the world will set off for three months onboard the Akademik Treshnikov, a Russian ship dedicated to scientific research. Twentytwo research projects – submitted by teams from Switzerland, the UK, France, Australia, etc. – were selected for the expedition. The projects range from glaciology to climatology, biology and oceanography.\nThis expedition neatly illustrates the SPI’s mission: the Swiss Polar Institute is designed to be a platform for global experts in polar research to bring their combined knowledge to bear – such as by drawing parallels between polar environments and alpine regions. This is similar to what is being done in the field of space research. “Swiss universities owe their competitiveness to a shrewd approach of competing and cooperating with each other at the same time,” said Mauro Dell'Ambrogio, State Secretary for Education, Research and Innovation. “The Swiss Polar Institute is a great example of intelligent cooperation.”\nThe Institute’s role will also be to assess the state of the Earth's poles and climate in general, to outline the many challenges we face going forward and to keep the public informed. Its work is bound to have an impact on the development of new technologies for extreme environments. The SPI will be an important asset for Switzerland, which aims to play a key role in international agreements on the future of the polar regions. This includes discussions on the Antarctic Treaty.\nThe Earth’s climate balance is at stake \n The Earth’s poles are fundamental to the planet's climate balance, and learning more about how they work through research is crucial. The climate, which is regulated by the interaction of atmospheric and oceanic currents, acts like a massive heat engine. This engine is powered by the transfer of heat between polar and tropical regions: currents of icy water deep in the ocean travel from the poles toward the equator, while warm water and air move across the ocean’s surface towards the frigid zones. This complex and fragile mechanism also plays a key role in the carbon cycle, in which the ocean absorbs a significant amount of the CO2 in the atmosphere.\nHuman settlement and activities may be concentrated far from the Earth’s poles, but they directly affect polar environments. “The poles are essential for climate balance, but they are also the regions where changes are most apparent: that’s where the largest temperature differences have been recorded,” said Philippe Gillet, vice president of EPFL and a specialist in Earth and planetary science. The 2015-2016 winter was the mildest on record at the North Pole. December and January temperatures there, normally close to -20°C, were above freezing.\nPotential discoveries \n The 22 projects selected for the expedition cover a spectrum of topics, including the composition of plankton, threatened animal species, the presence of microplastics in the surrounding water, the carbon cycle, microorganisms that flourish in the ocean depths or in ice, and the impact of waves on the coasts.\n“The ACE initiative is a unique and precious opportunity”, says ACE Panel member Prof. Jean Jouzel, glaciologist and climatologist. “Bringing together multi-disciplinary projects to circumnavigate Antarctica and gathering scientific evidence in a region so remote and yet deeply affected by human activity and climate change will hugely contribute to our understanding of past and future evolution of the Southern Ocean. It is a key region for the carbon cycle and the Antarctic continent which may significantly contribute to the sea-level rise in the coming centuries“.\nThe projects will make use of the most advanced data collection and analysis technologies available. In addition, because they will be run in extreme environments, the projects will provide insight into biochemical compounds and microorganisms that up to now have been studied little if at all. The results could lead to discoveries and new and interesting applications in the fields of biotechnology, medicine and environmental science.\n---\nPress kit\n Contacts\nEPFL\n Philippe Gillet, vice president for academic affairs , +41 21 693 70 58\n Sarah Perrin, press officer , +41 21 693 21 07\nFederal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL\n Gottardo Pestalozzi, communications , +41 44 739 22 40, mobile: 41 79 224 20 18\nETH Zurich\n Claudia Naegeli, media relations officer , +41 44 632 41 41\nUniversity of Bern\n Martin G.

{"id": 1523, "text": "Geneva and Casablanca loom large in people’s imaginations, but for vastly different reasons. Geneva sits on the tranquil shores of Lake Geneva; it’s known as the birthplace of Calvinism and is the archetypal international city. Casablanca, the “White City,” faces the unbridled Atlantic Ocean and was immortalized in Michael Curtiz’s eponymous movie. But there’s one thing these two cities have in common: they’ve both been shaped by the forces of globalization, which have been gaining momentum since the late 20th century. In a landscape marked by neoliberalism, competition between metropolises, and the cross-border flow of people, goods and capital, both Geneva and Casablanca can be called globalized cities, and both are vying to increase their appeal through major urban development projects.\nKamil Hajji grew up in Casablanca and moved to Switzerland to attend university. He holds an architecture degree from EPFL and completed his PhD at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR). After seeing first-hand the rapid transformation of Casablanca and then later Geneva, he decided to focus his thesis research on a comparison of their development patterns. He looked in particular at how their urban development projects are being informed by market forces and local resistance. His thesis public defense took place on October 29. \nGlobalization is a fascinating phenomenon. I saw it transform Casablanca completely, and as I began visiting other world cities, I saw a lot of similarities among them. I wanted to know what was behind that\nKamil Hajji​​​​​\nAn exhaustive study\nHajji examined the development projects for the new  and Casa Marina neighborhoods in Casablanca, and for the new  and  districts in Geneva. His aim was to understand exactly how each one has been influenced by globalization. “Globalization means adopting essentially the same public policies and strategies in cities around the world. Capital is moving more freely and local governments are seeking to attract it and keep it local. So they are implementing strategies with very similar fundamentals. You can see that in their buildings – high-rises and other urban structures designed to bring people in,” says Hajji. \nHe performed an exhaustive study of each project, conducting interviews with policymakers, investors, local groups, and people who were removed from their homes to make way for the development work. He also read through the minutes of neighborhood meetings and searched carefully through city archives. “I wanted to trace the projects back to the very beginning and see exactly how the process unfolded,” says Hajji, who undoubtedly drew on journalistic skills inherited from his father. “I also wanted to see whether the neighborhoods would turn into gated communities where people of a certain social class close themselves off from the outside world,” he adds. “In Morocco I saw the adverse social effects of globalization – that’s an issue I care about and wanted to understand better.”\nLocal resistance \nBy comparing these two globalized, dynamic cities with very different political systems, Hajji gained unique insight into the underlying mechanisms of globalization. In Switzerland, he saw a semi-direct democracy where local resistance can block profit-driven initiatives. In Morocco, where the constitutional monarchy was reformed to introduce greater democracy after the Arab Spring protests in 2011, he saw how local resistance movements are able to take shape, and how much leverage they have with local governments and investors. In both countries, Hajji assessed how much power is held by municipalities – the lowest rung of democracy.\nThe CFC First Tower, 122 meters, in the heart of Casablanca's Casa Anfa business district. © skyscrapercity\nIn the PAV project in Geneva, Hajji found that Switzerland’s local resistance system led to lengthy negotiations and a series of concessions that resulted in a final development plan considerably different from the initial proposal. However, in Casablanca, the more top-down approach results in plans “that are closer to the developer’s initial, globalized vision. That’s because local resistance is not organized enough and isn’t sufficiently represented in the political sphere to have much of an impact,” says Hajji. \nWith his PhD under his belt, Hajji is now completing a post-doc at LaSUR and works for , an EPFL spin-off. Based on his research, he believes that democracy can change how globalization is implemented locally. “In more democratic countries, the image of a neoliberal, globalized city changes shape as local considerations are taken into account,” he says. “These environments also tend to produce cities with greater social cohesion.”", "summary": "For his PhD thesis at EPFL, Kamil Hajji compared urban development projects in two major cities – each a business and financial hub, but in countries with very different societies and political systems.

{"id": 1526, "text": "Twenty years ago, squats, vacant land and brownfields were a common feature of European cities. Now, these spaces have disappeared, taking the cultural activities they once harbored with them. A new book by researchers at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR) takes stock of this dramatic shift, exploring what role – physical or symbolic – remains for unprofitable, experimental and subversive activities today. In other words, where does counterculture fit into the modern-day city?\nThe researchers look at three cities – Geneva, Lisbon and Ljubljana – focusing on the period between 2013 and 2017. They find that, just as municipal authorities are championing creativity and supporting varied year-round arts programs in their cities, they are simultaneously stifling, regulating and institutionalizing counterculture like never before. This puzzling contradiction is reflected in the title of the book, published by MétisPresses: \nLa contre-culture domestiquée : art, espace et politique dans la ville gentrifiée\n (Taming counterculture: art, space and policy in the gentrified city).\nThe authors show how gentrification is ridding cities of informal spaces and working-class neighborhoods and, in the process, oppressing and excluding people and groups living on the margins of society. Culture is no longer distinguishable from urban policy, with its focus on the role of the creative process and the most experimental and subversive social movements in cities. In fact, over the past 40 years, counterculture itself has evolved into post-counterculture, whereby art is expected to serve the attractiveness, entertainment and profit motives of wider cultural policy. \nRegulated spaces\nThe researchers argue that, in today’s cities, urban planning reigns supreme. Yesterday’s alternative venues have been replaced by tightly regulated and policed spaces that are heavily publicized on account of their appeal – and expected to yield a return on investment. “Today’s tourists make no distinction between listed castles, museums, festivals and alternative neighborhoods,” says Luca Pattaroni, a senior scientist at the LASUR and the editor of the book. “In Lisbon, for instance, the LX Factory alternative arts center was recently sold to an international consortium as a financial asset.” In another example, the authors show how competition for real estate means that artists are only granted temporary occupation of vacant premises until a more lucrative outlet is found.\nThe four-part study begins by looking at the emergence of counterculture in 1970s Geneva, and how the proponents of this movement claimed space to house their activities. The researchers then explore the changing narrative around counterculture, noting how the “avant garde” of the 1970s gave way to “alternative culture” in the 1980s. Their analysis of Geneva’s shift from a post-squat city in 2000 to the densely packed and heavily regulated place it is today shows how counterculture has become steadily institutionalized and absorbed into museums, concert venues and purpose-built alternative arts spaces. In part three, the authors turn their attention to Lisbon and Ljubljana – two cities where, in just a few short years, counterculture has undergone much the same transformation as in Geneva. Their analysis shows that this is not a uniquely Swiss phenomenon. \nResistance\nThe book ends on a more optimistic note, exploring pockets of resistance against this trend. The authors demonstrate how artists and artisans are taking over buildings and spaces, reclaiming the city’s streets and forming cooperatives and, in doing so, speaking up and pushing back against attempts to restrict their creative freedom. Because, as Pattaroni makes clear in the introduction to the book, art is about more than entertainment. It cannot be reduced to a policy tool. \nThis richly illustrated book was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, which funded the publication of  including RTS archive footage, photographs, an extra chapter and portraits of alternative spaces and neighborhoods in the three cities.\nBook launch at 6pm on 12 March at the Librairie du Boulevard bookstore, Geneva.

{"id": 1528, "text": "When you’re out of work, starting a company can be a good solution, both for you and for the economy. This is the conclusion of a recently released study led by professor Marc Gruber, holder of EPFL’s Entrepreneurship and Technology Commercialization Chair. Conducted with the support of several regional employment agencies, this study analyzed in detail and for the first time which unemployed individuals are starting their own businesses, what factors drive them to take this step, and how their companies are developing. The scientists compared data from several countries – Switzerland, Germany, France and Belgium. Gruber gives us an overview of the study.\n-Your study shows that companies started by unemployed people do much more than just provide them with a job.\nAbsolutely. It appears that these companies generate employment. In Switzerland, these enterprises created on average 2.2 jobs after three years, in addition to the position of the company’s founder, and thus they’re potentially taking other people off the unemployment rolls. In addition, they have a very encouraging survival rate, even higher in Switzerland than in the other countries we studied: 88% of them are still viable after three years, compared with 80% in Germany and 77% in Belgium.\n- Can you give us a profile of someone who’s likely to start a successful company?\nThis is a heterogeneous group, made up of people coming from very diverse backgrounds, from landscaping to architecture to consulting. Even so, there are certain commonalities. These people are by and large male, in the 30-60 year-old age bracket, and thus have a certain amount of previous job experience. Two profiles stand out: those who have always dreamed of starting their own business but resisted as long as they had salaried jobs; for them, unemployment provided the needed impetus and opportunity. And there are those who only considered starting a business after months, if not years, of unemployment, and then as a last ditch solution. Those in this second category are in the minority.\n- How can the results of this study be used?\nThe goal of this study was to better understand the effects that interventions and government support, which vary considerably from one country to another, have on the evolution of unemployment. These results will thus be primarily of use to policy makers in the area of unemployment, to improve programs designed to facilitate business development, better target their financial or training support systems, or develop new kinds of assistance. These data can also be helpful for entrepreneurs or those who would like to become entrepreneurs; they will discover possible avenues for developing their strengths, anticipating possible difficulties, identifying gaps they need to fill in education or management skills, and learning how to get the support they need. Understanding how to handle all these aspects is all the more important now that everyone is likely to change jobs or go through job restructuring several times in the course of his or her life.\n- Do you think that for these companies there is a “recipe for success?”\nWe often believe that luck is the main ingredient in success. You need it, that’s for sure! But in this study, we were asking ourselves about other components that systematically had an impact on the performance of new start-ups -- the idea itself, the founder’s expertise or knowledge, his management experience and personality – which make a company prosper, create jobs and turn a profit. In fact, two factors favorably influence success: an idea with growth potential and a founder with prior management experience. You have to know how to stay afloat in a competitive environment and understand how your competitors are handling it, as well. Our results show that specific expertise in the new company’s domain is less critical for these “high performers,” because they can always acquire knowledge along the way or get outside support by bringing in skilled collaborators.\n- Could starting a company be possible for all the unemployed?\nEntrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. But we could at least ask everyone who is jobless to consider it, to see it as a possible alternative. There are certainly many people who would make good entrepreneurs, but who don’t think of it or won’t even allow themselves to consider the possibility.", "summary": "More than 90% of companies launched by unemployed individuals are still viable after three years.

{"id": 1529, "text": "A real technical feat has just been achieved in Antarctica by EPFL’s high-precision antennas manufactured by Professor Juan Mosig’s Electromagnetics and Acoustics Laboratory (LEMA). Attached to a plane, these antennas can help to analyze with unprecedented precision the composition of an ice layer nearly 3000m thick, as well as the depth of the underlying bedrock. This is a major advance that should be of interest to both geologists and climatologists at a time when increasing efforts are being made to measure the effects of global warming on the cryosphere – the Earth’s ice-covered regions. In fact, scientists are all agreed that no complete and precise map exists of the bedrock underneath the ice.\nSatellite planned by the European Space Agency\n Creating these high-tech antennas is part of a wide-ranging project known as the POLARIS (Polarimetric Airborne Radar Ice Sounder) program launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) and run by the Technical University of Denmark. If the tests, undertaken last winter in Greenland and this spring in Antarctica, prove conclusive, the next step will be to attach these antennas to a satellite in order to analyze the Earth’s entire ice layer from outer space. Eventually, the ESA even aims to use this technology to study the different ice types present on the planet Mars or on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.\nHow does it work?\n Fixed into the lower part of the fuselage, the eight antennas form a radar with a wide aperture, capable of high-precision detection. The antennas generate electromagnetic waves at a frequency of 450 MegaHertz (MHz), that are in the UHF (ultra-high frequencies) bandwidth, similar to the waves of traditional televisions. “Depending on its frequency, a wave can either pass through a substance or be absorbed by it”, explains Professor Mosig. “UHF waves are the most suitable for this type of project because they easily penetrate the ice”.\nEvery time a change occurs in the property of the ice, a part of the wave ricochets, returning a faint echo that is picked up by the antenna. This echo is much stronger when the wave reaches the bedrock (cf. fig. 1)\n“Because of its properties, each material will alter the phase that is returned. This is a natural signature. Through this signature and the time taken by the wave to return, we can identify both the type of material present in a particular place, and the thickness of the layer that covers it”, comments Professor Mosig. The measurements are then gathered, analyzed and converted into usable information by the Technical University of Denmark (cf. fig.2).\nFigure 2.

The first edition will run 45,000 copies in French, English and German. It’s the fruit of a unusual partnership between a team of independent journalists and four leading universities in the area of technology and innovation: Technical University of Denmark, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Eindhoven University of Technology, and Technische Universität München. From today, Technologist is available for purchase in 20 European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, the UK, France, the Netherlands and Denmark.\n “Europeans hear about research done in their own country and in English-speaking countries, but often have no idea what’s going on in neighboring countries,” says Daniel Saraga, Executive Editor of Technologist. “The result is a general impression that most science is done in the U.S., whereas European research is incredibly dynamic.” The ambition of the new magazine is an attempt to rebalance the scales.\n Technologist’s model is one that is not often seen in the media: it is edited independently but funded by the partner universities. “One of our models is the MIT Technology Review,” explains Saraga. “It has proven that information can be treated objectively and in an interesting manner even though it’s funded by an institution. We discuss content with our partner universities, but we maintain our independence as to the way in which we present the information.”\nFracking: comparing the U.S. and Europe\nAlthough Technologist has a distinctly European tone, that doesn’t mean it ignores the rest of the world. The first edition covers “augmented reality” and describes research on robotic prostheses being developed in Switzerland, Germany and Brazil that could give paralyzed individuals the ability to walk again. A special section on shale gas compares the situation in the U.S. and Europe and looks at the political and scientific controversies surrounding hydraulic fracking. “Europe is home to some of the most interesting scientific programs in the world, and we have access to top experts in every subject from the universities on the continent,” says Saraga.\n The magazine calls upon the contributions of a fleet of high-caliber journalists based throughout Europe who write for magazines such NewScientist, Nature, Spiegel and La Recherche, and well-known graphic designers and illustrators who contribute to publications such as Domus, Wallpaper and Newsweek. The team is coordinated in Switzerland by the LargeNetwork Press Agency, and the website is managed in Copenhagen by a scientific editor.\n For the partner universities, it is critical that Europe’s scientific face has a strong media presence and that citizens are informed of scientific progress on the continental scale. This is why the project was included as part of their Eurotech consortium.\n Launched on June 24, 2014 at the EuroScience Open Forum (ESOF) in Copenhagen, Technologist aims to bridge, even modestly, the gap in language and culture.

The injection of capital comes on top of a CHF 10 million EU grant awarded to the HIPERION consortium, which brings together a range of industry and research partners. The company, whose technology has achieved record efficiency of 29% for sun-to-electricity conversion, will initially target the agricultural sector with translucent panels that can act as both greenhouse covers and power plants.\nTargeting agriculture first\nThe photovoltaic modules developed by Insolight, based at EPFL’s Innovation Park, represent a novel approach to solar power generation. Lenses embedded in a thin glass layer focus sunlight on tiny, high-efficiency, space-grade solar cells below. The lenses move a few millimeters throughout the day to track the sun’s movement across the sky and keep the cells aligned with the light rays. The system can be fitted to conventional solar panels to maximize energy production. But the translucent modules can also work as standalone power plants while serving other functions such as promoting crop growth.\nInsolight is planning to team up with major solar energy suppliers to target the agricultural sector with panels that can be installed in fields, on greenhouses and on green roofs. Users will be able to switch between two modes: an electricity generation mode, in which the lenses concentrate light on the high-efficiency solar cells, and a maximum light transmission mode, in which all incoming light passes through the panel to reach the crops below. “The agrivoltaics market may be relatively new, but it’s already worth an estimated CHF 700 million, with total installed capacity of 5 GWp,” says Insolight CEO Laurent Coulot.

{"id": 1539, "text": "EPFL’s Technology Transfer Office (TTO) has recently seen a surge in requests for licenses for your software, which generates color-coded graphs highlighting the key elements of websites’ data protection policies. Who are all these requests coming from? \nIt’s true that the TTO has received over 20 license requests in the past few months. Most of them come from companies offering web services – such as personal data protection software and data monetization applications – as well as lawyers drafting data protection policies and disclaimers, who want to test their texts. Some ad agencies have requested licenses so that they can place ads in accordance with new regulatory requirements. A few of the requests we have received were for exclusivity agreements, which is something we want to avoid. We just entered into a license agreement with DuckDuckGo, a US search engine that stands apart for its commitment to protecting personal data. For instance, it doesn’t store any personal information about its users.\nWhat benefits does your software offer DuckDuckGo?\nIts developers plan to incorporate our AI algorithms into the search engine’s Privacy Essentials extension. This extension already provides a summary of important data protection information, but that summary is generated by hand based on the policies of just a few dozen websites. With our algorithms, the summary generation process can be automated and expanded to include tens of thousands of websites. However, it’s worth pointing out that the summaries produced by our software have no legal value – they’re for information purposes only – but they do have a nearly 80% accuracy rate at this point.\nDid you expect Polisis to be so successful when you were developing the algorithms?\nWe spent a year and a half developing the technology at EPFL’s Distributed Information Systems Laboratory, in association with the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan. The development was done for research purposes, but the number of license requests the TTO has received since we put the program online has far exceeded our expectations. And over 30,000 people have tried it out. Part of Polisis’ success is due to the fact that it’s easy to use – you don’t have to be an expert to understand the color-coded graphs it generates. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that took effect in May also helped. Our program clearly provides the easiest way to decipher all the different data protection policies, which are often long-winded but now mandatory for all websites. The GDPR has also prompted people who are simply curious to take an interest in our program. That makes me almost wish we had created a start-up to market our technology!\nDo you have any competitors?\nThere are other websites out there that analyze data protection policies, but they don’t work the same way. They highlight specific sentences and clauses based on what a user searches for. But they don’t provide automatically-generated summaries of how websites use personal data.\nAre you surprised by some of the things you found using your program? \nIt was interesting to see that some websites that you wouldn’t think are much concerned about data privacy actually show up as having robust policies. The developers of those websites probably hired an army of lawyers to comb through their policies and introduce generic terms that make it through filters. The end result is policies with extremely vague terms like “with our partners for different reasons,” “if necessary” and “effectively.” These policies seem clear when you first read them, but dig deeper and you’ll find that’s not the case. And the GDPR has not completely eliminated this trend. Our algorithms are designed to boost transparency and draw attention to these kinds of highly important details. We are currently working with Kassem Fawaz’s lab at the University of Wisconsin to improve our algorithms so they can better recognize generic terms.\nYour software can help identify where personal data are sent and how they’re used, but can it check whether websites are actually following their data protection policies? \nNo, because we don’t have access to websites’ servers. But extensions like those provided by DuckDuckGo can spot advertising trackers and check whether websites disclose them in their data protection policies.

{"id": 1542, "text": "To explain why the system developed in his Distributed Computing Lab () represents a paradigm shift in how we think about cryptocurrencies – and about digital trust in general – Professor  uses a legal metaphor: all players in this new system are “innocent until proven guilty.”\nThis is in contrast to the traditional Bitcoin model first , which relies on solving a difficult problem called “consensus” to guarantee the security of transactions. In this model, everyone in a distributed system must agree on the validity of all transactions to prevent malicious players from cheating – for example, by spending the same digital tokens twice (double-spending). In order to prove their honesty and achieve consensus, players must execute complex – and energy-intensive – computing tasks that are then verified by the other players.\nBut in their new system, Guerraoui and his colleagues flip the assumption that all players are potential cheaters on its head.\n“We take a minimalist approach. We realize that players don’t need to reach consensus; they just need to prevent malicious behavior when it manifests,” he explains. “So, we assume everyone is honest, and if players see someone trying to do something wrong, they ignore that player – and only that player.”\nWith the consensus requirement out of the way, the DCL’s new system, dubbed Byzantine Reliable Broadcast, can achieve safe cryptocurrency transactions on a large scale with an energetic cost of virtually zero – “roughly equivalent to that of exchanging emails”, Guerraoui says – and just a few grams of CO2 compared to  for a single Bitcoin transaction.\nThat could be a big advantage over Bitcoin, which has been reported to have a global electricity consumption , and a global carbon footprint .\nCommunication is key\nSo, how can users be sure that cryptocurrency transactions are secure if they are not sure who the malicious players are? Guerraoui says: players just need to communicate with each other.\n“If a malicious player wants to make a payment, for example, this system would not allow anyone to accept money from that player until a randomly chosen sample has confirmed the player has not sent money to anyone else; otherwise, the payment will not be accepted,” he explains. “Basically, we’re saying that you only need to exchange information with a sample of players to implement a cryptocurrency.”\nThe central element of communicating, or broadcasting, information is what gives the Byzantine Reliable Broadcast system its name. After first  the theoretical results behind the system earlier this year in the proceedings of the 2019 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (), one of the two most prestigious conferences in the field, Guerraoui and his colleagues have recently published  describing the implementation and scale-up of their algorithm.\nFor its description of the first scalable solution to a consensus alternative, the second DCL paper has already garnered interest from industry, and won the Best Paper Award at the field’s other top conference,  (the 33\nrd\n International Symposium on Distributed Computing). The award will be presented in Budapest, Hungary in mid-October.\nFrom banking to bikeshares\nIn addition to its lower cost and energy expenditure, the Byzantine Reliable Broadcast system sacrifices nothing in terms of transaction security. While it has a narrower range of applications than Bitcoin – being suitable only for cryptocurrencies, and not for more complex transactions like smart contracts – the system can manage other forms of currency besides money.\n“It could be used for an abstract cryptocurrency for exchanging goods, like bikes in a bike-sharing program for example,” Guerraoui says.\nHe and his colleagues plan to release their new system as an open-source code for anyone to download and use by the end of 2020.\nThis research is being carried out as part of an ERC Proof-of Concept Grant won by Guerraoui , aimed at putting a new class of “consensusless” algorithms into practice.", "summary": "The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is limited by its astronomical electricity consumption and outsized carbon footprint.

{"id": 1544, "text": "Lausanne’s traffic is the noisiest in Switzerland, often exceeding 55 decibels – the upper safety limit recommended for Europe. That’s largely due to its steep roads, which result in excessive engine noise when vehicles get moving and accelerate. For the first time, scientists from EPFL, CHUV and HUG have crossed data from 3,697 Lausanne residents who reported high levels of daytime sleepiness in a CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study with the results of a noise survey carried out by the Swiss Federal Office of the Environment (OFEV). “This research, published in the \nInternational Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health\n, establishes a link between where people suffering from daytime sleepiness live and the noise caused by cars and trains passing through those areas at night. It shows that some areas of Lausanne are particularly problematic,” says Stéphane Joost, a researcher at EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographic Information Systems (LASIG).\nReal health risks\nSleep disturbances can have serious health consequences, as they can lead not only to daytime sleepiness and higher stress, but also to a greater risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, fatigue-induced accidents, depression and other psychological disorders. For their study, the scientists mapped out the neighborhoods where people suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness live and compared that with traffic-noise data obtained from the OFEV’s sonBASE. They found distinct neighborhoods with similar levels of reported sleepiness, illustrating the effects of nocturnal noise pollution on Lausanne residents.\n“Daytime sleepiness is a common complaint among the people who contact us,” says Raphaël Heinzer, head of the Sleep Disorders Center at CHUV. “This study is the first to show that where a person lives can be a major contributing factor.” The red zones on the scientists’ map indicate neighborhoods with both a high occurrence of daytime sleepiness and elevated levels of nighttime noise – meaning they are probably areas where residents don’t sleep very well. On the other hand, the blue zones indicate neighborhoods with low levels of daytime sleepiness. “The difference in nighttime noise between the red and blue zones is over five decibels, which is huge considering that volume doubles with every three decibels,” says Joost.\nLegend: \nBlue zones correspond to neighborhoods with below-average daytime sleepiness and where similar sleepiness levels are reported within a range of at least 400 meters. Red zones correspond to neighborhoods with above-average daytime sleepiness. \nLausanne’s red zones are located primarily at the intersection of Avenue d’Echallens and Chemin de Montétan – which is especially noisy between 10pm and 6am – and below the train station near the Place de Milan. In addition, the equivalent continuous sound level (Leq) in neighborhoods near major thoroughfares and train tracks can exceed 50 decibels, which is the maximum allowed by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health.\nMaking targeted measures possible \nThe study’s authors hope their work will help policymakers identify which neighborhoods can benefit the most from noise-reduction measures to improve residents’ health. “Fortunately, sleep disturbances and the resulting health problems are reversible. We can reduce nighttime noise by introducing speed limits, restricting certain kinds of vehicles, or using sound-absorbing surfaces, for example,” adds Joost.\nDoctors are also advocating such measures. “Improving patients’ health through urban-planning policies designed to reduce the amount of noise pollution they are exposed to is one aspect of a new field of healthcare called urban health,” says Idris Guessous, a primary care physician at HUG and a coauthor of the study. “We want to build awareness among not just doctors, but also urban planners, geographers, architects, lawyers and sociologists of the role they can play in working together to improve the health of a city’s residents. Our maps were developed jointly by several public-sector institutions, and they can help local governments make better informed decisions. We hope our research will speed progress towards targeted public-health policies.”\nA similar study is being carried out in Geneva using data on the city’s residents collected during HUG’s \nBus Santé\n program.

In the most severe cases, the sufferer may become fully paralyzed and in need of permanent assistance.\nThe TOBI project (Tools for brain-computer interaction) is financed by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7) and is coordinated by EPFL. Since 2008 it has focused on the use of the signals transmitted by the brain. The electrical activity that takes place in the brain when the patient focuses on a particular task such as lifting an arm is detected by electroencephalography (EEG) through electrodes placed in a cap worn by the patient. Subsequently, a computer reads the signals and turns them into concrete actions as, for instance, moving a cursor on a screen.\nTests involving more than 100 patients\n Based on this idea, researchers from thirteen institutions together with TOBI project partners have developed various technologies aimed at either obtaining better signal quality, making them clearer, or translating them into useful and functional applications. During the research, more than 100 patients or handicapped users had the opportunity to test the devices.

{"id": 1548, "text": "Every year, nearly 500,000 people around the world find themselves living with disability as a result of a traffic accident or other trauma that has damaged their spinal cord. People with severe injuries lose the vast majority of their motor and sensory abilities in their lower limbs. They may also experience secondary conditions resulting from inactivity, such as bedsores and cardiovascular disorders.\nIn order to improve their daily lives and restore as many motor functions as possible, research teams from the Alberto Santos Dumont Association for Research Support (AASDAP)\nin Brazil, in collaboration with EPFL, have developed a new, non-invasive system for lower-limb neurorehabilitation.\n Patients use their own brain activity to send electrical impulses to 16 muscles in their legs. With the help of a conventional walker and a body weight support system, they learn to walk again, build muscle strength and improve their motor skills. A haptic interface provides vibrotactile feedback on their arms, giving patients information about the position of their limbs in space. This means they can move their legs without having to constantly look at them.\n The system was tested on two patients with chronic paraplegia. At the end of the clinical evaluation, both patients were able to move with less dependency on walking assistance, and one of them displayed a clear motor improvement. Doctors also noticed enhanced cardiovascular capacity and muscle volume. Significant recovery was achieved without resorting to surgical intervention. The results of this study have been published in .\nElectrodes to measure brain activity and stimulate the legs \nThe patients wore an EEG headset with electrodes to record the brain’s electrical activity and detect movement intention. Eight electrodes were attached to each leg, stimulating the muscles involved in the walking process. After preliminary training, patients used their own brain activity to send electric impulses to the muscles in either leg.\n“We decoded the patients’ motor imagery using a non-invasive brain-machine interface,” says Solaiman Shokur, from the AASDAP. “The patients were instructed to imagine moving their left and right legs in turn, and our system used these signals to move the corresponding limb.”\nWith the help of a walker and supported by a harness that bore 60–70% of their body weight, the patients learned to walk again and increased their sensorimotor skills.\nThis approach, using a predefined walking trajectory, imposes a physiological gait on the patient. The trajectory is associated with a predefined electrostimulation pattern for the lower-limb muscles involved in walking.\n\"We controlled the electrostimulation through a closed loop. This allowed us to adjust the electrical current applied to the muscles in real time in order to correct for differences between the measured and target hip and knee angles,\" says Mohamed Bouri, who heads up the , which developed the electrostimulation and the vibrotactile feedback technologies. \"That means we can improve muscle activation and reduce muscle fatigue.\"\nAnother major component of this approach was the use of a wearable haptic display to deliver tactile feedback to the patients´ forearms in order to provide them with a continuous source of proprioceptive feedback related to their walking. Tactile feedback improves the fluidity of movement and increases patients' confidence in their ability to walk.\nWaking up residual nerves that have been dormant for years\nThe researchers’ approach is innovative: it is multimodal and doesn't require invasive surgery. Patients simply need to train on simulators and become familiar with the interface. The results are surprising in that they demonstrate both muscular improvement and progress in neurological functions. “Our hypothesis is that, after a spinal injury, some spinal cord fibers may have survived, but they may not have been activated for years,” says Solaiman Shokur. “Our system makes it possible to stimulate them again.\"\n\"There is no silver bullet to treat spinal cord injuries,\" says Miguel Nicolelis, from the AASDAP. \"More and more, it looks like we need to implement multiple techniques simultaneously to achieve the best neurorehabilitation results.\"\nThis project is the result of a collaboration between the , the headquarters of the , the  at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC, Santo André, Brazil), and EPFL’s  research group ().", "summary": "Researchers from the Alberto Santos Dumont Association for Research Support (AASDAP) in Brazil, in collaboration with EPFL, have developed a non-invasive strategy that combines functional electrostimulation, a body weight support system and a brain-machine interface for the rehabilitation of people with paraplegia.

{"id": 1553, "text": "Nutrition is a key factor in preventing obesity and chronic diseases like diabetes. Despite product labeling requirements, consumers have a hard time knowing – and keeping track of – exactly what they eat. Openfood is an EPFL initiative being launched today that will provide free and easy access to the largest food database in Switzerland via computer or smartphone.\n“We want to make this information available to everyone, from the general public to researchers, so that we can better assess what we are eating but also to encourage the development of new projects that use this database,” says Marcel Salathé, an EPFL professor and the founder of the Openfood project. EPFL has already created a free app that shows one way the data set can be used: people using the app can scan the bar code of products available in large grocery stores in order to see their ingredients and how much sugar the products contain. “By simplifying the sometimes complex information on product labels, Openfood helps consumers know what they are really buying, and this makes it easier to eat healthier,” says Salathé.\nResearchers, journalists, medical professionals and startups will be able to use this open-source data to come up with new tools in the area of nutrition. This could be a smart refrigerator, an app that helps find a healthier alternative product or a way of tracking daily meals in order to improve the user’s overall diet. While 14,000 products sold in Switzerland are already included in the database, anyone who uses the app can add more products, anonymously, with just a few clicks.\nA bridge between science and the public\nThe Openfood project was developed in partnership with the Kristian Gerhard Jebsen Foundation, a philanthropic foundation whose goals include ensuring the general public receives objective scientific information on nutrition and health issues. Since most people have a mobile phone these days, technology can build a bridge between science and the general public, offering an objective alternative to the biased information that comes out of the food industry and from sources lacking any scientific backing.\nAlongside the Openfood project, EPFL has also developed , a website that will publish articles and scientifically proven information on nutrition, under an editorial partnership with the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV). The factfood.org website, which is in French and English for starters, is an additional source of information alongside Openfood.

{"id": 1555, "text": "Solar and wind energy are great candidates for the electricity generation of the future, when nuclear electricity production is envisioned to cease. However, solar and wind sources’ peak availability takes place at times that do not usually correspond to peak demand hours. Therefore, a way must be devised to store and later reuse the energy generated. To address this issue many avenues have been explored, ranging from electrochemical batteries to water pumping to geographically elevated reservoirs.\nAlfred Rufer, director of the Industrial Electronics Laboratory (LEI) at EPFL, has worked for over ten years on an original storage system: compressed air. The use of a hydraulic piston (water pumped into a cylinder that compresses the air in the remaining space) instead of a mechanical piston delivers the best system performance, generating much less losses in the form of heat. The obtained high pressure air can be safely stored in bottles without losses until it is necessary to generate new electricity by expanding the gas in the cylinder. \"One of the advantages of our system is that it does not require rare materials. Also, its robustness makes it durable, \"says Alfred Rufer.\n\"Turnkey\" system\nSylvain Lemofouet carried out his doctoral thesis at LEI and founded the start-up Enairys Powertech to develop this principle and create \"turnkey\" electrical energy storage and retrieval units. As a result, the HyPES project was born.\nHis first prototype was launched in 2007. In 2011, a unit of industrial dimensions could already absorb 10 kW to be stored as compressed air. As of this year, a 25 kW pilot will be installed at the Mont-Soleil (JU) photovoltaic park. \"We talk in terms of the electric power that the system is able to absorb and release rather than about energy storage capacity, which does not entail significant expenses: we just need to add more bottles ,\" said Sylvain Lemofouet.\nIn the future, there will be 250 kW installations at first and 2’500 kW ones afterwards. \"The stored energy that we can provide will be adapted to decentralized production units such as solar parks warehouses or wind farms,\" said Sylvain Lemofouet.\nIn line with the canton’s politics\nDuring a press conference that took place at EPFL on 12 May 2014, the Canton of Vaud announced its backing to the development of the HyPES system in the form of a 1,66 million francs grant and by promoting the entry of the HyPES devices into the market.

{"id": 1557, "text": "The emblematic yellow Postbuses have been roaming the Swiss countryside for more than 100 years, serving even the country’s most remote valleys. Changes in rural development, in the distribution of populations, and in their accompanying mobility needs, however, have meant that PostBus Switzerland Ltd., a subsidiary of Swiss Post, has had to continually adapt its service.\nThe results of “Optima,” a long-term study – three years of work done by twenty researchers – commissioned to EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) by PostBus Switzerland Ltd. are being published today. PostBus Switzerland now has additional tools in hand with which to direct its strategic development in the most pertinent manner possible. Three laboratories participated in the study, which was done under the aegis of EPFL’s Transportation Center (): the Urban Sociology () led by Vincent Kaufmann, the Transport and Mobility laboratory (), led by Michel Bierlaire, and the Urban and Regional Planning Laboratory (), led by Martin Schuler.\nThese intermediate results show that PostBus has significant growth potential. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in the suburbs (neither in the city center, nor in a rural area), and this group is an ideal target for PostBus service. The services provided for leisure and shopping passengers could be further developed. In addition, the Swiss population already has a heightened sense of “multi-modality” – the use of several different forms of transport over a single route – as well as one of the most well-developed rail services in the world. Its car-sharing system, Mobility, which has just celebrated its 100,000th customer, is one the best in Europe.\nSeveral avenues to explore\nQualitative studies (detailed analysis of 20 people’s travel over a 10-day period) and quantitative measurements (a survey filled in by 2,000 people from all over Switzerland) done by EPFL reveal that more than 80% of the population would be, under certain conditions, likely to use PostBus services or increase their usage. The researchers made several observations that could lead to targeted actions:\n •\tThere is a “threshold” of 12 return-trip journeys per day, below which PostBus service does not attract users;\n •\tGood coordination between bus and train schedules is crucial; an improvement in “feeder” services to the train stations is one of the population’s biggest expectations. An lack of coordination between schedules is one of the most serious shortcomings noted in certain PostBus lines, and it penalizes the entire public transport chain; \n •\tPublic transport users do not cover ground in the same way as those who drive private vehicles. The former tend to make “clusters” of routes around their centers of interest (activities), and the latter tend to weave “webs” of routes over large areas;\n •\tThe “holes” in the PostBus service in off-peak periods during the day or on weekends heavily penalize its success, because this doesn’t permit people to be spontaneous. Original solutions such as providing taxi or free bicycle service during these periods could be an inexpensive way to address the problem; \n •\tThe image that people have of the PostBus system is still heavily influenced by tradition: leisure activities, hikes in the mountains, etc. Many of those who don’t use the PostBus are not aware of all the existing services and tend to overestimate how long a trip will take. Information campaigns and communications efforts should thus be carried out to convince new users – particularly by integrating Publicar in the online SBB planning tool (www.sbb.ch). In addition, the difference in service in the German speaking regions (much more complete) and French-speaking regions of Switzerland has a measurable impact on the image that the local population has of the services that the PostBus provides.\nThe avenues for action suggested by EPFL at the end of the study were deliberately left quite broad. It is now up to PostBus to analyze them with regards to their efficiacy and profitability. “Our collaboration has been very fruitful,” says Grego Ochsenbein, innovation specialist with PostBus Switzerland. “It allowed us to better understand the mobility needs and patterns of our current and potential customers, as well as those who don’t use public transport at all.

{"id": 1572, "text": "When vertebrates run, their legs exhibit minimal contact with the ground. But insects are different. These six-legged creatures run fastest using a three-legged, or “tripod” gait where they have three legs on the ground at all times – two on one side of their body and one on the other. The tripod gait has long inspired engineers who design six-legged robots, but is it necessarily the fastest and most efficient way for bio-inspired robots to move on the ground?\nResearchers at EPFL and UNIL revealed that there is in fact a faster way for robots to locomote on flat ground, provided they don’t have the adhesive pads used by insects to climb walls and ceilings. This suggests designers of insect-inspired robots should make a break with the tripod-gait paradigm and instead consider other possibilities including a new locomotor strategy denoted as the “bipod” gait. The researchers’ findings are published in \nNature Communications\n.\nThe scientists carried out a host of computer simulations, tests on robots and experiments on \nDrosophila melanogaster\n – the most commonly studied insect in biology. “We wanted to determine why insects use a tripod gait and identify whether it is, indeed, the fastest way for six-legged animals and robots to walk,” said Pavan Ramdya, co-lead and corresponding author of the study. To test the various combinations, the researchers used an evolutionary-like algorithm to optimize the walking speed of a simulated insect model based on \nDrosophila\n. Step-by-step, this algorithm sifted through many different possible gaits, eliminating the slowest and shortlisting the fastest.\nAdhesive pads\n The findings shed new light on problems for biologists and robotics engineers alike. The researchers found that the common insect tripod gait did emerge when they optimized their insect model to climb vertical surfaces with adhesion on the tips of its legs. By contrast, simulations of ground-walking without the adhesiveness of insects’ legs revealed that bipod gaits, where only two legs are on the ground at any given time, are faster and more efficient – although in nature no insects actually walk this way. “Our findings support the idea that insects use a tripod gait to most effectively walk on surfaces in three dimensions, and because their legs have adhesive properties. This confirms a long-standing biological hypothesis,” said Ramdya. “Ground robots should therefore break free from only using the tripod gait”.\nPolymer boots\n The researchers then built a six-legged robot capable of employing either the tripod or bipod gait. The bipod gait was again demonstrated to be faster, corroborating the simulation algorithms’ results.\nFinally, the experimenters examined real insects. To see if leg adhesion might also play a role in the walking coordination of real flies, they put polymer drops on the flies’ legs to cover their claws and adhesive pads – as if the flies were wearing boots – and watched what happened. The flies quickly began to use bipod-like leg coordination similar to the one discovered in the simulation. “This result shows that, unlike most robots, animals can adapt to find new ways of walking under new circumstances,” said Robin Thandiackal, a co-lead author of the study. “There is a natural dialogue between robotics and biology: Many robot designers are inspired by nature and biologists can use robots to better understand the behavior of animal species. We believe that our work represents an important contribution to the study of animal and robotic locomotion.”\n-----\nSource:\n, \nNature Communications", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL and UNIL have discovered a faster and more efficient gait, never observed in nature, for six-legged robots walking on flat ground.

{"id": 1573, "text": "Hydraulics research in French-speaking Switzerland is turning 90 this year. It plays a strategic role in the country’s renewable-energy industry and has changed considerably since Alfred Stucky built the first hydraulics lab in 1928 at what was then the Lausanne School of Engineering – and now EPFL.\nTo mark this anniversary, EPFL’s Environmental Hydraulics Laboratory (LHE) and Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) will be holding a special event at the school’s SwissTech Convention Center on 8 March. And since that is also International Women’s Day, they asked six female Doctoral-School alumnae to be the guest speakers, discussing the state of hydraulics research in Switzerland and internationally. The event will also include videos by other key figures from both business and academia. \nLCH director Anton Schleiss is the event organizer. He has headed the lab for 21 years, and was the one who wanted to put the spotlight on women researchers. Schleiss is also the president of the International Commission on Large Dams and advocates academic research that is both practical and competitive on an international level. We spoke with him about this event and his view of the hydraulics industry.\nWhy did you choose female alumnae as the guests of honor for the commemoration?\nIt’s a message we wanted to send. In my experience, it’s very important for a research lab to include scientists from all over the world and have a good balance of men and women – especially if we want to bring in new ideas, create positive energy and instill respect among colleagues. Around a third of the 50-odd thesis projects that I have supervised were by women, which is a pretty good percentage in this field. The women who will speak on March 8 are active around the world and will share their experience with us.\nHow has your discipline evolved over the years?\nHydraulic energy expanded rapidly in Switzerland and internationally between 1928 and the 1970s. For instance, a number of dams and large hydroelectric plants were built in the Alps. Academic research at the time supported these large-scale projects by providing expert reports that aimed to tackle specific problems, such as by conducting experiments on scale models. Research – that is, with no direct link to a major infrastructure project – didn’t reach EPFL until 1972 when Professor Walter H. Graf joined the school. That research studied things like sediment transport in rivers, sand build-up in dam reservoirs and lake hydrodynamics.\nWhat changed in the 1980s?\nBefore, engineers used concrete to completely dam up rivers and canalize them. But when the Reuss river flooded in the Canton of Uri in 1987 – causing over CHF 1 billion in damage because the whole dike failed – we realized that a river will always return to its original course during a flood. That natural disaster triggered a paradigm shift because it showed us we need to pay more attention to rivers’ natural behavior. So engineers started thinking about how to improve existing dams and build better ones in the future, in order to better protect the environment.\nAnd how did this affect research at EPFL?\nWhen I got to the school in 1997, it wasn’t very well-known in Switzerland for providing expertise on river engineering projects carried out under this new paradigm. Contractors turned mostly to ETH Zurich, even in French-speaking Switzerland. So I helped bring this culture to EPFL and increase the number of publications by our researchers. That bolstered our reputation in the scientific community, not just in Switzerland but around the world. We also developed pioneering theories on subjects like the scouring of rocks by high-velocity jets downstream of dams, models to simulate and predict lake floods in the Alps, and walls to protect areas against floods. Our PhD alumni still use these theories, and many of them have set up their own engineering firms. Of course, the research we conduct at our lab changes in line with industry needs. For example, we developed floating retention dams to use in the case of an oil spill; for that we worked on the artificial beaches set up for the Swiss national exposition in 2002. We also studied the safety of reinforced shafts in high-head hydroelectric plants – that research was prompted by the shaft failure and tragic accident at Cleuson-Dixence, just above Nendaz, in 2000. We were also a pioneer in protecting fish in canalized rivers by creating refuges.\nHow has climate change influenced hydraulics research in the past few years?\nIt has given rise to a host of new research topics. River floods have become more frequent and it is now more important than ever to protect rivers’ natural courses. More recently, the melting of glaciers has become a particularly worrying development in Switzerland. As glaciers melt, they form lakes that carry down increasing amounts of moraine – which can accumulate upstream of dams. If a large chunk of a glacier melted into one of these lakes, that could potentially be very dangerous. So we need to continue studying such scenarios.\nHow have your researchers addressed these issues? \nWe formed cross-disciplinary research teams, which was crucial for identifying all aspects of a given project and thus avoid the objections that could cause delays. We introduced a new methodology called Synergie that aims to develop “multi-purpose engineering solutions.” By that we mean solutions that strike the right balance between generating the power that people need and preserving the natural environment. For example, at Riddes in the Canton of Valais, we suggested creating an artificial lake on the Rhone and building a hydroelectric plant. That would not only generate power, but also help protect against floods and eliminate drawdown in the river. What’s more, a lake would provide a thriving habitat for wildlife, a rest area for migrating birds and even a place to go kitesurfing since the region is very windy.\nDams are still controversial, even within the scientific community. What would you say to detractors? \nOne of the biggest challenges of the 21\nst\n century will be to make renewable energy – and, of course, water – available to everyone under the best possible conditions. Out of the around 60,000 large [over 15-meter-high] dams around the world, only a handful are really debatable. Hydropower still has enormous potential worldwide and could replace many of today’s coal-fired plants. But that’s only if we keep to the notion of “synergy” and don’t try to build the biggest and highest dams at any cost. I often say that we need to build better dams for a better world. And that’s a challenge for engineers and companies alike.\n“Hydraulic Laboratory in Civil Engineering, 1928–2018, 90 years of impact thinking,” 8 March 2018, 3pm–5pm, SwissTech Convention Center.

Emotions of joy, anxiety and surprise will be hidden behind the masks they – along with their teachers and other staff members – will be wearing. In view of the worrisome public-health situation, the School has decided to make masks mandatory at all times within EPFL buildings. This new academic year will therefore be cloaked in white, like the cloth face masks that EPFL will provide to both students and staff.\n“We wanted to do all we could to avoid another lockdown at EPFL where everything has to take place online. That was one of the big takeaways from the crisis this spring,” says Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education. That why he and the other members of EPFL’s management team decided to have just one-third of the students physically present on campus on any given day. They divided the student body into three groups and set up a rotating system whereby each group comes to EPFL and attends classes in person every third day. On the other days, students can stream lectures or watch them at their own pace, as all classes will be recorded.\n“All teaching was done remotely last semester and our faculty learned a great deal from the experience. Above all, they learned that online instruction has its limits, but can also be useful in many subject areas. The flipped classroom concept, for example, turns out to be an interesting way to teach,” says Vandergheynst. The rotating system for this new school year – which combines online and in-person instruction – reflects these assessments.\nMoreover, to encourage interaction between different fields, students involved in cross-disciplinary projects will be allowed to come and work on campus. New \n have been launched; these include a Horological Competition and plans to develop a space rover, a catalog of objects orbiting Earth, and a new type of camera that can measure body temperature. “For our students, being able to apply the theory they learn in class to hands-on projects is essential.

(Light Efficient SystemS). Transporting light through fiber-optics, as this newly created start-up wishes to do, permits the reduction of energy use by more than 30%.\nLaptop screens are composed of different filters for colors and of a source of white light situated in the lower portion of the frame. With LED, which is currently used, 60% of the light remains trapped inside these diodes and accounts for a significant loss in efficiency. The fiber optics developed by L.E.S.S. could bring just as much luminosity and contrast while conserving a quarter of the energy. “That liberated power could be used by the processor to gain speed,” adds the entrepreneur.\nThe fiber-optic resembles a simple wire of several microns in diameter, primarily composed of glass. Its secrete resides inside: a nanostructure permits the generation and guidance of white light to illuminate the screen in a uniform and efficient manner. But how does this system compare to organic light-emitting diodes (Oled), a new technology for flatscreens that doesn’t require a source of light? “The primary problem of this system is that the luminosity—and therefore the consumption—varies, depending on the color. Since the screen is primarily composed of white, itis illuminated at full tilt and therefore consumes three times more than a backlit LED system. But a laptop screen is permanently 70% white.” It’s also for this reason that this innovation is primarily directed toward computer screens, given that television requires a lower percentage of white as a result of its use for film viewing or TV shows—which are principally in color.\nThe technology developed by Yann Tissot and his colleague, Simon Rivier, opens the road to diverse applications. Initially it will be used to light elements under a microscope and could be in our computers four or five years from now. Given that fiber-optics permit the illumination of a surface both large and small; other applications are also being developed, notably for precision instruments in the fields of medicine and industry.", "summary": "A single fiber-optic can light up computer screens.

Scientists can already assess this tiny organism’s morphology and genetic makeup, but there is currently no way to determine its internal chemistry. Yet obtaining this data would make it easier to more accurately predict the likelihood of healthy development. EPFL spin-off Annaida has developed EmbryoSpin, a new sensor that allows hospitals and clinicians to predict the viability of an embryo and produces results in just one hour. The company has recently completed its first fundraising round, securing one million Swiss francs to hire new staff and test the safety and efficacy of its technology before proceeding to clinical trials.\nA smart chip for fertility\nConventional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems are incapable of producing valid results for organisms as small as a grain of sand. Although some specialized devices are available, they’re not widespread because they are too complicated to use, too expensive and not yet sensitive enough. Several research groups around the world are currently tackling these issues. Solving these problems would give scientists unprecedented insights into the internal chemistry of microscopic entities, such as embryos and organoids – miniaturized organs that are increasingly used in pharmaceutical research. “The new sensor developed at EPFL’s Microsystems Laboratory (LMIS1), combines ease of use with unprecedented performance at microscopic scales, enabling previously impossible applications”, says Gora Conley, cofounder of Annaida. The scaled-down device can observe samples 50 times smaller than conventional systems – including human embryos in the very earliest stages of development.\nNMR harnesses the intrinsic properties of the nuclei of certain atoms in the presence of a strong magnetic field. These nuclei absorb electromagnetic waves then release the absorbed energy at a specific frequency, which differs according to the type of atom and the chemical environment inside the molecule. Using a receiver to capture this signal allows scientists to determine the internal chemistry of the sample. The new technology developed at the School of Engineering de l'EPFL uses purpose-built 3D-printed microfluidic structures to guide and contain samples smaller than a nanoliter. The structure is combined with a microchip, similar to those found in smartphones, which contains all the needed electronics. The whole system is just one millimeter across.\n“In preliminary trials, we demonstrated that our technology is sensitive enough to detect the chemical composition of tiny organisms,” says Annaida co-founder Marco Grisi, whose PhD thesis served as the groundwork for the technology. “More recently, we tested the system on embryoids obtained from mouse stem cells to see just how powerful it was. The sensor was able to detect viable signals showing the presence of lipids and metabolites, producing results in less than three hours.” The next step is to determine which chemical markers are predictors of healthy embryo development.\n“EmbryoSpin is a commercially viable, robust and easy-to-use device,” says Gora Conley . “We are now working to develop a system compatible with the typical workflow of a busy fertility clinic.”", "summary": "EPFL spin-off Annaida is developing a magnetic resonance system that can detect the chemistry inside the tiniest living organisms.

{"id": 1608, "text": "The molecule developed by Cellestia Biotech, an EPFL spin-off, is a targeted therapy designed to treat cancers resulting from a mutation of the Notch gene. Clinical trials are scheduled to start soon in Spain. This oral treatment is the first to work by stopping the problem at its roots, i.e., in the cell's nucleus. It inhibits the protein complex – which allow cancerous cells to multiply – so that they cannot generate signals.\nOne of the alternatives to chemotherapy currently being investigated by experts is the array of signals generated by proteins in a cell’s nucleus. A normal Notch protein plays an indispensable role in embryonic development and in the formation and maintenance of stem cells. Genetic lesions, however, can result in an abnormal signaling pathway that facilitates the development of cancerous cells and causes resistance to conventional therapies. This vicious signaling pathway has been the subject of several recent studies that have confirmed its link to breast cancer, leukemia and several types of lymphoma. Around 250,000 patients worldwide are diagnosed each year with a cancer related to this type of genetic lesion.\nBinding with the protein to keep it quiet \nThe safest way to block the signaling pathway is to cut it off at the source, preventing the protein from activating signals in the nucleus. Molecule CB-103, discovered by Rajwinder Lehal during his doctoral studies in Freddy Radtke's laboratory at EPFL, binds with the protein complex and inhibits its activity inside the nucleus. This cuts off all Notch signals regardless of how they are activated, thereby killing off the cancerous cells. Other therapies that target the Notch signaling pathway have also been investigated by research groups, but their effects remain peripheral – some block only part of the pathway while others inhibit different mechanisms involved in other cellular processes.\nPatents have been filed for the molecule and for the development and marketing of several similar molecules. Both in-vitro and in-vivo tests carried out on the molecule showed excellent efficacy and tolerance.

{"id": 1614, "text": "As part of the  program, master’s students from fields across EPFL, along with students from the University of Lausanne () and research assistants from the , travelled to India over the school holidays in February. They brought their diverse backgrounds and skills to bear on practical, social, and technological challenges at two schools located in migrant camps just outside of Bangalore.\nIn this unique program, however, the prototyped solutions are just one outcome: the other is the valuable learning process that goes into creating them. “We like to say that a prototype is not a product, but a process,” summarizes academic coordinator Marc Laperrouza, a researcher and lecturer in the EPFL  (CDH).\nThe one-room schools, set up by INSSINC partner the , can accommodate up to 60 students of all ages. Space, time, and resources are often in short supply. To ensure that solutions were applicable beyond the context in which they were developed, the three groups of students from Switzerland each tested their prototypes at both schools.\nA new measure of innovation\nDana Ghosn (Mechanical Engineering) addressed the problem of crowding in her project with Jean-André Davy-Guidicelli (Environmental Sciences and Engineering). They reimagined the schools’ open spaces using modular activity boards that doubled as light partitions. The boards – which can support magnets or chalkboards – help to reduce disturbances, while encouraging students to complete educational activities autonomously.\n“The major takeaway from this program for me is the understanding that innovation is much more about positive social impact than profitability,” Ghosn says. “I used to think of innovation in terms of market viability, without realizing that by thinking like that, you focus on people who can afford innovation, thus restricting it to a certain social class. Having learned how to bring together a positive social perspective and professional ambitions is truly special to me.”\nMeanwhile, Valentine Calame (EPFL + ECAL Lab) and Amara Slaymaker (Energy Science and Technology) aimed to optimize the work of the teachers, who spend a lot of time record-keeping using pen and paper. The students noticed that while the teachers did not have access to computers, most did have smartphones, and so they prototyped an easy-to-use, custom app to help take care of administrative tasks.\nFinally, Iscia Vos (Physical Engineering) worked with Patricia Cavestany (Mechanical Engineering) and Romain Talou (EPFL + ECAL Lab) to develop a mobile, modular and washable display panel that could be used to present different types of student projects in different settings. However, practicality was only one driver of the students’ design.\n“We realized that showcasing the students’ work would increase their self-esteem, as well as their parents’ acceptance of the school and teacher, which in turn would have an impact on the community’s perception of education,” Talou explains.\nA “convergence of solutions”\nINSSINC design coordinator Marius Aeberli, who led the 2020 edition, says that this year the final prototypes are the result of “a convergence of solutions”, having been selected from several initial concepts based on the results of field tests.\nThe program organizers are now working to ensure that this unique iterative design process can be applied to other student programs in the future, notably through EPFL’s Digital Resources for Instruction and Learning () program.\n“The INSSINC human-centered design process is invaluable for the development and refinement of social innovation, as it facilitates new streams of thought and techniques to be integrated into very complex and deeply embedded social challenges,” says Hilda Liswani, Business Development Manager at INSSINC partner .\nAbout INSSINC\n INSSINC is a collaboration with a local partner in India, the , which works to bring sustainable energy solutions to under-served communities.

{"id": 1615, "text": "Petroleum derivatives are used to make all sorts of goods: plastics, textiles, smartphones, furniture, and flavorings – like vanillin – not to mention cosmetics, detergents and pharmaceuticals. “Everyone knows that releasing massive amounts of fossil carbons into the air is a major contributor to global warming. However, most people don't realize how dependent we are on fossil fuels and how urgently we need to put an end to \nall\n these emissions,” says Rémy Buser, CEO of Bloom Biorenewables, an EPFL spin-off.\nGuided by this belief and a determination to cut carbon emissions, Buser, along with the company’s co-founder and COO Florent Héroguel and their team are working hard to rapidly market a technology originally developed at EPFL. Their discovery would let manufacturers use renewable carbon from biomass as a substitute for petroleum, particularly for making packaging plastics, perfume and marine biofuels. The €3.9 million in capital the company recently raised provides key resources for business development and serves as a sign of recognition from industry professionals around the world. The fund-raising round was led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures-Europe (BEV-E), a new European fund launched by a consortium including Bill Gates. BEV-E supports start-ups that are “visionary, bold and focused on a global carbon-reduction strategy.”\nAlthough alternatives to using petroleum as an energy source are coming to the fore, there are currently no cost-effective, non-fossil carbon sources to replace it in manufactured products. Manufacturers not wanting to rely on fossil fuels are faced with two possible solutions: use the carbon found in atmospheric CO\n2\n – though difficult to capture in its dispersed form – or extract carbon from biomass. At present, only cellulose, which accounts for about 40% of biomass’ total weight, can be recovered; it is extracted in the form of fiber, which can be used to make paper, for example, or refined into bioethanol. The rest is either burned or discarded. Bloom Biorenewables' technology allows biomass' other components, namely lignin and hemicellulose, to be recovered intact. Potential applications are wide-ranging, and would let manufacturers use nearly 75% of this environment-friendly resource.\nUsing bioplastics to replace polypropylene\nLignin and hemicellulose are polymers found in rigid plant cell walls. Together, they account for some 30%–40% of a plant's biomass. Lignin's energy density is 30% higher than that of cellulose. Until now, one of the stumbling blocks in using it has been its troublesome tendency to break down during processing. In 2016, researchers at EPFL's Laboratory of Sustainable and Catalytic Processing (LPDC) developed a method that resolves this problem by adding an aldehyde. “Aldehydes – which can be produced easily, inexpensively and in an environmentally-friendly manner – stabilize the lignin and hemicellulose and keep them from disintegrating,” says Héroguel. The two components can thus be extracted (and used) separately.\nHemicellulose in particular can be used to manufacture various types of bioplastics, including packaging materials to replace polypropylene. “One of the aims of the Circular Economy Action Plan – an EU roadmap for achieving climate neutrality by 2050 – is to make sustainable packaging and other plastic products mandatory and increase producer responsibility,” says Buser. Large companies, especially food producers, have already started down this road. And the market for sustainable carbon-based materials is just as huge as the one for their fossil-fuel counterparts. “Take textiles, for example. Cotton production alone cannot meet demand.” Thanks to “green chemistry” processes, which seek to eliminate the use of environmentally-harmful substances, lignin can be used as a raw material in perfume and flavorings.\nSustainable, circular products\n“With our technology, manufacturers can produce sustainable, circular products,” says Héroguel. The advantage of “green” carbon is that it fits into the earth's natural cycle and prevents the imbalances caused by extracting the carbon that has been buried for tens of millions of years – and which is largely responsible for global warming.\nThe €3.9 million in funding will allow Bloom Biorenewables to hire additional staff and set up its own R&D center near Lausanne, where it can ramp up production in order to win manufacturers over to its new raw material.", "summary": "Thanks to technology developed by start-up Bloom Biorenewables, plant materials can be used as an alternative to petroleum derivatives for producing a wide range of products, including bioplastics, textiles, cosmetics and even perfume.

{"id": 1630, "text": "A drone makes large circles in the sky. With two powerful antennas, it sniffs the data packets emitted by mobile phones. On the ground, an interface developed specifically for this project makes it possible to track the flight of a small robotic aircraft in real time from a computer. Colored dots visible on the screen map indicate the spotted phones. The vehicle tightens its flight around the selected device to indicate its position. “In the best tests we have performed, the place indicated was within 10 meters,” says Jonathan Cheseaux, who worked on this project with Karol Kruzelecki and Stefano Rosati under the supervision of Bixio Rimoldi, head of the Mobile Communications Laboratory.\nFollowing an earthquake or another natural disaster, it is often difficult to know the position of victims under the rubble. At a time when most people, even in poor countries, have a mobile phone, the team of Mobile Communications Laboratory had the idea of using them to know the position of victims and thereby facilitate a search. When WiFi mode is activated, the devices emit data packets at regular intervals so that it’s possible to know various parameters, including the power received by the antenna connection. This can vary depending on the surrounding terrain, the weather or interference. It is also weaker as the layer of rubble over a person is thicker—another important factor.\nBut there is little similarity between these signals and a distance in meters that would make it possible to know directly the position of the device. With the drone, it is the GPS points of the captured signals from several places that locate the phone. These benchmarks are considered the center of circles which could potentially find the phone. The intersection of the latter determines the location of the phone and, therefore, probably the person. “By refining the system to automatically eliminate weaker signals, the system has become even more accurate,” explains the master’s student. “Flight tests have located a cell phone on campus with high accuracy.”\n“The drone’s WiFi antenna could be replaced by Avalanche Victim Detectors (DVA) which would enable the rapid and inexpensive deployment of the first avalanche searches,” predicts the student, who is also an amateur mountaineer.\nIn the second part of his work, Jonathan Cheseaux also noted the challenge of connecting to the WiFi network of a device through the drone – without human intervention. An antenna on the plane permits the device to guess the identity of the router that connects the phone and then pretends to be it. It can thereby establish communication. “In the case of natural disasters mentioned above, it would provide a substitution network when connections have been destroyed,” he says. But for now, this system only works if the network is open and not password protected. This work has also helped highlight issues of confidentiality and the protection of private data. Recovering the names of registered WiFi (SSID) by a smartphone is done to establish the habits of owners. For example, it may have a list of “EPFL,” “Fitness,” “Café-so,” “House,” et cetera. The MAC address, a unique identifier, can also be recovered by the drones. It identifies the device brand and deconstructs statistics on the distribution of smartphone / router / printer brands.\nJonathan worked at one aspect of a much larger project called SMAVNET II.", "summary": "Summer series – student research (1): During his semester project in Communication Systems, Jonathan Cheseaux developed a system for locating a person via his or her mobile phone with a drone.

While the use of electric vehicles for personal transportation could help lower that number, reducing emissions from commercial transport – such as trucks or buses – is a much greater challenge.\nResearchers at EPFL have now come up with a novel solution: capturing CO\n2\n directly in the trucks’ exhaust system and liquefying it in a box on the vehicle’s roof. The liquid CO\n2\n is then delivered to a service station, where it is turned into conventional fuel using renewable energy. The project is being coordinated by the  group, led by François Maréchal, at EPFL’s School of Engineering. The patented concept is the subject of a paper published in .\nA complex process onboard the vehicle\nScientists propose to combine several technologies developed at EPFL to capture CO\n2\n and convert it from a gas to a liquid in a process that recovers most of energy available onboard, such as heat from the engine. In their study, the scientists used the example of a delivery truck.\n Credit: François Maréchal / EPFL\nFirst, the vehicle’s flue gases in the exhaust pipe are cooled down and the water is separated from the gases. CO\n2 \nis isolated from the other gases (nitrogen and oxygen) with a temperature swing adsorption system, using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) adsorbent, which are specially designed to absorb CO\n2\n. Those materials are being developed by the Energypolis team at EPFL Valais Wallis, led by Wendy Queen. Once the material is saturated with CO\n2\n, it is heated so that pure CO\n2 \ncan be extracted from it. High speed turbocompressors developed by Jürg Schiffmann’s  at EPFL’s Neuchâtel campus use heat from the vehicle’s engine to compress the extracted CO\n2\n and turn it into a liquid. That liquid is stored in a tank and can then be converted back into conventional fuel at the service stations using renewable electricity. “The truck simply deposits the liquid when filling up with fuel,” says Maréchal.\nThe whole process takes place within a capsule measuring 2 m x 0.9 m x 1.2 m, placed above the driver’s cabin. “The weight of the capsule and the tank is only 7% of the vehicle’s payload,” adds Maréchal. “The process itself uses little energy, because all of its stages have been optimized.”\nThe researchers’ calculations show that a truck using 1 kg of conventional fuel could produce 3kg of liquid CO\n2\n, and that the conversion does not involve any energy penalty.\nOnly 10% of the CO\n2\n emissions cannot be recycled, and the researchers propose to offset that using biomass.\nThe system could theoretically work with all trucks, buses and even boats, and with any type of fuel. The advantage of this system is that, unlike electric or hydrogen-based ones, it can be retrofitted to existing trucks in order to neutralize their impact in terms of carbon emissions.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have patented a new concept that could cut trucks’ CO\n2\n emissions by almost 90%.

One important aspect of the movement is the realization that the digital revolution impacts academia as much as the rest of society and requires changes in the way research is conducted and shared. New tools and best practices in data management and research documentation need to be explored with the aim to make results more robust, reproducible, accessible and reusable.\nOne of the missions of EPFL is to perform world-class research and disseminate the discoveries and technologies as broadly as possible to maximize their impact on the work of others, and on society at large. It is therefore important that everyone on campus continuously experiments in the way they produce and share research outputs of all possible forms: scholarly publications, data files of all kinds, the associated metadata, software and hardware, experimental setups, methods and instruments, etc.\nOpen science at EPFL: a new web page and upcoming events\nThe  is one example of the concrete steps taken by the Direction to explore the potential and challenges of open science.

The collection of such open software libraries and benchmarks developed by the  for the field of logic synthesis has received positive feedback from both academia and industry. But open is not enough. This project will focus on building up an active community to sustain the tools and promote their adoption in the research community.\nEvaluating the Quality of Science News Articles\n – In an age of fake news and mistrust towards experts, weeding out misreporting of scientific studies is important. The  will develop SciLens, a platform that automatically generates indicators using weakly supervised learning, effectively helping non-experts to evaluate more accurately the quality of a science news article.\nOpen Software Services for Education and Research\n – This joint project between  and  (CECAM) will build an open and collaborative online hub to host existing simulation and data-analysis tools, effectively creating an open science environment offering software tools as easy-to-use services, with minimal-to-zero setup time.\nBroadening the Scope of an Existing ELN\n – Choosing a laboratory information management system (LIMS) or an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) can be difficult. The many options available all have their pros and cons, and are not all suited for all research disciplines. Building on an existing open source tool, this project led by the  will develop a web solution adapted to the needs of the physical sciences, allowing users to adopt important open science best practices.\nOpen Science Using Proprietary Data\n – “I want to make my research open, but the data I use was obtained from a commercial data provider.” The apparent paradox between maintaining property rights AND facilitating replication and verification by others is not insoluble. To address this problem, a team at the  will develop an encryption method to facilitate replication studies from proprietary datasets.\nOpen Hardware workshops\n – The web plays a major role in the adoption of open science best practice.

This year, Switzerland participated for the first time with encouragement from the Federal  program and from EPFL Professor Jürgen Brugger, head of the Microsystems Laboratory, who organized a national selection competition last March. \n The condition for participating in the contest: design an original application using sensors that will “wow” a jury of experts. Mission accomplished for the team made up of Yujia Zhai, David Bonzon and Christian Adamczyk. Their project, entitled “Sensing the world through iPhone/Smartphone” won them third place in the contest and $1,000.\niPhone and social networks\n Presented in poster format at the China Science and Technology Museum, then in an 8-minute closed-door presentation to the jury, the project was convincing. The idea: gather atmospheric data using an iPhone, then send them over social networks, in order to build a sort of “environmental data map” that is continuously being updated.\n The students designed an interface – a simple electronic circuit – for connecting an iPhone to a humidity sensor\nA wonderful experience\n Project leader for iCAN Switzerland, Professor Jürgen Brugger can’t hide his pride. “I’m really happy about the commitment of both teams. The competition was extremely fierce. The third prize of one of the Swiss teams is outstanding achievement.” As for the EPFL students who participated, this scientific expedition to the Chinese capital will continue to be a source of motivation. “It was a fantastic opportunity to meet teams from all over the world,” says Ludovic.

Another car passes the vehicle in front of it, after the driver pushes the appropriate button. A truck recognizes a traffic jam and automatically slows down. All of these highly automated driving features have been developed through the collaboration of the European automotive industry and scientific community, with an eye toward making driving safer, more environmentally-friendly and more comfortable. The developments will be presented today and tomorrow at the Final Event of the EU funded research project HAVEit (“Highly automated vehicles for intelligent transport”) in Borås (Sweden) and at the nearby Hällered Volvo test track. Seven demonstration vehicles will be on display. With Volvo, EPFL has developed a color camera designed to recognize traffic light signals up to 130 meters away.\nCollaboration of different partners\n 17 partners from the European automotive industry, including Continental, Volvo Group, Volkswagen, the German Aerospace Center (DLR), as well as EPFL, have worked together to develop vehicle concepts and technologies through this project. Aside from networking technical innovations from research and science, HAVEit also aimed to secure the top spot in the international automotive industry for Europe and to tie together research and development resources.\nA Hybrid Bus—Active Green Driving Technology\n EPFL technology is integrated into one of the seven vehicles that have been developed—a hybrid bus that uses Active Green Driving Technology that takes hybrid technology, a combination electric and gasoline vehicules, to a new level. Hybrid vehicle technology can go much further in improving energy efficiency by making the switch between electric driven and gas driven modes to store brake energy created when going downhill automatic, for example. Automatically switching between these sources with high efficiency due to advanced information gathered from various sensors is called hybrid driveline control. Beyond the purely automatic control, the driver learns to interpret these data and drive more appropriately – he or she is even given feedback during and at the end of each trip.\nOne key aspect of hybrid driveline control is the detection of stop lights at a considerable distance ahead. The color camera mounted on the front of the bus recognizes red lights that are 5 to 60 meters away (working range) and could detect up to about 130 meters. The camera, developed at, transmits this information to an onboard computer that fuses data about the vehicle's surroundings from several sources. The camera needs to be rugged and withstand freezing temperatures in the coldest streets of Europe and around the world. Automobile compliable, modular and low-cost, it uses algorithms to dependably recognize red lights among the multitude of information captured. These algorithms make corrections for the relatively low quality images that are a result of automobile regulations for such devices.

{"id": 1659, "text": "In the race to miniaturize electronic components, researchers are challenged with a major problem: the smaller or the faster your device, the more challenging it is to cool it down. One solution to improve the cooling is to use materials with very high thermal conductivity, such as graphene, to quickly dissipate heat and thereby cool down the circuits.\nAt the moment, however, potential applications are facing a fundamental problem: how does heat propagate inside these sheets of materials that are no more than a few atoms thick?\nIn a study published in Nature Communications, a team of EPFL researchers has shed new light on the mechanisms of thermal conductivity in graphene and other two-dimensional materials. They have demonstrated that heat propagates in the form of a wave, just like sound in air. This was up to now a very obscure phenomenon observed in few cases at temperatures close to the absolute zero.Their simulations provide a valuable tool for researchers studying graphene, whether to cool down circuits at the nanoscale, or to replace silicon in tomorrow's electronics.\nQuasi-Lossless Propagation\n If it has been difficult so far to understand the propagation of heat in two-dimensional materials, it is because these sheets behave in unexpected ways compared to their three-dimensional cousins. In fact, they are capable of transferring heat with extremely limited losses, even at room temperature.\nGenerally, heat propagates in a material through the vibration of atoms. These vibrations are are called \"phonons\", and as heat propagates though a three-dimensional material, these phonons keep colliding with each other, merging together, or splitting. All these processes can limit the conductivity of heat along the way. Only under extreme conditions, when temperature goes close to the absolute zero ( -200°C or lower), it is possible to observe quasi-lossless heat transfer.\n A wave of quantum heat\n The situation is very different in two dimensional materials, as shown by researchers at EPFL. Their work demonstrates that heat can propagate without significant losses in 2D even at room temperature, thanks to the phenomenon of wave-like diffusion, called \"second sound\". In that case, all phonons march together in unison over very long distances. \"Our simulations, based on first-principles physics, have shown that atomically thin sheets of materials behave, even at room temperature, in the same way as three-dimensional materials at extremely low temperatures\" says Andrea Cepellotti, the first author of the study. \"We can show that the thermal transport is described by waves, not only in graphene but also in other materials that have not been studied yet,\" explains Cepellotti. \"This is an extremely valuable information for engineers, who could adapt the design of future electronic components using some of these novel two-dimensional materials properties.\"", "summary": "EPFL researchers have shed new light on the fundamental mechanisms of heat dissipation in graphene and other two-dimensional materials.

Not only did last year’s EPFLoop team put in a hugely successful showing, but this year’s team invested a lot of time and energy in a design that would make it through the qualification round. However, the effort paid off – the team was one of the 20-odd entrants selected to compete in the 2019 Hyperloop Pod Competition, beating out thousands of other hopefuls. “Even though we’ve already spent hundreds of hours putting together our team, designing our pod and finding sponsors, the real work is only just beginning,” says Lorenzo Benedetti, the EPFLoop team’s technical leader.\nThe idea for the Hyperloop Pod Competition came from Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who wanted to promote a fifth kind of transportation – in addition to cars, trains, planes and boats – whereby passengers travel in pods propelled through vacuum tubes called Hyperloops at speeds of up to 1,000 km/h. His company SpaceX launched the Competition in 2015 to test the technical feasibility of his idea. Student teams have to design a self-propelled pod that can travel through a 1.2 km-long Hyperloop test track at maximum speed with successful deceleration.\n“Being part of a competition so difficult, where the level of engineering is so high, is an invaluable experience. Last year the team learned how to work with SpaceX engineers, discuss technical specifications and solutions, and implement those solutions within a 24–48-hour timeframe. This year we have a better grasp of what the competition organizers expect and are better poised to meet their requirements, starting with the testing phase at EPFL,” says Benedetti. This year’s competition will take place mid-July 2019 on the test track at SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, like last year.\nLighter and more powerful \nThe EPFLoop team has unveiled the name of its pod: \nBella Lui\n. But the team members are understandably keeping the design and technical details under wraps. Benedetti has nonetheless given us clues about the team’s strategy: “The most important metric for a winning pod is a high power-to-weight ratio. The top three teams last year (from TUM, Delft and EPFL) had pods with very similar ratios, and they all performed nearly equally in the finals. This year we will aim to reduce the weight as much as possible while increasing the power available for the propulsion system.”\nSupported by the EPFL Vice-Presidency for Education in the context of interdisciplinary projects, the EPFLoop team currently has 38 members including 33 EPFL students from seven sections. They are being supervised by Professor Mario Paolone, Lorenzo Benedetti and André Hodder. Over 20% of the team members are women. The team is being supported by EPFL’s Senior Management; its three main sponsors are EPFL, the Association of Crans-Montana Municipalities (ACCM) and Bobst, with additional backing from Comsol, Brusa, National Instruments, Forum EPFL, Leclanché and ALLITE.\nLast year's fabulous adventure", "summary": "The EPFLoop team – which took home third place in last year’s Hyperloop Pod Competition – has been selected to compete again, making it one of around 20 short-listed teams that will head to California this summer.", "claim": "The EPFLoop team – which took home third place in last year’s Hyperloop Pod Competition – has been selected to compete again, making it one of 33 short-listed teams that will head to California this summer.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [28, 28], "noise": false}

{"id": 1663, "text": "The newest development in the area of smarthome products may be the server-heater. As they churn through terabytes of data, these machines can give off enough heat to maintain a comfortable temperature in your living room. Around 40% of the electricity used at data centers goes towards cooling the servers. Could this heat be put to good use? Karim Ziadé chose this topic for his Bachelor’s project, venturing into essentially unexplored scientific territory. In terms of energy savings, Switzerland could stop importing energy in winter under one of the scenarios analyzed. In economic terms, on the other hand, this approach will require further analysis.\nLet’s look at some numbers. Data centers in Switzerland consume 1.1 TWh, or 2% of the country’s electricity consumption. At the same time, the energy required for home heating and hot water heaters amounts to some 5.7 TWh, 80% of which is covered by imported energy in the winter. The logical solution is to put these data centers into residential areas around the country in order to make good use of their heat – and reduce our foreign energy dependency.\nOf course, the energy requirement for heating purposes is five times greater than the heat generated by data centers. But with electricity consumption at data centers doubling every five years, the tipping point should be reached in a dozen years. That led Ziadé to come up with two scenarios: the present and the future, when electricity consumption at data centers will exceed the amount used for heating purposes.\nThere are a number of constraints to be reckoned with. For reasons of data security, companies will not agree to move their servers off-site; for reasons of bandwidth, the servers will have to be located in regions equipped with optical fiber, which only five cities in Switzerland have at this point; and for practical purposes, the data centers run throughout the year yet their heat is not needed in the summer. But Ziadé focused his Bachelor’s project at the Energy Center on macroeconomic considerations. Ziadé makes clear from the start: “This is just a simplified preliminary estimate meant to determine whether or not this could be feasible in Switzerland.”\nHeating only half the year\nThe rough calculations show that Switzerland could already reduce its electricity imports in the winter by over 10% today. And in the future scenario, we could achieve 100% energy independence. This solution is thus feasible, at least in terms of energy capture. But the economic analysis is less convincing. Ziadé estimates that servers used as heaters will cost companies three times more than those used in their data centers. And they will have to be replaced every three years, which means high installation costs.\nUnder the current-day scenario, the server-heater would have to be on for nearly 4,000 hours per year to be worthwhile. Yet heating is only needed for around 2,000 hours per year (out of a total of 8,700 hours in a year). The calculations are also subject to a major variable: the price of electricity. But we know that prices will rise, and that we will have to reduce our electricity use. In addition, the operating cost of data centers tends to increase relative to the acquisition price.\nZiadé concluded that the feasibility of server-heaters will require more complex calculations that take more parameters into account.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES on Student Projects (1) – For his Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Karim Ziadé assessed the feasibility of putting data centers into residential buildings for heating purposes.", "claim": "SUMMER SERIES on Student Projects (three) – For his Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Karim Ziadé assessed the feasibility of putting data centers into residential buildings for heating purposes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [6, 6], "noise": false}
{"id": 1668, "text": "In 30 years, traffic has more than tripled on most Swiss highways. On the A1, it even increased from 20’000 to nearly 90’000 vehicles per day, between Lausanne and Geneva. The consequences are translated into daily kilometers of traffic jams and delays. One of the strategies put forward to remedy this situation is to regulate the freeway access with a system of traffic lights at the ramps: ramp metering. Researchers at the Urban Transport Systems Laboratory (LUTS) propose to combine this measure with speed limits on some freeway sections. Simulations conducted on portions of the A1 between Lausanne and Geneva corroborate the relevance of this overall strategy.\n Ramp metering has existed for over half a century and is widely used, often successfully, in Germany, the US or Australia. But Switzerland is not a country like the others: the access roads to the freeways are very short and often connected to the limits of the urban centers. In this context, slowing the access to the highway may spread the congestion to the urban network.\n That is why the LUTS’ team, led by Nikolas Geroliminis, decided to combine this system with variable speed limits on the freeways. The objective of this research, conducted in collaboration with the Federal Roads Office (Office fédéral des routes) and coordinated by EPFL Transportation Center, was to assess the effectiveness of combining both measures. \nSensors were installed on the A1 freeway from Lausanne to Geneva and on three ramps (access and exit): Gland, Nyon and Coppet. The data were supplemented by manual counts, detectors from variable speed limit system and video sequences at the access ramps of Coppet and Nyon.\nEqual treatment for all \n After tidying and sorting the data, the researchers developed a traffic control zone-based algorithm in which variable speed limits are considered. The idea was to treat in an equitable way existing freeway users, those wishing to enter it and those aiming for the secondary network.\n The difficulty of the exercise lied in constructing the algorithm in order to maintain the density levels on all ramps below the congestion thresholds and preventing the onset of low speeds on the highway. When it is not possible to maintain the lanes below the congestion threshold, the algorithm seeks to delay as much as possible exceeding such threshold. In order to do this, it uses the “storage” capacity still available on the ramps near the location of the bottleneck.\n30% less delays on the freeway\n And it works! The researchers tested the algorithm on a micro-simulation model for the studied A1 stretch. It managed to slow the onset of congestion, to speed up the return to normality after traffic jam occurrences and to improve overall performance on the freeway and on access and exit ramps. With this control strategy, the total delays on the highway decreased by about 30% and were reduced by approximately 12% across the entire network. Finally, the effects on the users not using the freeway were low. \"This suggests that this new strategy is very effective since it reduces not only ramp delay, but also total system delay without penalizing non-freeway users\" says the study. And it concludes that \"the proposed strategy, conducted in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, substantially reduces ramp queues compared with local ramp metering strategies.\"\n A field test would allow to better understand the potential of such a strategy for Swiss freeways.", "summary": "EPFL researchers showed that by managing the access to freeway junctions and moderating the speed limit on the express lanes it is possible to reduce delays by over 12% across the highway system.", "claim": "EPFL researchers showed that by managing the access to freeway junctions and moderating the speed limit on the express lanes it is possible to reduce delays by 30% across the highway system.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [27, 28], "noise": false}

{"id": 1671, "text": "A new material has the potential to improve the sensitivity of photographic image sensors by a factor of five. In 2011, an EPFL team led by Andras Kis discovered the amazing semi-conducting properties of molybdenite (MoS2), and they have been exploring its potential in various technological applications ever since. This promising candidate for replacing silicon has now been integrated in a prototype of an image sensor. This sensor, described in an , has five times the light sensitivity of current technology.\n All digital cameras work according to the same principle: they convert light into an electric charge. The camera has a light sensor, whose surface is a semi-conducting material that is divided into millions of cells, or pixels. The semi-conducting material on each cell reacts to the incoming light by generating a specific electrical charge, which is then transferred to the camera’s firmware for processing. The efficiency of this process depends on the quantity of light that is needed to trigger the charge transfer. \nThe all-time pixel record\nThe objective of the EPFL researchers was to demonstrate molybdenite’s potential in image sensors. For this reason, their sensor only has a single pixel. But it needs five times less light to trigger a charge transfer than the silicon-based sensors that are currently available. “Our main goal is to prove that MoS2 is an ideal candidate for this kind of application,” explains Kis. \n This level of sensitivity would open up the huge area of low-light or night photography, without resorting to “noise”-generating amplification techniques, slowing down the shutter speed or using a flash. For some specialized domains in which light conditions are often not optimal, such as astrophotography or biological imaging, the advantage is even more obvious. “It would make it possible to take photographs using only starlight,” says Kis.\nA revolutionary material\nMolybdenite’s extraordinary properties make this performance possible. Like the silicon used in currently available sensors, molybdenite requires an electric current, which comes from the battery. To generate a pixel, the charge generated by the light energy must be greater than the threshold current from the battery. \n A single-atom layer of molybdenite requires only a very small electric charge to function. Because of this, it takes much less light energy to reach the threshold needed to generate a pixel. \n MoS2 is a naturally abundant, inexpensive material. In addition, Kis explains, the prototype doesn’t require any other semi-conductors, which should greatly simplify manufacturing processes. Kis, who is a pioneer in research on the semi-conductivity of molybdenite, recently demonstrated its potential in an integrated circuit and, in early 2013, a flash memory prototoype. With this new step into imaging, molybdenite shows its extraordinary potential in another important area of application.", "summary": "An EPFL team has built a prototype for an image sensor based on the semi-conducting properties of molybdenite.

{"id": 1675, "text": "Impresso is a new professional networking app designed to help people establish business contacts. Now available on Google Play and the App Store, it is modeled after both LinkedIn and Tinder, although with a few key differences. “Our app has no messaging service, no ‘swiping’ and no spam,” says Ben Beh, the founder of Impresso Labs. “We wanted to build a platform where users – all of whom have been verified – can set up face-to-face professional meetings.”\nOnce users register on the app, they can search other user profiles and send contact requests to specific individuals. A geolocation feature limits searches to people in the same area. Users who send a contact request must state what they are looking for – a partner for a specific project, a job opportunity or professional advice, for example. The other person can then accept or refuse the invitation. If they accept, the app reveals the phone number of each user. “It’s like when people exchange business cards,” says Beh. “Our app communicates contact information, and that’s all. It’s up to the users to call each other and set up a face-to-face meeting if they want.”\nUsers who accept requests receive credits in the form of XIMs, which are electronic coins used primarily in video games. For each accepted request, they receive credits roughly equal to the price of a cup of coffee. The company plans to eventually incorporate blockchain technology into its app whereby the XIMs will be converted into a cryptocurrency.\nOnly verified users and CVs\nThe app’s main advantage is that it’s designed to ensure all users are real people and not internet bots; they must provide a portrait photo and a copy of their ID when they register. This policy helps build trust in the app. “I have hundreds of contacts on LinkedIn,” says Beh, “but I doubt all of them are really worth keeping. Professional networks are effective only if your contacts are individuals you actually know and not just virtual profiles. With our app, users can build a professional network quickly and easily, selecting only people they’ve met in person and who can bring something to the table. Whether they are looking to develop their careers, scout new business opportunities or simply meet new people, Impresso can save users precious time.”\nIn the future, recruiters will be able to use the app to check job certificates, degrees and other professional credentials – a highly useful feature for screening job applicants. Beh explains: “Based on conversations I’ve had with major recruiting firms, HR staff spend a lot of time sorting through applications, checking whether the statements made on CVs are accurate and contacting references. It can actually take up to two weeks just to be able to speak with someone who is listed as a reference.” But eventually job applicants will just have to send recruiters their Impresso profile, since the documents will have already been checked and references verified. “We’re not there yet, though,” says Beh. “Recruiters first need to see that they really can trust our app.”\nThe app’s developers are also working on adding blockchain technology to Impresso through a feature being designed in conjunction with EPFL’s Decentralized and Distributed Systems Lab (DEDIS), headed by Prof. Bryan Ford. That will enable the app to store data in a decentralized way, providing greater security for users’ information. “The technology we are considering – such as Omniledger, Calypso and Skipchain – will change how users’ data are stored, shared and deleted. Of course, we will also make sure that the app complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation,” says Beh.\nFor now, Impresso Labs is focusing on professional networks and recruitment. But it could expand its concept to other industries as well, such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals, where user data are shared with third parties.\nAbout Web Summit 2019\nWeb Summit is an annual global conference where professionals discover the latest developments in internet technology.

{"id": 1681, "text": "A major risk factor for mental and physical health, stress can rise from difficult situations in our private of professional life. Chronic stress can have a number of consequences, including high blood pressure, weight gain, addiction, burn-out, and depression, to name just a few. Stress also translates into financial problems, which is something we have been aware of for a long time: a 2003 study by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs of the Swiss Government showed that stress causes an economic burden of several billion Swiss francs per year.\n“A better understanding of stress is a prerequisite to prevent and treat stress-related health problems,” says  at EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute. And in order to achieve this better understanding, Sandi and  at the University of Basel, two world-renowned experts on stress research, have now founded a national network of more than 30 stress researchers from Swiss universities.\nCentralized under the website , the network’s mission is \n“to promote stress research in Switzerland by raising public and political awareness for the importance of stress research, fostering scientific interaction between different disciplines and supporting fundraising for stress research.”\n“\nWe believe that scientists from different disciplines need to team up to adequately address the complex phenomenon of stress”, says de Quervain.\n“In addition to our main focus in stress research, the Stress Network also aims to help ameliorate stress conditions in Switzerland,” says Sandi. “We have initiated exchanges with major stakeholders – politicians, foundations, unions – to identify key issues in which our combined expertise can contribute with innovative solutions and approaches. We are also planning a series of activities to communicate key developments in stress research and management to the public.”\nNobel laureate to speak at stressnetwork.ch symposium\n Stressnetwork.ch is organizing public lectures and yearly symposia around the topic of stress.

Tania Palmieri and Orhan Öçal have proven the former with their end of semester project for the College of Humanities.

{"id": 1683, "text": "With a projection head of 1 cm3 , and a total size smaller than a credit card, this new micro projector is a real breakthrough. It can be integrated in a portable computer or mobile telephone , or even an MP3 reader, while keeping its bright, high-quality image. This new device will enable the projection of documents and videos onto a wall, in the same way as current fixed projectors. The size of the image can be adjusted simply by modifying the distance between the projector and the projection surface; the resulting image remains uniformly clear.\n Another significant advantage: this projector uses very little energy, requiring on average 30% less current than the matrix- or LED-based technology currently available on the market. This solution, now being finalized, should be available in 2011 for industrial applications, and the following year for consumer electronics, according to Nicolas Abelé, Technical Director of the start-up, located in the EPFL Science Park.\n Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are only beginning to be used as a basis for the next generation of optical material. “This micro-projector functions using tiny mirrors of less than a millimeter’s thickness. Positioned on a silicon (wafer) disc, they reflect red, blue and green laser beams,” explains Maher Kayal, the EPFL research director who developed the microelectronic aspects of the system. The device, contained in a tiny glass case (3 mm x 4 mm), oscillates so rapidly that the beam can scan a surface up to 20,000 times a second. In August, Maher Kayal’s team was able to generate a color image in VGA resolution (640 x 480px) for the first time.\n This pocket projector works at a minimum distance of 50 centimeters, and enables the projection of images onto a surface equivalent to a 15-inch screen. During the last few months, the Lemoptix team has considerably improved the architecture of the optical head containing the laser light sources and the MEMS mirrors, thereby reducing the size of the whole device and its energy consumption. The manufacturing and assembly processes have also been defined, and the first sub-contractors identified. Moreover, the company succeeded in raising 1.4 million Swiss francs of new funds at the end of August.\n This technology has many advantages that will enable it to succeed in the market. “The micro-components used can be manufactured in thousands, even tens of thousands, at low cost,” emphasizes Nicolas Abelé. It will be developed from now until end-2011 for industrial applications. For example, it could be used by automobile manufacturers to project information directly onto the windshield, such as speed, GPS information etc. Medical technology companies have already shown an interest: this technology could be used to beam information related to an operation directly onto the patient, and would avoid the surgeon having to lift his head to look at a screen. The improved brightness and contrast will enable it to replace LCD screens. The Lemoptix team is already envisioning the creation of an interactive version; this would allow you to touch the projected image to zoom or change screen.\n Contacts:\tNicolas Abelé, Technical Director, Lemoptix,  – 021 550 61 13\n Maher Kayal, Professor at l’EPFL,  – 021 693 39 81", "summary": "The projector of the future, 1 cm3 of technology that can be integrated into a portable computer or mobile telephone, is about to take the market by storm. , a spin-off of EPFL, working together with the , completed its development at the beginning of September.

Their device also records the cells’ electrical signature so that they can be traced. While this innovation may seem trivial, it can save researchers several weeks of precious time and speed up development work in pharmaceuticals, cancer treatments and personalized medicine. The company began marketing its device this year.\nCreating cell lines from a single cell\nEach biological cell – like each human being – is different, with variations in their size, shape and configuration. That has been making researchers’ jobs particularly difficult over the past few years. Because of those differences, scientists have been cloning stem cells and cancer cells to obtain samples that can be compared effectively and generate reliable results. This is the approach taken by several major research organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Being able to create cell lines from a single cell is essential for developing new therapies.\nThe method that scientists currently use is to repeatedly dilute cells in order to maximize the occurrences of a given cell. But that takes several weeks, so it’s a long and costly process. Yann Barrandon, an honorary professor at EPFL and stem-cell expert, was hoping for years that engineers would develop a system for turning this step into a simple formality, making his research easier and providing traceability. Tired of waiting, he suggested the project to two EPFL PhD students – David Bonzon and Georges Muller – who took it on with the help of Professor Philippe Renaud at the Microsystems Laboratory 4. After several years of hard work, Bonzon and Muller were ready to unveil their device; they created SEED Biosciences and, in association with other researchers, just published two articles in \nSLAS Technology\n. “Several systems have been introduced over the past few years, but ours – called Dispencell – is the first to tick all the boxes. It’s easy to use, doesn’t affect cell functions, can be sterilized, improves traceability, and more,” says Bonzon, the company’s CTO.\nThe pipette tips are designed to be sterilized and replaced © 2020 Alain Herzog\nTo use the device, scientists pipette 20 µL of a solution with a high cell concentration, drawing in a few hundred cells. They then place the pipette’s tip into the dish where they want to dispense the cells. By pressing a button, they can release individual cells one by one. The system contains an electronic sensor linked to a software program – also developed by SEED Biosciences – that records each cell’s electrical signature. The software is sensitive enough to detect single cells as they pass through the tip. They are then displayed on a computer screen as sharp peaks. The company is now working on a feature that can distinguish damaged cells from healthy ones.\nTwo electrodes in the pipette’s tip\nPart of the device’s secret is that it uses a 50-year-old mechanism called a Coulter counter. With this counter, particles pass between two chambers separated by a tiny hole while an electric current is applied across the hole. In SEED Biosciences’ device, one electrode is located against the pipette’s tip and another is placed in the solution. A thin membrane with a 30 μm hole stretches across the very tip of the pipette and allows the cells to pass through one by one. The device detects and records the cells as they pass through; because the cells are not conductive, they cause changes in the current based on the cells’ size. By measuring the change in current, the software determines the cells’ passage and electrical signature. The pipette tips are designed to be sterilized and replaced so as to avoid contamination.\nThe device is initially intended for the pharmaceutical industry but also has promising applications in personalized medicine. SEED Biosciences is currently carrying out a funding round to support its market launch.", "summary": "EPFL spin-off SEED Biosciences has developed a pipetting robot that can dispense individual cells one by one.

{"id": 1696, "text": "If you want to use a connected device underwater, you don’t have many options. Radio waves don’t work well – they are easily absorbed by water, meaning they can’t go much further than a meter. Many sensors only offer a wired connection, but they are impractical because you have to remove the devices from the water to recover their data. Acoustic communication is often used, but it is very slow and unreliable. These are significant obstacles to effective communications when it comes to underwater construction, inspection, monitoring and repair activities – such as in the offshore energy sector. Limnology research is another field affected by this problem.\nHowever, the engineers at Hydromea have come up with a solution: using light to transmit data below the ocean or lake surface. They have developed an underwater modem called LUMA that communicates through a rapidly blinking blue light. The modem converts data into light pulses that it sends out, or inversely, converts light pulses that it receives into data – all in the blink of an eye. “Our optical modem gives you a fast wireless underwater connection,” says Alexander Bahr, Hydromea’s COO.\n© 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog, the LUMA underwater optical modem communicates with blue light\nOn the same wavelength \n“We chose blue light because even though water is generally opaque for electromagnetic waves, there is a small transparency band for blue and green light. That’s what lets our system send and receive data over long distances,” says Felix Schill, the company’s CTO. While water readily absorbs most waves, and especially infrared ones, just blue and green light can travel through it. The red and yellow light waves of the sun are absorbed in just a few meters.\nThe hardest part about developing LUMA was making sure it could send data over long enough distances and work reliably under all sorts of conditions. “Because light generally diffuses so rapidly underwater, finding a way to send communications over distances of 50 or 100 meters was difficult,” says Schill. “It took us a long time to develop a receiver sensitive enough to capture tiny light pulses even from far away.”\n© 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog, Felix Schill and Damien Doy work on the light pulse receiver\nPlumbing the depths\n LUMA is designed to work at depths of up to 6,000 meters. It’s a fully contained unit in a plastic casing, which is completely encased in clear plastic so it doesn’t collapse under extreme water pressures. The system has already been tested in the Pacific Ocean, at 4,280 meters below sea level, by scientists at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, in Germany. That’s the first research institute that Bahr and Schill began working with. “We were later contacted by companies operating offshore that were interested in our technology for laying underwater pipelines or building foundations for offshore wind farms,” says Bahr.\n© 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog, Alexander Bahr and Felix Schill prepare their modem\nBahr and Schill started researching underwater Wi-Fi systems when they were both students in Australia back in 2004. They fleshed out the details of their design over the years, and finalized it during their post-doc work at EPFL. Today they still collaborate with the School. For instance, they are helping develop robotics and communications systems for LéXPLORE, a research platform located just off the shores of Lake Geneva, neat Pully Vidy.\n© 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog, LéXPLORE platform off Vidy\nThere, limnologists are using LUMA to regularly check on the data collected underwater and make sure the measurement instruments are working properly, since the sensors need to remain underwater for months at a time. One modem is installed on the data logger which collects scientific data from the submerged sensors and the other modem is installed on a subsea robot that dives down to where the sensors are located and collects the sensors’ data instantly. “The LéXPLORE scientists give us feedback on their specific needs, and this helps us further improve our modem’s performance,” says Bahr.\n© 2020 EPFL Alain Herzog, a robot lowers the modem to the bottom of the water", "summary": "EPFL spin-off Hydromea has developed a miniature optical modem that can operate down to 6,000 meters below the ocean’s surface.

{"id": 1702, "text": "Despite the pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout, your company managed to raise CHF 92 million in funding – CHF 56 million in 2019 and the rest very recently. What's your secret?\nIt was precisely because of the pandemic that we decided to streamline our fundraising efforts by continuing a third round rather than starting a new one. So we signed up the same set of investors, mainly Swiss, as well as a few others they had brought on board. This eliminated the need to make lots of presentations to attract new investors, which would have been difficult in light of the public-health situation.\nIn 2011, when you were a professor at EPFL, your lab developed an algorithm that transforms how computer buses transfer data. This breakthrough technology was the subject of your first patent. Is that when you came up with the idea for a start-up, with the anticipation that it would take off?\nWithin an hour of our system working for the first time, we thought it would be a good idea to create a start-up. It was immediately clear that, while our technology could give rise to some outstanding research papers, the best way to spotlight it would be through a company. However, Kandou Bus grew much more slowly than we had anticipated in our original business plan, which called for a few months’ R&D work at EPFL, a prototype in under a year, and funding rounds the following year to turn the system into a marketable product. We were hoping to get where we are now in just four years. But when the applications for your invention are in brand-new territory, as was the case for us, then the process is like skiing down a treacherous slope at night with only a flashlight. You have limited visibility, you have to react with lightning speed and, if necessary, change course without falling over. Under such circumstances, finding your way takes time.\nWhat were the key development steps for your business?\nWe're lucky that our technology is a horizontal one – that is, it concerns all segments of the computer-component market instead of just one narrow application. The downside of this was how to gauge the market early on to determine which segment to target first. During this phase, which lasted three years, we were in stealth mode; we didn't share what we were working on. Fortunately, the CEO of a US start-up, which had become a multinational some years earlier, believed in our technology. He loaned us CHF 10 million in 2012 so that we could keep our head above water. Then in 2014, after delivering a paper at a high-profile industry conference, someone from Marvell, a semiconductor company, expressed real interest in our system. It took two more years to secure this first contract, which really set us on our way.\nSuccessful IT start-ups are rare in Switzerland. What are the advantages of being based at EPFL?\nFirst of all, I live here and I love this region – that's important. Also, because there's not much ICT here, it's easier to blaze your own trail. At a place like Silicon Valley with so many successful high-tech firms, newcomers have a tendency to imitate them in order to get backing, even though that might not be the best course for their business. Finally, being positioned outside the microcosm, and its attendant discussions, lends us an air of mystery, which is an advantage during negotiations. Locating our company at EPFL was a strategic choice at the beginning. I was a professor there and needed to be able to shuttle quickly between the company and my office. Now, however, it gives us a clear advantage in hiring talented young engineers and keeping abreast of research developments.\nWhat advice would you give to entrepreneurs want to create a fast-growing start-up?\nBeing an entrepreneur is a lot like being a scientist – you have to be passionate about what you do from the outset. You can't invent it later on. Without that kind of enthusiasm, it's extremely difficult to succeed because your personal investment is crucial: developing ideas takes up a lot of time and you don’t get much vacation or weekends off. This kind of commitment is also what allows you to weather the storm when nothing goes according to plan. Afterwards, the fast growth comes on its own. There's no big mystery about the early funding period. You have to cultivate your network, but if an investor doesn't latch on, there's no point spending huge amounts of time trying to convince them. You can see right away if someone's interested.\nWhat are your plans after this substantial funding round?\nNow our main goal is to market our first chip for all USB-C connections by spring 2021. This chip allows for faster, lower-power data transfer between all types of devices: smartphones, computers, external hard drives, and so on. We’re currently in the final development phase for the high-end version. Over the next year, we’ll roll out other chips aimed at a much larger market. This will be our first widely-distributed product.\nWhere do you see your company in ten years or so – is an IPO in the cards? Will Kandou be the next Logitech?\nIn terms of success, I think Kandou Bus will follow in Logitech's footsteps. My goal is to supply chips for all the devices people use to communicate. Today, systems are built using components, and we’re designing those components. But we’re planning to fabricate finished products based on our technology within a decade. Our technology will likely be used in satellites. With regards to our business model, we want to remain an independent company.

{"id": 1707, "text": "In recent years, two-micron lasers (0.002 millimetre) have been of growing interest among researchers. In the areas of surgery and molecule detection, for example, they offer significant advantages compared to traditional, shorter-wavelength lasers. However, two-micron lasers are still in their infancy and not yet as mature as their telecom counterparts (1.55-micron). Moreover sources currently used in labs are typically bulky and expensive. Optical fibre-based 2 micron lasers are an elegant solution to these issues. This is where researchers at Photonics Systems Laboratory (PHOSL) come in.\nIn an article published in \nLight: Science & Applications\n, the team of Camille Brès at EPFL described a way to design these lasers at a lower cost, by changing the way optical fibres are connected to each other. Thanks to the new configuration, they were able not only to produce very good 2 micron lasers, but also to do without an expensive and complex component that is normally required.\nBloodless surgery and long-range molecule détection\nTwo-micron spectral domain has potential applications in medicine, environmental sciences and industry. At these wavelengths, the laser light is easily absorbed by water molecules, which are the main constituents of human tissue. In the realm of high precision surgery, they can be used to target water molecules during an operation and make incisions in very small areas of tissue without penetrating deeply. What is more, the energy from the laser causes the blood to coagulate on the wound, which prevents bleeding.\nTwo-micron lasers are also very useful for detecting key meteorological data over long distances through the air. Not to mention that they are highly effective in the processing of various industrial materials.\nReplacing a cop with a detour\nTo create a 2 micron fibre-laser, light is usually injected into an optical-fibre ring containing a gain region which amplifies 2 micron light. The light circulates in the ring, passing through the gain region many times thus gaining more and more power, until becoming a laser. For optimal operation, these systems include a costly component called isolator, which forces the light to circulate in a single direction.\nAt PHOSL, researchers built a thulium-doped fibre laser that works without an isolator. Their idea was to connect the fibres differently, to steer light instead of stopping it. “We plug a kind of deviation that redirects the light heading in the wrong direction, putting it back on track”, said Camille Brès. This means no more need for the isolator, whose job is to stop light moving in the wrong direction, sort of like a traffic cop. “We replaced the traffic cop with a detour,” said Svyatoslav Kharitonov, the article’s lead author.\nHigher quality laser \nThe new system not only proved to be less expensive than more traditional ones, it also showed it could generate a higher quality laser light. The explanation is as follows: the laser output gets purified because light interacts with itself in a very special way, thanks to the amplifying fibre’s composition and dimensions, and the high power circulating in this atypical laser architecture. “While the association of amplifying fibres and high power usually weakens traditional lasers performance, it actually improves the quality of this laser, thanks to our specific architecture”, said Svyatoslav Kharitonov.\nReference\nLight: Science & Applications\n, Isolator-free unidirectional thulium doped fibre laser", "summary": "Lasers with a wavelength of two microns could move the boundaries of surgery and molecule detection.

{"id": 1710, "text": "Cancer immunotherapy aims to enhance or restore the ability of the patient’s immune system – namely T cells – to recognize and attack cancer. But tumors use several strategies to fight back immune attacks, making immunotherapy efficacious only in a minority of the patients. For example, they produce blood vessels that block, rather than facilitate, the arrival of T cells. EPFL scientists have now improved the efficacy of immunotherapy against different cancer types by reprogramming the tumor blood vessels. The study is published in \nScience Translational Medicine\n, and is featured on the cover of the journal.\nStarving tumors\nTumor blood vessels are essential for providing oxygen and nutrients to the growing cancer cells. The laboratory of  focused on two proteins, called VEGFA and ANGPT2, which tumors produce to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. Blocking the actions of VEGFA and ANGPT2 may curb the growth of the blood vessels, limit the provision of oxygen and nutrients, and starve the tumors.\nTo block both VEGFA and ANGPT2, the EPFL scientists used an antibody called A2V. The team tested A2V in experimental models of breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma. They found that A2V provides clear therapeutic benefits, whereas antibodies that block either VEGFA or ANGPT2 alone had more limited efficacy. Importantly, A2V also inhibits metastasis, a condition that is frequently lethal in patients with cancer.\nA2V reprograms the tumor blood vessels\nUnder the influence of VEGFA and ANGPT2, the tumor blood vessels also acquire an aberrant structure that impedes the passaging of T cells, thus limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy. A2V caused the regression of many tumor blood vessels, but some persisted after the therapy.\n“One interesting finding was that A2V not only regressed most of the tumor blood vessels, but also reversed the aberrant features of those that had remained, making them similar to normal blood vessels and more permissive to the arrival of anti-tumoral T cells”, says De Palma. Indeed, A2V promoted the “extravasation” of activated T cells into the tumors, a process that is required to initiate an immune response against the tumor.\nA2V helps checkpoint blockers\nTumors can evade detection and attacks by patrolling immune cells, such as T cells. Tumors accomplish this by expressing certain proteins, called “immune checkpoint ligands”. One of these is the protein PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1), which binds a receptor (PD-1) that is present on the surface of T cells, stopping them from attacking the tumor. A way to circumvent this problem is to use drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. These are usually antibodies that find and bind the immune checkpoint proteins on tumors, thus leaving them open to immune attacks.\nThe EPFL researchers found that the accumulation of activated T cells around the tumor blood vessels, which was promoted by A2V therapy, also triggered a defensive response: the blood vessels started to produce the checkpoint ligand PD-L1 in an effort to “blind-sight” the attacking T cells. However, the researchers found that it is possible to overcome this setback by blocking the PD-1 receptor. Indeed, an anti-PD-1 antibody further improved the anti-tumoral effects of A2V.\n“These data remind us that mechanisms of resistance to anti-cancer therapies are always beyond the corner. While A2V normalized the tumor blood vessels and facilitated the arrival of activated T cells, the anti-tumoral T cells became rapidly suppressed upon their extravasation to the tumor microenvironment”, says De Palma.\nThe study has important implications for cancer immunotherapy. “Our work suggests that certain anti-angiogenic drugs, namely ANGPT2 inhibitors, have more profound effects on tumors than initially thought. Besides targeting the blood vessels, they also help initiate anti-tumoral immune responses, which can be reinforced by immune checkpoint blockade”.\nThis work was mainly funded by the Leenaards Foundation, the Swiss Cancer League, the San Salvatore Foundation, and Roche. It also included contributions from the Roche Innovation Centers at Basel and Munich.\nReference\nMartina Schmittnaegel, Nicolò Rigamonti, Ece Kadioglu, Antonino Cassará, Céline Wyser Rmili, Anna Kiialainen, Yvonne Kienast, Hans-Joachim Mueller, Chia-Huey Ooi, Damya Laoui, Michele De Palma. \nDual angiopoietin-2 and VEGFA inhibition elicits anti-tumor immunity that is enhanced by PD-1 checkpoint blockade.\nSci.

{"id": 1715, "text": "What do marching soldiers, a children’s playground and a paper clip have in common? The answer came in a lively presentation by Margaux Larcher, a PhD student at the Laboratory of Thermomechanical Metallurgy (LMTM), at the finals of EPFL’s My Thesis in 180 Seconds (MT180) competition. Using just the right words, carefully chosen metaphors and a dash of humor, she explained how the seemingly random movement of atoms in the shape memory material she is studying is, in fact, synchronized. Larcher’s presentation won over the jury and wowed the audience. Under normal circumstances, it would have drawn thunderous applause. But these are unusual times, and the 600-seater Rolex Forum was almost empty, with fewer than 50 audience members in attendance because of measures against the coronavirus. The event was live-streamed on  to allow spectators to cast their vote for the audience award (voting closes at 6pm tonight).\nMaterials were the star of the show last night as Rita Drissi Daoudi, another PhD student from the same lab as Larcher, took second place for her presentation on a system that detects manufacturing defects by “listening” to 3D-printed parts as they’re being made. Her audio detection method could one day be used to fix imperfections on the fly and stop defective components such as aircraft parts and hip implants from rolling off the production line. This year is the first time that EPFL will send two women to the national final, which will take place at the Rolex Forum on 26 May.\nThird place went to Sébastien Le Fouest for his presentation on vertical-axis wind turbines, which are smaller and more versatile than conventional horizontal-axis versions but have the disadvantage of being more fragile. Le Fouest is a PhD student at the Unsteady Flow Diagnostics Laboratory (UNFOLD), where he is investigating ways to overcome this fragility by studying the formation of vortices. In his presentation, for which he’d already picked up an audience award, he used his body to show how the wind acts on the blades. The other audience winner was Alice Gillen from the Laboratory of Nanobiotechnology (LNB) for her research into sensors that could deliver a steady dose of dopamine, in just the right amount, to patients with Parkinson’s disease.\nHigh-caliber presentations\nThe jury was chaired by Professor Marilyne Andersen from the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC). She was particularly impressed with the caliber of this year’s entries. “The presentations were of such a high standard that we thought each one was going to be the winner – until the next one came along and made us reconsider,” says Prof. Andersen. The 14 PhD students who competed last night were able to successfully distill several years’ worth of research into just three minutes. The audience, watching in person and online, was treated to a whirlwind tour that included cell transport mechanisms for Alzheimer’s disease drugs, a magnetic probe for a nuclear fusion reactor, and a system for cooling hydrogen fuel cells. The students’ hard work and public-speaking skills turned these otherwise dry subjects into clear and engaging presentations.", "summary": "The fifth annual My Thesis in 180 Seconds competition was held behind closed doors last night because of the coronavirus.

{"id": 1721, "text": "Two boats out of the ordinary and four crew members selected among champions: Hydros, the company that, with support from Lombard Odier private bank, operates and develops among others “l’Hydroptère.ch”, has unleashed its best assets at . Trials began yesterday in Falmouth, England.\nEight countries will compete aboard catamarans with dimensions not exceeding 7.62 x 4.20 m in size and 27.8 m2 in sail area. The two teams representing Switzerland have been training since early September aboard their vessels mounted on \"hydrofoils\", where they are capable to rise above the waves given specific wind conditions.\nHydros is very ambitious about this race. Florent Gaillard, head of communications, said openly: \"We have what it takes to win!\" And his optimism is not unfounded. Both catamarans have accumulated a substantial know-how in the course of countless practice sessions aboard the “Hydroptère.ch” on Lake Leman.\nExceptional partnership\nThe technology used also results from industrial and academic partnerships in the Leman area that have managed to establish a genuine \"cluster of excellence\" in the field of composite materials. Firstly, the boats are assembled in the Décision S.A. shipyard in Ecublens. Their construction puts great emphasis in the use of revolutionary materials whose development has been made possible by the involvement of several EPFL units such as the Laboratory of Applied Mechanics and Reliability Analysis (LMAF) and the Laboratory of Polymer and Composite technology (LTC). Finally, the raw material used to build the boats’ structure and wings is manufactured by North TPT, in Penthalaz.\nThe specialty of this quest, which makes it stand out at an international level, is the use of carbon fiber and thin film glass composites. Developed from the outset for sailing related applications, these materials became known in 2007 thanks to the famous Alinghi \"black sails\". At present, the same constituents allow the production of particularly light and strong rigid structures. Thus, the North TPT material is also used in some of the most important parts of the second Solar Impulse airplane.\nJoel Cugnoni from LMAF keeps regular contact with this company. \"We characterize these materials by accurately studying their behavior in extreme situations, he said. For example, we have found that the assembly of thin films is incredibly resistant to fatigue and able to preserve all its features intact up to its breaking point.\"\nThe specialists who have combined their efforts to create these two exceptional boats are gathered in a relatively small geographic area. They already prepare the future by launching last summer an international student's competition, called HydroContest, in which participants will have one year to enhance the performances of a given boat ().\nBut for the time being, the will all have their eyes on England.

{"id": 1726, "text": "“Any records that were kept before 2000 basically don’t exist, because we have no means of viewing them,” says Frédéric Kaplan, head of EPFL’s Digital Humanities Laboratory. This radical statement reflects Kaplan’s concern that in the not-too-distant future, only information recorded in electronic form will be accessible – meaning information in all other formats will fall by the wayside. “We urgently need to bring our archives into the digital age. We mustn’t lose contact with the past.”\nBringing the past into the digital age is exactly what the Venice Time Machine (VTM) project sets out to do. It aims to build a multidimensional model of the city that spans the past millennium, using millions of historical documents stored in a variety of formats. Launched in 2012, the project is now reaching its halfway point in a year that will include two major steps forward.\nMapping 5,000 years of European history\n The first is a drive to expand it to cities across Europe under a broader Time Machine initiative. In a manifesto published in 2016, Kaplan called for universities across the continent to join forces to share the region’s cultural heritage. His paper received widespread acclaim, prompting several EU commissioners to champion his idea. Kaplan’s manifesto became the cornerstone of a proposal for the Time Machine project to become part of the EU’s FET Flagship program, which provides €1 billion in funding over ten years to large-scale research initiatives.\nTime Machine aims to create a large-scale simulator for mapping 5,000 years of history. 165 partner institutions from 32 countries have formed a consortium to develop new technology for digitizing, analyzing, accessing, preserving and sharing historical and cultural documents. The FET Flagship application was sent in this month with a response expected next year.\nSeveral Time Machine projects already under way\nSome cities decided not to wait for the EU’s green light to launch their Time Machines. \nAmsterdam\n (pictured above), Nuremberg, Paris, Jerusalem, Budapest and Naples have all decided to dig through their archives and create a huge database linking their history on a national and European level. Why? We spoke with Julia Noordegraaf, Professor of Heritage and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam, and Sander Münster, who heads the Department of Media Design at \nDresden \n(pictured on the right) Technical University, to find out.\nWith the application submitted, the next step will be to create the online interfaces that will allow people to browse the over two million documents that have already been scanned. In the five years since the project began – or two since the researchers started digitizing documents – they have scanned 190,000 records from the Venice State Archive, 720,000 photographs from Fondazione Giorgio Cini, and 3,000 books on Venice’s history held in the city’s main libraries. “That’s less than 1% of everything that’s out there. It’s enormous!” says Kaplan. It also led to the discovery of an art trafficking ring between the Netherlands and Italy.\nTens of thousands of annotations\n To scan this unprecedented volume of documents, the researchers first had to develop \ntechnology that could quickly digitize kilometers of archives, some dating back 500 years. The devices they built include a semi-automated scanner for fragile manuscripts and documents in large formats, a robotic arm to turn the pages of books and journals, and a high-speed scanner, developed in conjunction with Adam Lowe at Factum Arte, that can digitize a photographic record front-and-back in just 4 seconds.\nIn addition to the digitization effort, historians, paleographers and archivists hand-wrote over 160,000 notes on the documents indicating names, places and keywords. Their annotations were used to create an automatic handwriting recognition system that could extract information from the documents. “Our system had to be able to handle many different types of writing and abbreviations, since they weren’t standardized at the time. We showed the computer an array of examples so it could learn how to learn,” says Sofia Ares Oliveira, a researcher at the Digital Humanities Laboratory. The system she and her colleagues developed can transcribe unannotated words with an error rate of 4% per character. “It’s like when you enter a word with a typo into a search engine. Our system is smart enough to come up with fairly accurate results and give you a good idea of what the text is about,” she adds.\nThree programs for delving into digital data\n The project team will launch their search engine, called Canvas, by this summer. It will let people view original versions of scanned records from the State Archives and search the entire database of digitized documents by keyword, such as a name, place or date. It works like Wikipedia in that authorized users can correct scanning errors they find in the files, and thereby continually improve the service.\nA second task was to digitize the vast photo library owned by Fondazione Giorgio Cini. Some 370,000 of the Foundation’s million photographs have been scanned so far. And here again, researchers added thousands of notes by hand to train the computer. That resulted in a search engine called Replica that can search not only text, but also images by establishing connections between them. “The machine learned to form links between the photographs’ composition, the position of the people in them, and any other items or patterns. That allows the machine to spot similarities among the images – paving the way for art historians to flesh out their history,” says Benoît Seguin, the EPFL student who developed Replica as part of his thesis, which he will defend this summer.\nAnd a third task was to tackle the scientific books and journals stored away in Venice’s main libraries. This collection includes nearly 3,000 books from the 19\nth\n to 21\nst\n centuries and over 100 years of scientific publications, all on Venice. They were digitized under the Linked Books project – a project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and spearheaded by researchers Giovanni Colavizza and Matteo Romanello working in association with Kaplan. An ad hoc program called Venice Scholar was also developed to automatically extract and search citations, making it easier for historians to use them as they navigate through the city’s history. This is an open system, like the other two, and new entries can be easily added to the database. These secondary sources are also linked to the primary sources in Canvas.\nPress kit:\nContacts :\nAnne-Muriel Brouet \nPress Service EPFL\n +41 21 69 32442\nSandy Evangelista \nPress Service EPFL\n +41 21 69 32185\n +41 79 502 81 06\nFrederic Kaplan \nDigital Humanities Laboratory EPFL\n +41 21 69 30253\n +41 21 69 31901", "summary": "2018 will be a pivotal year for the Venice Time Machine project.

{"id": 1727, "text": "A hunt for the goose that lays golden eggs. This is, in essence, Philippe Paccaud’s proposal in his master's thesis, conducted at EPFL’s Automatic Control Laboratory. This micro-technology student addressed the question that intrigues more than one mathematician: to what extent can we predict the number on which a roulette ball will fall? He might not have found a miracle equation, but the young man was certainly able to get some interesting results.\nHe had to be resourceful. He put together a customized experimentation platform that basically consisted of a wheel, a computer and a camera to record the slightest movement of the ball and the position of the number zero slot as a benchmark. To ensure consistency in the light source and thus the accuracy of the detection, the student had the idea to distribute LEDs along an old bicycle rim, which he then suspended above the wheel.\n\"By means of this system, I executed a thousand throws and recorded all the data to develop a model,\" explained Philippe Paccaud. Image processing algorithms allowed him to measure the ball and the roulette’s position every time. A Kalman filter - a tool for estimating a dynamic system’s variables based on partial and/or noisy measurements - was used to assess the speed and acceleration. Then, the database thus created was analyzed by machine learning algorithms. In fact, this is one of the original features of this work, as pre-existing studies on the subject were based primarily on physical models.\nA slight tilt\nThe data collection did entail some difficulties. The student quickly realized that he had to correct a flaw in the wheel: a slight tilt was influencing the ball’s trajectory. \"A 0.2 degrees difference is enough to bias the results,\" he explained. There was another difficulty; after starting with 1’400 different features recorded per throw, he ended up with too much information that was simply impossible to analyze. For that reason, he had to reduce them to the most relevant. Finally, Philippe Paccaud also had to ensure the proper positioning of the camera above the game. \"It must be placed exactly in the center to ensure an accurate measurement of the ball’s position, any mistake could inevitably influence the speed and acceleration estimates.\"\nOnce these corrections were made, the student was able to predict with a 43% success rate the baffle (the diamond-shaped metal parts placed around the wooden perimeter, just above the numbered boxes) on which the ball was to hit first. \"We could continue this work by testing other algorithms for predicting on which half of the roulette the ball is most likely to stop moving,\" he notes.\nEstimate the area\nIn conclusion, Philippe Paccaud highlighted the problem’s complexity. Not only each throw involves a huge number of variables, but one small parameter variation of the ball (position, speed, acceleration) will completely change the final result, making a prediction of the exact figure, according to him, almost impossible. \"One of the algorithms assessed that a difference of 2 inches per second for an initial ball’s speed of about 1.3 meters per second (that is: a ~ 0.2% margin) produces the same result, but just outside this range the end result is 10 slots away! One could only speak of the probability to estimate the area of the wheel where the ball will stop.\"\nBut these were not the figures that interested Philippe Paccaud the most. \"I thought it was particularly rewarding to start from scratch, to create a project from A to Z and to imagine an entire experimentation and analysis system, all of this counting on the teachers’ full confidence.\"", "summary": "Summer Series - student work (9): To what extent could we predict the number on which a roulette ball is going to fall?

{"id": 1728, "text": "The ranking was published yesterday evening: L.E.S.S. came in first place this year after finishing second last year. The competition, which looks at companies set up in the past five years, is judged by a panel of 100 startup experts: venture capitalists, business angels and heads of startup funds.\nWinning this competition does not translate into an immediate financial payoff, but it does guarantee visibility in Switzerland and abroad. “For many Swiss and foreign venture capitalists and business angels, this ranking is becoming something of a benchmark,” said Jordi Montserrat, one of the competition's organizers. For the international audience, this five-year-old event also says something about the quality and diversity of Swiss startups in general.\nSo what nudged L.E.S.S. to the top of the list? \"Just like Abionic and Flyability, it is now better known and has greater credibility,” said Montserrat. These startups raised money and won various prizes and awards, all of which brought them notice. Some criteria are objective: a quality product, a team of driven entrepreneurs and a substantial target market. But the success of innovative new companies depends largely on the founder’s personality, team-building skills and public presence. The experts drew on their own experience and intuition in making their selections. The top 20 finishers include other EPFL offshoots: Lunaphore, Faceshift (rumored to have been recently acquired by Apple), Scantrust, Actlight and Gamaya.\nThe top three finishers: \nTechnical lighting of the future\n L.E.S.S. developed the nano-active fiber – as thin as a human hair – which greatly reduces power consumption in displays, high-speed manufacturing inspection systems and automotive lighting. According to its designers, it could soon replace LED technology for technical lighting solutions as well. This EPFL spinoff was formed in 2012 and was able to raise three million francs this year. These funds will allow the company to begin ramping up production volumes in response to growing demand from key clients, mainly in Japan, Germany and Switzerland.\nDetect allergies in minutes\n Abionic created an allergy-testing device that’s now ready for the doctor’s offices. A few drops of the patient’s blood are mixed with a special fluid and placed in small capsules containing allergens. Arranged on a CD-sized disc, these samples are then analyzed by a laser in under ten minutes. The device also indicates the severity of the allergy. Abionic's system, created in 2011, is already being marketed. The company is expecting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which would open the door to the American market.\nThe drone that bounces off obstacles\n This is Flyability’s first appearance in the ranking, and it ended up in third place – whereas the top two finishers came in second and third in last year’s ranking. This company has developed Gimball, a drone modelled after insects that’s not afraid of running into things. In fact, it simply bounces off them thanks to the small spherical cage that surrounds it. This flying robot, which came out of the labs last year, can be sent into disaster zones, for example, taking video with its integrated camera and delivering precious information to rescue crews. This type of use in rescue situations won over the jury in the “Drones for Good” competition recently held in the United Arab Emirates, and the company took home a million dollar grant.\nThe startup ranking was inaugurated in 2011 by officials of the Institut für Jungunternehmen (IFJ) based in both French- and German-speaking Switzerland.

Ricardo Beira elaborated this idea in his thesis, and subsequently created the start-up, DistalMotion, to further develop it:. The device is controlled by small joysticks which allow the operation of surgical tools fixed to the end of a metal arm. The goal? To facilitate minimally invasive operations without opening the abdominal wall.\nTwo to three bodily orifices allow for the passage of a small camera and long surgical instruments. This technique, known as endoscopy, is used more and more in urology, gynecology and visceral surgery.While this technique has many benefits, the main problem is the lack of precision in the surgeon’s movements, which is linked to the rigidity of the tools. Moreover, the surgeon must work with a mirror as, for example, a movement to the surgeon’s left results in the tool moving to the right; hence, a particularly intense training is necessary. Ricardo Beira’s system solves these problems.\nCompletely Mechanical\n The small joysticks are able to exactly replicate the surgeon’s movements,. As a result, pliers, scissors, needles and other tools move as if a practitioner was directly holding them. The research completed at the robotics laboratory has allowed for the elimination of a problem inherent to such mechanisms, the exaggeration of movements. When a small movement outside of the patient’s body is translated into a larger one inside the patient, operations become even more. delicate and painstaking. Thanks to this device, seven degrees of freedom are permitted in the reproduction of movement, including, for example, the rotation of the wrist.\nIn the era of robotics crammed with electronics, detectors and sensors, this mechanical engine developed by Ricardo Beira is quite remarkable. It should permit a considerable expansion of the variety of coelioscopic procedures, which present numerous advantages in relation to traditional surgery, notably with regard to safety, aesthetics and cost. The post-operative pain and risk of infection are lesser, the scars are smaller, and the stay at the hospital shorter.\nThe device requires craftsmanship of the highest and most detailed order, but the horizon is bright due to the numerous foreseen advantages . “The future cost of production will lie outside a common measure with the only devices capable of this much mobility in this type of operation, the DaVinci robots.

{"id": 1740, "text": "What if everyone had their own medical avatar – a virtual replica of themselves featuring their own personal data – that could improve the way their health is managed and the way they are treated if they fall ill? That is the bold proposal put forward by the Health EU project, whose tagline is “Human avatars to prevent and cure diseases”. This international project, led by a consortium* headed by EPFL in collaboration with the Institute for Human Organ and Disease Model Technologies based in the Netherlands, recently applied to become a FET Flagship. FET Flagship is a prestigious multi-disciplinary research program run by the European Union that offers €1 billion in funding over ten years.\n“What we are proposing is a totally revolutionary way of handling health issues,” explains Adrian Ionescu, a professor of nanoelectronics at EPFL and one of the project’s originators. With its avatar-based system, Health EU aims to achieve improved disease prevention, early diagnosis, more accurate monitoring and customized, targeted administration of medicines and treatments, especially for increasingly common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular, chronic and neurodegenerative disorders.\n“We are offering a possible solution to problems faced by the current healthcare model, which is not economically sustainable because of the extremely high costs it entails,” adds Professor Ionescu.\nThe project’s core idea is to combine customized medicine with digital technology, using the latest technological developments such as connected objects, artificial intelligence and the concept of “digital twins”. In principle, a digital twin is a digital replica of an object that can be used to test and measure the effect of variables, processes and scenarios that would be impossible to apply in the real world. The approach is already being used in aerospace and astrophysics and in the automotive industry. However, it has not yet been applied to human beings. «Health EU’s vision combining digital and physical human avatars is taking digital twins to an unprecedented level» remarks Chris Van Hoof, senior director of Connected Health Solutions & IMEC Fellow.\nA whole range of technologies \n“Avatars are not simple digital models,” continues Professor Ionescu. “They will be developed and calibrated continuously on the basis of a large amount of customized data, collected experimentally during our day-to-day lives. Advanced models will be developed using artificial intelligence. Behind the scenes, we will create the infrastructure for the future Internet of Healthcare in order to manage the data in the form of genuine human avatars.” The Health EU project plans to develop a whole technological platform around patients and their virtual twins, capable of generating “big and deep data”. The platform will take into account and connect genomic and biological data, but also environmental and behavioral data, for example information about people’s habits and lifestyles. To collect that data, the project plans to use a whole range of leading-edge technologies: portable sensors, implants, nanomedicine techniques and medical imaging.\nIt will also use “organ-on-chip” technology – one of the project’s key features. This technology involves transferring cells onto a microchip to observe how they act and react. It will be the most physical, concrete aspect of the avatars. The method offers the possibility of testing the biological functions of an organ or interactions between several organs, but outside the human body. For example, the effect of a medicine could be measured at an early stage, avoiding side effects that can sometimes be extremely harmful, and allowing treatments to be tailored as closely as possible to the patient’s needs.\nReducing animal testing\nBetter anticipation of risks, personalized advice, more accurate medical monitoring, more suitable treatments and faster analysis: these are some of the main benefits that Health EU intends to deliver. More generally, the project aims to reduce costs and give a major boost to innovation in the medtech sector. “We shouldn’t forget that the solutions we are proposing would also replace a large proportion of testing currently carried out on animals,” stresses Albert van den Berg from the University of Twente, one of the coordinators of the Organs on Chip platform.\nHowever, there are many challenges ahead in terms of developing and refining the technologies, arranging collaborations between experts from many different disciplines and countries, and protecting the data collected from individuals. “Europe must maintain its data sovereignty,” says Patrick Boisseau, VP Healthcare at CEA Tech and Chairman of the board of the European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine. Information will be stored on servers located in Europe. We are also working on MPEG-type compression standards that will be specifically customized for the Health EU program. This secure infrastructure will become the future Internet of Healthcare, developed with the world’s leading cybersecurity experts. \"Health EU will be a kind of Netflix for genomic and sensory data! At the end of the day, however, it will always be up to patients to decide what they want doctors to see, and which doctors they want to see it”, says Adrian Ionescu.\nMore than 90 scientists from 47 leading-edge research groups at universities, institutes, clinics and companies in 16 European countries are directly involved in Health EU. Around 60 other scientists are project partners. The Health EU proposal has just been submitted to the European Union, and the final decision on whether it obtains FET Flagship status is likely to be made in early 2020.\nTo find out more about the Health EU project, visit \n* \nAs part of the Health EU project, EPFL and ETH Zurich are collaborating closely, with the involvement of more than 25 laboratories. Elsewhere in Europe, major technology hubs in France (CEA-LETI and Genopôle), Belgium and the Netherlands (IMEC, University of Twente and HDMT), and Germany (Fraunhofer and Max Planck Societies) are also taking part in the project.

As the third call for proposals is now complete, six projects were selected for a total of CHF 1,788,619. “I offer my sincere congratulations to the six newest laureates at Campus Biotech,” declare the Co-Chair of the Foundation. “Each of these teams is pursuing research in extremely important and potentially high-impact areas of neuroscience and it is a great honour to be able to add extra fuel to the collaborative fire that is driving their vital work. I want to thank the other applications who, this time, we unfortunately could not select.”\nPierre Magistretti, chairman of the Catalyst Fund, adds: “The task of the Scientific Committee has been very rewarding due to excellent quality of the proposed projects, but at the same time, making the selection of the top six successful applications was quite challenging. This initiative provides a unique opportunity to leverage the outstanding potential of the Lemanic Neurosciences to promote basic research and translational projects in this field.”\nA successful year with 40 proposals\nThis year, the call for proposals was very successful. “It’s a great validation of the vision that we had for the Catalyst Fund that this year, the programme’s third, we had over 40 proposals”, tells Bertarelli. “This extraordinary number, together with the fact that every submission was of a very high calibre, is a further proof that collaborative scientific research in Switzerland is in great health. I also warmly thank EPFL and the Catalyst Fund’s Scientific Committee for their superb work with this important programme.”\nThe scientists will use the proceeds to kick off their research and make rapid progress towards clinical applications.\nMore about the projects\nUsing cell grafts to repair brain damage \nOne of the biggest challenges in neuroscience today is developing safe, effective methods for repairing adult nerve-cell damage caused by neurological disorders. In this project, a team of scientists led by Jocelyne Bloch and Nicole Déglon from CHUV and Grégoire Courtine from EPFL has come up with a cell therapy-based method that involves grafts of autologous adult brain cells. The cells can be harvested from cortical biopsies, cultivated to produce autologous neural cell ecosystems (ANCEs) and reimplanted into the brain to repair damage. Bloch’s team has already found that such grafts can mediate functional recovery in nonhuman primates suffering from Parkinson’s disease or the consequences of a stroke. The next steps will be to conduct clinical trials on stroke victims and to further study the molecular profile of ANCEs and how this profile evolves following the reimplantation of ANCEs.\nMeasuring and preventing chronic pain\nChronic pain is a complex phenomenon shaped by a variety of factors going beyond mere body damage. In order to assess, characterize and predict chronic pain, Bigna Lenggenhager from the University of Zurich, Olaf Blanke from EPFL and Tristan Bekinschtein from the University of Cambridge developed a method that can be conducted entirely from home. Patients use a portable telemedical tool to take brain and behavioral measurements and perform self-reports. Because pain is largely influenced by attention, the scientists are studying how fluctuations in attention – whether spontaneous or experimentally induced – modulate pain changes in patients. These measurements provide key information about the time maps of chronic pain and the underlying brain signatures. The team’s findings may eventually be used to facilitate the prediction of pain levels and thereby improve chronic pain management and understanding.\nImproving brain-image resolution through ultrasound \nThe conventional ultrasound examination of brain activity, commonly known as transcranial color-coded duplex or transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCCD/TCD), has limited use for neurological applications and cerebral vascular imaging in human adults. That’s because adult skull bones act as a barrier to the propagation of ultrasound, thereby degrading imaging resolution. In this project, a team of scientists led by Fabienne Perren from the University of Geneva is developing a new technique for ultrafast ultrasound transcranial neuroimaging. By combining this type of neuroimaging procedure with a contrast agent, they were able to obtain super-resolved maps of brain vessels down to the capillary level. The team will work with Philippe Ryvlin from the University of Lausanne and Olaf Blanke from EPFL to perform a clinical validation of the technique on healthy volunteers and conduct clinical confrontation trials on patients suffering from epilepsy and cerebrovascular pathologies.\nHearing music better by feeling its vibrations\nOver 5% of the world’s population suffers from hearing impairments preventing them from fully experiencing the joy of listening to music. Although standard hearing aids can help, they do not cover the full auditory spectrum. In this project, Daniel Huber from the University of Geneva and Mario Prsa from the University of Fribourg will examine new ways for transforming the wide frequency spectrum of audible sounds into the range of vibrations perceptible by the somatosensory system. This research will go hand in hand with the design and development of a novel type of portable vibrotactile stimulation device that enhances the range of information perceived by hearing impaired and deaf individuals during musical performances.\nObserving Parkinson’s inside the brain \nParkinson’s disease is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, a lack of motivation and hallucinations. In this project, Paul Krack from the University of Bern, Vanessa Fleury from Geneva University Hospitals (HUG), and Olaf Blanke and Dimitri Van De Ville from EPFL will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on resting-state patients to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of these symptoms and better understand the effects of dopaminergic medication on these patients’ brain activity. The team’s findings could pave the way to improved diagnoses and better targeted treatment strategies.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms behind dry eyes\nIn this project, Denise Zysset-Burri and Martin Zinkernagel from the University of Bern are studying dry eye disease – an ocular surface condition that affects some 34% of the world’s population. Their goal is to assess the associations of patients’ local immune systems and ocular microbiomes, and the role they play in disease development. The results could give doctors a better understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms and eventually lead to a broader range of treatment options. This research could also have important implications for the prevention of dry eye disease and other immune-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.", "summary": "The Catalyst Fund – supported by the Bertarelli Foundation – has selected six research projects to fund this year.

From many individual particles showing projections of the centriole complex in various orientations (upper panel), by using a fused intermediate (yellow, lower panel), the newly developed method allows now to reconstruct a multicolor 3D model (lower panel) (credit: Christian Sieben/EPFL).\nSuper-resolution microscopy is a technique that can “see” beyond the diffraction limit of light. The technique has garnered increasing interest recently, especially since its developers won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014. By exploiting fluorescence, super-resolution microscopy now allows scientists to observe cells and their interior structures and organelles in a way never before possible.\nMany of the molecular complexes inside cells are made up of multiple proteins. Since current techniques of super-resolution microscopy typically can only use one or two fluorescent colors, it is difficult to observe different proteins and decipher the complex architecture and underlying assembly mechanisms of the cell’s interior structures. An even greater challenge is to overcome the noise inherent to the super-resolution methods and fluorescent labeling, to achieve the full resolution potential.\nScientists from  have now solved both problems by developing a new method to analyze and reconstruct super-resolution images and re-align them in a way that multiple proteins can be placed within a single 3D volume. The method works with images taken with large field-of-view super-resolution microscopy, with each image containing hundreds of two-dimensional projections of a labeled structure in parallel.\nEach 2D view represents a slightly different orientation of the structure, so that with a dataset of thousands of views, the method can computationally reconstruct and align the 2D images into a 3D volume. By combining information from a large number of single images, the noise is reduced and the effective resolution of the 3D reconstruction is enhanced.\nWith the help of , the researchers tested the method on human centriole complexes. Centrioles are pairs of cylindrical molecular assemblies that are crucial in helping the cell divide. Using the new multicolor super-resolution reconstruction method, the researchers were able to uncover the 3D architecture of four proteins critical for centriolar assembly during organelle biogenesis.\nThe new approach allows for unlimited multiplexing capabilities. “With this method, if the proteins in the structure can be labeled, there is no limit to the number of colors in the 3D reconstruction,” says Suliana Manley. “Plus, the reconstruction is independent of the super-resolution method used, so we expect this analysis method and software to be of broad interest.”", "summary": "A new technique developed by EPFL overcomes the noise and color limitations of super-resolution microscopy by creating three-dimensional reconstructions from single-color, two-dimensional images of protein complexes.", "claim": "A new technique developed by EPFL overcomes the noise and color limitations of super-resolution microscopy by creating three-dimensional reconstructions from single-color, hundreds-dimensional images of protein complexes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [29, 29], "noise": false}

Miz is the lead author on  about the new algorithm, which was recently presented at  2019 in San Francisco, California, USA.\nCo-author , a former LTS2 researcher and EPFL data visualization lecturer now working as a data artist, added that what made Wikipedia so appealing as a data source was its accessibility and size.\n“Wikipedia has some 5 billion visits per year for English alone. With this technique, we can identify groups of pages that belong together,” he said.\nFrom collective memory to fake news\nThe researchers’ algorithm is unique because it can not only identify such anomalous events, but also provide insights into exactly where, how, and why they happened.\n“The core difference is that we provide more context due to the network structure. For example, if we look at Wikipedia pages about the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, we can see that the page about the attack is directly connected to the page about Charlie Hebdo magazine, and also to a cluster of pages representing terrorist organizations,” Miz explains.\nBenzi and Miz call this kind of information-seeking “collective memory”, as it can reveal how current events trigger memories of the past.\n“The Wikipedia research is about trying to explore new findings about human nature itself. Wikipedia is a very interesting dataset because it reflects more or less what we as humanity decide to remember. Collectively, we have the same train of thought and browse the same topics,” Benzi says.\nSo, what topics do people most care about, according to this research? In short: other people.\n“Some 80% of visits are for entertainment or celebrities.

And it could prove invaluable in missions that are hazardous or simply not possible with human pilots, such as taking measurements in a volcanic ash cloud or above a nuclear power plant after an accident.\nThe scientists involved in the project have joined forces under the aegis of EPFL’s Transportation Center, which is called TraCE. The Real-Time Coordination and Distributed Interaction Systems Group – known as REACT – is working on predicting trajectories and in-flight collision avoidance. The Computer Vision Laboratory, also known as CVLab, has the job of outfitting the aircraft with a veritable visual intelligence system. And the Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, DISAL, will test algorithms on small, lightweight flying robots.\n“It is a project that confirms EPFL’s unique expertise in the transport research field. The multidisciplinary character of the project unites three laboratories from three different Schools who have teamed up with a large company like Honeywell to remain as close as possible to industrial requirements”, says Michaël Thémans, Associate Director of the Transportation Center.\nFor Honeywell, the project has great potential in both the civil and commercial sectors, far beyond just aviation. “These new technologies will not only help us improve general flight safety, for example by providing better autopilot systems, but they will certainly also have other uses in automating everyday life,” says George Papageorgiou, director of the Aerospace Advanced Technology Europe System Engineering & Applications Department at Honeywell.\nZero accidents\nThe REACT team has been working for several years on issues involving driverless vehicles. They will now also work on developing algorithms that can predict position and trajectory for aircraft occupying a given segment of airspace based on the data from all available devices – GPS, ground-based radar, cameras, and infrared cameras. They’re looking to provide very reliable programs to avoid all accidents as far in advance as possible. “It’s a project that places the technological bar very high,” says group director Denis Gillet.\nCVLab scientist Vincent Lepetit is developing a system to analyze images taken by high-definition cameras. “What seems to be a simple task for the human eye is incredibly complex to reproduce technically,” he explains. “The main difficulty lies in the enormous amount of information that has to be processed; each image is made up of several hundred thousand pixels.” In addition, it’s not enough to perceive objects in the immediate vicinity; they must also be identified, their trajectory and speed calculated, and their time of approach predicted.\nDISAL, the third group involved in the project, will work on algorithms to network data with other nearby aircraft. The group has recently acquired a flight-testing area with a testing room and will soon have a state-of-the-art 3D positioning system. Sensors and algorithms will be tested on small flying robots called quadrirotors. “We will work on integrating trajectory prediction, avoidance, stability, vision, and data-exchange algorithms developed by various laboratories, and see how to get them working together in real time,” explains laboratory director Alcherio Martinoli.\nA new perspective\nBy working with EPFL, Honeywell is in search not only of cutting-edge research expertise, but also a new perspective on aviation technologies. “We have much to learn from scientists in other research fields, because they will certainly look at the problems from a different angle and propose different solutions and ideas,” says Papageorgiou.\nThere’s still a psychological and social hurdle to overcome, however – one that’s not negligible. “The idea of pilotless airplanes is still frightening, and that’s why we’re moving step by step,” the Honeywell representative says. “Developing these new technologies will take a lot of time. It’s a true revolution; people will get more comfortable with it very gradually over time.”", "summary": "Will planes someday fly without pilots?

{"id": 1772, "text": "To make you documents inaccessible to a third party, two post-doctoral fellows at EPFL have created a start-up called Di55erent around three data security solutions. The solutions are based on the clever but intuitive ideas of locking files in a safe or breaking them apart like a jigsaw puzzle, also referred to as key-based encryption and files-splitting, respectively. Only the person in possession of the right key can decrypt the puzzle pieces and reconstitute the original file.\n performs secure files transfers. The service encrypts the user’s files on the browser itself using a secret code selected by the user. “Once encrypted, the contents of the files cannot be accessed by anyone, not even us,” states Radhakrishna Achanta, one of the co-founders. This is because cracking a well-chosen code takes a long time. It is similar to trying to open a safe by going through every possible combination of digits: it can be done, but it takes years. The level of security is similar to that of online banking, which requires two-level authentication. To reconstitute the document, the user has to enter the correct password, which is transferred by the sender via SMS or telephone.\nThe service is extremely easy to use. The user simply uploads a file, enters the email addresses of the sender and receiver, chooses a secret code, and clicks on “Send.” There are already several other approaches to keep online files safe. Some of them encrypt files during transmission, while others encrypt the data once it arrives on the storage server. “These schemes have their weaknesses,” explains Thomas Lochmatter, the other co-founder. “In the first case, the files are only encrypted during transmission, which means that they can be read before of after they are sent which is not secure enough, apart from being suscesptible to « man-in-the-middle » attacks.. In the second case, the company that stores the files has access to them. That means that its employees can read them.”\nThis “digital safe” also keeps data out of the hands of government authorities. According to the revelations in the American media in 2013, the National Security Agency and FBI has access to user data including chat conversations, images, videos, emails, and other documents stored by the nine largest IT companies. « Our solution provides end-to-end security, from the sender to the receiver, making files illegible for all others who do not possess the secret code », the founders emphasize.\nBuilding on the technology used for MakeSends, the start-up has developed two other solutions that provide data privacy protection to the users. The first one,  is a software solution that encrypts files before placing them on a cloud server by first enveloping them in a secure HTML file. The other product, , first splits each file into multiple pieces, much like a jigsaw puzzle, and encrypts and stores each fragment on one or several clouds.

{"id": 1775, "text": "The global North and South have differing climates, economies and infrastructure. And the technologies put to use there must be different too. Tech4Dev, a program set up by EPFL’s Vice Presidency for Innovation in partnership with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), aims to connect the School’s researchers with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in order to design and implement a targeted project in a country in the global South. The program, a spin-off of the Tech4Impact initiative, focuses on bridging the gap between theory and practice and accelerating research into cutting-edge technologies that could make a real difference to a huge number of lives in the developing world. The first four Tech4Dev grantees have been announced.\nThe selected projects are highly diverse: a process for making protective tarpaulins from biomass waste, a solar-hydrogen fuel cell for clean cooking, a robust incubator for newborns, and a 3D printer that turns plastic waste into assistive devices for people with disabilities.\nThe grantees were chosen by an international expert panel following a December 2019 call for proposals for groundbreaking technologies in fields including healthcare, transport, safety, energy, environment, disaster management and more. The four winners will each be funded for two years, up to a maximum of 300,000 Swiss francs. At least 40% of the budget will need to be disbursed in the global South. A second call will open in October 2020, when a further four projects will be awarded funding.\n“The main aim of the program is to take innovative ideas developed at EPFL and fast-track the route to practical application on the ground,” says Beatrice Scarioni, a member of the Tech4Dev management team.\nThe four projects at a glance:\nSustainable tarpaulins from biomass waste\nPlastic tarpaulins are incredibly versatile. For instance, they can be used to provide emergency shelter for people affected by natural disasters or humanitarian crises. Researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Sustainable and Catalytic Processing (LPDC) have developed a new technology to convert agricultural residues that would otherwise go unused into a 100% bio-based, fully biodegradable polyester. As part of the project, the team will test its invention by collecting waste from Bangladesh to be turned into polyester granules. These will then be spun into yarn and used to make tarpaulins. The partner is the NGO Medair.\nA sustainable cooking fuel\nFood cooking is an energy-intensive activity. Right now, most cooking fuels used worldwide – such as charcoal, wood, agricultural waste and animal dung – come from unsustainable sources and are associated with air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In order to counter this problem, a team at EPFL’s Laboratory of Renewable Energy Science and Engineering (LRESE) has devised a new type of stove that runs on solar hydrogen. The project, a joint initiative with the University of Yaoundé in Cameroon, combines both production and delivery. The researchers aim to design and install a solar hydrogen production plant, coupled with a storage solution to deliver the fuel to homes together with compatible stoves. As an interesting side effect, the combustion process produces drinking water.\nA robust incubator for Africa\nEach year, more than one million newborns die of hypothermia in their first month of life. Most of these premature deaths occur in developing countries. EPFL’s EssentialTech Center, which specializes in technology innovation for the global South, has designed a new kind of incubator that is particularly suited to use in these parts of the world. The robust machines, which require minimal maintenance, can withstand voltage fluctuations and power cuts and are impervious to the demands of hot, humid climates and high levels of environmental dust. The project is a collaborative effort with the Center for Public Health and Development (CPHD), which aims to bring innovative solutions to East Africa.\n3D-printed assistive devices for people with disabilities\nThe idea behind the 3D Printing for Peace (3DP4Peace) project, led by researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory for Processing of Advanced Composites (LPAC), is to improve waste management and recovery while delivering wider social benefits. More specifically, the team aims to develop a 3D printing system that can turn plastic waste into assistive devices for people with disabilities while at the same time supporting small business and job creation.

{"id": 1776, "text": "According to the European Commission’s Taxation and Customs Union, approximately 36 million counterfeits of all kinds were seized by European customs authorities in 2013. In 2008, the market for counterfeit and pirated goods represented several hundred billion dollars, according to the International Chamber of Commerce. These figures demonstrate the extent of a phenomenon that is facilitated by internet sales and easy access to production technologies. Companies are implementing various strategies to combat illegal copying, including the ability to authenticate their products. The ideal solution to this is to be able to verify products across the supply chain, all the way from producers, through carriers and customs to consumers.\nThe system developed by ScanTrust relies on a special QR code. At its center is a unique composition of several thousand pixels. At this level of precision, any attempt to copy codes results in a significant loss of information. An irreversible degradation of the original image is caused by toner that diffuses into the paper in a random manner. “Counterfeits can thereby be distinguished from original prints: they have lost some of the information of the complex structures,” says Justin Picard, CEO at ScanTrust, which is currently collaborating with several \n EPFL laboratories.\nAuthentication of these codes, which can be affixed to all kinds of materials, requires a smartphone application that was also developed by ScanTrust. The app uses an algorithm to automatically search for differences between originals and copies, with results appearing in seconds. These codes do not require complex technology to function. The system therefore has the advantage of being usable by the manufacturer, carriers, customs and retail outlets, as well as by the consumer.A software platform allows brands to manage, produce and analyze the codes and to protect their products independently.\nThe new generation of security systems, which are often costly, provide product traceability. The codes generated by ScanTrust do this at minimal cost. The codes are linked to a number and registered on a platform. When a logistics manager, a customs officer or a consumer scans a product, the information contained in the QR code, including its geolocation, is sent directly to the system. The producer and the distributor can thereby track their products throughout the supply chain. It should be noted that consumers can choose whether or not to share this \n tracking information.\n“Multiple solutions to identify fraudulent copies exist, but thus far none is satisfactory,” says Picard. “The most difficult to reproduce are expensive and require special equipment to control, while those that can be visually identified are easily reproducible.” Drawing on many years of work in the fight against counterfeiting, and as a recognized expert in the field by the OECD and the World Economic Forum, Picard returned to EPFL, where he did his post-doctorate, to start his business in 2013. His business partner Nathan Anderson is developing trade relations with China.\nThe company has the wind in its sails. It is about to raise 1,2 million francs round of initial seed funding led by AngelVest Group and SOS Ventures with participation from strategic partners in the packaging industry and select angel investors. ScanTrust’s partners and customers include both multinational Fortune 500 Companies as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, and this most recent round of funding will primarily go towards building out the product and engineering teams, as well as supporting on-going projects with existing customers and onboarding new customers.

{"id": 1777, "text": "In Switzerland, 50–60% of new homes are equipped with heat pumps. These systems draw in thermal energy from the surrounding environment – such as from the ground, air, or a nearby lake or river – and turn it into heat for buildings.\nWhile today’s heat pumps generally work well and are environmentally friendly, they still have substantial room for improvement. For example, by using microturbocompressors instead of conventional compression systems, engineers can reduce heat pumps’ power requirement by 20–25% (see inset) as well as their impact on the environment. That’s because turbocompressors are more efficient and ten times smaller than piston devices. But incorporating these mini components into heat pumps’ designs is not easy; complications arise from their tiny diameters (<20 mm) and fast rotation speeds (>200,000 rpm).\nAt EPFL’s Laboratory for Applied Mechanical Design on the Microcity campus, a team of researchers led by Jürg Schiffmann has developed a method that makes it easier and faster to add turbocompressors to heat pumps. Using a machine-learning process called symbolic regression, the researchers came up with simple equations for quickly calculating the optimal dimensions of a turbocompressor for a given heat pump. Their research just won the Best Paper Award at the 2019 Turbo Expo Conference held by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n1,500 times faster \n The researchers’ method drastically simplifies the first step in designing turbochargers. This step – which involves roughly calculating the ideal size and rotation speed for the desired heat pump – is extremely important because a good initial estimate can considerably shorten the overall design time. Until now, engineers have been using design charts to size their turbocompressors – but these charts become increasingly inaccurate the smaller the equipment. And the charts have not kept up to date with the latest technology.\nThat’s why two EPFL PhD students – Violette Mounier and Cyril Picard – worked on developing an alternative. They fed the results of 500,000 simulations into machine-learning algorithms and generated equations that replicate the charts but with several advantages: they are reliable even at small turbocompressor sizes; they are just as detailed as more complicated simulations; and they are 1,500 times faster. The researchers’ method also lets engineers skip some of the steps in conventional design processes. It paves the way to easier implementation and more widespread use of microturbochargers in heat pumps.\nThe benefits of microturbocompressors\n Conventional heat pumps use pistons to compress a fluid, called a refrigerant, and drive a vapor-compression cycle. The pistons need to be well-oiled to function properly, but the oil can stick to the heat exchanger walls and impairs the heat transfer process. However, microturbocompressors – which have diameters of just a few dozen millimeters – can run without oil; they rotate on gas bearings at speeds of hundreds of thousands of rpm. The rotating movement and gas layers between the components mean there is almost no friction. As a result, these miniature systems can boost heat pumps’ heat transfer coefficients by 20–30%.\n This microturbocharger technology has been in development for several years and is now mature. “We have already been contacted by several companies that are interested in using our method,” says Schiffmann. Thanks to the researchers’ work, companies will have an easier time incorporating the microturbocharger technology into their heat pumps.\nPaper related to this research in", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed a method that uses artificial intelligence to design next-generation heat-pump compressors.

The SwissTech Convention Center is a world-class tool for the exchange of knowledge through which our school can make critical contributions to solving major societal challenges,” explains André Schneider, Vice President of Planning and Logistics at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. He wants the new EPFL Convention Center to be far more than simply one of the most modern in the world. “As one of the few convention centers in Europe to be established on a university campus, it will also serve as smart conferencing lab – a place to experiment with the most innovative technologies for improving the flow of ideas in scientific conferences and making these exchanges more fruitful.”\nThe SwissTech Convention Center (STCC), inaugurated today, already offers delegates the very best in technical equipment. It is characterized in particular by extreme modularity. Its large auditorium can be automatically transformed, at will, from a 3,000-seat amphitheater to a banquet hall of more than 1800 square meters, thanks to the Canadian technology, “Gala Systems,” which ensures the metamorphosis in about 15 minutes. Multiple intermediate configurations offer event organizers unsurpassed flexibility. The ground floor offers the possibility of countless workroom configurations across an area of nearly 1500 square meters.\nAs evidence that it meets a clear demand not only from scientists but also many businesses, as well as local and international institutions, the Center is already almost completely booked through its first year of operation. “The interest of the business world is also of prime importance to us, because that will lead to greater technology transfer,” says André Schneider.\nNovel equipment and architecture\nIn addition to multimedia art facilities in each of its rooms, STCC is also equipped with smart displays whose content automatically adapts depending on location. These same screens can communicate with the mobile phones of participants in events, for example, by sending them papers for discussion.\nDesigned by Richter Dahl Rocha & Associés of Lausanne, STCC also uses several pioneering technologies. It is based primarily on posts, some of which operate simultaneously as geothermal heat pumps. Packed with sensors, they are developing this technology to save large amounts of energy. One of its facades is also covered with 300 square meters of transparent and colored photovoltaic solar collectors, which are based on the principle developed by EPFL professor Michael Grätzel. Financed entirely by Romande Energie, this innovative solar installation is a world first for a public building and a new realization in the partnership between EPFL and Romande Energie to develop a large-scale solar power plant and conduct research and development. The chromatic organization of the panels is the work of artist Catherine Bolle of Lausanne.\nAn innovative financing model\nThe financing of STCC is also pioneering. As part of a public-private partnership, two real estate funds, Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund LivingPlus (CS REF LivingPlus) and Credit Suisse Real Estate Fund Hospitality (CS REF Hospitality) assumed the entirety of the business contract – to the tune of 225 million Swiss francs. This amount also includes the construction of the Northern Quarter, a complex which brings together businesses, services, 516 student dorm rooms and the SwissTech Hotel, which adds to the Starling Hotel to complete the accommodations on offer in the campus’ immediate vicinity. EPFL is the sole tenant of the buildings, constructed on a plot that belongs to the Swiss Confederation with surface rights granted for a period of 99 years.

{"id": 1786, "text": "Crop diseases, a major cause of famine, have always been diagnosed by visual inspection, though microscopes and DNA sequencing are also used today. But the first line of defense is still the keen eye of farmers around the world, many of which do not have access to advanced diagnostics and treatment advice. To address this problem, scientists from EPFL and Penn State University are releasing 50,000 open access images of infected and healthy crops. The images will allow machine-learning experts to develop algorithms that automatically diagnose the disease of a crop. The tool will then be put into the hands of farmers – in the form of a smartphone app.\nThe entire world depends on a stable food supply. Global population is predicted to reach 9 billion by 2050, and the need for food security is becoming increasingly urgent. Meanwhile, crop diseases continue to plague humanity, causing mass starvations. The challenge, then, is to grow enough food while ensuring that we don’t lose it to pests and diseases.\nThe Irish potato famine alone (1845-1847) killed over a million people when the water mold ‎Phytophthora infestans caused a blight that decimated the country’s crop. Today, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that crop disease annually reduce potential yields by as much as 40%.\n and  are now fortifying the first line of defense against crop disease by exploiting the ubiquitous smartphone. The scientists are releasing an open-source database containing 50,000 images of infected and diseased plants.\nThe idea behind the initiative is to provide software developers with the “raw materials” to build machine-learning algorithms. Machine learning is a computational way of detecting patterns in a given dataset in order to make inferences in another, similar dataset. Fueled by breakthroughs in algorithm development, cheap computing, and cheap storage of very large data sets, the results of machine learning have permeated our everyday digital experiences, from face-recognition in photos and videos, to recommender systems in online shops.\nWhat Salathé and Hughes want to do is to apply these techniques that were developed by computer scientists to the problem of recognizing and diagnosing crop diseases. Algorithms with sufficient accuracy will be incorporated into smartphone apps, allowing farmers to snap pictures of their infected crops and get instant diagnosis and treatment advice.\nFor the two scientists, this is a natural evolution of their website, , one of the world’s largest free libraries of science-based knowledge on plant diseases. It covers 154 types of crops and over 1,800 diseases – and it's still growing. “In addition to being a library, PlantVillage is a network of experts who help people around the world find solutions to their problems,” says Marcel Salathé. \"Our goal is to let the smartphone do most of the diagnosis, so that human experts can focus on the unusual and difficult cases.\"\nThe smartphone app is the next step in this evolution, utilizing the imaging capabilities and connectedness of smartphones to automate the recognition of plant diseases. \"The beauty of the phone is that it penetrates society from community gardens in Brooklyn to smallholder farms in Burkina Faso,\" says David Hughes. With an expected 5 billion smartphones in the world by 2019, mobile apps have an enormous potential to transform how food is grown.\nThe bottleneck in the process is training algorithms to recognize diseased and healthy crops. Despite how affordable and accessible digital photography has become, finding enough publicly available images of crop diseases to train algorithms has been impossible until now.\n“By providing all these images with open access, we are challenging the global community in two ways,” says Hughes. “We are encouraging the crop-health community to share their images of diseased plants, and we are encouraging the machine learning community to help develop accurate algorithms.”\n\"The next step\", Salathé adds, \"is to combine the enormous expertise in data science around the globe with our open access data sets in the form of online competitions to develop the best algorithms to diagnose plant diseases. In the very near future, we'll launch the first online competition based on this growing data set that we make available today.\"\n “This is a truly exciting venture,” says Hughes. “The internet and mobile platforms have transformed many aspects of human society.

{"id": 1790, "text": "An especially counter-intuitive feature of quantum mechanics is that a single event can exist in a state of superposition – happening \nboth here and there\n, or \nboth today and tomorrow\n.\nSuch superpositions are hard to create, as they are destroyed if any kind of information about the place and time of the event leaks into the surrounding – and even if nobody actually records this information. But when superpositions do occur, they lead to observations that are very different from that of classical physics, questioning down to our very understanding of space and time.\nScientists from EPFL, MIT, and CEA Saclay, publishing in \nScience Advances\n, demonstrate a state of vibration that exists simultaneously at two different times, and evidence this quantum superposition by measuring the strongest class of quantum correlations between light beams that interact with the vibration.\nThe researchers used a very short laser-pulse to trigger a specific pattern of vibration inside a diamond crystal. Each pair of neighboring atoms oscillated like two masses linked by a spring, and this oscillation was synchronous across the entire illuminated region. To conserve energy during this process, a light of a new color is emitted, shifted toward the red of the spectrum.\nThis classical picture, however, is inconsistent with the experiments. Instead, both light and vibration should be described as particles, or quanta: light energy is quantized into discrete photons while vibrational energy is quantized into discrete phonons (named after the ancient Greek “\nphoto\n = light” and “\nphono\n = sound”).\nThe process described above should therefore be seen as the fission of an incoming photon from the laser into a pair of photon and phonon – akin to nuclear fission of an atom into two smaller pieces.\nBut it is not the only shortcoming of classical physics. In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition state, like the famous Schrödinger cat being alive \nand\n dead \nat the same time\n.\nEven more counterintuitive: two particles can become \nentangled\n, losing their individuality. The only information that can be collected about them concerns their common correlations. Because both particles are described by a common state (the wavefunction), these correlations are stronger than what is possible in classical physics. It can be demonstrated by performing appropriate measurements on the two particles. If the results violate a classical limit, one can be sure they were entangled.\nIn the new study, EPFL researchers managed to entangle the photon and the phonon (i.e., light and vibration) produced in the fission of an incoming laser photon inside the crystal. To do so, the scientists designed an experiment in which the photon-phonon pair could be created at two different instants. Classically, it would result in a situation where the pair is created at time \nt\n1\n with 50% probability, or at a later time \nt\n2 \nwith 50% probability.\nBut here comes the “trick” played by the researchers to generate an entangled state. By a precise arrangement of the experiment, they ensured that not even the faintest trace of the light-vibration pair creation time (\nt\n1\n vs. \nt\n2\n) was left in the universe. In other words, they erased information about \nt\n1\n and \nt\n2\n. Quantum mechanics then predicts that the phonon-photon pair becomes entangled, and exists in a superposition of time \nt\n1\nand\nt\n2\n. This prediction was beautifully confirmed by the measurements, which yielded results incompatible with the classical probabilistic theory.\nBy showing entanglement between light and vibration in a crystal that one could hold in their finger during the experiment, the new study creates a bridge between our daily experience and the fascinating realm of quantum mechanics.\n“Quantum technologies are heralded as the next technological revolution in computing, communication, sensing, says Christophe Galland, head of the Laboratory for Quantum and Nano-Optics at EPFL and one of the study’s main authors. “They are currently being developed by top universities and large companies worldwide, but the challenge is daunting. Such technologies rely on very fragile quantum effects surviving only at extremely cold temperatures or under high vacuum. Our study demonstrates that even a common material at ambient conditions can sustain the delicate quantum properties required for quantum technologies. There is a price to pay, though: the quantum correlations sustained by atomic vibrations in the crystal are lost after only 4 picoseconds — i.e., 0.000000000004 of a second! This short time scale is, however, also an opportunity for developing ultrafast quantum technologies. But much research lies ahead to transform our experiment into a useful device — a job for future quantum engineers.”", "summary": "Scientists from EPFL, MIT, and CEA Saclay demonstrate a state of vibration that exists simultaneously at two different times.

{"id": 1803, "text": "In the world of microscopy, this advance is almost comparable to the leap from photography to live television. Two young EPFL researchers, Yann Cotte and Fatih Toy, have designed a device that combines holographic microscopy and computational image processing to observe living biological tissues at the nanoscale. Their research is being done under the supervision of Christian Depeursinge, head of the Microvision and Microdiagnostics Group in EPFL’s School of Engineering.\nUsing their setup, three-dimensional images of living cells can be obtained in just a few minutes – instantaneous operation is still in the works – at an incredibly precise resolution of less than 100 nanometers, 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. And because they’re able to do this without using contrast dyes or fluorescents, the experimental results don’t run the risk of being distorted by the presence of foreign substances. \n Being able to capture a living cell from every angle like this lays the groundwork for a whole new field of investigation. “We can observe in real time the reaction of a cell that is subjected to any kind of stimulus,” explains Cotte. “This opens up all kinds of new opportunities, such as studying the effects of pharmaceutical substances at the scale of the individual cell, for example.”\nWatching a neuron grow\n This month in Nature Photonics the researchers demonstrate the potential of their method by developing, image by image, and the birth of a synapse, caught over the course of an hour at a rate of one image per minute. This work, which was carried out in collaboration with the Neuroenergetics and cellular dynamics laboratory in EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute, directed by Pierre Magistretti, earned them an editorial in the prestigious journal. “Because we used a low-intensity laser, the influence of the light or heat on the cell is minimal,” continues Cotte. “Our technique thus allows us to observe a cell while still keeping it alive for a long period of time.”\nAs the laser scans the sample from various angles, numerous images extracted by holography are captured by a digital camera, assembled by a computer and “deconvoluted” in order to eliminate noise. To develop their algorithm, the young scientists designed and built a “calibration” system in the school’s clean rooms (CMI) using a thin layer of aluminum that they pierced with 70nm-diameter “nanoholes” spaced 70nm apart.\nFinally, the assembled three-dimensional image of the cell, that looks as focused as a drawing in an encyclopedia, can be virtually “sliced” to expose its internal elements, such as the nucleus, genetic material and organelles.\nToy and Cotte, who have already obtained an EPFL Innogrant, have no intention of calling a halt to their research after such a promising beginning. In a company that’s in the process of being created and in collaboration with the startup Lyncée SA, they hope to develop a system that could deliver these kinds of observations in vivo, without the need for removing tissue, using portable devices. In parallel, they will continue to design laboratory material based on these principles. Even before its official launch, the start-up they’re creating has plenty of work to do - and plenty of ambition, as well.", "summary": "Two young EPFL scientists have developed a device that can create 3D images of living cells and track their reaction to various stimuli without the use of contrast dyes or fluorophores.", "claim": "1000 young EPFL scientists have developed a device that can create 3D images of living cells and track their reaction to various stimuli without the use of contrast dyes or fluorophores.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 0], "noise": false}
{"id": 1805, "text": "This unusual project – a wooden house fully designed and built by first-year architecture students – was launched in 2016 by architect and EPFL professor Dieter Dietz. Professor Dietz pushes the budding architects to stretch their imagination to the limits, while meeting the standards and constraints related to this type of building.\nHOUSE 2 follows on the heels of HOUSE 1. For this second round of the project, Dietz – who also heads EPFL’s ALICE laboratory – divided his students into groups of 15 and asked them to design the dozen or so rooms in the house. The catch this year was that all the wooden pieces had to fit together into a container. This is because the project is headed for Zurich: HOUSE 2 will be on display in the western part of the city, under a railway bridge near the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), from 30 May to 15 June. This marks an unprecedented collaboration between the city and EPFL; the wooden home will be open to the public throughout the exhibition.\nFacing a critical evaluation\nThe student’s dozen projects – ranging from a kitchen and tea bar to an artistic projection room, urban training turret, high-tech conference room, and rest area – have just passed their critical evaluation. Dietz and his team called on Rémy Meylan, an engineer specialized in wood construction, to carry out the assessment.\nMeylan had the difficult task of reminding the students who came up with the most daring designs of certain construction standards and technical constraints.\nMeanwhile, Dietz used the evaluation to encourage the students to improve their designs, pointing out their strengths but also their weaknesses and shortcomings. “You should see the constraints you face as opportunities, not problems,” Dietz said as his class was faced with a tricky structural problem related to building a staircase. The students set up 1:10 and 1:5 wooden models in the Rolex Forum to help them visualize the magnitude of the house, which will be some 50 meters long, and the various challenges they will need to overcome.\nAn educational project \nLike HOUSE 1, HOUSE 2 is above all an educational project. It requires students to first work in a group on one part of the house, then to collaborate with neighboring groups to ensure feasibility and coherence. The future architects also link theory to practice, acquiring first-hand experience by actually building the structure themselves. Finally, their projects need to account for real-world conditions, including the experience of passersby.\nHOUSE 2 will be partly pre-assembled on the EPFL campus between mid-April and mid-May.

{"id": 1809, "text": "Childhood traumas alone do not explain the development of domestic violence - at least in the case of rats. As part of a study conducted at EPFL, researchers from the Brain Mind Institute were able to show that purely biological elements played a crucial role in the development of aggressive behavior. This study has been published online in \nTranslational Psychiatry\n (a Nature Publishing Group journal).\nCarmen Sandi and her team’s research targets a deeper understanding of human domestic violence. \"But it is unimaginable to isolate human beings from social interaction to see the personality they would develop,\" indicates the researcher. Hence, she carried out experiments with rats in order to conduct her research.\n The experiment begins with male rodents who were exposed several times during their youth – that is, around puberty – to two types of psychological stress. They were thus subjected to short sessions in which they were put in a location without any place to hide, which they by nature dislike. On the other hand, researchers also exposed them to the characteristic odor of one of their natural predators, the fox.\nLike father, like son\n As adults, when these rats were put in contact with females, they showed a more aggressive behavior towards them than their peers who had not been stressed during adolescence. But the most interesting part was still to come. \"The male offspring of these stressed rats showed an aggressive behavior towards females, just like their fathers had done\", Carmen Sandi continues \"and yet our protocol had allowed us to eliminate any 'social influence' as the rat couples had been separated before the birth of their offspring.\"\nFor researchers, this demonstrates that certain behavioral traits are rooted in biological factors and not only in social ones like imitating a role model.\nMany possible explanations\n As for the females subjected to stressed males, they went through considerable behavioral, hormonal and neurological changes. The other females, put into relationships with only second generation aggressive males - who accordingly had not been directly stressed - showed exactly the same characteristics. This proves that the violence they suffered translated into long-term damage which was not exclusively psychological.\nIn the wake of this research, several additional studies will try to explain more accurately the mechanisms at work. The reasons for the transmission of aggressiveness in males could be epigenetic (inherited changes in the expression of certain genes), or might be related to physiological changes in the mother during pregnancy, observed after exposure to an aggressive male. An imperceptible deficit of maternal care in the offspring’s first days of life could also play a role in some cases, but the study in question only took into account families where such care did not differ from the one provided by an unstressed mother.\nIt would obviously be risky to immediately extrapolate these results to humans. Many analogies could, however, \"lead us to revise the way we regard the origin of the development of domestic violence as exclusively psychological and social\", Carmen Sandi explains. If biological factors do not explain everything, they constitute nevertheless a heavy legacy, which may favor drifting towards such kinds of behaviors. \"From this knowledge, we can work to develop treatments that would be able to block the expression of this biological transmission,\" the researcher concludes.", "summary": "In an experiment carried out with rats at EPFL, it was observed that aggressive behavior passed from one generation to the other, even without any contact between the parent and its offspring.

{"id": 1819, "text": "Imagine yourself on a plane the evening before a symposium sifting through hundreds of presentation abstracts to decide which presentations to attend. How can you be sure that you won’t miss a talk relating to your field of research? Three students at the EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences have invented a software application called TrailHead, which uses a visualization system to sort through this information. With their software application, Jonas Arnfred, Amine Mansour and Yannik Messerli have found a way to target presentations according to specific scientific interests. Already used at symposiums, the TrailHead web interface received 1,472 visits in 2012.\nAn algorithm as a magical formula\n In order to sort through a large group of presentations, the students developed an algorithm based on text recognition and semantic analysis. Jonas Arnfred, the student who initiated the project, enthusiastically explains: “One of the exciting aspects of TrailHead is that we had to combine several methods from different disciplines – such as automatic text extraction, automatic learning or graphic design – to produce a very concrete tool.” The first step was to gather the various articles on individual presentations to be given at the same symposium. The next step was to automatically convert these articles into raw data that could be recognized by the future software application.\nAmine Mansour, who later joined the project, continues: “It was not an easy matter to find an algorithm that could calculate similarities between articles and therefore link the presented subjects to specific research fields.” He first tested an algorithm that could detect word similarities and calculate the number of occurrences of the same terms in these texts. It later became apparent that an additional algorithm was needed to assess lexical fields so that groups of words associated with the same research field could be identified.\nA well-designed and practical visualization system\n Instead of producing a copious list of dozens of presentation abstracts, the application proposes a map of the various presentations linked according to subject matter. “The difficulty of this method of visualization was to make it both intuitive and fluid,” explains Yannik Messerli, who set about creating a web interface that would be compatible with the greatest possible array of peripherals. “An algorithm graphically outputs the conference presentations to make closely related subjects appear grouped together.”\nTrailHead generates a personalized symposium schedule\n Once you have selected the desired research field(s) and have clicked on the presentations that the software application suggests that you attend (based on the criteria selected), TrailHead allows you to generate a personalized symposium schedule and choose from among various options (e.g. add presentation abstracts to schedule). It also has a feature that lets you synchronize your schedule with your electronic agenda.\n“We have continuously worked to improve this software application by introducing more powerful search filters as well as other features. The project has been quite an undertaking – 2 years – and has enabled us to earn a living during most of our studies. We are very thankful to our Professor, , for having guided and supported the project,” explains Yannik. Amine adds: “The interesting aspect is that we were given the opportunity to create a specific tool from start to finish and now this tool is being used by the scientific community.”\nIndeed, TrailHead was used for the first time in 2012 at the International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), which included 700 presentations and over 1,000 participants. The TrailHead web interface received 1,472 visits, with a peak in traffic of 563 hits five days before the start of the symposium. TrailHead was also used by participants in the Information Theory and Applications (ITA) 2013 symposium as well as in the ISIT 2013 symposium.\nIn the future, TrailHead could also prove useful to participants at festivals, enabling them to choose from among the various cultural events, concerts or open-air films over the summer.

{"id": 1835, "text": "Hydrogen is often touted as the fuel of the future. But because this gas is highly explosive, it must be stored and transported under pressure in specialized and expensive containers. Hydrogen therefore has issues in terms of safety, logistics, and profitability that could significantly limit its wider use. However, a solution might lie in research by EPFL scientists, who have developed a simple system based on two chemical reactions. The first reaction transforms hydrogen into formic acid, a liquid that is easy to store and less flammable than gasoline, while the second reaction does the reverse and restores the hydrogen. Another possible application of their technology would be to use atmospheric CO\n2\n to synthesize a number of useful chemical products.\nGabor Laurenczy’s team has already developed a process for transforming formic acid into hydrogen gas. The method was the subject of several articles, one of which appeared in Science, and it is currently under industrial development. But a complete and coherent system would also require the inverse process: transforming hydrogen into formic acid. This has now been achieved, completing the cycle, thanks to the financial support of EOS Holding. The scientists in Laurenczy’s team have described the process in a Nature Communications article.\nThe researchers synthesized formic acid in a single step, starting with hydrogen and atmospheric CO\n2\n. Conventional methods to accomplish this involve several steps, which are complicated to carry out and generate undesirable chemical byproducts.\nThe two chemical reactions – hydrogen to formic acid and back to hydrogen - are catalytic: the advantage is that nothing is lost in the transformation, and the process can thus be used in constructing sustainable devices.\nWith their two catalytic reactions, the researchers now possess all the technology they need to build a complete, integrated device. Laurenczy envisions small energy storage units in which the current from photovoltaic cells produces hydrogen by electrolysis, which is then transformed and stored as formic acid, and finally transformed back into hydrogen to produce electricity at night-time. “Our procedure is simple enough that it can be implemented at the domestic level,” he says.\nAnother possible application of this technology would be to use atmospheric CO\n2\n, a greenhouse gas, as a building-block for chemical synthesis. Formic acid is the basis of numerous organic syntheses, e.g. in the textile industry.

{"id": 1838, "text": "By combining a gold alloy with boron carbide, an extremely hard ceramic that’s used in bulletproof vests, a team of EPFL researchers has succeeded in making the world’s toughest 18-karat gold (75% gold). With a Vickers hardness number of 1000, it’s harder than most tempered steels (600 Vickers) and thus almost impossible to scratch, except with a diamond. This discovery is the result of a three-year collaboration between the Mechanical Metallurgy Laboratory in EPFL’s Institute of Materials, under the leadership of Professor Andreas Mortensen, and the Swiss watchmaking company Hublot. \n Infiltration under pressure\n The process for developing this material is relatively complicated. Powdered boron carbide is heated to almost 2000°C, where it forms a rigid, porous structure by a process called sintering. A liquid molten alloy of gold is infiltrated under very high pressure into the pores of this structure, and then solidified, yielding a pore-free composite material. The final material is thus made up of two kinds of crystals that are intimately interconnected in space, like two three-dimensional labyrinths. Because the molten gold used is a previously-made alloy based on 24-karat gold and aluminum (3%) for strength, the final gold is thus 3% aluminum, 75% gold and 22% boron carbide\n . \nOvercoming the 18-karat limit\n By definition, gold is very soft. Managing to harden it to this degree while still maintaining 18-karat purity was a real challenge for the EPFL scientists. They overcame the obstacle by taking the ceramic-metal composite approach. Composite materials are created by artificially combining several materials that conserve their individual characteristics even after they’re assembled. In this they are different from alloys, in which atoms mix together to form a new, homogeneous, material. \n Check it out at BaselWorld\n The EPFL researchers aren’t the first to play around with different materials in an effort to make more resistant gold. They are, however, the first to have attained this degree of hardness in 18-karat gold.

{"id": 1841, "text": "Tuberculosis continues to be a global pandemic, second only to AIDS as the greatest single-agent killer in the world. In 2013 alone, the tuberculosis bacterium \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n caused 1.5 million deaths and almost nine million new infections. Resistance to tuberculosis drugs is widespread, creating an urgent need for new medicines. EPFL scientists have now identified lansoprazole, a widely used, over-the-counter antacid, as an excellent candidate against tuberculosis. The study is published in \nNature Communications\n.\nIt takes well over ten years for a new tuberculosis drug to complete these trials and be approved for human use. Meanwhile, traditional antibiotics have led many strains of tuberculosis bacteria to evolve multi-drug resistance. Millions of new chemical compounds have been tested for their ability to disrupt the growth of M. tuberculosis in the test tube, but discouragingly few are currently in clinical trials.\nBut we can speed this process up. Compounds that have already been approved for use in humans could be repurposed as anti-tuberculosis medications, and cut down both the time and cost of new drug development.\nScreening against tuberculosis\nThis is the strategy adopted by Stewart Cole's lab at EPFL. The assay uses a robotized system that gives candidate drugs to cultured lung cells that have been infected with \nM. tuberculosis\n. Robotized \"high-throughput screens\" like this are a growing trend in drug development as they can work through massive libraries of candidate drugs quickly and accurately in a day, as opposed to the months required by manual methods.\nThe EPFL researchers used a method they had previously developed, which can reflect what happens when the bacterium infects a lung much better than conventional screening assays used in tuberculosis research. The scientists screened a large panel of already approved drugs, and identified the blockbuster antacid lansoprazole, known commercially as Prevacid\n®\n, as a potential anti-tuberculosis medication.\nA new use for an old drug\nLansoprazole was found to be effective against \nM. tuberculosis \nbut only when the bacterium grows inside cells. The researchers investigated the underlying biology and found that lansoprazole kills the bacterium after the human cells convert it into a sulfur-containing metabolite.

{"id": 1842, "text": "How do you make the leap from a novel idea to a factory-made product? That’s the question four groups of students from EPFL, UNIL and ECAL set out to answer at the second . Under this program spearheaded by EPFL, the students spent 16 days in Hong Kong and Shenzhen learning about the different steps involved in making a prototype. By the end of the Camp, four groundbreaking devices were developed and then unveiled in a presentation to the public this fall. “It was an impressive achievement, because the students had an average of only one day a week to work on their projects,” said Marc Laperrouza, head of the CHIC program.\nBecoming a musician without an instrument\nOut of the students’ four innovations,  is the most fun. This system includes two sensor-equipped drumsticks, an accelerometer and a gyroscope that let you play the drums virtually. It also comes with an application, so you can record your songs, run a metronome or play with other users through a multi-player feature. “With Tikku, we are targeting more the games market than the market for simulators,” said the students, who plan on continuing the development work alongside their studies. \nAnother invention, , is a food container that lets you take meals with you and heat them up on the go. This wireless, battery-powered device can be programmed using a smartphone application. “Too many people wolf down a sandwich at lunch because they’re short on time. We wanted to develop a practical system that lets people eat a hot meal, even when they’re away from home,” said Chenyue Xu, a materials engineering student at EPFL and part of the group that came up with Hibachi.\nSharing your mailbox\nThe third innovation is , which lets people exchange items through a secure physical mailbox using a virtual key sent via an application. The device is affordable and sturdy, and can be tailored to any type of mailbox. It’s a clever system that can be used in an entire neighborhood or at a university, for example, to set up a common post box.\nAnd the fourth, , aims to make cycling safer with a connected bicycle helmet equipped with an audio GPS and turn signals. “By improving bike riders’ safety, we hope more people in cities will switch to cycling as a means of transportation,” said Audrey Marullaz, a microengineering student.\nWhile each of the four projects was unique, the students all faced some of the same challenges. “The hardest part was learning to work together despite our very different ways of seeing things,” said Victor Guittet, a student at ECAL. “And the language barrier was a big hurdle when we were in China. We had to be creative and come up with inventive work-arounds. It was a great learning experience.”\nThe 2017 Camp kicked off this fall with a workshop attended by 45 students from EPFL, UNIL, ECAL and UNIGE.

A team of scientists from EPFL and the company Amazentis have shown how a molecule in pomegranates, transformed by microbes in the gut, enables muscle cells to protect themselves against one of the major causes of aging. In nematodes and rodents, the effect is nothing short of amazing. The discovery was published in \nNature Medicine\n in July, and human clinical trials are currently underway.\n28.07.16 – Is antivirus software already dead? That’s certainly what George Candea believes, and he’s not the only computer security expert who says so. Together with some of his former PhD students, the EPFL professor founded \nCyberhaven\n, a startup that is developing a brand new approach to computer security. Their idea is to neutralize malware instead of trying to block it. Cyberhaven’s solution safeguards sensitive documents together with the relevant applications in a safe haven. The firm – whose R&D is carried out at Innovation Park – raised 2.7 million dollars in July.\n25.08.16 – Can solar energy be stored for periods when the sun doesn’t shine? Using commercially available solar cells and none of the usual rare metals, researchers at EPFL and CSEM have now designed a device that outperforms in stability, efficiency and cost. Their promising system converts the energy into hydrogen through water electrolysis. It uses the electrical current produced by a solar panel to ‘split’ water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The clean hydrogen can then be stored away for future use to produce electricity on demand, or even as a fuel. Their research was published in \nJournal of the Electrochemical Society\n in August.\n07.09.16 – With a 36% yield, the solar panels developed by startup Insolight could deliver up to twice as much energy as traditional panels. These results, which could represent a world record, were validated on a prototype in August by an independent lab. The new system uses a flat and very thin device to focus the sun’s rays on the tiny surface area of very high performance cells, and therefore deliver exceptional efficiency.\n06.10.16 – Stand up. Take a few steps. Change direction. Climb some steps. Navigate around an object on the ground. Sit back down. Most people take these everyday movements for granted, but for people with paraplegia, they’re simply impossible. All that may change now thanks to an exoskeleton called TWIICE. This walking assist device, developed entirely at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory (LSRO), was used at the 2016 Cybathlon – the first competition for disabled athletes who use various assistive technologies – which took place in Zurich on 8 October.\n14.10.16 – Scientists may have found an unexpected ally in the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. A research team led by EPFL has discovered a microbial community that lives naturally hundreds of meters underground – in the very rock layers that have been chosen to host Swiss nuclear waste. A study published in \nNature Communications\n in October shows that the bacteria consume the hydrogen that accumulates as the steel canisters bearing the waste corrode. If left unchecked, this hydrogen could affect the integrity of the host rock. By tweaking the design of nuclear waste repositories, the bacteria could be used to make them safer.\n01.11.16 – Winter resorts will need to increase their density to prevent their decline. A number of Switzerland’s ski resorts are reaching a point of saturation, with peak-time traffic jams, buildings popping up in avalanche zones, and general encroachment upon the natural surroundings. While the current trend is to stop construction, an EPFL doctoral thesis suggests that the opposite might actually be necessary: we need to invest in these regions, increase their density, and ensure seamless public transportation to and from them. PhD student Fiona Pià has offered concrete and innovative solutions for Verbier, a typical example of the problems that winter resorts face today.\n09.11.16 – In June 2015, a primate with a spinal cord injury regained control of its paralyzed leg with the help of a neuroprosthetic system called the “brain-spine interface” that bypassed the lesion, restoring communication between the brain and the region of the spinal cord. “This is the first time that neurotechnology has restored locomotion in primates,” said neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine, who led the collaboration and holds the IRP chair in spinal cord repair. “But there are many challenges ahead and it may take several years before all the components of this intervention can be tested in people.”\n10.11.16 – Examining diseased red squirrels from England, Ireland and Scotland, scientists at EPFL and the University of Edinburgh have discovered that the same bacteria that cause leprosy in humans also infect red squirrels. About a century ago, leprosy in Europe virtually disappeared, at least among humans. Their study, published in \nScience\n in November, shows how a pathogen can remain undetected in the environment after it has been cleared from the human population.\n30.11.16 – Shipping vaccines in an unbroken temperature-controlled supply chain (a ‘cold chain’) all the way to recipients is a major logistical and financial challenge in remote areas and developing countries. According to Doctors Without Borders, the need to keep vaccines within a temperature range of 2-8°C is one of the main factors behind low immunization-coverage rates. Researchers at EPFL’s Supramolecular Nanomaterials and Interfaces Laboratory, in collaboration with scientists in Milan, Turin, Leiden and Oregon, have come up with three simple and inexpensive vaccine additives to get around this obstacle. They were able to stabilize vaccines at room temperature for several months.\n14.12.16 – By mid-December 2016, EPFL startups had raised a total of CHF 397 million for the year. That's 50% more than in 2014, when the figure reached CHF 242 million. Spin-offs – companies founded as a result of technology developed in an EPFL lab or created by a campus researcher – saw the largest increase in funding. They raised CHF 261 million, including CHF 100 million for Mindmaze alone. Other companies located in EPFL’s Innovation Park raised CHF 76 million, and AC Immune began trading on Nasdaq, adding a further CHF 60 million.

You’ll be able to touch and move real-world objects just like their virtual counterparts. And if you look down, you’ll see your fingers; your virtual hands will reproduce even the slightest movement. This kind of unparalleled immersive experience is exactly what Hugo Hueber, a Bachelor’s student in computer science at EPFL, is aiming to create through an enhanced VR video game he is working on as part of his project.\n“My goal was to develop a video game that combines the latest technology with the 3D interactive research we’re carrying out at the lab. That will let video gamers interact physically with a virtual environment that can be transferred to any location – a living room, office or even classroom – instantly,” says Hueber.\nThat requires first measuring real-world objects like a chair and then modeling and calibrating them in the video game, which can be done in just a few clicks. Once this is done, players can use the object in the game at the same time as they physically touch it with their fingers. Achieving this was a formidable technical challenge for the Master’s student, but it seriously enhances the immersive experience for users.\nSeeing your fingers in 3D\nAnother feature of Hueber’s technology is that it improves users’ perception of their fingers, further blurring the line between virtual and reality. His system doesn’t require a joystick – a piece of equipment that lessens the sense of reality. Rather, users can see each of their fingers and move them with a great deal of precision, for instance tapping them together or picking up an object with ease. And that’s not all – by placing sensors on their bodies, users can see themselves move inside a video game. “The system tracks the sensors’ movements and generates real-time images of those movements as they affect different parts of the body. That means users will have the impression of being fully immersed in a video game, since their physical movements will be synchronized directly in the game,” adds Hueber.\nVideo games are useful for research, too \nHueber’s project is just one application of the research carried out over the past few years by the, headed by Ronan Boulic.

{"id": 1853, "text": "As our society becomes increasingly connected, cyber threats – whether in the form of stolen data, attacks on key infrastructure or large-scale hacking – represent a growing risk. Countering these threats requires specific expertise, and the need for well-trained experts is surging. This need was identified in the “National strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks (NCS) 2018-2022”. To help address this critical issue and promote the training of IT security specialists and research in the area of cyber security, EPFL and ETH Zurich, with the support of the Swiss government, are teaming up to offer a new joint Master’s degree in Cyber Security starting in the 2019-20 school year.\n\"Switzerland has been long recognized for its strengths in terms of reliability and trust. We have an outstanding education system, with two federal institutes of technology, ETH Zurich and EPFL, which are among the best in the world. Our universities and institutes of higher education are also at the forefront in many domains. It is in the light of these attributes that Switzerland can, and must, play a leading role in cyber security\", says Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin, Head of the Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research.\nThis new Master’s program was presented on Tuesday 19 March at a press conference attended by Federal Councilor Guy Parmelin, EPFL President Martin Vetterli and ETH Zurich President Joël Mesot. “Through this joint program, we are combining our two schools’ strengths in what is a vital industry for our country. We can build upon a strong track record in cyber security going back to 2003 when the Zurich Information Security and Privacy Center was installed at ETH,” says Joël Mesot.\nEPFL President Martin Vetterli shares Mr. Mesot’s assessment: “EPFL has been investing in cyber security research for over ten years, drawing on highly qualified professors in cryptography, privacy and personal-data protection. By joining forces, we will equip engineers with cutting-edge skills in this important discipline and establish Switzerland as a leader in digital trust.”\nThis will be Switzerland’s first university-level degree program in Cyber Security – a booming field with excellent job prospects. “Soon every company above a certain size will need to hire a cyber security manager. And they aren’t the only ones that will have to protect themselves – countries are also vulnerable. As digitalization takes hold, critical infrastructure like power generation and distribution will be increasingly targeted by cyberattacks,” says Professor Mark Pauly, who heads up the program at EPFL.\nThe program will start in the fall of 2019. The topics covered will include cryptography; hardware, software and network security; and methods for ensuring system security and earning user trust. The courses will incorporate practical components and address not just the technical aspects of cyber security, but also the ethical, legal and business challenges of a field that affects just about every aspect of our lives. The goal will be to equip IT security engineers with the full range of fundamental and applied skills they need to remain at the forefront of their profession. “Students will be able to choose from a wide range of courses at both ETH Zurich and EPFL. And once they graduate, they will have excellent career opportunities, whether in industry, the public sector or research,” says Professor Peter Müller, who is in charge of the program at ETH Zurich.\nCourses will be given in English. Students can select whether to follow the program at EPFL or ETH Zurich – the two schools’ admission processes will be coordinated – but they must complete one semester at the other school. The program will be structured slightly differently at the two schools, but the skills taught and the number of credits (120) will be the same. The diploma will bear the logos of both schools.\nThe program is intended primarily for students with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology or communication systems. But students with Bachelor’s degrees in other disciplines can also apply provided they have the necessary prerequisites. The admission process for the program is similar to that for other Master’s degrees at the schools, and runs from 16 January to 15 April for EPFL and 1–31 March for ETH Zurich.", "summary": "The two technical universities have teamed up to offer a new Master’s program that will train cyber security engineers.

{"id": 1857, "text": "Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have many advantages over their silicon-based counterparts. They offer transparency, low cost, and high power conversion efficiencies under cloudy and artificial light conditions. However, until now their overall efficiency has been lower than silicon-based solar cells, mostly because of the inherent voltage loss during the regeneration of the sensitizing dye. In a \nNature \npublication, EPFL scientists have developed a state solid version of the DSSC that is fabricated by a new two-step process raising their efficiency up to a record 15% without sacrificing stability.\nThe new solid-state embodiment of the DSSC uses a perovskite material as a light harvester and an organic hole transport material to replace the cell's electrolyte. Typical fabrication of this new DSSC involves depositing a perovskite material directly onto a metal-oxide film. The problem is that adding the entire material together often causes wide variation in the morphology and the efficiency of the resulting solar cell, which makes it difficult to use them in everyday applications.\nMichael Grätzel's team at EPFL has now solved the problem with a two-step approach: First, one part of the perovskite is deposited in to the pores of the metal-oxide scaffold. Second, the deposited part is exposed to a solution that contains the other component of the perovskite. When the two parts come into contact, they react instantaneously and convert into the complete light-sensitive pigment, permitting much better control over the morphology of the solar cell.\nThe new method raises DSSC power-conversion efficiency up to a record 15%, exceeding the power conversion efficiencies of conventional, amorphous silicon-based solar cells. The authors believe that it will open a new era of DSSC development, featuring stability and efficiencies that equal or even surpass today's best thin-film photovoltaic devices.", "summary": "Dye-sensitized solar cell efficiency has been raised to a record 15% thanks to a new fabrication process developed by EPFL scientists.", "claim": "Dye-sensitized solar cell efficiency has been raised to 15% 15% thanks to a new fabrication process developed by EPFL scientists.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 11], "noise": false}
{"id": 1861, "text": "A group of scientists in EPFL’s Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces, under the leadership of EPFL professor Michael Grätzel, has improved the efficiency of the famous Grätzel solar cells to 12.3%. This performance is now comparable to silicon-based solar panels that are on the market today. And the costs of using this technology have come down slightly. Their results appeared in an article in the November 4 issue of Science magazine.\nThe challenge was to increase the efficiency of the dye-sensitized cells, in order to produce more electricity. To do this, the chemists replaced the standard dye components – ruthenium and iodine – with porphyrin and cobalt. This combination allows them to increase the absorption of sunlight and results in a more efficient electron exchange. It’s this exchange of electrons from the dye to the substrate that produces electricity.\nGrätzel cells mimic the process of plant photosynthesis, and these new dye-sensitized cells take the imitation even closer -- the new chemical combination gives them a greenish tint. This color increases the efficiency of the process that converts light energy into electricity. To get the most out of the light coming from the Sun, the cell absorbs the colors of the spectrum with the highest energies and rejects the rest, which includes the green wavelengths.\nGrätzel cells can be used to create flexible, transparent solar panels. They’re a promising alternative for certain applications in which traditional rigid, silicon-based panels cannot be used. In addition, this new efficiency benchmark brings them well within the efficiency range of silicon cells: the theoretical maximum efficiency of Grätzel cells is now 30%, compared with 26% for silicon.\nSource:\nPorphyrin-Sensitized Solar Cells with Cobalt (II/III)–Based Redox Electrolyte Exceed 12 Percent Efficiency\n, Aswani Yella, Hsuan-Wei Lee, Hoi Nok Tsao, Chenyi Yi, Aravind Kumar Chandiran, Md.Khaja Nazeeruddin, Eric Wei-Guang Diau, Chen-Yu Yeh, Shaik M Zakeeruddin, Michael Grätzel, \nScience\n, Vol. 334 no. 6056 pp. 629-634, 4 novembre 2011.\nLink:", "summary": "Dye-sensitized Grätzel solar cells have just set a new efficiency benchmark.

{"id": 1872, "text": "A large proportion of the energy consumed – between 20% to 50%, according to some studies – is dispersed as heat. Although it is already possible to recycle heat at temperatures over 150 degrees to produce electricity or to heat homes, the rest is simply released into the environment. At a time when companies are forced to be concerned with their environmental impact, this deficiency must be remedied. The start-up OsmoBlue, based in EPFL’s Laboratory of Microsystems, developed a process based on the principle of osmosis to convert heat over 30 degrees into electricity.\nOsmosis is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the concentration between two solutions separated by a membrane differs, for example between saltwater and freshwater. A stream flows from the less concentrated to the more concentrated solution, which tends to balance the concentrations on each side of the membrane. The mechanical energy of this stream may be converted into electrical energy by a turbine and an alternator. Heat is again used to separate the fluid into two separate solutions, one of which is more concentrated than the other. It is, therefore, a closed circuit (see image) that does not consume water. Though this concept has attracted significant investment, it has struggled to become a reality due to low yields.\nThe OsmoBlue technology is advantageous because it can be implemented with any heat source: air, water, gas, etc. The efficiency of the machine is both dependent on temperature and the nature of the hot and cold sources (air, water, gas, or steam). Connected on one side to the heat source and the other to the power grid, modular systems could eventually be installed in existing structures, near the company’s cooling system.\nWith a team of seven people, the young entrepreneur has completed a digital laboratory demonstrator and a digital model for evaluating the performance of the product. \"For example, it allowed us to estimate that 10 megawatts of heat could produce between 100 and 600 kilowatts of electricity, the consumption of one hundred homes.\"\nIt was during a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University in the United States that Elodie Dahan had the idea to revisit the method of osmosis. Components have been revised in light of recent advances in materials engineering and microtechnology. A first prototype is currently being manufactured at EPFL. A pilot unit on a larger scale could then be installed in a regional waste incineration company in 2014.", "summary": "Soon, it will be possible to produce electricity from heat over 30 degrees emitted from a waste incinerator, refinery, or data processor.

More than 200 people in India, Kenya and Tanzania who attended the workshop are already receiving the economic and health benefits of this ingenious system and are enjoying daily light through this process.\nUsing kerosene poses many problems. Financial problems are first: the $2–$3 per week spent on fuel often represents 20% of a family’s budget. Health is of equal concern: kerosene is extremely toxic when burned, and daily use equals the inhalation of smoke from 40 cigarettes, often increasing the risk of serious lung diseases, according to a recent study by the University of Berkeley. At the global level, this releases 265 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Added to this is the danger of the device itself, which causes severe burns on millions of people each year.\nThe development of a new light source for third world countries faces two recurring problems: cost and long-term integration into everyday life. Govinda Upadhyay, PhD student in the Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory, had the bright idea to develop this bare-bones but effective lamp. Designed to be made by anyone, these lamps require nothing more than locally-found equipment. Only the solar panels are ordered from abroad. Five to six hours of charging in the sun is enough to give four to five hours of light.\nThere is no patent to impede the widespread use of the system developed by the researcher. Only an electric cable, mobile phone battery, an on / off switch and LED are needed. The shade can be customized, made with empty bottles or boxes of various shapes. The design has already been field tested since the founder of the start-up and his team – Elisa Wepfer, Vincenzo Capogna, Naomi Savioz and Parag Rastogi – have already visited several regions in India, Tanzania and Kenya to disseminate their knowledge. The young doctoral candidate relies on these globetrotters to spread the word.\nThe materials needed for making 100 lamps weighs 1kg – easy to fit in a carry-on. “Globetrotters who like to mix business with pleasure can attend a day of training with the start-up in Switzerland,” he says. “They then go share this new knowledge with a village in a developing country for three days before going on vacation. It adds a humanitarian touch that fans of traveling off the beaten track appreciate.”\nTo best address the concept of sustainable development among beneficiaries and thereby foster their understanding of the importance of solar energy, Govinda has developed a lesson plan centered on the lamp. Using concrete examples, it starts by creating an awareness of the negative affects of the kerosene lamp on health and the environment, so that people understand why it is important to change this part of daily life. It also addresses the recycling of waste related to lamps. The second day of the workshop is devoted to learning lamp assembly. Each person will then be able to teach this new method to other members of the community. “It is important that the know-how also comes from the people themselves, that they take ownership of the system so that it is not simply an element imported from rich countries that they soon forget. Three days is all it takes to train a village to manufacture these lamps.”", "summary": "The solar lamp developed by the start-up LEDsafari is a more effective, safer, and less expensive form of illumination than the traditional oil lamp currently used by more than one billion people in the world.

{"id": 1878, "text": "Have the Swiss government’s lockdown measures been effective in stemming the pandemic? That’s the question a team of EPFL researchers set out to answer by analyzing data dating back to 28 February, the day the Swiss government banned groupings of over 1,000 people. This initial restriction was followed by a series of others that culminated in a ban on groupings of over five people, introduced on 20 March. “It’s essential for policymakers to be able to quantify how effective these measures are in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, so that they can make the right decisions for both this pandemic and future ones,” says Jacques Fellay, the study’s coauthor. Fellay, a medical researcher at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences, also sits on the Swiss federal government’s COVID-19 scientific advisory board. The team’s findings\nTheir method involves using an epidemiological model to calculate the virus’s “basic reproduction number,” or R\n0\n, over the course of the pandemic on both a national and cantonal level. The model uses detailed data on over 1,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Vaud as well as publicly available information on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in Switzerland. “We were fortunate to have access to key data such as the length of hospital stays – including in intensive care units – which isn’t always the case in this type of study. That allowed us to tailor our model to the specific clinical conditions in Switzerland,” says Joseph Lemaitre, a PhD student at EPFL’s Laboratory of Ecohydrology and the study’s lead author.\nThe research team found that on a national level, R\n0\n fell from 2.8 at the start of the pandemic to 0.4 in early April – a decrease of 86%. Looking at individual cantons, R\n0\n dropped between 53% (in Jura) and 92% (in Basel-Stadt). The reduction in people’s movements was measured using smartphone data: trips for work, shopping and recreational activities fell between 50% and 75% on a national level and between 30% and 80% on a cantonal level. The researchers also found a strong correlation between a reduction in people’s movements and a decrease in R\n0\n, even though this rate actually started declining a few days before people began changing their habits.\nCaption:\n R\n0\n time series calculated by the researchers’ model. Median = dashed line; interquartile range = dark grey; 95% confidence interval = light grey. 1 = ban on groupings of more than 1,000 people; 2 = closure of schools; 3 = closure of all non-essential businesses; 4 = ban on groupings of more than 5 people. / J. Lemaitre et al., SMW, 2020\nAccording to the study, R\n0\n began falling on 6 March – at least one week before Swiss schools were officially closed. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health rolled out its COVID-19 information campaign on 28 February and updated it on 2 March with a heightened focus on personal hygiene measures. This campaign raised awareness about the gravity of the situation and prompted people to follow the government’s personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations. As a result, R\n0\n started falling before the recommendations became mandatory. “R\n0\n was already close to 1 when the government banned groupings of more than five people and asked that everyone stay at home. Of course, that may be partly due to the fact that people saw those requirements coming and changed their behavior accordingly – by adopting social distancing measures, for example – even before the official announcement, as suggested by data on internet searches,” says Lemaitre.\nThe researchers’ model indicates that 3.9% of the Swiss population has been infected by the new coronavirus (as of 24 April), with cantonal rates ranging from 1.9% in Bern to 16% in Ticino.\nCaption: \nPercentage of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland up to 24 April.

Lemaitre et al., SMW, 2020\nNow that the lockdown measures are gradually being lifted, the research team plans to publish their R\n0\n estimate daily. Tracking this metric closely will be essential since the spread of the virus can only be slowed through people’s behaviors, and not by waiting until we achieve herd immunity – which is still far off. “Will we see a rise in infections now that restaurants and shops are opening back up? Could that rise be contained through a more aggressive testing and tracing strategy? And how helpful are masks?” says Fellay. “We still don’t have the answers to those questions – which is why we must track epidemiological indicators closely. Daily R\n0\n figures will be a useful guide for public-health policymakers in the coming months. Researchers can help by continually enhancing their models with new data, such as the results of the serological tests that are being carried out or the more detailed information we now have on how COVID-19 develops in clinical patients.”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have modeled the effects of measures taken in the country to slow the spread of coronavirus.

{"id": 1881, "text": "2D materials, which consist of a few layers of atoms, may well be the future of nanotechnology. They offer potential new applications and could be used in small, higher-performance and more energy-efficient devices. 2D materials were first discovered almost 15 years ago, but only a few dozen of them have been synthesized so far. Now, thanks to an approach developed by researchers from EPFL's Theory and Simulation of Materials Laboratory (THEOS) and from NCCR MARVEL for Computational Design and Discovey of Novel Materials, many more promising 2D materials may now be identified. Their work was recently published in the journal \nNature Nanotechnology\n, and even got a mention on the cover page.\nThe first 2D material to be isolated was graphene, in 2004, earning the researchers who discovered it a Nobel Prize in 2010. This marked the start of a whole new era in electronics, as graphene is light, transparent and resilient and, above all, a good conductor of electricity. It paved the way to new applications in numerous fields such as photovoltaics and optoelectronics.\n\"To find other materials with similar properties, we focused on the feasibility of exfoliation,” explains Nicolas Mounet, a researcher in the THEOS lab and lead author of the study. \"But instead of placing adhesive strips on graphite to see if the layers peeled off, like the Nobel Prize winners did, we used a digital method.\"\nMore than 100,000 materials analyzed\nThe researchers developed an algorithm to review and carefully analyze the structure of more than 100,000 3D materials recorded in external databases. From this, they created a database of around 5,600 potential 2D materials, including more than 1,000 with particularly promising properties. In other words, they've created a treasure trove for nanotechnology experts.\nTo build their database, the researchers used a step-by-step process of elimination. First, they identified all of the materials that are made up of separate layers. \"We then studied the chemistry of these materials in greater detail and calculated the energy that would be needed to separate the layers, focusing primarily on materials where interactions between atoms of different layers are weak, something known as Van der Waals bonding,\" says Marco Gibertini, a researcher at THEOS and the second author of the study.\nA plethora of 2D candidates\nOf the 5,600 materials initially identified, the researchers singled out 1,800 structures that could potentially be exfoliated, including 1,036 that looked especially easy to exfoliate. This represents a considerable increase in the number of possible 2D materials known today. They then selected the 258 most promising materials, categorizing them according to their magnetic, electronic, mechanical, thermal and topological properties.\n\"Our study demonstrates that digital techniques can really boost discoveries of new materials,\" says Nicola Marzari, the director of NCCR MARVEL and a professor at THEOS. \"In the past, chemists had to start from scratch and just keep trying different things, which required hours of lab work and a certain amount of luck. With our approach, we can avoid this long, frustrating process because we have a tool that can single out the materials that are worth studying further, allowing us to conduct more focused research.\"\nIt is also possible to reproduce the researchers' calculations thanks to their software AiiDA, which describes the calculation process for each material discovered in the form of workflows and stores the full provenance of each stage of the calculation. \"Without AiiDA, it would have been very difficult to combine and process different types of data,\" explains Giovanni Pizzi, a senior researcher at THEOS and co-author of the study. \"Our workflows are available to the public, so anyone in the world can reproduce our calculations and apply them to any material to find out if it can be exfoliated.\"", "summary": "A team from EPFL and NCCR MARVEL has identified more than 1,000 materials with a particularly interesting 2D structure.

Building A was officially opened in 1993 and has since been joined by 12 others. That building is today being renamed to honor the memory of Claudine and Bernard Vittoz, who founded EPFL Science Park and were generous benefactors.\nEPFL Innovation Park (EIP) currently houses more than 2,250 employees, 26 large companies, 116 start-ups and more than 75 entrepreneurial projects at the incubator stage – all this on the edge of a campus containing some 340 laboratories. These are impressive figures given that the science park's first seed was planted only 25 years ago.\nIn 1991, when EPFL President Bernard Vittoz launched the Science Park Foundation, he was a pioneer. His ambition was to create a space that would stimulate innovation and the transfer of technology by bringing start-ups and companies close to the university campus, its researchers and students. In 1993, there was the official opening of Building A, the first in a blossoming complex that now features 13 buildings. That marked the creation of Switzerland's first science park, which was renamed EPFL Innovation Park in 2014.\nA new name\nOver its 25-year history, Building A has housed more than 100 start-ups. Today, after an impressive refurbishment, it is celebrating its anniversary by adopting a new name. As a tribute to Bernard Vittoz, as well as his wife Claudine who recently left part of her estate to the Foundation, the building now bears their names. “Professor Vittoz was a visionary who understood very early on the importance of physical proximity between researchers and entrepreneurs,” remembers Jean-Philippe Lallement, CEO of the EPFL Innovation Park Foundation. “His drive and charisma allowed the plan to take shape and develop. Mrs. Vittoz also gave the plan her wholehearted support.”\nThe anniversary is also an opportunity for EIP to continue its development, in order to maintain its appeal and address the needs of its various user communities as effectively as possible. “EPFL Innovation Park is now almost full, so it’s important that we foster the innovative spirit of the companies we have here. A key part of our efforts is to create spaces that encourage interaction and provide opportunities to meet,” explains Marc Gruber, chairman of the EPFL Innovation Park Foundation.\nThe aim is to foster contact between entrepreneurs and researchers, both formally and informally, by creating meeting areas and organizing events. The Foundation plans to create a walkway that shows how scientific ideas born in EPFL’s laboratories have made their way to market.

This center will develop interactive “helper” robots, a new generation of intelligent machines that perform tasks for people in their everyday environments and safely co-exist with them. And while most of today’s robots are designed according to engineering concepts used for manufacturing plants, they are not optimal for building robots that have to perform in a home environment. To achieve the grand goal of developing helper robots, fundamental breakthroughs in technology, materials, and control methods will be required. An NCCR constitutes an ideal and timely platform for creating the desired synergies bearing the potential of a quantum leap in robotic technology and further strengthening Switzerland’s already strong international position and visibility in human-oriented robotics. The NCCR will capitalize on the Swiss tradition in micro-engineering, precise manufacturing, and human-friendly technology, creating tremendous opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer at a point in history when developing robots with a human orientation is in a situation strategically similar to that of the nascent personal-computer industry 30 years ago.\nNCCR “Synaptic bases of mental diseases”\n This NCCR targets an open dialogue between researchers in neuroscience and psychiatry through common projects. By creating a platform for cutting edge technology in brain imaging, genetics, and behavior studies, the center will explore the molecular and cellular origins of mental illness. In an intense collaboration between researcher and clinicians from the Lake Geneva region (EPFL, UNIL, UNIGE, and CHUV) as well as several groups from Basel, this NCCR will set up an important center that will educate experts of a new generation—psychiatrists with a solid background in the neurosciences.\nNCCR “Chemical Biology”\n The goal of this new center is to use new chemistry techniques to study the living organism. Contrary to traditional biochemistry, where researchers work on extracted cells, the scientist working at this NCCR will explore living cells in their environment thanks to recent developments in diagnostic tools. One of their goals will be to concentrate on cell signaling, a field of research that promises to discover the early mechanisms that lead to certain diseases.

This is what a new smartphone app, “Mobile Observatory,” developed by EPFL’s Distributed Systems Laboratory, is proposing. Currently still in the prototype stage, the invention could be available to the public in the near future.\nRecently tested in Zurich with a group of volunteers, the application allows users to consult, with a single click and in real time, the levels of certain pollutants in specific areas of the city. The information comes from a network of sensors installed on the roofs of several trams, in the context of a project called OpenSense that has been conducted over the past three years in Lausanne and Zurich by four EPFL and ETH Zurich laboratories.\nPublic transportation is the ideal platform from which to collect this kind of data: it provides mobile, reliable, predictable, and complete coverage of a given area. In addition the system gives the application another advantage by providing data that are more precise and targeted than those based on fixed stations. Its operation in real-time also makes it possible to give instantaneous warnings when pollution levels change unexpectedly.\nThe information provided is particularly useful to those who suffer from respiratory disease, or on days when cloud cover causes the concentration of fine particulates to increase. “A person with asthma could check at what time the pollution will be at its lowest level in his or her neighborhood, and plan to run errands at that time, or a jogger could choose the place and time where ozone levels are lowest to go running,” suggests PhD student Julien Eberle, one of the application’s designers.\nOpen the windows!\nAt the moment, ten sensors are roaming around Zurich.
