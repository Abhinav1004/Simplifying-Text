{"id": 0, "text": "Even though silicon is one of the most abundant elements, the energy required to make silicon from sand is immense. It is for this reason, but also to reduce manufacturing costs, that Professor Christophe Ballif and his team from the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory at the EPFL have been working for several years on thin-film silicon solar cells that are a thousand times thinner than conventional cells.\nThere’s just one catch: the thinner the cells, the less they absorb the rays of the sun and the less electricity they produce. So researchers are trying to trap light in the thin silicon layers to increase their absorption. Traditionally, thin layers of zinc oxide—a material that is very abundant, completely non-toxic, and that grows in the form of small pyramid-shaped crystals—are used for this purpose. These crystals scatter light efficiently into the underlying silicon layer. With such zinc oxide layers, even a new world record cell efficiency was achieved.\nReducing costs\nBut scientists are attempting to beat this record. “It is difficult to modify the natural pyramidal shape of these crystals in order to obtain even better light scattering,” explains researcher Corsin Battaglia, “so we had the idea to force the crystals to grow on a different support, an inverted mould with the desired structure.” The idea is as ingenious as it is simple. Once the thin layer of zinc oxide is deposited on the mould all that needs to be done is to “demould” it—as you would a tarte tatin, for example—to obtain a film with the desired structure.\nThis procedure, described in the September edition of the journal Nature Photonics, not only increases the amount of light that is trapped, thereby increasing output, but it also has the potential to reduce the cost of the cells because of its compatibility with mass production. These are interesting arguments at a time when photovoltaics is seeking to produce electricity at a lower price than the current grid price.", "summary": "Do better with less.

{"id": 1, "text": "Gone are the days when the United States and the Soviet Union competed to achieve firsts in spaceflight capability – first in space, first to the moon. That golden age cast a decades-long shadow over space exploration. But that is all changing now, not least with the arrival of new players on the scene. The EPFL Space Center (eSpace) is marking UN World Space Week, the annual October celebration that officially starts today, with a clear statement of its intent to capture the opportunities offered by this decisive turning point.\neSpace, founded in 2014, is expanding and redefining its research priorities with the launch of a new initiative dubbed Sustainable Space Logistics. The move is part of the unit’s ambitious plans to become a center of excellence in equipment and data for space exploration, and in the development of lasting, sustainable space infrastructure.\n“There’s growing talk in space circles of mankind returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent base there,” says eSpace director Jean-Paul Kneib. “But before we can do that, we need to think long and hard about how we design consumables – energy, fuel, water and food – from the standpoint of both recycling and sustainability.”\nIn recent years, more and more governments have launched space programs. Countries like China and India are rising rapidly up the list of world space powers. But the biggest change has been the arrival of private companies on the scene. Firms like SpaceX and EPFL spin-off Astrocast are now sending their own rockets and satellites into space, bringing incredible energy and ground-breaking ideas to the table.\nSatellite constellations\nIn the new space age, satellites are becoming ever smaller – and smarter. Looking ahead, it seems as though satellite constellations are the future, with smaller devices such as CubeSats operating in tandem and forming a robust network that covers more of the Earth’s surface. This development owes much to advances in Internet of Things (IoT) systems.\n“It’s incredible to see how fast technology is evolving,” says Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace who specializes in space debris. “We’re on the cusp of the space research 4.0 era.”\nSince the world’s first satellite was launched over 60 years ago, space has become increasingly cluttered with junk – thousands of pieces of debris ranging from tiny paint chips to rocket stages and entire obsolete satellites. All that debris orbiting the Earth poses a major collision risk, with serious implications for space exploration. In fact, the problem has become so acute in recent years that scientists are having to rethink mission design with junk in mind. The need for sustainable solutions has never been greater.\nSought-after expertise\nEPFL is ideally placed to make the most of this new landscape. “Our skills and expertise are exactly what the space industry is looking for,” says Sonia Ben Hamida, a researcher who recently joined the eSpace team. “In many respects, it’s the perfect fit.”\neSpace’s logistics services could support operations and activities across a broad spectrum of fields, ranging from transport, storage, packaging and distribution, to location, telecommunications, navigation, repair and resupply. Other potential applications include in-orbit manufacturing and assembly, drilling, human presence, surveillance, cleaning, recycling – and more.\nTechnologies developed for other applications by various EPFL labs and startups – especially in microengineering, electronics and robotics – could also be repurposed for use in the space industry. Examples include solar radiation and cosmic ray protective equipment, cleaner propulsion systems, next-generation transport vehicles, and space robots designed to capture junk or move objects around in space. And, of course, artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize viewing, tracking, orientation recognition, and in-orbit assembly systems.\neSpace will define its research priorities after consulting with the European Space Agency (ESA), the Swiss Space Office and other bodies. Pending that decision, manufacturers, scientists, students and other interested parties are invited to contact the center to express their interest.\nTo get in touch with the Sustainable Space Logistics initiative, please write to: \nEPFL Space Center invite participants of all ages, from all around the world to take part in an essay competition to introduce new ideas on the topic of how to develop space logistics services, in a sustainable way:", "summary": "Things are changing in outer space: it is filling with debris, attracting private companies, and raising new technological challenges.

{"id": 6, "text": "Is there life on a distant planet? One way astronomers are trying to find out is by analyzing the light that is scattered off a planet’s atmosphere. Some of that light, which originates from the stars it orbits, has interacted with its atmosphere, and provides important clues to the gases it contains. If gases like oxygen, methane or ozone are detected, that could indicate the presence of living organisms. Such gases are known as biosignatures. A team of scientists from EPFL and Tor Vergata University of Rome has developed a statistical model that can help astronomers interpret the results of the search for these “signs of life”. Their research has just been published in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nSince the first exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun – was discovered 25 years ago, over 4,300 more have been identified. And the list is still growing: a new one is discovered every two or three days. Around 200 of the exoplanets found so far are telluric, meaning they consist mainly of rocks, like the Earth. While that’s not the only requirement for a planet to be able to host life – it also needs to have water and be a certain distance from its sun – it is one criterion that astronomers are using to focus their search.\nIn the coming years, the use of gas spectroscopy to detect biosignatures in planets’ atmospheres will become an increasingly important element of astronomy. Many research programs are already under way in this area, such as for the CHEOPS exoplanet-hunting satellite, which went into orbit in December 2019, and the James-Webb optical telescope, scheduled to be launched in October 2021.\nStarting with an unknown\nWhile much progress has been made on detecting exoplanetary biosignatures, several question marks remain. What are the implications of this kind of research? And how should we interpret the results? What if just one biosignature is detected on a planet? Or what if no biosignatures are detected – what should we conclude? Those kinds of questions are what the EPFL-Tor Vergata scientists set out to answer with their new model.\nTheir work tackles the problem from a new angle. Traditionally, astronomers have looked for life on another planet based on what we know about life and biological evolution on Earth. But with their new method, the scientists started with an unknown: how many other planets in our galaxy have some form of life. Their model incorporates factors like the estimated number of other stars in the galaxy similar to the Sun and how many telluric planets might be orbiting within a habitable distance from those stars. It uses Bayesian statistics – particularly well suited to small sample sizes – to calculate the probability of life in our galaxy based on how many biosignatures are detected: one, several or none at all.\n“Intuitively it makes sense that if we find life on one other planet, there are probably many others in the galaxy with some type of living organism. But how many?” says Amedeo Balbi, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics in Tor Vergata’s Physics Department. “Our model turns that intuitive assumption into a statistical calculation, and lets us determine exactly what the numbers mean in terms of quantity and frequency.”\n“Astronomers already use various assumptions to evaluate how credible life is on a given planet,” says Claudio Grimaldi, a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPMC) who is also affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Rome. “One of our research goals was thus to develop a method for weighing and comparing those assumptions in light of the new data that will be collected over the coming years.”\nSpreading from one planet to another\nGiven the small number of planets that will likely be examined in the near future, and assuming that life will emerge independently on any one planet, the EPFL-Tor Vergata study found that if even just one biosignature is detected, we can conclude with a greater than 95% probability that there are over 100,000 inhabited planets in the galaxy – more than the number of pulsars, which are objects created when a massive star explodes at the end of its life. On the other hand, if no biosignatures are detected, we cannot necessarily conclude that other forms of life do not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.\nThe scientists also looked at the theory of panspermia, which states that instead of emerging independently on a given planet, life forms could be carried over from another planet – such as through organic matter or microscopic organisms being carried on comets or spreading between neighboring planets. This implies that the probability of life on a planet also depends on how far it is from other planets and how easily various life forms – whose physical characteristics could be extremely different from those we are familiar with – are able to resist the extreme conditions of space travel and adapt to the new planet. Factoring in panspermia alters the inferred number of inhabited planets elsewhere in the galaxy.", "summary": "One way to determine whether there is life on another planet is to look for biosignatures in the light that is scattered off its atmosphere.

{"id": 8, "text": "Before cell division, the long strings of the cell’s DNA are wrapped tightly into the structures we know as chromosomes. This protects the cell’s genetic material from physical and chemical damage.\nThe ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. These are specialized structures that have to be replicated with each cell division cycle. But the complete replication of telomeres up to the very ends of chromosomes also requires specialized mechanisms, and these are limited. Telomeres are also very sensitive to oxidative damage, which affects their ability to replicate.\nBecause of this, telomeres shrink over time, limiting the lifespan of cells. Telomere shortening is essentially the cause of cell aging.\nNow,  and Wareed Ahmed at EPFL have discovered two antioxidant enzymes that work together to prevent oxidation of telomeric DNA at chromosome ends. The scientists disrupted both the enzymes, called PRDX1 and MTH1, in cancer cells, and found that the cells’ telomeres shrunk with every round of cell division, eventually disappearing altogether.\nOne of the promising targets in cancer therapy is the enzyme telomerase. Normally, telomerase prevents telomeres from shortening in germ and stem cells, which helps with development. But telomerase is also highly active in cancer cells, keeping their telomeres intact and making the cells virtually immortal. The new work shows that disrupting PRDX1 and MTH1 prevents telomerase from counteracting telomere shortening.\nSo far, attempts to efficiently block telomerase in cancer have not been fruitful in the clinic. The discovery of the co-operating enzymes opens up a new opportunity to indirectly block telomerase. “Instead of inhibiting the enzyme itself, we target its substrate – the chromosome end – making it un-extendable by telomerase,” says Lingner.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have identified two enzymes that protect chromosomes from oxidative damage and shortening.

Hopefully without harm, and it will soon be forgotten.\nBut for the longer-term studies, Asteroid Vesta is a kind of movie star for planetologists. With 500 km in diameter, it is one of the three largest objects of the asteroid belt that formed simultaneously to the solar system we live in, four billion years ago. It is considered a “protoplanet” or a precursor of a planet. Moreover, it is the only known asteroid to have an earth-like structure – with a core, mantle and crust.\nComputer simulation reconstructs collisions between asteroids \n Using a three-dimensional computer simulation, Martin Jutzi from the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern has now accurately reconstructed how Vesta collided with other asteroids twice over a billion years ago. The models show that the protoplanet owes its elliptical shape to these collisions and that they also scarred its surface structure. They are presented in a study published today on the front page of \nNature \nmagazine.\nThe simulations also enable detailed conclusions on the composition and properties of Vesta’s interior to be drawn for the first time, which helps us to better understand the evolution of the solar system. «Based on the sort and distribution of this material at the surface of the asteroid, we are able to precisely reconstruct the various inner layers of Vesta down to a depth of 100 km», explains Philippe Gillet, head of EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory.\nBased on this information, the computer simulations demontrarte exactly how two consecutive impacts of celestial bodies led to the formation of the observed overlapping basins, which almost span the entire southern hemisphere of Vesta. The models show the size (66 and 64 kilometres in diameter), velocity (5.4 kilometres per second) and the impact angle of the bodies that collided with Vesta. This reveals a lot about the properties of the objects that were near the protoplanet a billion years ago.\nThe final images of the simulations closely resemble the shape and topography of Vesta’s southern hemisphere as observed by the Dawn mission. The models even accurately reproduce the spiral-shaped structures inside the youngest crater which are visible on images from the Dawn mission. «This shows how reliable our method is», rejoices Jutzi. “It also proves that the method we used to determine the composition of Vesta’s inner layers are accurate, adds Gillet.

{"id": 19, "text": "Primary liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with current treatments being very limited. Liver cancer cells are particularly addicted to the amino acid glutamine, which fuels their proliferation. EPFL scientists have now found that a liver protein called “liver receptor homolog 1” (LRH-1) is responsible for the digestion of glutamine into smaller molecules, which are avidly consumed by liver cancer cells. Therefore, blocking LRH-1 causes cancer cells to starve and greatly reduces the development of liver cancer in mice, while preserving normal cells. The discovery is published in \nGenes & Development\n, and can introduce new drugs that target LRH-1 to effectively treat liver cancers.\nLRH-1 is a receptor in the cell nucleus, where it regulates the expression of various genes. In this study, scientists from different groups at EPFL led by , discovered that LRH-1 coordinates several key genes that are involved in the metabolism of glutamine – an amino acid to which liver cancer cells become addicted. The researchers found that LRH-1 drives the development of liver tumors by helping cancer cells to convert glutamine into molecules that are directly needed for proliferation.\nThis would also mean that disrupting the function of LRH-1 in the liver of mice would protect against the development of liver cancer. That is exactly what the scientists found when they studied mice that had been genetically modified to not express LRH-1 – so called “knockout” mice. After exposing them to chemical carcinogens, the livers of knockout mice showed dramatically less development of tumors. “Shutting down this pathway by inhibiting LRH-1 abrogates the utilization of glutamine as a fuel and brings the cancerous cells in tremendous metabolic distress,” says Pan Xu, the first author of the study.\nBased on the study, LRH-1 could be a new drug target to prevent the development of liver cancer. Because cancer cells, unlike normal cells, are very often addicted to glutamine, drugs that inhibit glutamine metabolism have been proposed as new highly efficient chemotherapy agents.\n“Inhibiting LRH-1 can thus be an effective way to starve only liver cancer cells, while leaving normal cells intact,” says Kristina Schoonjans. Her lab is now actively trying to identify new chemotherapeutic agents to treat liver cancer by developing specific compounds that inhibit LRH-1. The researchers also hope that these findings may extend to other types of cancer, since LRH-1 is also abundant in the pancreas and ovaries.\nThis work involved a collaboration of Kristina Schoonjans’ lab with EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering and Institute of the Physics of Biological Systems, and the University of Groningen.

{"id": 22, "text": "The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.\nThey realized that one building in particular – the Saint-François parking lot – was at the core of the problem. This building links the city center with the Flon neighborhood, meaning that it could play a strategic role in turning downtown Lausanne car-free. So they decided to expand and completely transform it. “Our building holds a restaurant, a co-op market with local products, and a hotel that offers medium-term accommodations such as for artists, conference-goers and businesspeople,” says Flavien Davin. “There would also be common spaces and a co-working area to promote interaction between these groups.”\nThe students also added a public staircase along the side of the building. “We felt that this ‘patchwork building’ deserved an important role, as it sits above one of Lausanne’s public transport hubs,” says Bernard Valette, co-author of the study. “Currently, people who use the parking lot do not have direct access to the various means of public transport beneath the building. Our aim was to better coordinate the building’s different purposes.”\nPedestrian zone and distribution depots\nTheir project also encompasses the Flon train station, which is the third largest in French-speaking Switzerland in terms of passenger numbers. “Our vision was to transform the downtown area, between the Flon neighborhood and Saint-François, into a huge pedestrian zone. That would require expanding the public transport system and totally redesigning the city’s logistics,” says Valette. The students’ project takes into account the future M3 metro line, which will strengthen the link between the north and south of the city, as well as the future tram line that will connect the western side of the city to its center. They would add yet another tramline, between Morges and Lutry, in order to relieve throughtraffic south of the city.\nMaintaining the flow of goods to stores and residents in a car-free city center would require some radical thinking. For this, the students designed three major ‘automated distribution depots’ in the city through which all goods headed for downtown stores and residents would pass. These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.\nAccording to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.\nChanges ahead \nIs all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”\nSolving two problems at once\nThe students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”", "summary": "A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035.

But these systems can be expensive to set up and take down – and they can’t adapt to the water surface as evaporation causes it to change size and shape,” says Jamie Paik, the head of EPFL’s  (RRL) and a professor at the School of Engineering. Researchers from RRL, working in association with a scientist from Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Chile, have developed a water-preservation system tailored specifically to Chile’s winegrowing region as part of a project sponsored by EPFL’s .\nRobust, flexible and modular origami robots\nTheir system involves robots that look like little floating tiles. Powered by embedded solar panels, they can assemble themselves automatically on the water surface and move as it changes size and shape. “The idea isn’t necessarily to cover the entire water surface but to have the robots follow the sun and avoid shady spots. That means the robots would continuously cover places where the water evaporates – and it would minimize the number of robots needed,” says Paik. \nResearchers are also looking into other ideas, such as using floating robots not to cover the water surface but to unfold and fold up a tarp automatically based on the shape of the water surface. These robots would be much easier to move around than plastic balls or a mounted tarp and could automatically adapt to changes in water levels. What’s more, the solar energy generated by the researcher’s robots could be a boon to sunny regions.

The temperature and amount of sunlight in the country’s regions can vary drastically from one day to the next, resulting in substantial fluctuations in water-reservoir shapes and making existing methods ineffective. Many of Chile’s vineyards are run by cooperatives of small families that can’t afford to invest in complicated, costly systems.

{"id": 26, "text": "In recent years optical fibers have served as sensors to detect changes in temperature, like a thermometer, and pressure, like an artificial nerve. This technique is particularly useful in structures such as bridges and gas pipelines.\nEPFL researchers have now come up with a new method that enables optical fibers to identify whether they are in contact with a liquid or a solid. This is achieved by simply generating a sound wave with the help from a light beam within the fiber.\nThis study was conducted by the Group for Fibre Optics (GFO) run by Luc Thévenaz within the School of Engineering and has been published in \nNature Communications\n.\nA sensor that doesn’t disturb the light\n No wider than a strand of hair, an optical fiber made of glass transmits light that varies according to four parameters: intensity, phase, polarization and wavelength. These parameters are altered when the fiber is stretched or the temperature changes, enabling the fiber to act like a sensor by detecting cracks in structures or abnormal temperatures. But up to now it was not possible to determine what was happening around the fiber without having light escape the fibre, which disrupts its path.\nThe method developed at EPFL uses a sound wave generated inside the fiber. It is a hyper-frequency wave that regularly bounces off the fiber’s walls. This echo varies at different locations depending on the material the wave comes into contact with. The echoes leave an imprint on the light that can be read when the beam exits the fiber, making it possible to map out the fiber’s surroundings. This imprint is so faint that it hardly disturbs the light propagating within the fiber. The method could be used to sense what is going on around a fiber and send light-based information at the same time.\n The researchers have already immersed their fibers in water and then in alcohol, before leaving them out in the open air. Each time, their system was capable of correctly identifying the change in the surroundings. “Our technique will make it possible to detect water leakages, as well as the density and salinity of fluids that come into contact with the fiber. There are many potential applications,” says Thévenaz.\nSpatial and temporal detection\n These changes in the surroundings are located thanks to a simple time-based method. “Each wave impulse is generated with a slight time lag. And this delay is reflected upon the beam’s arrival. If there were any disturbances along the way, we can both see what they were and determine their location,” explains Thévenaz. “For the moment, we can locate disturbances to within around ten meters, but we have the technical means to increase our accuracy to one meter.”\nThe idea of using a sound wave in optical fibers initially came from the team’s partner researchers at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

{"id": 27, "text": "“I was really surprised, when doing this research, to find that 50% of spin-outs don’t necessarily establish themselves near the parent company,” observes EPFL professor Christopher Tucci. In an article appearing this summer in the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, he demonstrated that new companies often also choose to set up shop thousands of kilometers, or even continents, away from their parent companies. He looked at U.S.-based international companies specializing in hard disk technology, drawing upon a database of information on 400 U.S. counties. Tucci is familiar with these constant changes taking place in the business environment, because he has been studying them for many years. So why do these companies choose to either stay close to home or head for the horizon?\nWhy stay? \n In the early 2000s, the so-called “agglomeration theory” from evolutionary economics hypothesized that an entrepreneur always chooses to stay in proximity to the parent company, in order to tap into group advantages. This decision allows a new company working in the same sector to benefit from the stability and solidity of the parent company and from on-site provider and client networks. “Our study shows that companies who choose not to move away have more aggressive strategies, and to succeed, they need to maintain local relationships. We also found that those who decide to stay within a restricted perimeter are technologically much more advanced than other spin-outs, but financially quite similar,” Tucci adds.\nWhy move away?\n Companies who decide to leave aren’t banking on technological innovation, but instead are looking for new markets. “Thanks to this study, we now understand better how spin-outs position themselves in the market. In both cases, the companies from which they have spun out often become their principal clients.”\n Another theory, not confirmed by the study, is the “spillover” theory. It hypothesizes that stronger companies don’t want to establish spin-outs in industrial clusters because of “spillovers:” they fear that their ideas or technologies will spill over and be stolen by neighboring competitors. “But this effect can’t be clearly seen from the database we used in this research,” notes Tucci. \n He also observed that the spin-outs that stay typically generate new spin-outs themselves. Tucci points to the case of IBM: “Almost all the big hard disk companies came from IBM.” Its first spin-out was Seagate Technology, created in 1978 by Al Shugart and Finis Conner, a company that manufactured embedded hard disks in Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox. It set up R&D sites in Silicon Valley and then branched out to Northern Ireland and Singapore.

{"id": 29, "text": "Can a home run entirely on solar facades? Apparently so, according to NeighborHub, a house designed and built for the 2017 Solar Decathlon by Swiss students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg (HEIA-FR), the Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD Genève) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR). With NeighborHub, the students wanted to show that it makes both practical and economic sense to install solar panels on a home’s facade – thereby maximizing the surface area put to use – even though sunlight can sometimes struggle to penetrate urban areas. “Unlike rooftops, facades are more likely to be in the shade since other buildings can block the sunlight,” says Philippe Couty, the engineer coordinating the project for HEIA-FR. “That could sharply reduce the amount of power that solar panels generate. But we wanted to show that solar energy can indeed be produced on facades, even in areas packed with a lot of buildings.” The project team went about searching for technology that could prove them right. Peter Cuony, head of solar power systems at Groupe E Connect and a member of the project team from the very beginning, came up with the idea of using power optimizers. The students found that these optimizers fit the bill perfectly, and they installed one in each panel to continuously monitor and adjust the solar panels’ performance.\nMaximizing each panel’s output\n In conventional solar power systems, the panels are connected in series, which means each one can generate only as much energy as the lowest-producing one. Power inverters, taking their cue from the least productive panel, convert the direct current into the alternating current that the home can use. But this method can be a major handicap for the efficiency of solar panels installed on building facades, since the weakest link (e.g. the most shaded panel) could pull down the entire system’s power generation. And that was exactly what happened before the power optimizers were installed on each panel. “Even if each panel has a different level of sun exposure and consequently generates a different amount of energy, the optimizers draw on the instantaneous maximum power generation of each panel, regardless of how much sunlight they do – or don’t – receive,” says Victor Saadé, an EPFL electrical engineering student who is leading the project group responsible for solar panels.\nAchieving energy independence\n Thanks to this novel way of using existing technology, NeighborHub can run entirely on the power generated from its facade-installed solar panels. It even generates more energy than it needs. What’s more, its rooftop remains free for other purposes, like promoting biodiversity – the space can be used to cultivate a variety of plants.\nThe energy independence achieved by the one-story house offers encouraging prospects for residential buildings. Each story could generate enough power for its own needs. That could be a major benefit for cities that are growing vertically.\n“Our house demonstrates that it is possible to produce enough energy for an entire building using solar panels installed only on the building facades,” says Cuony.\nNeighborHub’s open house next Saturday will give the public a unique opportunity to check out the next-generation house before it heads off to the Solar Decathlon competition, which will be held in Denver from 5 to 15 October 2017.\nNeighborHub open house at a glance\n “\nNeighborHub ready to head off to the United States\n”\n Saturday, 10 June 2017, 10am to 5pm\n Smart Living Lab, Halle bleue, blueFACTORY, Passage du Cardinal 13B, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland\n Free of charge, no sign-up required\n Learn more at\nThe project is supported by the following partners:\nThree public-sector partners: Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Canton of Fribourg, City of Fribourg and Smart Living Lab\nAnd the following private partners: Groupe E and Landolt & Cie SA, JPF-Ducret, Régent SA, La Mobilière and Setimac", "summary": "EPFL, in association with the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design and the University of Fribourg, is taking part in the 2017 international Solar Decathlon competition.

First: what resources can you draw on to survive and grow? And second: how do you respond if your environment suddenly changes? \nA group of researchers from Eawag, ETH Zurich, EPFL Lausanne, and the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen recently discovered that the number of individualists in a bacterial population goes up when its food source is restricted. Their finding goes against the prevailing wisdom that bacterial populations merely respond, in hindsight, to the environmental conditions they experience. Individualists, the study finds, are able to prepare themselves for such changes well in advance.\nScarcity fosters diversity, diversity promotes flexibility\n In a recent paper in the journal \nNature Microbiology\n, researchers working with Frank Schreiber have shown that individual cells in bacterial populations can differ widely in how they respond to a lack of nutrients. Although all of the cells in a group are genetically identical, the way they process nutrients from their surroundings can vary from one cell to another. For example, bacteria called \nKlebsiella oxytoca \npreferentially take up nitrogen from ammonium (NH4+), as this requires relatively little energy. When there isn’t enough ammonium for the entire population, some of the bacteria start to take up nitrogen by fixing it from elementary nitrogen (N2), even though this requires more energy. If the ammonium suddenly runs out altogether, these cells at least are prepared. While some cells suffer, the group as a whole can continue to grow. “Although all of the bacteria in the group are genetically identical and exposed to the same environmental conditions, the individual cells differ among themselves,” says Schreiber.\nDetailed insights thanks to the latest technology\n Schreiber and his colleagues were only able to reveal the astonishing differences between the bacteria by studying them very closely. “We had to measure nutrient uptake by individual bacterial cells – even though these are only 2 μm large,” explains Schreiber. “Usually, microbiologists study the collective properties of millions or even billions of bacteria. It was only thanks to the close collaboration between the research groups, and by pooling our expertise and technical equipment, that we were able to study the bacteria in such detail.”\nBacteria are individualists, too\n The present study shows to what extent individuality – in bacteria and in general – can be essential in a changing environment. Differences between individuals give the group new properties, enabling it to deal with tough environmental conditions. “This indicates that biological diversity does not only matter in terms of the diversity of plant and animal species but also at the level of individuals within a species,” says Schreiber. \n Next, Schreiber and his colleagues plan to study whether the individualistic behavior of specific individuals is of equal importance in natural environments.\nOriginal publication\nPhenotypic heterogeneity driven by nutrient limitation promotes growth in fluctuating environments \n Frank Schreiber, Sten Littmann, Gaute Lavik, Stéphane Escrig, Anders Meibom, Marcel Kuypers, Martin Ackermann.

{"id": 31, "text": "In a paper published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers at EPFL’s Blue Brain Project, a Swiss Brain Research Initiative, have developed a new framework to work out how a single neuron in the brain operates.\nThe analysis was performed using cells from the Blue Brain’s virtual rodent cortex. The researchers expect other types of neurons – non-cortical or human – to operate in the same way.\nTheir results show that when a neuron receives input, the branches of the elaborate tree-like receptors extending from the neuron, known as dendrites, functionally work together in a way that is \nadjusted to the complexity of the input\n.\nThe strength of a synapse determines how strongly a neuron feels an electric signal coming from other neurons, and the act of learning changes this strength. By analyzing the “connectivity matrix” that determines how these synapses communicate with each other, the algorithm establishes when and where synapses group into independent learning units from the structural and electrical properties of dendrites. In other words, the new algorithm determines how the dendrites of neurons functionally break up into separate computing units and finds that they work together \ndynamically, depending on the workload,\n to process information\n.\nThe researchers liken their results to the functioning of computing technology already implemented today. This newly observed dendritic functionality acts like parallel computing units meaning that a neuron is able to process different aspects of the input in parallel, like supercomputers. Each of the parallel computing units can independently learn to adjust its output, much like the nodes in deep learning networks used in artificial intelligence (AI) models today. Comparable to cloud computing, a neuron dynamically breaks up into the number of separate computing units demanded by the workload of the input.\n“In the Blue Brain Project, this mathematical approach helps to ascertain functionally relevant clusters of neuronal input which are inputs that feed into the same parallel processing unit. This then enables us to determine the level of complexity at which to model cortical networks as we digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain,” explains Marc-Oliver Gewaltig, Section Manager in Blue Brain’s Simulation Neuroscience Division.\nParallel computing units of neurons can independently learn to adjust their output\nAdditionally, the research reveals how these parallel processing units influence learning, i.e. the change in connection strength between different neurons. The way a neuron learns depends on the number and location of parallel processors, which in turn depend on the signals arriving from other neurons. For instance, certain synapses that do not learn independently when the neuron’s input level is low, start to learn independently when the input levels are higher.\nTo date traditional learning algorithms (such as those currently used in A.I. applications) assume that neurons are static units that merely integrate and re-scale incoming signals. By contrast, the results show that the number and size of the independent subunits can be controlled by balanced input or shunting inhibition. The researchers propose that this temporary control of the compartmentalization constitutes a powerful mechanism for the branch-specific learning of input features.\n“The method finds that in many brain states, neurons have far fewer parallel processors than expected from dendritic branch patterns. Thus, many synapses appear to be in “grey zones” where they do not belong to any processing unit,” explains lead scientist and first author Willem Wybo. “However, in the brain, neurons receive varying levels of background input and our results show that the number of parallel processors varies with the level of background input, indicating that the same neuron might have different computational roles in different brain states.”\n“We are particularly excited about this observation since it sheds a new light on the role of up/down states in the brain and it also provides a reason as to why cortical inhibition is so location-specific. With the new insights, we can start looking for algorithms that exploit the rapid changes in pairing between processing units, offering us more insight into the fundamental question of how the brain computes,” concludes Gewaltig.", "summary": "How do neurons process information?

{"id": 32, "text": "EPFL’s new brand identity is centered on its acronym. The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nThe School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.\nThe font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge. The School profoundly affects the lives of those who study or teach there. As a hub of research and knowledge, EPFL is a source of personal and professional fulfillment. We wanted to reflect all of that in the new design,” says Caroline Moser, CEO of Moser Design.\nThe new visual identity consists of more than just the logo, as it covers the full range of graphic elements that convey the School’s brand. The logo itself figures prominently on campus, in the form of a 2.6-meter-high metal sculpture next to the Rolex Learning Center.\nModern-day agora pays tribute to the past\nThe symbolic launch of the School’s 50th anniversary celebration would not have been complete without paying tribute to Maurice Cosandey, the visionary who in 1969 turned what was then a local engineering school into a Swiss federal institute of technology.\nThe Lombard Odier Agora was therefore inaugurated today in Place Maurice Cosandey – the square named after EPFL’s first president – in a ceremony attended by the Cosandey family.\nPlace Maurice Cosandey sits at the southern entrance of the campus, between the Rolex Learning Center and ArtLab. It was chosen for the Agora as part of an initiative originating with the ArtLab project to revamp this area. The redevelopment project was led by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE), which is headed by architecture professor Dieter Dietz. “Our goal for this project was clear: to get the entire EPFL community – especially students – involved in order to breathe life into a neglected part of campus,” says Dietz.

{"id": 34, "text": "“Ouay, ask the nurse what time she’s coming.” “Ouay, tell John to go run errands.” Or “Ouay, I don’t feel well, call the nurse.” The round smart speaker developed by the student team acts on the sound of a user’s voice. And it can connect users with people outside the home – caregivers, friends or family members can send text or voice messages to Ouay through a special app and Ouay reads the messages out loud. By providing a constant connection, the system allows elderly patients to remain independent while at the same time reassuring everyone involved that help is never far away. It has already been tested by several organizations that provide home-care services to the elderly.\nToday there is a host of new systems for helping the elderly or handicapped live on their own, as well as a growing number of specially equipped apartment buildings. These developments are often motivated by the dual goals of improving patients’ lives and keeping costs down. And recent technological advancements, such as in sensors and alert systems, are supporting this trend. But the two people behind the idea for Ouay – Sven Borden, a first-year Master’s student in microengineering at EPFL, and Loïc Rochat, a student in mechanical engineering – found that there was one key element missing, based on their personal experience with elderly people. “We needed a reliable device that patients can use to easily communicate with people outside the home. That would help them feel more independent,” says Borden. They fleshed out their idea at the Zurich hackathon, a weekend-long brainstorming marathon where would-be entrepreneurs come with a business idea and draft a business plan. Once the hackathon was over, the duo took their business plan and decided to run with it.\nA reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit at EPFL \nBorden and Rochat teamed up with other students from EPFL, HEC and HE-ARC, and then spoke with local caregivers and patients in order to pinpoint their needs. “I think Ouay is a good reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit we have here at EPFL,” says Borden. The students initially set up an association to build up their network and pool their funds. Since this initial investment, Ouay has expanded its reach considerably; the student team received an XGrant (financial support that EPFL provides to student startups) as well as a CHF 20,000 FIT Digital grant from Vaud’s Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). The proceeds were used to create the prototypes that are currently being tested by home-care providers.\nHelping people fall asleep with remote hypnosis \nFor elderly patients, even minor inconveniences – like not being able to find something in their apartment or a nurse showing up late – can cause a great deal of stress. And caring for elderly patients can also cause stress for friends and family. To help alleviate these factors, Ouay has a number of useful features including alerts for taking medication, reminders for doctor’s appointments and messages that can reassure someone feeling anxious. These features work through the mobile telephone network. Jean-Luc Tuma, who heads up the local home-care group Uniquecare santé et soins à domicile, sees the clear benefits of the device, which his staff tested: “It’s an excellent way to help patients live autonomously, independently and safely.” And his staff discovered new uses for Ouay as they tried it out in real-life situations. “The most remarkable thing we’ve done so far is having a hypnotherapist use the device to help a patient fall asleep through remote hypnosis,” says Tuma. He believes Ouay will eventually become a standard tool for caregivers.\nThe students officially launched their company and want to bring in more people. They plan to seek out “motivated students aiming to become professional developers, prototype builders or electronic device designers, and give them another opportunity to work on concrete problems,” says Rochat.", "summary": "Two students from EPFL have developed a smart speaker with voice-activation technology that connects patients directly to their loved ones as well as caregivers and emergency services.

{"id": 36, "text": "With cities expected to grow significantly in the future, it is vital to plan their development and anticipate their impact on the environment ahead of time. Nahid Mohajeri, an urban architect and geographer at EPFL, looked into Geneva’s history in order to understand how the city developed the way it did and predict how it will change in the future.\nIn order to model a city's evolution over time, Dr. Mohajeri came up with the idea of combining two different scientific approaches: statistical thermodynamics – \nPreliminary results, published in Ecological Modelling, indicate that cities in general – and Geneva in particular – grow by virtue of two very different processes: they spread out and/or become denser. Dr. Mohajeri also observed that large cities are proportionally more energy efficient and have a lower specific ecological footprint per resident than small towns.\nFor the purpose of quantifying the different cities, the researcher analyzed them in terms of their thermodynamic entropy, which scientists call “randomness.” She also used other physics and engineering methods, such as spatial analysis. In this way, Dr. Mohajeri was able to model cities on a computer.\nThe goal is to compare the ecological impact of various urban forms – compact or dispersed – in view of one day developing a framework for building eco-cities. But is there really an ideal urban form? That’s what Dr. Mohajeri is trying to determine.\nEvery city evolves on the basis of several criteria specific to that city, such as the land on which it was built and the political decisions that transform it. “Kerman, in southern Iran, is an interesting example,” said the researcher. “The city experienced rapid growth at the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979. ‘Revolutionary’ housing was quickly thrown up on the outskirts of the city. The old town is squat and dense, and its expansion seems to be aimed at replicating an American city.”\nDr. Mohajeri analyzed dozens of cities around the world, from New Orleans to London and Geneva. Some give the impression of having grown haphazardly, while others are neatly squared off by their avenues, or, like Geneva, stretch out slowly in the shape of an octagon.\nThe parameters used by the researcher focus on the spatial distribution of 11,418 buildings. According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, more than 83% of Switzerland’s population will live in urban areas in 2050. Dr. Mohajeri’s studies on entropy led to the discovery that two very different processes drove Geneva’s growth: expansion (where streets and buildings were added to the edge of the city) and densification (where streets and buildings were added within the existing city). Expansion has been the dominant force in Geneva over the past 170 years.\nThe Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO - PB) uses the thermodynamic-statistical approach, which originated in the field of physics, to learn more about the complex relationship between the built environment and the natural environment.\nOnce the laws of thermodynamics that govern a given city’s growth are identified, the next step will be to learn how their spatial-temporal evolution affects the functioning of their ecosystem. More specifically, the idea is to determine how a city’s growth and form influence its energy consumption, changes in land cover, biodiversity and human well-being.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher is modeling cities in order to understand their metabolism and determine their ecological impact when they grow and change.

Inspired by muscle contraction, its individual soft components are activated (they collapse) when negative pressure (vacuum) is applied to them. The robot uses suction to grab objects or to stick to a smooth wall for climbing, so it can really achieve a wide range of tasks because of the unique properties of vacuum. The robot can be reconfigured to perform different tasks, making it highly modular and versatile, with a wide range of applications in both research and in industry. The invention is published today in \nScience Robotics\n.\n“What we have is a fully functional robot which is entirely powered by vacuum, which has never been done before,” says EPFL roboticist Matt Robertson who worked on the project. “Previous work has shown individual components powered by vacuum, but never in a complete system.”\nVacuum-powered components are a recent addition to robotics – and, more importantly, they’re safe. Today, most actuators on the market are activated by applying positive pressure, i.e. by injecting air into their components. But containing positive pressure requires stiff high-pressure pneumatics, which also pose a safety threat: in extreme situations, they can explode. By comparison, vacuum-powered actuators are safe, soft, and simple to build.\n“What's more is that our soft building blocks are designed to be plug-and-play, so ultimately we can assemble several types of robots from the same basic units,” says EPFL scientists and lead researcher Jamie Paik. “They can be reconfigured to perform different tasks like crawling, gripping canisters, and climbing a vertical wall.”\nA five-module robot can move like a tentacle; a four-module robot with a suction gripper can grab an object and drop it on a target; a three-module robot can crawl on the ground; a two-module robot can be equipped with suction-cup feet to climb a smooth, vertical surface, like glass.

The results are .\nA hard drive functions as a data storage device in a computer, where a large amount of data can be stored with an electromagnetically charged surface.\nNowadays, the demand for high capacity hard drives has increased more than ever. Computer users handle large files, databases, image or video files, using software, all of which require a large amount of memory in order to save and process the data as quickly as possible.\nThe EPFL scientists used a halide perovskite/oxide perovskite heterostructure in their new method for reversible, light-induced tuning of ferromagnetism at room temperature. Having a perovskite structure represents a novel class of light-absorbing materials.\nAs reported in the publication,\n“The rise of digitalization led to an exponential increase in demand for data storage. Mass-storage is resolved by hard-disk drives, HDDs, due to their relatively long lifespan and low price. HDDs use magnetic domains, which are rotated to store and retrieve information. However, an increase in capacity and speed is continuously demanded. We report a method to facilitate the writing of magnetic bits optically. We use a sandwich of a highly light sensitive (MAPbI\n3\n) and a ferromagnetic material (LSMO), where illumination of MAPbI\n3\n drives charge carriers into LSMO and decreases its magnetism. This is a viable alternative of the long-sought-after heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology, which would heat up the disk material during the writing process.”\nThe method is still experimental, but it may be used to build the next generation of memory-storage systems, with higher capacities and with low energy demands. The method provides a stand for the development of a new generation of magneto-optical hard drives.

{"id": 44, "text": "Governments across Switzerland are embracing civic technology. This is one of the headline findings of the first Civic Tech Barometer, a survey conducted by researchers from EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR) in partnership with Geneva Canton’s Consultation and Communication Department. The team’s conclusions are based on responses to an online survey sent to municipal, city and cantonal authorities nationwide between August and November 2019. In total, 83 government employees from the French, German and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland submitted answers.\n The idea behind civic technology, or civic tech, is to change the way citizens participate in democratic processes. The LaSUR survey found that the Swiss civic tech landscape is far from uniform. The most common platform types include websites, blogs, open-data repositories, social media, participatory spaces where citizens can submit ideas and suggestions, and open forums for discussion and debate. Yet half of the technologies mentioned by survey respondents are not truly participatory because they are designed more for one-way communication than two-way interaction. \n The survey did, however, reveal a handful of more collaborative platforms, including Crossiety (dubbed the “digital village square”) and Decidim. With such a wide variety of options available, governments are free to choose how involved they want citizens to be in the decision-making process.\nPlanning leads the way\n “Swiss authorities use civic tech across a broad spectrum of policy areas,” says Armelle Hausser, a doctoral assistant at LaSUR who carried out the survey as part of her PhD research. “Chief among these are planning and development, youth services, sport, environment and social action.” In most cases, local executive bodies are the driving force behind civic tech usage – and legal requirements have little to no bearing on such initiatives. In fact, just one-third of the platforms and technologies reported by respondents were developed to meet a legal obligation. \n Conversely, other interested parties – such as project and department managers, citizens’ groups, charities and non-profits – rarely call for the use of civic tech in consultation and participation processes. “This finding is counter-intuitive,” says Professor Vincent Kaufmann, who heads LaSUR. “It suggests that, in Switzerland, citizens still prefer to voice their views through conventional channels, for instance by objecting to planning proposals or by taking part in popular initiatives and referendums.”\nLimited resources\n The team also found that local governments currently allocate little in the way of funding and human resources to civic tech initiatives, preferring in the majority of cases to outsource the process to external providers. “Authorities don’t yet have a clear idea of the roles and skills required for this kind of initiative,” explains Hausser. Yet expectations were high among the respondents, who said they planned to use civic tech to produce more information for public consumption, keep citizens better informed and understand their views, improve transparency, secure public support and widen participation more generally.\n “There are many other plans in the pipeline, including online surveys and participatory mapping platforms,” adds Hausser. “In terms of technology types, a general direction of travel seems to be emerging. But we’ll need to run the survey again to make doubly sure.” What is certain is that Swiss authorities are keen to embrace civic tech, with no fewer than 31 high-priority initiatives planned for the coming year. \nRoom to improve\n The LaSUR team found clear room for improvement in two areas. First, although citizens’ views obtained using civic tech are reflected in accompanying reports, Swiss authorities still tend not to give these views due weight in the final decision-making process. And second, it is still too early to properly assess the impact of the technology on citizen participation. The researchers will have a clearer picture after running their second survey, scheduled for fall 2020.\n The results of the initial survey will be presented at a special event – open to practitioners and other interested parties as well as the wider public – on 3 February 2020 at the 3DD Espace de Concertation in Geneva. Hausser will incorporate the findings into her thesis, which focuses on wider issues around the use of civic tech for public participation in planning processes in Switzerland.

In the same way, the noise of jet engines could be deflected towards the sky rather than the ground, and certain types of vehicle could be rendered undetectable by sonar.\nScientists at EPFL’s Laboratory for Electromagnetism and Acoustics have succeeded in creating a device that implements the principle of negative refraction in the domain of acoustics. This was achieved by applying recent findings from the domain of electromagnetism, and the results could mean that one day objects are no longer an obstacle to sound.\n“Even though it’s only at the experimental stage, the study of this phenomenon has become a burning topic in acoustics over the last three or four years”, describes Hervé Lissek, scientist and co-author of an article recently published in the journal Physical Review B*.\nAlready well understood in the area of optics, the phenomenon of refraction is illustrated by the deflection of a light beam when it encounters an alteration in the propagation medium. This explains why a straw, when dipped into a glass of water, appears to be broken at the point where it enters the liquid – the trajectory of the light is deflected when it passes from one medium (air) to another (water). Refraction is also responsible for mirages and rainbows. \nTo “flow” around an object\nNegative refraction is not found in nature. It can be produced by using artificial structures called “metamaterials”, which have the property of further bending – or inverting the path of – light rays, resulting in their potential to “flow” around an object, at least theoretically. Some scientists believe that this phenomenon could one day be used to make objects invisible or transparent, a bit like Harry Potter’s cape!\nFor the first time, EPFL scientists have succeeded in demonstrating the possibility of obtaining negative refraction in the domain of acoustics using a discrete device; this work was based on a recent PhD thesis in the domain of electromagnetism**. Sound is defined by two essential properties of a fluid (a material medium) in which it travels: its mass, put in movement by an acoustic disturbance, the acceleration of which is normally directed according to the forces of acoustic pressure (inertial force); and its compressibility, which allows it naturally to oppose such forces (restoring force).\nUsing the device they conceived, the EPFL scientists obtained, simultaneously, negative values for these two parameters; that is to say, to further compress the particle of fluid subjected to excessive acoustic pressure, and to determine that its acceleration oppose the forces of pressure. This combination is a prerequisite in obtaining negative refraction, a property that has been initially observed in a digital model of acoustic metamaterial. Similar results have also been observed in a second phase, using an experimental prototype which enabled the validation of the theoretical concept.\nEven though we are still a long way from a genuine acoustic “invisibility cape”, these results demonstrate the performance of a tangible physical system representing negative refraction, while constituting an important achievement for research in this area.\n*“Acoustic transmission line metamaterial with negative/zero/positive refractive index”, published in Physical Review B – Frédéric Bongard, Hervé Lissek and Juan R.

{"id": 50, "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, researchers are turning their attention to the virus’ biology, mechanism of action, and possible treatments. One of the targets are a group of immune cells called “neutrophils”, which have been reported to infiltrate the respiratory tract of patients who have died from COVID-19.\nThe idea is that in their attempt to attack the virus, neutrophils might be making the disease’s symptoms even worse by invading the lungs and exacerbating inflammation there. In order to find out if this is actually the case, scientists may use a mouse model whose neutrophils they deplete with “anti-neutrophil” antibodies.\nThe approach is used widely for studying neutrophils in a number of different conditions, including autoimmune diseases, chronic infection or inflammation, wound healing, and even some types of cancer. However, the neutrophil-depletion model is only partially effective, lacks specificity, and doesn’t last long enough.\nA neutrophil with its typical\n,\n segmented nucleus\n.\nA \nprotrusion of the nucleus \nacts like \na \n“\ndouble-edged sword\n”\n, \nwhich the neutrophil wields \nto kill \npathogens –\n but which \nalso \nsometimes damages tissues and exacerbates disease\ns\n. \nCredit: \nEtienne Meylan, EPFL\nNow, scientists led by Etienne Meylan at EPFL, have identified the source of the problem and have developed an alternative model that addresses its shortcomings.

The researchers have now identified these neutrophils, and determined that the reason they survive is because they have a lower chance of being targeted by the antibodies.\nTo address this, the scientists have developed a double antibody depletion strategy that enhances neutrophil elimination. The method increases the killing rate of the antibodies, resulting in a profound, specific and long-lasting reduction in neutrophil numbers in blood and tissues.\n“Our study could be useful to address the functional importance of neutrophils in acute or chronic infection, in inflammation or in cancer,” says Meylan. “In particular, transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection coupled to our standardized neutrophil depletion strategies may help establish a causal link between this innate immune cell type and COVID-19.”\nOther contributors\nLausanne University Hospital (CHUV)\nSwiss Cancer Center Léman\nINSERM, France\nMassachusetts General Hospital Research Institute\nUniversity Duisburg–Essen", "summary": "Neutrophils are critical immune cells for antimicrobial defense, but they can exacerbate a number of diseases, perhaps including COVID-19.

{"id": 51, "text": "For years, mini versions of organs such as the brain, kidney and lung—known as “organoids”—have been grown from stem cells. Organoids promise to cut down on the need for animal testing and offer better models to study how human organs form and how that process goes awry in disease. However, conventional approaches to grow organoids result in stem cells assembling into micro- to millimeter-sized, hollow spheres. “That is non-physiological, because many organs, such as the intestine or the airway, are tube-shaped and much larger” says Matthias Lütolf, a professor at EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering, who led the study published today in \nNature Materials\n.\nTo develop larger organoids that resemble their normal counterparts, Lütolf and his team turned to bioprinting. Just as 3D-printers allow people to create everyday objects, similar technology can help bioengineers to assemble living tissues. But instead of the plastics or powders used in conventional 3D-printers, bioprinters use bioinks—liquids or gels that encapsulate living cells. “Bioprinting is very compelling because it allows you to deposit cells anywhere in 3D space, so you could think of arranging cells into an organ-like configuration such as a tube,” Lütolf says.\nThe researchers designed a customized bioprinting set-up consisting of a microscope and a device that can aspirate and deposit cells through a thin nozzle coupled to a syringe pump. On the microscope stage, the team installed a plate containing a gel that resembles the complex extracellular environment found in many tissues. This type of gel, Lütolf notes, “is incredibly potent to allow cells to form a tissue, but because it’s difficult to handle people haven't really exploited it for bioprinting.”\nBy moving the microscope stage and monitoring constantly the process through the microscope lens, the researchers were able to deposit into the gel a line of intestinal stem cells that measured a few centimeters in length. “The cool thing about using a microscope is that you can always see what you're doing and you can watch what cells do—you're not blind,” Lütolf says. “In other bioprinting approaches, you don't see what's going on.”\nOnce stem cells were seeded, Lütolf says, “magic happened”: the cells started to grow and interact with each other, forming a continuous, tube-shaped tissue that mimicked many of the anatomical and functional features of a regular gut. The lab-grown guts, which reached up to three centimeters in size, were composed of crypt-shaped pockets with stem cells and they contained the same specialized absorptive and secretory cells as those found in a full-sized intestine. The mini-guts’ secretory cells were also able to secrete antimicrobial molecules in response to specific stimuli.\n© 2020 EPFL\nWhat makes the newly developed approach different—and more successful—than other methods to grow organoids is that it combines the flexibility and precision of 3D-printing with the ability of stem cells to grow and organize themselves. “We allow the biology to happen—that’s absolutely crucial,” Lütolf says.\nBy bioprinting organoid-forming cells from the gastrointestinal tract, the researchers also generated portions of the stomach, small intestine and colon, which then formed interconnected mini versions of their parent organs. With traditional methods for growing organoids, Lütolf notes, “you can grow either stomach organoids or intestinal organoids—whereas with bioprinting, you can combine different cell types and arrange them in different ways,” he says.\nWhile the mini-organs perform the functions of their normal counterparts, their use in regenerative medicine, including for replacing human tissues and organs, is still years away, Lütolf says. But he notes that the newly developed approach could be used to build tissue models for human diseases, including cancer, and for testing how drug candidates act on specific cell types within a tissue.\nLütolf’s team now hopes to use bioprinting to build airway tubes to study viral infection, for example with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The infected mini-airways could then help to test different treatment approaches. “A big advantage is that, with a microscope, you can watch as infection evolves, so you can quantify and study what happens,” Lütolf says. “That’s an exciting perspective.”", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed an approach to print tiny tissues that look and function almost like their full-sized counterpart.

Place it at a certain angle between a white wall and a light source, and a clear, coherent image appears of the face of Alan Turing, the famous British mathematician and father of modern computer science.\nThere’s no magic here; the only thing at work is the relief on the plaque’s surface and a natural optical phenomenon known as a “caustic,” which researchers in EPFL’s Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory have succeeded in bending to their will. Their research was presented recently at the Advances in Architectural Geometry Conference in Paris. A public demonstration will also be held November 16-17 at EPFL as part of the Alan Turing days, an event celebrating the 100th birthday of the famous scientist.\n“With the technique that we’ve developed, we can compose any image we want, from a simple form such as a star to complex representations such as faces or landscapes,” explains EPFL professor Mark Pauly, head of the laboratory, who conducted the study with four other scientists*.\nThis “caustic” effect is well known and easy to observe; a bit of sunlight shining on a pool of water produces patterns that dance on the surrounding tiles or walls. These undulating lines, apparently random, are generated by light that hits the moving surface of a pool or puddle. This effect, which is very mobile and dynamic in liquid, produces static patterns with solid transparent materials such as glass or transparent acrylic (better known as Plexiglass).\nDeviated trajectories\nScientifically, this phenomenon can be explained by light refraction. When light rays hit a transparent surface, they continue their trajectory but are bent as a function of the surface geometry and optical properties of the material. The light passing through is thus not uniformly distributed. It gets concentrated in certain points, forming some zones that are more intense and others that are more shaded.\nPauly and his colleagues studied the principles of this distribution, and were able to identify the curves and undulations they would need to give to the surface in order to direct the beams of light to a desired area. They then developed an algorithm, to calculate the trajectories very precisely and thus form a specific image.\nOne of the most interesting and eagerly awaited applications of this method is in architecture. It could be applied to display cases, windows, fountains, and ornamentations on museums and monuments. In design it could be used for decorating glasses, vases, carafes, jewelry and many other objects.

{"id": 61, "text": "Rising temperatures, increasingly intense rainfall and extended periods of drought are some of the known effects of climate change. But how are trees reacting to them? To find out, a team of researchers from EPFL and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) studied two of the most common plant species found in Switzerland and the rest of Europe: beech and spruce trees. The study,* which was recently published in \nGlobal Change Biology\n, revealed that each species reacts differently, with the amount of moisture in the air playing a greater role than was previously thought.\n\"To find out what forests may look like in the future, we have to understand how each plant species will respond to climate change,\" explains Constant Signarbieux, the scientist in charge of the study, which was carried out at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS).\nThe researchers observed five-to-seven-year-old saplings of the two species for four years, from 2012 to 2015. The saplings were collected at the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura mountains during the colder months, and then replanted in three locations at different altitudes: in the small village of St-Georges (at 1,010 meters), in the Vallon Arboretum in Aubonne (at 570 meters), and in the grounds of the EPFL-run Fondation des Bois Chamblard on the shores of Lake Geneva (395 meters). A fourth group of saplings was kept at its original altitude of 1,350 meters and used as a control group.\nYoung trees at the Aubonne's site, and one reference tree at Marchairuz. (c)ECOS\n\"Transplanting these young trees at lower altitudes meant we could simulate the impact of an average temperature increase of between 1 and 6\n°\nC, in keeping with what is forecast to occur between now and 2100 based on a number of climate-change scenarios,” explains Signarbieux.\nTo beech or not to beech? \nBy regularly measuring each tree's trunk and four main branches, the researchers were able to estimate the trees’ biomass. They noticed that the rise in temperature prolonged the growing season – the period from when the first new leaves or needles appear in the spring until they turn yellow in the autumn – in a similar way for each species. However, the two species demonstrated very different biomass growth. The beech trees did well from the rising temperatures, flourishing quickly and becoming more easily acclimatized to the warmer temperatures than the spruce trees. \"Spruces are a more conservative species and perhaps adapt more slowly,\" says the researcher. \"This could have an immediate impact on our forests, as beech trees are more likely to be predominant going forward.\"\nThe researchers didn't stop there. They wanted to learn more about why the two species grew at different rates – and the reason came as quite a surprise. Their analyses revealed that it had nothing to do with either photosynthesis or the amount of water in the ground. Instead, it was all down to the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) – the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can potentially hold at a given temperature. This gives an indication of how dry the air is and how much pressure the plant's water system is under as a result.\nIt’s all about suction\nA plant's leaves contain microscopic pores, called stomata, which regulate how gases move between the leaves and the atmosphere. \"Plants use these stomata to absorb CO\n2\n from the air through diffusion,\" explains Signarbieux. \"When the pores open to let the gas in, water escapes from the leaves at the same time. This process is known as transpiration and occurs because there is always more moisture in the plant than in the air. It is what creates the suction that pulls water and sap from the soil through the roots, up the stalk and into the leaves.\"\nThe drier the air, the higher the VPD and the greater the suction effect will be. When there are several consecutive days with a high VPD – an ever more regular occurrence due to climate change – plants are put under increasing strain. But different plants react in different ways, as shown by the two species studied. Even before there is no water left in the ground, spruce trees close their stomata to prevent any more hydric stress. Beech trees, however, are more tolerant of this type of stress and wait longer before closing their stomata, which enables them to continue absorbing CO\n2\n and therefore keep growing. This gives them a competitive advantage over the spruces.\nIn the past, average seasonal or annual temperatures and rainfall were used to analyze plants' responses to their environment. But those factors alone don’t explain why the beech and spruce trees grow at such different rates. What makes this study truly original and groundbreaking is that the researchers took account of another variable that is often overlooked: the number of hours during which the VPD was above a certain critical level, indicating that the plant was experiencing exceptionally dry conditions. The biologists now intend to expand their research to other species, in the hope of creating a graphic representation of what Europe’s forests will look like in the future – and to help ensure that they are managed and used sustainably.\n*\nConducted as part of the doctoral thesis by Paula Sanginés, a researcher in the ECOS lab.", "summary": "How do trees adjust to the effects of global warming?

Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA! I've been a part of this festival for decades and it truly is a magnificent representation of what happens when different cultures unite for the sake of music. Absolute magic. And I'm proud to know that the memory of this special place will never be lost.”", "summary": "Thanks to an innovative technology for encoding data in DNA strands, two items of world heritage – songs recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival and digitized by EPFL – have been safeguarded for eternity.

Which routines will they keep once the lockdown is over? Which people are suffering most from this unprecedented situation? In order to better understand how Swiss residents are coping with the lockdown, researchers from EPFL, Idiap and UNIL have created . \nIn addition to asking a series of questions, the survey displays emergency phone numbers, options for online chats and links to useful websites and videos in order to provide support resources to people who are distressed, bored or suffering from domestic violence. The survey results will be used to identify the inequalities that are arising in the face of the pandemic and to develop coordinated and collaborative strategies to avoid them in the future, should a similar situation arise. \nThe survey takes around 15 minutes and is designed to get a better idea of what types of housing and living conditions make people more mentally resilient – or susceptible – to the lockdown. For instance, are women taking on more of the household chores and childcare responsibilities? If so, to what extent, under what conditions and predominantly in which areas of Switzerland? Which people feel loneliest? Which people are the least informed about existing support networks? \nCitizen research\nAt the end of the survey, participants can leave their email address if they would like to use a new application called Civique App (available on iPhone and Android). The app will enable them to report on how they are adapting week after week by sending in text messages, remarks from friends and family, and photos of individual spaces serving as home office, gym and school at the same time. The developers are using the app to create citizen research groups. By leaving their email address, participants will also have the option of scheduling a video conference where they can discuss their feelings, situation and coping mechanisms in more detail with a psychosociological expert. Once all the data are collected – on people’s emotions, creative ways of adapting and overall experience – they will provide policymakers with valuable information on Swiss residents’ basic needs and how emergency response measures can be better targeted, whether in the short-term for this crisis or to help anticipate future ones.\nInterdisciplinary cooperation\nThe researchers taking part in this cross-disciplinary initiative are Claudia Binder, a full professor at EPFL and head of EPFL’s Laboratory on Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS); Ulli Vilsmaier, a visiting professor at HERUS; Livia Fritz, a post-doc researcher at HERUS; Anna Pagani, a PhD student at HERUS; Daniel Gatica-Perez, an adjunct professor at Idiap and at EPFL’s Digital Humanities Institute; Vincent Kaufmann, associate professor and head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR); Laurie Daffe and Garance Clément, post-doc researchers at LASUR; and Marie Santiago Delefosse, a full professor at UNIL’s Institute of Psychology.\nContacts\nFor English and German \n Claudia Binder, full professor, EPFL; Tel.: +41 21 693 93 62; Email:  \nFor English and French\n Marie Santiago Delefosse, full professor, UNIL; Tel.: +41 21 692 31 11; Email:  \n Vincent Kaufmann, associate professor, EPFL; Tel.: +41 21 693 62 29; Email:", "summary": "A new nationwide study being conducted jointly by EPFL, the Idiap Research Institute and the University of Lausanne (UNIL) aims to understand the emotional effects of the lockdown on Swiss residents and what steps they are taking to cope with it.

{"id": 65, "text": "On 12 June 2019, EPFL was officially designated as a  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the fields of open-source data and code development for nuclear applications. The IAEA is the world's central inter-governmental forum for scientific and technical co-operation in the nuclear field. It works for the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, contributing to international peace and security and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. For its work, the IAEA won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.\nThe IAEA endorses the EPFL for spearheading the creation of an international network of industries and research institutions that will develop an advanced, open-source simulation platform for the analysis of nuclear reactors. “This will be a unique opportunity to work on a major paradigm shift in the nuclear sector towards open, collaborative, and efficient R&D,” says Carlo Fiorina, the main initiator of this activity and a researcher at EPFL’s , headed by Professor Andreas Pautz.\nThe need for a new development strategy in the nuclear sector comes from its ever more stringent safety requirements, but also from the vibrant worldwide research activities dedicated to the development of new nuclear technologies for CO\n2\n-free energy generation, production of medical radioisotopes, incineration of existing nuclear waste, water desalination, and hydrogen production.\nThe EPFL Collaborating Centre’s objective will be to step beyond traditional development strategies, which are based on relatively old and often proprietary software and data. At the core of the Centre’s activities will be the promotion of R&D work fostering the concepts of open-source and shared development. This will boost R&D activities and contribute to a safe operation of nuclear plants by increasing synergies, limiting inefficiencies, promoting networking, and contributing to standardization.\nIn addition to leading this international effort, EPFL will produce new, open, and high-quality validation data at its . “This is an exciting chance to use our unique facility to bring about a real impact in the nuclear sector,” says Pavel Frajtag, who heads the reactor.\nThe open software and experimental data produced during the project will be distributed to the IAEA member states. This will empower innovation and spread IAEA’s safety culture, notably in developing countries that aim to include nuclear technologies as part of their strategic development targets for public welfare and reduced CO\n2\n emissions.\n“The designation as an IAEA Collaborating Center is a big honor and a strong recognition of EPFL’s reputation, the high nuclear safety standards in our country, and the excellence of nuclear research in Switzerland,” says Andreas Pautz. “It will put the CROCUS reactor on the map of outstanding nuclear facilities, and open pathways to global collaboration.”\nDuring the inauguration ceremony on 12 June, the IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy Mikhail Chudakov presented Professor Andreas Mortensen, vice president of research at EPFL, with the official nomination document (photo).

{"id": 67, "text": "Neurons communicate with each other at synapses through complex mechanisms. The synapses establish contact between the neurons and convert their electrical signals into chemical signals, the release of neurotransmitters. Study of these phenomena is one of the essential keys to understanding the brain. The team from the EPFL’s Laboratory of Synaptic Mechanisms, headed by Ralf Schneggenburger, has shed some light on previously unknown functions of proteins in the release of neurotransmitters.\n In the first paper (1), the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to deactivate a protein selectively in the calyx of Held, the brain’s largest synapse. This novel method enabled them to discover a direct, unexpected role for the protein RIM (Rab3 interacting molecule), which increases the density of calcium ion (Ca2+) channels, a type of ion channel that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release.\n In the second article (2), the scientists used mice that had been genetically modified so they would not produce a specific protein, synaptotagmin. This Ca2+-sensing protein is known to bind calcium ions (Ca2+), thus initiating neurotransmitter release. The researchers used a virus to reintroduce the missing gene in the nerve terminal and reestablish the gene function at the calyx of Held.\nA Protein’s Double Life\n Subsequently, the scientists used viruses expressing slightly modified versions of the gene coding for the protein. Careful comparison enabled them to reveal a double role of this protein. The function of synaptotagmin is in fact not limited to initiating neurotransmitter release; it also inhibits other Ca2+- sensing proteins present in the nerve terminal. In doing so, it increases the amplitude of the release signal while suppressing background release events. In other words it optimizes the signal quality, similarly to what occurs in an electronic circuit.\n The approaches developed by Ralf Schneggenburger’s team are promising. They should also help us gain more insight into the function of other proteins that are active in the synapses. Since synaptic transmission is the basis of all fast communication between neurons in the brain, misfunction at synapses can underlie several neurodegenerative- and psychiatric disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's Disease. \"Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular bases of synapse function will contribute to the development of treatment strategies of these disorders in the future,” the researcher explained.\n (1)Neuron, January 27, 2011, “”\n (2)Neuron, February 24, 2011, “”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have made a step forward in understanding signal transmission in neuronal networks, thanks to new methods to molecularly influence the nerve terminal.

{"id": 71, "text": "Today’s consumers want a cleaner, greener society. There are a number of concepts out there addressing this goal, such as green economy, green growth, sustainable development, bioeconomy and circular economy. These terms have even been adopted by non-profit organizations, lobbies and international organizations for use in their names and initiatives. But that doesn’t necessarily mean we’re all clear on exactly what these concepts mean. At least that’s according to a recent study carried out at EPFL. The research, published this month in \nJournal of Cleaner Production\n, looked specifically at the concept of the green economy. Scientists compared 140 definitions found in journal articles (117) and white papers (23) published over the past ten years. 95 of these definitions were of “green economy” and 45 of “green growth,” a similar term that is often used as a synonym. \nThe concept of a green economy first appeared in the scientific literature in the 1990s but didn’t really gain traction until 2008 – in the wake of the global financial crisis – especially in political and academic circles. The United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were also major drivers of this trend. “The number of journal articles published on this topic every year went from zero in 2008 to 200 in 2018,” says Albert Merino-Saum, the study’s lead author and a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS). But the problem is that each article has its own definition of what the green economy is. While everyone seems to agree that a green economy is based on various social, economic and technological factors, the way each one is described and the importance given to each one can vary from one study to the next.\n“We were surprised to see that all these articles were being published without referring to a seminal study or benchmark paper giving a clear definition of ‘green economy.’ That’s highly unusual for scientific research, where people first try to establish a common conceptual basis. So in our study we aimed to clarify the term and thereby help policymakers evaluate different options in view of the consequences,” says Merino-Saum.\nThree conceptual families\n The first step was to establish a framework of around 40 conceptual elements for evaluating the 140 definitions. The scientists found that the definitions could be grouped into three main families. The first is what they call “econocentric,” or focused on economic factors like trade and finance to achieve environmental and social goals. “This family is closest to the idea of ‘green growth,’ except that discussions of green growth generally don’t account for the fact that natural resources are limited,” says Merino-Saum. The second family focuses more heavily on human well-being. Here the emphasis is on reducing inequality in the distribution of wealth and access to natural resources. The third family sees science and technology as a solution for environmental problems and a vector for sustainable economic growth. “Going forward, we’d like to see journal articles start by stating which ‘green economy’ conceptual family they are referring to,” says Merino-Saum. \nAn idea on its way out? \n But that assumes that the green economy concept is here to stay. Some people think it’s merely a fad that will soon go out of fashion. “Right now we’re seeing a lot of articles about the ‘circular economy.’ From 2008 to 2018, the number of these articles has swelled from zero per year to 800, with a sharp rise in 2015,” says Merino-Saum. This surge could be due in part to reports issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has become a thought leader on the topic, and to the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan. Merino-Saum believes that the green economy concept will only last if researchers make a clear distinction between it and its cousin, sustainable development – such as the fact that the former is more practice-oriented. One sign that ‘green economy’ could be on the way out is its rejection by the UN, which, in its 2030 Agenda, talks about 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe irony isn’t lost on Merino-Saum that the terms coming in and out of fashion relate to sustainability. “Of course, some of the terms are only used for green washing,” he says bluntly, “but most of them are genuinely intended to spur a transition to a more sustainable society.” According to Merino-Saum, the keys are: using the right indicators to measure how effectively concepts are being implemented, and adapting implementation to the actual conditions in a given situation. For instance, priorities like access to water, water quality and access to healthcare can differ from one country – or region – to the next. Now that this study is finished, Merino-Saum and his team plan to dissect some other concepts. Next up? ‘Smart cities’ and ‘urban sustainability.’", "summary": "Concerns about climate change have given rise to a whole series of concepts that are widely used despite their lack of a concrete definition.

{"id": 72, "text": "Croatia and EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland) officially announced their intention to create a centre of scientific-technological excellence. Located in Croatia, its goal will be to launch the careers of young, high-potential researchers in order to stimulate strategic research and economically relevant technological innovation and limit the loss of intellectual capital from the country. The project proposal will be submitted to the European Commission as part of the Horizon 2020 framework programme. If approved, it will receive up to €20 million in funding from the EU, bring together more than 70 collaborators and give creative young talents who are just setting out in their careers the stimulating opportunity to lead their first teams and to conduct visionary research in selected fields that are considered of key importance to the future of Croatian economy. EPFL, recognized in Europe for its success in applying a strategy based on recruiting and developing the careers of young researchers, hopes to help transfer its demonstrated successful expertise in this important strategic area to Croatia. The partners have been in discussions since summer 2013, and their ambition is to make this centre into an international leader in its specific domains by 2020. \n Such a platform should help strengthen other Croatian-EU cooperation projects.\n The official project announcement took place in Zagreb on March 7, 2014, in the presence of the Croatian Vice-Minister of Science, Education and Sport Saša Zelenika, the Croatian Vice-Minister of Regional Development Jakša Puljiz, the Swiss State Secretary of Education, Research and Innovation Mauro Dell Ambrogio, the President of the Swiss National Science Foundation Martin Vetterli, and EPFL President Patrick Aebischer.\n The centre will host a dozen scientific teams in Croatia, each one led by a promising young professor, selected after an open excellence competition. In all, more than 70 individuals could be working in the centre. The research areas concerned – notably engineering, health-related and electronics – correspond to activity sectors identified as crucial for Croatia’s improved economic development. \nInvesting in young researchers – a strategy for a scientific Europe\n EPFL has established a highly effective means of recruiting promising young scientific talents and giving them the means to realize their potential: the “Tenure Track” system, in which they are placed at the head of a research team with a significant budget at their disposal for a seven-year probationary period. Currently, EPFL has 60 of these young tenure track assistant professors in its faculty. In a sign of its success, out of 100 Tenure Track professors who have started their careers at EPFL, more than a third obtained an ERC starting grant – the most prestigious grant awarded by the European Research Council to young researchers, carrying up to €2 million in funding. \n According to EPFL President Patrick Aebischer, measures such as these are necessary not only to stimulate research, but also to enable Europe to retain its most talented researchers. “Young European scientists must often wait for many years before a professorship becomes available. Many of them leave for the U.S., never to return,” he explains. “Whether it’s in Switzerland or in Croatia, we must put a system in place that allows them to reach their full potential and establish their careers in Europe, and in doing so make a local contribution to value and job creation.” \nThe project proposal will soon be submitted to the European Commission \n \"We must promote the career of our young researchers. This is the main expectation of our joint project with EPFL,” explains Saša Zelenika, Croatia’s Vice-Minister of Science, Education and Sports.\n Based on its experience, EPFL will take responsibility for launching and initial management of the institute, with help from international and Croatian scientific committees. The project will be part of the European Horizon 2020 programme, which includes a section entitled “Teaming” that is dedicated to the transfer of expertise and strategies between countries.\n The project proposal will be submitted in September 2014. If approved by the European Commission, EPFL and the Croatian partners will have an additional year to submit a detailed action plan.

{"id": 76, "text": "Pilot and psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard just \"landed\" after 72 hours of simulated flight across the Atlantic Ocean in Solar Impulse, a solar airplane which is equipped with advanced renewable technology. This second virtual flight, which started Tuesday morning and took place at the military base in Dübendorf, Switzerland, was the chance for Piccard to test his mental and physiological boundaries during strenuous flight conditions. EPFL technology monitored his mental states and cardiac rhythm throughout the flight, both in real-time and for post-flight data analysis.\n In a collaboration between EPFL, Hirslanden and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), twenty-seven electrodes placed on Piccard's head measured the electrical activity of his brain, also known as electroencephalogram (EEG). Mental states like sleep, fatigue and thinking can be detected in the fluctuations of these electrical signals. This information will be compared with a series of vigilance tests that were done during the 72 hour flight to evaluate Piccard's alertness and his ability to perform tasks.\n EPFL scientists also measured the electrical activity of the pilot's heart, also known as an electrocardiogram (ECG). The obvious reason is to detect an unusual heartbeat, or a cardiac arrest. But cardiac rhythms also contain information about mental alertness.\n “We are developing smart technology that can evaluate mental states in real-time by monitoring the heart alone,” explains EPFL scientist Francisco Rincon at the Embedded Systems Laboratory. “The 72 hours of data collected here – from the heart, the brain activity and the vigilance tests – will be helpful for developing this technology.”\n The flight simulator took Solar Impulse on one possible trajectory across the Atlantic Ocean, from Norfolk (US) to Almeria (ES), although it did not simulate all of the possible conditions one would experience in Solar Impulse's cockpit. \"Atmospheric pressure and temperature changes were not incorporated into the simulation at this stage, although both have an impact on human physiology,\" explains Solar Impulse pilot André Borschberg, \"not to mention the excitement of really flying Solar Impulse.\"", "summary": "Solar Impulse pilot Bertrand Piccard put his mental and physiological limits to the test during a 72 hour simulated flight across the Atlantic Ocean which ended today.

{"id": 79, "text": "Making a foray into the business world is an essential rite of passage for all EPFL engineering students. They must spend 2–6 months working for a company, after which they can also opt for an in-company master’s project to cap off their studies (\nsee text box\n). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.\nA wellspring of innovation\nBut EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.\nThe reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”\nJosep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.\nSupport for small businesses\nThe students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&D.\n“The best possible transition”\nAs delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.\nEve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said. And it was clearly a positive experience on both sides, because the firm hired her as soon as she graduated. Indeed, many students go on to be hired by the companies they work for. “We hire about 20% of our interns,” said Solà i Carós. “The advantage is that they already know our company. Internships bring us a lot of benefits in the short and long term.”\nInternships also give businesses an opportunity to form ties with EPFL laboratories. That could open the door to broader joint research projects financed by Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which aims to encourage technology transfer to industry.\nEPFL internships and master’s projects\nInternships are in general paid and give engineering students an opportunity to spend several months working for a company. They take place away from an academic setting, and the subject must be approved by the school.\nMaster’s projects are students’ final research projects and are closely overseen by an EPFL professor.

{"id": 80, "text": "There is growing evidence that our clothing exposes us to particles and chemicals on a daily basis – and that this exposure could carry significant health risks. Scientists therefore need to better quantify this exposure so that we can develop strategies for mitigating those risks. At least that’s according to Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL’s Smart Living Lab in Fribourg, who has just published a critical review of research on this topic in Environmental Science and Technology.\n Our clothing acts as a protective barrier against physical and chemical hazards. However, it can also expose us to potentially toxic chemicals and biological particles by releasing millions of such substances every day, depending on how we use and treat the fabrics. Some substances are removed by washing, drying and storing clothing properly, while others stick around and become difficult to get rid of. \nAnalysis of 260 articles\n These potentially toxic substances include molecular compounds, abiotic particles and biotic particles (such as microbes and allergens), and can end up in our lungs. Common examples include nicotine residue from cigarette smoke, microbes from pets and hazardous compounds used in the farming, medical and manufacturing industries. Surprisingly, until now scientists have taken little interest in this issue. In the first part of his paper, Licina summaries the findings of 260 articles on the subject and identifies some serious knowledge gaps as well as specific avenues for further research. \n “We feel this issue has been understudied so far. The clothing and fabrics people wear have changed enormously over the past few years – today our clothes contain synthetic materials with antimicrobial, anti-UV, stain-repellent and water-repellent additives – but nobody can say whether these new materials expose us to more chemicals and particles than natural fibers,” says Licina. \nA significant impact \n He suggests requiring that all clothing include a label indicating not just what materials it is made from, but also what substances were used in the fabrication process – much like the ingredient and nutrition-information labels that are required on food. “Today there are no laws or regulations addressing this issue,” says Licina. In short, we know that clothing can have a significant impact on our daily exposure to particles and chemicals, through the air we breathe and the contact with our skin, but we don’t what the full ramifications are in terms of public health. \n Dusan Licina has been writing articles on this subject for several years. While he was performing research in the US (from 2016 to 2018), he spent a year continually monitoring indoor air quality at a neonatal intensive-care unit. He measured how particles are transported inside the unit and even to babies’ incubators. Licina found that when nurses entered the unit, the air-particle concentration increased by a factor of 2.5, and that some of those particles could be traced directly to the shirts that nurses wore during their commute to the hospital. These particles could feasibly play a major role in the development of the babies’ immune systems. But, once again, more research is needed.\nNon-smokers exposed\n Similar studies carried out on clothing worn in other settings revealed significant traces of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides – compounds that could be absorbed by fabrics in one place and released in another. “Research has already shown that an individual’s clothing can carry potentially toxic particles that can expose people nearby. For example, scientists have found that non-smokers who sit next to smokers with nicotine particles on their clothing have traces of nicotine in their blood and urine later on,\" says Licina. “What’s more, the particle concentrations that people are thus exposed to from clothing are substantial when compared with total exposure estimates in health effect studies. However, what’s missing are data on how that exposure affects us on a day-to-day basis.” \n To fill in those gaps, Licina calls on biologists and chemists to work closely with environmental engineers, in the interests of public health. He also suggests that until further research is conducted and better clothing-information regulations are adopted, consumers pay more attention to how their clothes are made and wash them regularly using gentle, all-natural detergents.", "summary": "Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at the Smart Living Lab, EPFL Fribourg, has taken a critical look at how much we really know about our exposure to particles and chemicals transported by our clothing.

{"id": 83, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process.

{"id": 85, "text": "A second small Swiss satellite is going to be launched into space. After SwissCube in 2009, the Swiss Space Center (SSC) at EPFL is working on a new project. Baptized as CubETH, the youngest member of the Swiss cubsats family takes a lot from its predecessor: it measures ten cubic centimeters and weighs less than 1.5 kg. However, its scientific mission is more ambitious. This device is the result of a partnership with the Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich (ETHZ) as well as other collaborators. Its launching is scheduled for the end of 2015 at the earliest. The prototype is currently going through the “flat sat” stage: in order to test all its electronic components, they are electrically connected as they will be in the final structure while lying flat on a lab’s table.\n\"We aim at making CubETH a high performance orbitographic tool capable of calculating its position, altitude and orientation in space with high accuracy,\" said Markus Rothacher, director of the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab at ETH Zurich and main investigator for the scientific part of the project. The idea is to design a stable satellite in order to prevent it from spinning, as it happened to the SwissCube. \"But most importantly, added the specialist, we want to create conditions for future cubsats constellations so that, for example, we could carry out thorough observations of Earth at a given time. For that reason, it is essential to know the satellites’ exact orbits so as to coordinate their trajectories and scientific equipment.\"\nProven on Earth, unprecented in space\nTo achieve a more accurate measurement of the satellite’s orbit, the researchers opted for GPS receivers designed by the Swiss company u-blox. \"These sensors caught our interest because they are small, cheap and their performance is well proven, said Anton Ivanov, SSC researcher in charge of the satellite’s entire technical design. The u-blox receivers are very common, particularly in mobile phones, but they have never been used in space. We want to prove that, by adapting its software, this low cost piece of hardware originally developed for terrestrial purposes can be used in space applications.\"\nIn addition, these sensors are compatible with other navigational systems like the Russian GLONASS or the European Galileo. Hence, researchers are envisaging using all of these GPS technologies, not only for the cubsats constellations but also in the context of the \"cleaner\" satellite project CleanSpace One. They could certainly provide the high precision necessary for carrying out the delicate maneuvers to approach and capture space debris.\nFinally, the CubETH will also have an antenna on its side to study the atmosphere’s composition and nature. The idea is yet again to verify the efficiency of less expensive components than those traditionally used in space. In such a way, the CubETH project remains faithful to the spirit behind SwissCube and cubsats in general: being a platform for testing and demonstrating the applicability of standard electronic components in space.\nAn educational role\nThe cubesats’ format was devised by the California and Stanford universities to allow scholars conduct their own spatial scientific experiments at a reduced cost. The most innovative and significant design elements of SwissCube have been kept, such as the use of cell phone batteries packaged in a waterproof and thermally controlled casing. Another preserved feature is the use of the innovative system of copper pads that provide a better attachment of the solar cells on the satellite’s walls.\nEven before its launch, the new satellite will have also played an important educational role. In addition to generating links and collaborations between the country’s two Federal Institutes of Technology, the different pieces of software on board the satellite will have been the object of study of undergraduate and doctoral students lucky enough to take advantage of a concrete project for learning about space technologies.\n*\n Other Project Partners\n:\n Academic: Hochschule Zentralschweiz (Luzern), Hochschule Rapperswil Tecknik\n Industrial: u- blox, RUAG, Saphyrion.", "summary": "CubETH is the name of a joint project between EPFL’s Swiss Space Center and ETHZ whose main objective is to build a satellite scheduled for launch in late 2015.

{"id": 86, "text": "This may be Switzerland’s last stand, since its eligibility for European research and funding programs is in jeopardy. The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.\nEPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).\nEPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.\nHowever, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants. This restriction was temporarily lifted on 15 September 2014.\nThis grace period will end on 9 February 2017. Swiss researchers can therefore still respond to calls for proposals whose deadline falls before that date.\nEPFL H2020 Advanced Grants\nSmit, Berend – MaGic\nThe Materials Genome in Action\nIt is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

{"id": 91, "text": "Vincent Kaufmann, a sociologist who specializes in mobility studies, decided to expand his usual focus on urban areas to include Switzerland and the European Union (EU). Kaufmann, who is also the head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, teamed up with Spanish researcher Ander Audikana to write an essay on mobility and the free movement of people in the EU and in Switzerland. The authors’ starting point was the “Stop mass immigration\" initiative, which was approved by voters on 9 February 2014.\nTheir essay provides a Swiss perspective that people concerned about a borderless EU and its unintended consequences might do well to consider. Clive H. Church, researcher at the University of Kent,\nalso draws an interesting parallel between Switzerland and post-Brexit UK in the book’s preface. Vincent Kaufmann tells us why this essay is important.\nWhat gave rise to this essay?\nSwitzerland has been dealing with mobility-related issues for decades: the introduction of the Erasmus program, truck traffic crossing the Alps, limiting trucks to 40 tons, the AlpTransit initiative, the free movement of people, the modal shift from road to rail, and so on. All these issues have one thing in common: mobility. And yet, they are never analyzed together. On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people voted on two separate questions that, in reality, were both rooted in mobility. On that day, the people approved the “Stop mass immigration” initiative, which called for immigration quotas. They also gave the go-ahead for a fund to upgrade the country’s rail infrastructure. In a way, Swiss people paradoxically voted for “less mobility” and “more mobility” at the same time. Since then, there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric but very little sociological analysis of what really happened in that vote. Seeing this, Ander Audikana and I wanted to show how important it is to look at all these mobility issues together, in Switzerland but also in the EU, in order to get a better idea of what the consequences will be.\nWhat are your main conclusions?\nIn the first part of our essay, we look at the EU’s founding documents. It’s clear that the free movement of people – much more than economic interests – was at the core of the European project. These documents show that mobility was considered the only way of unifying the member states and erasing the differences in their political and welfare systems. The Erasmus program, for example, clearly states this goal in its founding texts. But there are two sides to mobility: movement and “moorings”. Moorings refer to the connections a person makes once they have moved to a new place: building meaningful social relationships, absorbing the culture, learning the language, making use of public spaces, coming to identify with the place and building an emotional bond with it etc. Unfortunately, EU policies largely overlook this, and instead demand that people move from place to place while failing to assess the consequences of widespread geographical mobility on regional development, the ability of diverse groups of people to live alongside each other, and wage dumping. These problems are left to the individual member countries, and we think this is a major shortcoming.\nHow does this shortcoming affect Switzerland?\nIn theory, an EU company could win a contract to plant trees in a small Swiss town, and no local landscaping companies would be able to compete on price. This is a good example of mobility without moorings: the cross-border deal is encouraged without first looking at whether this scenario is fair. While people consider these types of situations totally unfair, the EU has created a legal apparatus that is simply oblivious to this. It’s this type of mechanism that Europeans are now rallying against, as we see in the rise in populism. The mobility demanded by the EU creates as many problems as it solves.\nYou interviewed the leaders of the six main political parties in Switzerland about this issue. Yet they are cited anonymously in your essay. Why did you do this?\nWe wanted to get away from partisan politics and take an anthropological approach. Rereading these interviews, we saw that mobility-related questions did not fit neatly into the left-right paradigm. We see, for example, very liberal views on both sides: the idea that the world will be a better place the more people move around. At the same time, there’s a need for the state to be more assertive and get a better grip on the flow of money, people and goods. We think that where these two positions meet is where we can find compromises and solutions. In Switzerland, local identity is important and is currently seen as being under threat. The people want the government to do something about this.\nIs this what the EU could learn from the Swiss experience when it comes to rethinking mobility and the elimination of borders? \nSwitzerland is seeking a better balance between mobility and moorings. The fact that the EU is so dogmatic about being borderless is a problem for Switzerland, since this country doesn’t work that way. The Swiss don't subscribe to dogmas – they reach compromises through discussion and direct democracy. For EU countries, Switzerland is an interesting laboratory. Debates that do not happen elsewhere take place here. We feel that the way in which the Swiss achieve compromises on questions of mobility and the free movement of people could help the EU overcome some of the hurdles it faces. Our analysis shows, for example, that the EU should not have focused so much on a policy of \nmobility\n in its founding documents but rather on a policy of \naccessibility\n: access to services, to infrastructure and to other countries. The EU’s overriding goal should not be to make sure that people move from here to there at all costs. It should be to guarantee a certain level of fairness when people, goods, and services move across borders. Returning to the example of EU companies competing in Switzerland: in order to gain access to the Swiss market, these companies should apply Swiss prices.\nIn your essay, you foresee a return to medieval, walled-in cities in Europe. Is the situation that dire? \nThe current border situation will require a strong political response by the EU. Failing that, we believe there’s a good chance that walls, watchtowers and barbed wire could indeed pop up all over Europe, transforming the continent into a gated community.\nVincent Kaufmann, Ander Audikana, \nMobilité et Libre circulation en Europe: un regard suisse\n, Fondation Jean Monnet, Economica - Les Cahiers rouges, Paris, 2017.", "summary": "Vincent Kaufmann, an EPFL researcher, has co-authored an essay on Switzerland’s recent referendums on mobility and the free movement of people.

{"id": 93, "text": "Will it be possible one day to reconfigure electronic microchips however we want, even when they are in use? A recent discovery by a team at EPFL suggests as much. The researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to create conductive pathways several atoms wide in a material, to move them around at will and even to make them disappear. Their research is the subject of a recent article appearing in Nature Nanotechnology.\nAdaptable electronics is generating significant interest in the scientific community because of the many applications. Imagine for a moment that one single microchip was capable of accomplishing the tasks of several different circuits. For example, a circuit assigned to process sound information could, when not being used for this purpose, be reassigned to process images. This would allow us to miniaturise our electronic devices.\nAt the same time, it would become possible to develop resilient circuits. Whenever a microchip is damaged, it could theoretically reconfigure itself so that it could still function using the components that remain intact. \"An effective way to keep faulty devices working when they are in hard-to-reach places, like space,\" says Leo McGilly, the article's lead author.\nUnderlying this promising technology are so-called 'ferroelectric' materials in which it is possible to create flexible conductive pathways. These pathways are generated by applying an electric field to the material. More specifically, when the electric current is applied, certain atoms moves either \"up\" or \"down,\" which is known as polarisation. In recent years, the academic world has observed that conductive pathways several atoms wide - called 'walls' - form between these polarized zones. The only problem is that, until now, it was impossible to control how these pathways form.\nAt this point, the researchers have tested their research on isolated materials. The next step consists in developing a prototype of a reconfigurable circuit. Leo McGilly would go even further. \"The fact that we can generate pathways wherever we want could allow us to imitate in the future phenomena that take place inside the brain, with the regular creation of new synapses. This could prove useful in reproducing the phenomenon of learning in an artificial brain.\"\n-----\nAdd. informations:", "summary": "Multitasking circuits capable of reconfiguring themselves in real time and switching functions as the need arises - this is the promising application stemming from a discovery made at EPFL and published in Nature Nanotechnology.

{"id": 94, "text": "Concrete has been around since the 19\nth\n century. Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

{"id": 96, "text": "Photovoltaics can be used directly in building and renovation projects and serve as a construction material in their own right. Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

Without realizing it, we are constantly tweaking our pace, stride length and foot lift. But could we consciously play with these parameters in order to influence our energy expenditure?\n Researchers at EPFL’s  from the School of Engineering studied eight gait parameters in order to come up with a very sophisticated software program that uses an avatar to predict how much energy people use when they walk depending on their walking style. This research has been published in . Salman Faraji, the co-lead author, devoted an entire section of his thesis to this topic.\nThe avatar – a torso equipped with two legs with feet – can be freely configured. Users start by entering their height and weight and can then set the walking speed, distance between their feet (stride length and stride width), and foot lift, along with the incline of both the torso and the ground. They can also add mass and simulate the effect of being pushed or pulled at different parts of the body. The number of calories burned and the energy consumption are displayed in real time whenever the parameters are modified.\nMaking custom exoskeletons\nThis pioneering software drew on a number of experiments appearing in recent literature, and it offers a huge number of potential applications – especially in the medical realm. “The software could be used to select the best design for an exoskeleton or a custom prosthetic, in order to reduce the user's effort. With a wearable exoskeleton, for example, we could optimize the location of the battery and actuators, or determine the ideal walking pattern for the user’s preferred speed,” says Amy Wu, the study’s other co-lead author.

Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples.

{"id": 110, "text": "At  – educational facilities designed to promote cross-disciplinary research – a groundbreaking new device is in the works. Eight Master’s students in microengineering, bioengineering and life sciences () developed a portable biosensor for the  competition, which was held at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands on 7–8 September 2018. Their device can provide precise measurements of the amount of vancomycin, an antibiotic used as a last-resort treatment, in a patient’s blood plasma. This information will help doctors deliver exactly the amount of drug needed and therefore reduce the occurrence of harmful side effects. For instance, vancomycin is known to cause damage to the kidneys and to hearing.\n“We started working on the biosensor last fall alongside our coursework, and this summer have been working on it full-time. Being able to use the DLL has made our research a lot easier, since they have all the equipment we need,” says Alix Faillétaz, a Master’s student in bioengineering. This is the second year in a row that EPFL is participating in SensUs, where its team will be up against students from 12 other universities from around the world. “The competition was launched three years ago. It’s really demanding and is a huge challenge for the students. They must overcome a series of problems and learn to work together, trust each other and delegate tasks based on each individual’s specific skills,” says Professor Philippe Renaud, who is coaching the team.\nPolarization-based measurements\nSensUs aims to encourage the development of biosensors, targeting a different application each year – although the objective always relates to measuring a biomarker with an impact on public health. The objective is chosen by a panel of experts that includes Professor Renaud. Existing tests to measure vancomycin require a great deal of time, a considerable amount of blood and a special machine that costs tens of thousands of Swiss francs. But the EPFL team’s portable biosensor can take measurements in less than five minutes with just a few drops of blood, and costs under 5,000 francs. Their device shines polarized light on a sample containing a homogeneous mixture of the patient’s blood plasma and a synthetized peptide (an amino-acid sequence) solution.\nHow does it work? “We first created a peptide that bonds specifically to vancomycin, and then we added a fluorescent compound,” says Faillétaz. “As the vancomycin bonds to the fluorescent peptide, the peptide’s movement slows and the light it emits becomes more and more polarized. By measuring the degree of light polarization, we can calculate the vancomycin concentration in a patient’s blood.” According to Professor Renaud, this method already exists but has never been used to make a portable biosensor.\nAt the competition, the EPFL team will have to not only prove their biosensor’s efficacy by analyzing various samples, but also demonstrate its benefits for the healthcare industry and its market potential. “By changing the synthesis compound, our biosensor could be used to detect other antibiotics and biomarkers,” says David Vilela, a Master’s student in life sciences.\nEPFL on the first step of the podium\n The SenSwiss team won the most awards in the SensUs international competition. They won the technical award, and placed second for the awards related to creativity and entrepreneurship. Their biosensor has proven to be the most effective in accurately measuring the amount of vancomycin in blood plasma samples.

{"id": 118, "text": "Swarm robotics is offering innovative solutions to real-world problems by creating a new form of artificial intelligence based on insect-like instincts. Mirko Kovac, from EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, is a young robotics engineer who has already made leaps forward in the field with his grasshopper-inspired jumping robot.\nHe and his collaborators have created an innovative perching mechanism where the robot flies head first into the object, a tree for example—without being destroyed— and attaches to almost any type of surface using sharp prongs. It then detaches on command. The goal is to create robots that can travel in swarms over rough terrain to come to the aide of catastrophe victims.\n “We are not blindly imitating nature, but using the same principles to possibly improve on it,” explains Kovac, who recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL. “Simple behavioral laws such as jumping, flying and perching lead to complex control over movement without the need for high computational power.”\n Jumping, gliding and perching allow for mobility over rocky territory or destroyed urban areas. This new form of AI takes its inspiration from the insect world, but is more as an abstract reflection on their instincts and design principles than merely imitating their morphology. This simplicity allows for greater mobility since the robots are not bogged down with heavy batteries. Kovac imagines swarms of his robots equipped with different sensors and small cameras that could be deployed over devastated areas to transmit essential information back to rescue command centers.\n The labs most recent innovation, perching a robot, saves valuable energy by allowing the robot to rest like insects or birds do. Many previous perching mechanisms include a complicated swooping maneuver to decrease momentum and land on legs, often without the ability of detaching. The mechanism developed by Dr Kovac and Jürg Markus Germann, recently published in the Journal of Micro-Nano Mechatronics, avoids this problem by using two spring-loaded arms fitted with pins that dig into the surface, whether it is wood or concrete. The snapping of the arms creates a forward momentum, allowing for a soft deceleration of the glider and avoiding mechanical damage. A remotely controlled mini-motor then detracts the pins and allows the robot to continue on its way.\n “I am fascinated by the creative process,” says Kovac, “and how it is possible to use the sophistication found in nature to create something completely new.” The perching mechanism can be easily adapted to other robots. His previous robot, a quarter-gram jumping robot that can achieve heights of up to four and a half feet, could now be fitted with the new perching mechanism as well as wings, thus creating a hybrid creature that gets around much like a flying grasshopper.\n Having recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL, Mirko Kovac is spending this summer in the United States as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.", "summary": "A swarm of flying robots soars into a blazing forest fire.

{"id": 119, "text": "Today’s “intelligent” cars, equipped with multiple sensors and algorithms, can react to emergency situations, regulate speed, assist with parking and respond to voice commands. But they don’t know who’s at the wheel or how that driver is feeling. The face is a valuable source of this information, and a project initiated by EPFL’s Transportation Center involving EPFL’s Signal Processing 5 Laboratory (LTS5) and PSA Peugeot Citroën aims to mine it for use in the automobiles of the future.\nFace-related technologies have progressed rapidly in recent years, and are used in many areas. Facial recognition is used in real time to relay the exact position of an individual, and eye-tracking devices indicate the direction in which he or she is looking. Analyzing the movements of the head and eyes can also indicate a state of fatigue or sleepiness. EPFL’s LTS5 and its start-up, nViso, are conducting research into capturing facial expressions and exploring the wide range of possible scientific, behavioral and commercial applications that the technology offers.\nTechnological challenges\nThe scientists had to tackle the challenge of adapting the technology for use in cars. “Our goal is to build the technological base to detect and situate a driver’s face at any moment in time,” explains LTS5 director Jean-Philippe Thiran. “Using this tool, it will then be possible to build and test various driver assistance applications such as eye tracking, fatigue detection, lip reading, and so on.”\n“With this study we are trying to make the interface between the car and the driver more intuitive; reading intentions from facial features is a very natural interactive mode,” adds Olivier Pajot, PSA Peugeot Citroën’s representative on the EPFL campus.\nThe instrument, developed using a prototyping platform provided by the French car manufacturer, is currently operational, although the research is still far from finished. Vehicles impose a number of specific limitations, beginning with the question of where to place the camera. It cannot obstruct the driver’s field of vision. “One of the possible options is to place it behind the steering wheel, which would require a system that’s quick enough to recapture the face detection after the arms of the steering wheel interrupt it,” explains Thiran. Another issue is adapting to changing lighting conditions, in order to track the driver’s face as the car goes into a tunnel, for example, or when driving into a setting sun. And, finally, the tool must perform as well when the driver is facing it as when she turns her head to the side.\nImproving performance\n“We are currently working on improving the system’s performance, particularly by increasing the number of images processed,” continues Thiran. “The next step is to test it in realistic conditions. PSA Peugeot Citroën will install the platform on a car and our lab will test the system under various application scenarios.”\nPSA Peugeot Citroën opened an office in EPFL’s Innovation Square in summer 2011, with the goal of collaborating on research and innovation projects.

{"id": 120, "text": "When used in very large quantities in drinking water, chlorine presents significant risks to public health. As well as neutralizing the pathogens found in water, chlorine reacts with the natural organic matter and produces a variety of disinfection by-products (DBPs).\nThe discovery of a potential link between DBPs and an increased rate of miscarriages and bladder cancers has led to the implementation of stricter regulations, as well as changes in the design of water-treatment systems during the last decade.\nThese concerns, added to the risks involved in the storage of chlorine in gaseous form, have recently persuaded many sewage or water-treatment stations to partially stop using chlorine for the disinfection of water. Many systems are now using chloramine instead.\nHowever, as described by Urs von Gunten (School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering at EPFL and EAWAG) and David L. Sedlak (University of California) , a series of recent studies suggests that this change from chlorine to chloramine has led to unexpected consequences that present risks to public health and the environment. It was discovered that monochloramine can form NDMA, a substance that has proved to be much more toxic than the “traditional elements” formed by chlorine.\nThe risks of chlorine\n“This problem affects mainly the U.S.”, explains Urs von Gunten “as the use of monochloramine is illegal in Switzerland. What’s more, in Switzerland the water is often pumped directly from the water-table, and is distributed without chlorine.\"\nIn particular, they apply to the protection of drinking-water sources, the appropriate treatment of water, and the maintenance of distribution networks . These measures enable the authorities to minimize the presence of chlorine, or to avoid its presence altogether.\nUrs von Gunten also raises the issue of the different levels of acceptance in the population. In Switzerland, the taste of chlorine causes suspicion and complaints from the public. “In the U.S. it’s the opposite,” he explains. “If drinking water doesn’t taste of chlorine, people are concerned!”\nThis specialist of drinking-water treatment notes a rather diversified situation in Europe: “The application of standards differs from one country to another. In Switzerland, Germany and Austria the use of chlorine as a disinfectant for water is avoided as far as possible. In Spain, however, it is used a lot, and France is somewhere in between.\nConsidering the risks that the use of chlorine presents to public health, Urs von Gunten offers this conclusion: “The solution can be found in a rigorous regulation that protects drinking water resources, that guarantee clean disinfection, and that maintain distribution systems - these measures would avoid using large quantities of chlorine as a disinfectant and avoid the unpleasant odors, tastes, and health risks that accompany it.”", "summary": "Disinfection using chlorine has played an important role in the supply of drinking water, but its use also involves some risk.

The objective of this grant program is to ensure that there is a new supply of graduate scientists, to encourage mobility, and to support women’s careers. “The number of grants is limited, while the number of doctoral students with the required level to aspire to these grants has largely increased”, observes Caroline Vandevyver, responsible for the preparation of the application forms. “This is the result of the strict selection of doctoral students performed by the Doctoral School. Only 15% of them applied in 2005, compared to 27% in 2010.” In a market which is becoming more and more competitive, doctoral students are increasingly aware of the value of doing research abroad. While not all of them become professors, many find interesting opportunities in universities, as well as in industry.\n An FNS grant constitutes a first-rate opportunity, since it enables the doctoral student who has completed his/her thesis to continue his/her education in the university and the topic of his/her choice. The grant is awarded for a period of 18 months, and includes an allowance for personal expenses, an amount for travel expenses, and possibly also a contribution towards research and symposium costs. The amount granted depends on marital status, family-related responsibilities, and the cost of living in the country of residence. They are awarded independently of nationality, sex or family situation. Only the applicants’ competencies are taken into account. The researchers are thus able to devote their entire attention to their research work. The only condition for applying is to have obtained a doctoral degree at EPFL. “All those who received one of these grants said that it had been a springboard for their professional career”, adds Caroline Vandevyver.\n EPFL and its teachers strongly encourage these research periods abroad. They constitute an almost inevitable step in a scientific career, are practically essential in becoming a professor, and a major asset in being selected for important positions. The likelihood of becoming a professor is greater for someone who has benefited from a grant. In a recent study, the EPFL Research Commission has observed that 17% of post-doctoral scholarship students began an academic career, but that only 23% of them came back to Switzerland to pursue it. We might therefore wonder: what is the benefit for a university such as EPFL to see its best people leave? This question of brain drain versus brain gain has been assessed in depth both at EPFL and the FNS, and the two institutions have reached the conclusion that the benefits of this type of sponsorship is extremely positive, and contributes to increasing the visibility of Switzerland internationally. FNS scholarship students are ambassadors for EPFL worldwide: they increase the institutions renown, and stimulate other researchers to come to study or work in Switzerland.

The research team, led by Mirjam Münch, also showed that the effects of light exposure last until the early evening, and that light intensity has an impact on cognitive mechanisms. The results of this research were recently published in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience. \n Light synchronizes our biological clocks. It is collected in the eye by photoreceptors that use photopigments (pigments that change when exposed to light), known as melanopsin. These cells, which differ from rods and cones, are considered a third class of photoreceptors in the retina and were discovered just ten years ago. They’re not there to form an image, but to perceive and absorb photons in the visible light spectrum. In addition, they are stimulated by blue light. \nExploring office lighting \n Münch and her team wanted to know how our circadian rhythm could be influenced by our perception of light during the daytime. They created realistic office lighting conditions and recruited 29 young participants. “For this study, we took into account the intensity of natural and artificial light without specifically evaluating their spectra.”\nFrom daytime to dusk\n To synchronize their internal biological clocks, the volunteers had to maintain a regular sleep schedule during the seven days leading up to the test. They wore bracelets equipped with light sensors and accelerometers, so that the scientists could monitor their movements. \n The study itself took place over two eight-hour sessions. The participants spent the first six hours in an experiment room, first in well-lighted conditions (1000-2000 lux, more or less equivalent to natural light in a room). In the second session, the light intensity was about 170 lux, which is what the eye perceives in a room without a window, lit with artificial light. For this experiment, light intensity was measured at eye-level. Every 30 minutes, the subjects were asked to assess how alert or sleepy they felt. \n Finally, at the end of each session, the participants underwent two hours of supplemental memory tests in a darkened room – less than 6 lux. During these last two hours, the researchers took saliva samples in order to measure cortisol and melatonin concentrations. These two hormones are produced in a in a 24-hour cycle by the human body.\nBoosted by the light\n The volunteers who were subjected to higher light intensity during the afternoon were more alert all the way into the early evening. When they were subjected to light intensity ten times weaker, however, they showed signs of sleepiness and obtained lower scores on the memory tests. \n These results were observed even in the absence of changes in cortisol and melatonin concentrations in their saliva. “With this study, we have discovered that light intensity has a direct effect on the subjective feeling of sleepiness as well as on objective cognitive performance, and that the benefits of more intense light during the daytime last long past the time of exposure,” concludes Münch.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences our cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until early evening.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences their cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until early evening.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [8, 8], "noise": false}
{"id": 129, "text": "Swiss democracy produces lots of data: municipality-by-municipality ballot results and the votes of the National Council are publicly available, as are the responses of the candidates and voters who filled in the questionnaire on the \"smartvote\" voter recommendation website before the 2011 Federal elections. Under the supervision of professors Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran, Vincent Etter and Julien Herzen, PhD students in the Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory, explored these data to reveal a number of interesting facts. They are currently continuing their research by creating a platform, Predikon.ch, that will be able to predict the results of a federal vote based on initial results coming in from municipalities and past data.\nYes, the “Röstigraben” exists! “And it was a bit of a surprise,” admits Etter. They performed a dimensionality reduction on the municipal results for all votes since 1981. This is a standard tool used by statisticians who specialize in data analysis to produce a graphical representation of data. Two groups emerged: one French-speaking and one of German-speaking. (You can see it at ). “The municipalities closest to the intersection of the groups on the graph are also those that are geographically closest to the linguistic border,” notes Herzen.\nWhile the linguistic divide is easy to see on this representation, it’s a bit more difficult to make sense of the graph’s axes, obtained by the dimensionality reduction. “It’s not the traditional left-right and conservative-liberal divisions,” explains Etter. Over time, the Italian-speaking regions seem to move away from the French-speaking districts to join their German-speaking compatriots. In a future version of their interactive graphic, the scientists plan to add a temporal cursor that will highlight this.\nRight and Left are alive and well \nAlthough the Röstigraben can’t be explained by either the left-right or conservative-liberal divide, these classical political categories are alive and well when it comes to politicians, as the duo found when they applied the same data visualization tools to information from the 2011 Federal elections obtained from the voter recommendation website smartvote.ch.\nWith the same data analysis approach, the researchers explored whether the political parties were really all that different from one another. They showed that the positions of 25.8% of the socialist candidates were closer to the median of the green party positions than to their own party’s position. Inversely, the proportion was 18.8%. But the overlap was greatest in the PBD, with more than half of its politicians closer to the median of another party (most often the PDC, 33.1%) than aligned with their own.\nEtter and Herzen also showed that it would be easy for a candidate who filled in his or her own smartvote profile to choose responses that would optimize the number of times they would be recommended to voters that trusted the site. However, this was evidently not exploited in 2011, since the difference between the voting records of parliamentary politicians and their smartvote profile was very small.\nEbikon, a small town that has it right\nThe next step for the two computer scientists is to predict the result of an vote by combining the initial votes coming in from a small number of municipalities with the database of past results. The platform they are developing with Victor Kristof, a student in Communication systems, is called Predikon.ch, a combination of the words “Prediction” and “Ebikon.” This small town near Lucerne (population 12,000) appeared in their preparatory studies to be the one whose results most reliably predicted the federal result. “By doing the exercise with past votes, in 96% of the cases, the result in Ebikon gave us the correct result at the federal level,” explains Herzen.\nThe project’s development is hampered by the fact that each of Switzerland’s 26 cantons has a different system for presenting its data, and that often these platforms are only online for a few hours the day the vote is held, while ballots are still being counted; but nonetheless there’s a good chance that the Predikon index will soon be mentioned in the news updates on these Sundays.\nThe Predikon project, along with all of Etter and Herzen’s research, will be presented at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences Open House, Saturday November 22 at 3:30 pm in room BC420, during a seminar entitled “La démocratie suisse vue par les données.” Throughout the Open House, a Predikon demo will be held on the fourth floor of the BC building.

{"id": 130, "text": "Obviously, wind farms work best when it is windy. But aside from wind-speed and direction, there are other more subtle factors that influence their power output. Using a mathematical model, researchers from EPFL’s  have shown the impact of vertical movements of the air on the productivity of wind farms. They found that increased turbulence caused by convective movements, common on hot, sunny days, increased the output of wind farms by shortening the lifespan of the turbulent wake downstream of the individual turbines. They published their  in the journal Physics of Fluids early this month.\nMahdi Abkar and Fernando Porté-Agel, the authors of the study, used a mathematical model to study the turbulence generated by a wind turbine as its rotors slice through the wind that drives them. With turbines often set up to form dense wind farms, understanding the turbulent wakes generated by upwind turbines and how long it takes for them to recover are important in predicting the overall power output of these wind farms, as turbines set up in the wind shadow of others are driven by strong wind. Today, turbines are spaced between five and seven turbine diameters apart – about 500 to 700 meters for large turbines – to maximize the amount of power that can be produced on a given area.\nOptimizing production over a 24-hour cycle\n“What we were interested in was understanding the effect of thermal stability on the characteristics and dynamics of the turbulent wake behind wind-turbines,” says Abkar. In other words, how do temperature-driven vertical movements in the lower atmosphere influence the turbulent wind shadow cast by a wind turbine. On sunny days, the hot ground causes the air above it to heat up and rise. This vertical motion is a characteristic of an unstable, convective atmosphere. On a typical night, by contrast, the earth’s cold surface cools the air above it, leading to a stable situation.\nAbkar used simulations to study the power output of a wind farm under convective and stable conditions and found a significant difference between both cases. “In the convective case, downwind turbines were about 30% less productive than those in the front lines. Under a stable atmosphere, the losses were even higher, on the order of 60%,” he says. His findings are important to optimize the power output of wind farms over a 24-hour cycle, as the lower atmosphere goes its stable nocturnal state to the convective state typical of daytime.\nSo, why does the turbulence recover so much faster in the convective case? According to Abkar, this is mostly due to the higher levels of turbulence in the incoming wind, which enhances turbulent mixing within, thereby breaking apart the turbulent wake behind the turbines. By contrast, in the stable setting, the turbulence is allowed to linger on for much longer, as turbulent mixing remains low.\nAccounting for windfarms in weather models\nUnraveling the detailed physics at play within wind farms is not only important to optimize their power output. Wind turbines alter the atmospheric dynamics by absorbing some of the wind and increasing turbulence, which can modify a number of other properties, such as atmospheric humidity and temperature. That is why meteorologists are interested in improving how they account for them in weather models. In a second paper, published in the journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, Akbar and Porté-Agel propose a new way to account for wind farms in large-scale atmospheric models that considers the number of turbines in the wind farm, the way that they are set up, and the wind direction.", "summary": "When set up in groups, wind turbines in the front rows cast a wind shadow on those behind them, lowering their performance.

{"id": 131, "text": "“The status quo on the software market needs to change, explains Viktor Kuncak, Associate Professor at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences' . All too often, developers adopt a software patch strategy for products that are already being sold on the market!” And yet there are tools out there that can improve the reliability of software before products reach consumers. Moreover, these tools are already widely used for hardware development. “Once a microchip has been manufactured, it’s too late to fix an error.” In fact, the later an error is detected, the more expensive it becomes to fix it.” Greater software reliability can also bring benefits to many different areas such as aviation or medical equipment, making them more reliable. \nViktor Kuncak and post-doctoral researcher Andrew Reynolds are currently working to develop automatic software verification tools. Just like a mathematical demonstration seeks to prove that an affirmation may be true for a given set of values, software verification is aimed at ensuring that a function will not cause a crash or produce an outlier for the full range of possible user entries or actions.\nIf there is one tool that mathematicians regularly use, it is mathematical induction. This method consists of proving that a theorem holds true for a given natural number (n) and that what is true for n is also true for the natural number that follows (n+1). Once this has been done, one must also prove the validity of the theorem for the smallest natural number: 0. This form of demonstration was previously not possible with an SMT solver (satisfiability modulo theories), which is an essential component of automatic software verification. The two researchers have now managed to overcome this obstacle, developing an approach that allows one to automatically use mathematical induction in a constraint resolution process. The code input language to be verified is Scala, “we chose it because of its similarity with mathematical formulations and reasoning,” explains Viktor Kuncak.\nApart from the computerization of mathematical induction, this approach is also remarkable because it breaks down tasks. “Whenever a verification cannot be executed directly, our tool breaks the problem down into sub-problems that it may be able to resolve. When there is a known path, this path will be used. Otherwise, other paths will be explored and a new breakdown may be performed, thereby allowing a large number of potential problem-solving pathways to be explored, explains Viktor Kuncak.\nAlthough the EPFL researchers are more specifically interested in potential applications to software verification, advances in the area of automated mathematical proofs can also benefit other fields. “The primary focus of SMT solvers has been for problems faced by industry (including software verification). Only more recently have SMT solvers been used for solving more difficult problems, which would include solving open mathematical problems. So far, this has been somewhat limited, but is starting to become more common,” states Andrew Reynolds. “One project along these lines is the TPTP library of problems pursued by the University of Miami. The use of SMT solvers such as the one I work on (CVC4) has led to solving several previously unsolved problems in this library.”\nThe approaches that the EPFL researchers are focused on are interesting both in terms of success rates and speed of execution. What are the limits of this tool? “It’s a bit like having a brilliant student,” explains Viktor Kuncak, “We cannot ascertain the theoretical limits but empirically, we have observed that the tool has more difficulty handling certain formulas than others,” The research conducted with Andrew Reynolds at the EPFL began in 2014. “We have obtained good results in only a few months, notes Viktor Kuncak. The EPFL has a certain lead in this field and we hope to consolidate this position.”", "summary": "It is possible to test computer programs using tools borrowed from mathematicians and their famous demonstrations.

{"id": 136, "text": "The apps created by Uber and its competitors put peers in touch with each other when one of them is looking for a ride. But the online platforms these companies have developed also collect users’ personal data – from passengers and drivers alike. Multiplied by millions of users each day, that comes out to be a goldmine of information, especially in the era of Big Data. Researchers from EPFL and the Faculty of Business and Economics at UNIL looked at how the same level of service could be achieved without disclosing users’ personal data. Their software, called  (O for oblivious), can be used to set up a ride where only the driver and passenger know the starting point, route and destination.\n“Ride-hailing apps like Uber have created a lot of buzz and controversy. But the issue of data protection has been less discussed,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, a professor at EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences. Some data security concerns have already been reported in the press, such as a flaw that revealed data about hundreds of drivers and – even worse – a threat by a Uber executive to dig up dirt on unfriendly journalists. The members of the project team, who are all experts on data protection, could not pass up the challenge of seeing whether it would be technically possible to keep personal data confidential in ride-hailing platforms. They will present the results of their research at two conferences in North America this summer.\nStill convenient and fast\nORide uses a cryptographic system similar to homomorphic encryption. It can carry out operations on encrypted data and get the same result as if the data was not encrypted. For example, it can add an encrypted 2 + 2 to get an encrypted 4. So when someone uses ORide to search for a driver, the system will receive encrypted location data about the passenger and the drivers who are available. It will then identify the closest drivers, and – still using encrypted data – let the passenger select a driver. Once the two app users are matched up, ORide will display the location of each one on the other’s smartphone.\nThe route that the driver takes is also coded in the users’ smartphones. The only data seen by the ride-hailing company is the distance travelled and the cost of the ride, since this information is what the company will use to take its cut of the fee and what passengers will use as a record of their travel expense. What’s more, ORide doesn’t affect the app’s convenience – passengers can still pay with their credit cards and evaluate their drivers. “Our protocol was designed not to provide complete anonymity, but to make it very hard to track the passengers’ and the drivers’ movements,” says Hubaux. The researchers also realized that their system needs to allow passengers to hunt down a lost item or provide evidence in case of a dispute with a driver. In the event of such a dispute, the data can be re-identified, but only with the agreement of the party making the complaint.\nConfidentiality: a selling point\nThe project team tested their system using public data on New York taxi drivers. They wanted to make sure in particular that the encryption protocol doesn’t slow down the process of searching for a driver. New York – whose population is roughly the same size as Switzerland’s – has just as many Uber and Lyft drivers as taxi drivers. “The encryption with a high-security key adds just a few milliseconds to the search time and doesn’t require a faster internet connection,” says Hubaux. “On the downside, ORide won’t necessarily find the closest driver, which means passengers could have to wait one or two extra minutes.”\nUber and its rivals are now free to decide whether they’re interested – especially since the researchers purposely chose not to patent their technology. “This is a highly competitive market, and confidentiality could be a selling point or a way to avoid a legal battle if a firm has to share the data it has access to with the secret services,” adds Hubaux.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping their personal data secret.", "claim": "Researchers from EPFL and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping my personal data secret.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [21, 21], "noise": false}

{"id": 139, "text": "Most rod-shaped bacteria divide by splitting into two around the middle after their DNA has replicated safely and segregated to opposite ends of the cell. This seemingly simple process actually demands tight and precise coordination, which is achieved through two biological systems: nucleoid occlusion, which protects the cell’s genetic material from dividing until it replicates and segregates, and the “minicell” system, which localizes the site of division around the middle of the cell, where a dividing wall will form to split it in two. But some pathogenic bacteria, e.g. \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n, don’t use these mechanisms. EPFL scientists have now combined optical and atomic force microscopy to track division in such bacteria for the first time, and have discovered that they use instead an undulating “wave-pattern” along their length to mark future sites of division. The findings are .\nThe work was carried out jointly by the labs of  and  at EPFL. The scientists wanted to understand how bacteria that do not have the genes for nucleoid occlusion and the minicell system “decide” where and when to divide. This is important, as many pathogenic bacteria fall into this category, and knowing how they divide can open up new ways to fight them.\nThe researchers focused on \nMycobacterium smegmatis\n, a non-pathogenic relative of \nM. tuberculosis\n. Neither of these bacteria uses the two “conventional” biological systems for coordinating division, meaning that a non-conventional approach was needed for studying them. \nThe researchers combined two types of microscopy to track the life cycle of the bacteria. The first technique was optical microscopy, which uses fluorescent labels for “seeing” various biological structures and biomolecules. The second technique was atomic force microscopy, which provides extremely high-resolution images of structures on the cell surface by “feeling” the surface with a tiny mechanical probe, much like a blind person can form a three-dimensional mental image of an object by passing their hands over its surface.\n“This experiment constitutes the longest continuous atomic force microscopy experiment ever performed on growing cells,” says Georg Fantner, while John McKinney adds: “It illustrates the power of new technologies not only to analyze the things we already knew about with greater resolution, but also to discover new things that we hadn’t anticipated.”\nArmed with a custom-built instrument that combines the two techniques, the scientists created long-term time-lapses of the growth and division of the bacteria over multiple generations. Unexpectedly, they found that the bacteria produce undulating “trough-like” patterns across their length. These morphological landmarks on the undulating surface of mycobacterial cells correspond to future sites of cell division. \nThe troughs are roughly repeating waves, which the scientists calculated to have an average wavelength of ~1.8 μm, and an amplitude too small to resolve with conventional microscopes (about 100 nm). This might be the reason why waveform troughs have not been reported before. \nThe time-lapse images also showed that, after the mycobacterium divides, the new “daughter” cells inherit the “mother” cell’s wave-trough pattern, and ultimately divide at the center-most wave-trough.\nWave-troughs can form up to three generations before they are used as division sites. According to Alexander Eskandarian, the lead author of the study, these morphological features are “by far the earliest known landmark of future division sites in bacteria.\" Building on these observations, future research will focus on identifying the underlying mechanisms responsible for wave-trough formation and propagation and recruitment of the cell division machinery.\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the Innovative Medicines Initiative, the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7), and the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO).\nReference\nHaig A.

{"id": 142, "text": "Switzerland is one of the countries in Europe that relies the most on geothermal energy for residential heating. A study conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy in 2019 found that the country has  (GSHPs) – the “highest concentration per square kilometer in the world.” Many of these pumps are installed in residential yards at depths of up to 400 meters and use a vertical closed-loop system to circulate heat up to the surface.\nThe advantage of GSHPs is that they have little impact on the environment. They can heat homes and buildings all year long since geothermal energy is a stable heat source. And they offer a promising alternative for decarbonizing the heating sector. In Switzerland, buildings’ heating and cooling systems account for a third of total energy demand, and 75% of the country’s energy comes from fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. \nOperation of a vertical ground-source heat pump. © ADEME\nA finite energy source\nIn 2017, Doris Leuthard, then-president of the Swiss Confederation, called geothermal energy an “incredible energy source” but warned that it’s not infinite; it needs to be extracted according to specific rules. For instance, the borehole heat exchangers used in GSHPs should be installed a certain distance apart to prevent thermal interference – the heat-exchanger equivalent of a short circuit – and prevent the ground from cooling. “The heat-transfer fluid absorbs the heat that’s in the ground,” says Alina Walch, a PhD student at EPFL’s . “If too many of these exchangers are packed into a tiny space, the ground will cool off, which is something we absolutely need to avoid.”\nThermal interference is one of the factors that a team of scientists, including Walch, took into account in  on 18 November. They calculated the technical potential of GSHPs in the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva. “The technical potential is the maximum amount of geothermal energy that can be extracted by the heat pumps using all the available area in the two cantons, assuming they operate at at least 80% of their rated power,” she says.\nThe research team estimated the available area using existing topographical data on Switzerland, excluding built environments and natural habitats like forests from their study. They then simulated GSHPs installed throughout that area based on factors such as ground temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. “We incorporated the various technical constraints and estimated the optimal borehole spacing that would both comply with installation standards and maximize the extractable heat,” says Walch.\nRegional variation of ground data in the case study region. a) Restriction zones for geothermal installations, b) Ground surface temperature at 1m depth, c) Thermal conductivity, d) Thermal diffusivity derived from the geothermal cadastres. Grey zones are outside the study area. © LESO-PB\nInsufficient capacity in urban centers \nTheirs is the first study of its scale in Switzerland to consider not just the ground’s geothermal capacity but also the technical limitations of GSHPs. The scientists estimate that the annual technical potential of the region they studied is 4.6 TWh, which corresponds to about a third of its total heating demand. They also calculated a maximum energy density of 15.5 kWh/m\n2\n. “Geothermal energy has only limited potential to serve as the region’s only source. It could cover demand in many suburban and rural areas, but would fall considerably short in urban centers,” says Walch. Urban planners can use this information in their technical and economic feasibility studies of GSHP system deployment. \nThe research team also found that the cumulative installed borehole depth shouldn’t exceed 2 km per hectare in order to avoid over-exploitation of the heat capacity of the ground. \nWalch stresses that their findings are only theoretical for now; the study doesn’t factor in local phenomena like phreatic zones and groundwater flows, which can affect the time needed for the ground to cool. It will be essential to drill test bores before installing borehole heat exchangers. \nThe team hopes that by quantifying the heat-generation capacity of shallow geothermal energy, and by pinpointing areas where additional energy sources will be required, their work will inform decarbonization strategies for Switzerland’s heating sector. “Our ultimate goal is to conduct nationwide studies and combine these findings with similar ones for other types of renewable energy,” says Walch, also worked on a study to evaluate . “It’s important to estimate the technical potential independent of heat demand.

{"id": 143, "text": "Bacteria are everywhere. They are the most abundant form of life on our planet. Pick up just about any surface and its likely covered in bacteria. The aquatic environment is no different. Indeed, the ocean is full of small particles and debris, some inert, some highly nutritious. But how do bacteria differentiate between these surfaces, how do they hold onto them in moving water and how do they recognise each other so that they can work together?\nTake the cholera bacterium, \nVibrio cholerae\n, which infects the small intestine, causing diarrhoea and severe dehydration. It lives in salty water, such as seas, oceans, and estuaries, attaching itself to the shells of crustaceans. These exoskeletons are composed of a sugary polymer called chitin, and provide a rich source of food for the cholera bacterium – allowing it to grow and survive in the environment.\nTo do all this, \nV. cholera\ne uses an appendage that’s “a bit like a grappling hook’’ says lead researcher David Adams. “The idea is that bacteria can throw out these long ropes, hook onto something, and reel it back in’’. These ‘ropes’ are actually the product of highly versatile nano-machines known as type IV pili, which are used by many different bacterial species for motility, sensing surfaces and sticking to them, and even taking up . Consequently, type IV pili are considered critical for the environmental survival and pathogenesis of not just \nV. cholerae\n but a wide range of bacteria.\nOver the course of the last decade or so, the group of  established that \n only when growing on chitinous surfaces and showed that they are essential for DNA-uptake. But how exactly they functioned and what else they might be capable of doing had remained somewhat elusive and was therefore the focus of the current study published in \nNature Microbiology\n.\nTo directly observe the DNA-uptake pili in live \nV. cholerae\n bacteria, the researchers used a technique called cysteine labelling. With that, they were able to establish that, as predicted, the pili are highly dynamic, extending and retracting to take up DNA. “This was an important milestone’’ says laboratory head Melanie Blokesch “even though we’d established some time ago that these structures were there, to see them moving in real-time was something quite special’’.\nThe biggest insight came however, when researchers disrupted the motor that powers pilus retraction, revealing that these ropes could also self-interact with each other, and in doing so, allow cells to stick together. Curiously, different strains of \nV. cholerae\n produce slightly different variants of the PilA subunit, which forms the major building block of the pilus. Remarkably, this creates a set of highly specific interactions that can be used as an identifier between strains ensuring that like only pairs with like.\nFinally, when researchers visualised \nV. cholerae\n growing under more realistic conditions upon chitin surfaces, they revealed that these DNA-uptake pili naturally form dense networks of self-interacting pili. These pili bind tightly to the chitin surface and are required for the bacterium to stay attached during water flow. Thus, the DNA-uptake pilus is a multifunctional toolkit for chitin surface colonisation and kin recognition and the results of this work will help to advance our understanding of how the cholera bacterium survives in the natural environment. This knowledge, on the other hand, is important to better understand the transmission to humans in cholera endemic regions.", "summary": "The cholera bacterium uses a grappling hook-like appendage to take up DNA, bind to nutritious surfaces and recognise ‘family’ members, EPFL scientists have found.

{"id": 144, "text": "Decision-making has gathered immense interest in fields like psychology, neuroscience, robotics and even economics, with numerous models and software simulating the human mind. However, such models are limited to a type of decision-making that focuses only on each decision step in isolation, without taking into account the preceding decisions leading up to it, although the latter is often our everyday experience. Publishing in \nPLoS One\n, scientists from EPFL and the University of Berne have perfected a model that can simulate this type of decision-making and learning conditions with surprising accuracy.\nDecisions, feedback, learning\nDecision-making comes in two major into two types: Markovian and non-Markovian, named after the mathematician Andrey Markov (1856-1922). Simply put, in Markovian decision-making, the next decision step depends entirely on the current state of affairs. For example, when playing backgammon, the next move depends only on the current layout of the board, and not on how it got to be like that. This relatively straightforward process has been extensively modeled in computers and machines.\nNon-Markovian decision-making is more complex. Here, the next step is affected by other factors, such as external constraints and previous decisions. For example, a person’s goal might be to travel on the train. But what will happens when he arrives at the door to the train depends on whether or not he has previously visited the ticket booth to buy a ticket. In other words, the next step depends on how he got there; without a ticket, he cannot proceed to the desired goal. In neuroscience, the “buy-ticket” step is referred to as a “switch-state”.\nA new model of decision-making\nA team led by Michael Herzog at EPFL and Walter Senn at the University of Berne developed the first biologically plausible model that can handle non-Markovian decision-making. Herzog’s group has now tested it with humans as well as various computer models. The model, developed in a previous study, was now validated with two distinct tests, designed by Aaron Michael Clarke and Elisa Tartaglia in Herzog’s lab. The tests were performed by human subjects, and three computer models with different degrees of learning ability. In addition, the test were also taken by an advanced brain model called a “spiking neuron network”, which makes decisions based on whether the majority of neurons in a population fired a signal, or “spike”, and simulates human performance in a very realistic manner.\nThe first experiment tested the impact of the switch-state on people’s decision-making and learning. Users played a computer game where they had to navigate through eight icons (a gun, a car etc.) to finally reach the end goal (called “Yeah!”). Each icon came with three buttons, each leading down a different route, and the user had to decide which one to take. Although there was a relatively short route from the first icon to the goal, it was impossible to go through it unless the user first went through a switch-state icon – an image of a computer. Users repeated the experiment multiple times, becoming increasingly better at deciding which routes to pick. For example, most people took over 80 clicks to get to the goal when they began, but after 40 games, they needed fewer than ten.\nThe second experiment tested how delayed feedback affects decision-making and learning. Here, users were shown a set of experimental images and told that each image belonged to either category one or category two. Each category corresponded to either the left or the right arrow on the keyboard, but the participants were not told which arrow went with which image beforehand. Next, the users were shown each image one at a time, and had to press either the left or right arrow depending on the category of each icon. In response, the screen produce a RIGHT or WRONG feedback message. As the test went on, the feedback became delayed, to the point where feedback from one icon would come after the feedback for the next icon had appeared.\nDecision dynamics\nThe results of the study drew three major conclusions. First, that human decision-making can perform just as well as current sophisticated computer models under non-Markovian conditions, such as the presence of a switch-state. This is a significant finding in our current efforts to model the human brain and develop artificial intelligence systems.\nSecondly, that delayed feedback significantly impairs human decision-making and learning, even though it does not impact the performance of computer models, which have perfect memory. In the second experiment, it took human participants ten times more attempts to correctly recall and assign arrows to icons. Feedback is a crucial element of decision-making and learning. We set a goal, make a decision about how to achieve it, act accordingly, and then find out whether or not our goal was met. In some cases, e.g. learning to ride a bike, feedback on every decision we make for balancing, pedaling, braking etc. is instant: either we stay up and going, or we fall down. But in many other cases, such as playing backgammon, feedback is significantly delayed; it can take a while to find out if each move has led us to victory or not.\nFinally, the researchers found that the spiking neurons model matches and describes human performance very well. The significance of this cannot be overstated, as non-Markovian decision-making has proven to be very challenging for computer models. “This is a proof-of-concept study,” says Michael Herzog. “But the study makes an important contribution toward understanding, and accurately modeling, the human brain – and even surpassing its abilities with artificial intelligence.”\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute with the University of Berne. \nReference\n Clarke AM, Friedrich J, Tartaglia EM, Marchesotti S, Senn W, Herzog MH. \nHuman and Machine Learning in Non-Markovian Decision Making.\nPLoS One\n 21 April 2015. 10(4): e0123105.

{"id": 147, "text": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a major player in nutrition today. Studies have shown that NAD+ concentrations decrease during aging and that recovering the body’s levels of NAD+ can prolong both health span and even life span, making it the focus of much research in nutritional science, medicine, and even pharmaceutics.\nIn terms of biology, NAD+ is what is known as a “co-enzyme” – a necessary molecule that helps an enzyme carry out its respective reaction in the cell. NAD+ is a common co-enzyme for multiple metabolic enzymes across all living cells, meaning that it is heavily involved in producing energy and keeping cells alive and healthy.\nPublishing in \nNature\n, scientists lead by  in collaboration with TES Pharma have found a new way of increasing NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme competing with its production.\nThe \nde novo\n synthesis of NAD+ in the cell begins with the amino acid tryptophan. One of the key enzymes involved in this process is ACMSD, which limits the amount of NAD+ produced by the \nde novo\n synthesis pathway.\nThe scientists were able to show that ACMSD controls the levels of NAD+ in the cell through a mechanism that doesn’t seem to have changed during evolution: case-in-point, the researchers found that, in both the earthworm \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n and mice, blocking the enzyme resulted in higher NAD+ levels and enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe inactivation of ACMSD also increased the activity of Sirtuin 1, an enzyme that NAD+ works with in its role as co-enzyme. Sirtuin 1 is known to play major roles in mitochondrial well-being, and as a result, the boost of NAD+ levels ultimately enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe team then used two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD, developed by . “Since the enzyme is mostly found in the kidney and liver, we wanted to test the capacity of the ACMSD inhibitors to protect these organs from injury,” explains Elena Katsyuba, first author of the paper.\nBoth inhibitors were shown to preserve kidney and liver function in animal models of acute kidney injury and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, offering much promise for their future therapeutic potential in humans. “The fact that ACMSD is exclusively present only in the liver and kidneys reduces the risk of negative repercussions of its loss on other organs,” says Katsyuba. “Put simply, the enzyme will not be missed by an organ that does not have it anyway.”\n“Given the beneficial health effects of boosting NAD+ levels that we have seen in worm and mouse models of disease, we are looking forward to bringing these compounds soon to the clinic to the benefit of patients suffering from liver and kidney diseases, two areas with a large unmet clinical need,” says Johan Auwerx.\nOther contributors\nTES Pharma\nUniversity of Lausanne\nPolytechnic University of Marche\nEPFL Histology Core Facility\nUniversity Hospital of Geneva\nPolish Academy of Sciences", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have found a new way to boost the famous anti-aging molecule NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme that limits its production.

{"id": 148, "text": "Scientists from EPFL and WSL have been studying soils in oil palm cultivation for years, in an effort to develop more sustainable methods for growing this crop. Palm oil production has been criticized by environmentalists because of its large carbon footprint and negative impact on biodiversity. For instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia – the world’s two biggest producers – it has directly or indirectly caused large-scale deforestation, thereby reducing biodiversity and releasing significant amounts of CO\n2\n into the atmosphere. And planting oil palm trees in the deforested areas does not make up for the lost carbon storage capacity, according to a . \nBut the findings of a new study by EPFL and WSL – appearing today in \nScience Advances\n – indicate there may be a carbon-friendly alternative to deforestation. The scientists investigated oil palm crops that had been planted on former pastures in the Los Llanos region of Colombia, the world’s fourth-largest palm oil producer. There, large areas of pastures – which themselves had been planted in the past on savannas – were replaced by oil palm plantations 56 years ago. By calculating the crops’ carbon footprint since then, the scientists found that the total carbon storage – taking into account both vegetation and soil stocks – was unchanged relative to when the land had been used for pastures.\n“Our study is the first to look at the carbon footprint of palm oil production over the long term – that is, across two plantation cycles, since oil palm trees are replaced every 25–30 years,” says Juan Carlos Quezada, a PhD student at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS) and the study’s lead author. “It’s also the first to explore how converting pastures into oil palm farms affects soil quality and fertility over the long term, looking at all soil layers, not just the surface.”\nCarbon capture\nIn tropical climates, pastures – especially those that have been neglected and degraded – commonly consist of large grassy areas with a few small trees scattered around. Planting dense populations of oil palm trees – which can reach 15 meters in height – on these pastures can increase the carbon capture rate per unit of surface area, thanks to the palm trees’ roots, trunks and leaves, as well as the vegetation around them.\nUnder typical farming methods, oil palm trees are cut down every 25–30 years and replaced with young trees to start a new plantation cycle. As the roots and other parts of the old trees decompose, they nourish the soil and partially offset the carbon initially lost in the upper soil layer when the pastureland was converted. As a result, over the long term cultivation period, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem remains unchanged compared to the initial level before land conversion took place. \nAn alternative worth exploring \n“We should bear in mind that palm oil in and of itself is not harmful – neither to our health, when eaten in moderation, nor to the economy. And we’re not talking just about multinationals – the incomes of hundreds of small farmers in Colombia and other countries depend on it,” says Alexandre Buttler, head of ECOS and a co-author of the study. “The problem lies with the negative carbon impact and loss of biodiversity caused by deforestation. But the main palm oil producing countries have large abandoned pastures that could be converted favorably, thus limiting the massive carbon loss resulting from deforestation.” \nThis study was conducted as part of the  project, a cross-disciplinary initiative funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and led by ETH Zurich. OPAL brings together project partners from Switzerland, Indonesia, Colombia and Cameroon.

{"id": 149, "text": "How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.\nHuman comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”\nCoccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”\nCoccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average. The researcher’s first step was to assess the campus’ energy balance; she looked at individual buildings and the effect that buildings have on each other. Summers will be hotter and hotter, and this will be felt more in built spaces than in wooded ones. Existing buildings will have to be renovated, and new buildings will require design changes. Particular attention will have to be paid to the exterior of buildings: “Vegetation moderates microclimates and blocks solar and infrared radiation, evapotranspiration reduces the air temperature, and plants provide shade,” says Coccolo. “These factors completely change our perceived thermal comfort.”\nTurning climate challenges into design opportunities\nTo offset the expected rise in summer temperatures, the study shows that, in addition to proper insulation, buildings and their immediate surroundings will need to provide more shade through protective features according to the level of solar radiation, the direction the building faces and the season. For Coccolo, this goes beyond simply multiplying the number of plants and trees; the focus should be on what truly enhances comfort. This may include such things as foliage density and plant height. Replacing asphalt with grass, for example, can radically change our thermal perception.\nThe Urban Systems group at the LESO-PB believes that, in the future, architects and urban planners will need to work together in designing the space between buildings, which is just as important as the space inside them (leso.epfl.ch/urbansimulation).\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press Service EPFL\n +4179 502 81 06\nSilvia Coccolo\n Postdoctoral Researcher\n +41 21 693 4543\nJean-Louis Scartezzini \nDirector of the Laboratory of Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory\n +41 21 693 55 49", "summary": "In the year 2100, temperatures at EPFL are expected to be similar to those currently experienced in Perugia, in central Italy.

{"id": 155, "text": "We’ve all sat frustrated in rush-hour traffic – either in the morning on the way to work, in the evening on the way home, or both. Some try to get around the problem by leaving a little earlier or a little later. That helps balance out traffic flows and create a certain equilibrium – which many transportation engineers and economists have been studying. Their goal is to better understand the mechanisms behind this equilibrium so that large infrastructure projects can be better designed and help reduce congestion.\nLamotte’s thesis – supervised by Nikolas Geroliminis, a professor at EPFL’s Urban Transport Systems Laboratory – investigates this equilibrium and weighs up different methods for reducing traffic congestion. He shows that most city traffic follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach, but that a more efficient way to regulate traffic would be by introducing a reservation system for specific time slots.\nLamotte’s first finding is that in a multidirectional road system – which is what’s typically seen in and around cities – the drivers who have the longest commute are the ones who make the most effort to avoid rush-hour traffic. That’s because they have a greater incentive to adjust their commute times and find the optimal time for leaving work or home based on how long it will take them to arrive at their destination.\nReserved lanes\nHe also found that one measure that has proven effective for reducing traffic congestion, in Stockholm for example, is a congestion charge. “Even a relatively low charge that varies with the time of day can change people’s behavior,” says Lamotte. However, such charges are not popular and not always feasible. Adopting one in Switzerland, for example, would require a constitutional amendment.\nBased on the observation that traffic congestion results from lose-lose competition among drivers, Lamotte looked to other transportation methods for possible ideas. In air travel, passenger traffic is regulated by reservation systems that let travelers book seats until the plane is full. At that point, travelers have to take another flight. He suggests a similar system for commuter traffic using special reserved lanes. The allowed number of vehicles on the lanes would depend on the roads’ capacity, and the demand for reservations would be used to determine which segments of road to set aside for the system. Commuters who don’t want to use the system would be free to use the regular road lanes whenever they want – but they might find those lanes congested.\nGuiding public policy \n“Today such a system would be hard to implement,” says Lamotte. But he’s already looking ahead to the emergence of new modes of transport. “Car-sharing systems are becoming increasingly common, and self-driving cars are not far off. Commuters will soon start getting used to reserving a vehicle ahead of time. Then it will be just a small step to reserving a time slot as well,” he adds. He hopes his thesis will help inform policymakers’ decisions when it comes to long-term urban planning. “It’s important to be aware that this competition for commuting times bears a cost, and that intelligently designed traffic systems can help cut that cost,” says Lamotte.", "summary": "For his thesis, EPFL PhD student Raphaël Lamotte studied rush-hour traffic congestion.

{"id": 159, "text": "How did vertebrates walk 300 million years ago? Could they already stand upright on their legs? Did they move in a balanced, energy-efficient way? Scientists at EPFL’s  and the  at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin set out to answer these questions. Using the fossilized skeleton and footprints of \nOrobates pabsti \n– a vertebrate that, on the evolutionary tree, comes between amphibians on one hand and reptiles and mammals on the other – the scientists created computer simulations and a robot. Drawing on experimental studies of four living amphibian and reptile species, they used these tools to gauge how plausible different ways of walking were for the fossilized animal.\n“\nOrobates \nis an ideal candidate for understanding how land vertebrates evolved because it is in the lineage leading to modern amniotes. These animals formed in eggs laid on land and became largely independent of water,” says John Nyakatura, a professor at Humboldt-Universität. What’s more, \nOrobates \nis the oldest-known vertebrate for which scientists have been able to link a fossil with its fossilized footprints. “This combination is what enabled us to carry out our unique quantitative study, which paves the way to replicating the walk of other fossilized animals,” says Auke Ijspeert, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. The researchers’ findings appear in .\nA motion-based model and then a robotic one\nTo better understand how \nOrobates \nwalked and pinpoint just how advanced its locomotion was, the scientists at Humboldt-Universität developed a digital model of its skeleton based on the animal’s fossil and the biomechanics of modern animals with sprawling postures. They used this model to carry out the first kinematic computer simulation of \nOrobates’ \ngait as it walks on its digitalized footprints. This simulation focuses on movements (rather than forces) and identifies gaits where the animal’s bones do not collide or come out of their joints.\nIn parallel, two scientists at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory – post-doctoral researcher Kamilo Melo and PhD student Tomislav Horvat – used the fossilized animal anatomy to build a robot called OroBOT. Designed and scaled to match the shape and movements of the extinct animal, OroBOT was used to calculate the physics of how \nOrobates \nwalked. “We tested our hypotheses about the animal’s locomotion dynamics with our robotic model, which factors in the real-world physics of the animal’s gait,” says Melo.\nTesting hundreds of different gaits, based on contemporary animals\nThe interdisciplinary team of scientists tested hundreds of different gaits with their robot in order to determine which ones \nOrobates \ncould have used – and those that it clearly did not. The gaits they tested were based on biomechanical principles extracted from similar modern-day animals such as caimans, salamanders, iguanas and skinks, which they analyzed through X-ray videos and force measurements. “We studied the biomechanics of their movements and determined which mechanical principles they all followed,” says Nyakatura. The research team looked at three features in particular: how erect the animal stood on its legs; how its backbone bent; and how much its elbow or shoulder joints bent as it walked. These three features determine what the researchers call the animal’s “sprawling gait space.” They created  where fellow scientists – and the wider public – can explore the universe of movements that \nOrobates \ncould have used.\nWith these results, they came up with the most likely ways that \nOrobates \nmay have walked. They scored the gaits based on how much energy was required, how stable the movements were, how the leg forces compared with those of other sprawling animals, and how closely the movements aligned with the fossilized footprints. The gaits with good scores appear quite athletic and most closely resemble the movements of caimans. This suggests that \nOrobates \nprobably already held itself a little upright on its legs – unlike salamanders and skinks. Its locomotion was thus more advanced than had been previously thought. \nThe study concludes that advanced — more upright, balanced and mechanically power-saving —locomotion, as in \nOrobates\n, may have evolved before the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals lived. The novel approach developed for this study can be applied by other scientists in their work, and it could be modified to study other evolutionary transitions, such as the origins of flight or galloping gaits in mammals.\nContacts\nFor inquiries about robotics, in English or Spanish:\nKamilo Melo (robotics engineer, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)\nEmail: \nFor inquiries about robotics, in French:\nAuke J.

{"id": 164, "text": "At 5:01 pm Wednesday evening, the Philae lander touched down on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko – Chury, for short – seven hours after taking leave of its mothership, the Rosetta orbiter. Although there are still concerns about its anchoring and the resulting feasibility of some operations, the washing-machine sized robot has already gotten to work, sending data and spectacular images of its new surroundings.\nLaunched in 2004 by the European Space Agency, the probe made a 10-year voyage, traveling 500 million kilometers from Earth, to wind up somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In March, Rosetta’s systems were rebooted successfully as it approached the comet, and in August it began to orbit. The first photos of the comet revealed a fascinating shape, seemingly the result of an agglomeration of two rocky cores. The images sent yesterday by Philae indicate that the comet seems to be made up primarily of rock, and not ice. Grégoire Bourban space engineer and Deputy Director of the EPFL Swiss Space Center, gives us his engineer’s viewpoint on this exceptional event.\n-\tWhy was this operation such a huge challenge, from a space engineering point of view? \nIn the heat of the operation, Wednesday, someone dared to compare this adventure with the first human moon landing. And I share that opinion. Because this operation is very different from others that have involved a lander. For the missions on Venus or Mars, for example, we were dealing with bodies that had been studied for a long time, and we understood the precise nature of the ground we’d be landing on. In addition, they were much larger targets, with many appropriate landing spots. What is unique about Chury is that we knew next to nothing about it in August 2014; but we had to choose a landing site, then make millions of descent calculations, studying various trajectories. Managing to do this successfully, from 500 million miles away, is quite simply incredible!\n-\tWhat will Philae allow us to study, and how will it operate? \nThe Philae mission is a true success, even if the lander has experienced some anchoring issues and only two of its three feet appear to be stable. We still don’t know what the consequences of this will be on the analysis operations. If all goes as planned, the lander and orbiter will remain for an entire year in this configuration, accompanying a comet for the first time ever in its trip around the Sun. As it approaches the sun, its core will begin to melt, and thus it will release gases that will react with others already in suspension. Comets are considered to be a possible origin of the presence of water on Earth, and studying this comet’s composition could thus give us valuable information about our origins.\nTo carry out these tasks, Philae is equipped with various instruments for analyzing particles, electromagnetic radiation, various gases, soil properties and even the sounds that the comet emits. It can bore up to 20 centimeters beneath the surface and remove samples. It’s these soil-sampling operations that are in question due to the failure of the harpoons to anchor the lander. And given the weak gravity, even a very small perturbation could eject the robot from the surface.\n-\n\tSome elements or instruments on board Philae and Rosetta were made in Switzerland. Which ones are they and what do they do?\nThere was a significant Swiss involvement in this project. The most well known instrument is Rosina; developed at the University of Bern, it’s what we call a mass spectrometer. Its objective is to analyze the composition of the comet’s atmosphere, the temperature and density of the gases, and their evolution as the comet approaches the Sun. Several companies, including APCO and Clemessy, also developed ground-based support systems, that is, everything used to test the electrical and mechanical properties of the instruments before they’re launched into space. Certain components, most notably the mechanisms for pointing the communications antenna and the solar panel supports, were built by Mecanex in Nyon, which is now part of the company RUAG Space. Finally, some of Philae’s micro-cameras were developed at the CSEM in Neuchâtel. The first images sent from the surface of the comet, made public yesterday morning, came from these instruments!\n-\tWhat lessons can we learn from this for future space operations and exploration?\nMissions like this are very rare, because they are terribly costly in terms of both money and time – more than €1.5 billion and 20 years of work went into Rosetta. The concrete results that she will provide and the public enthusiasm we’re seeing are extremely positive signals for us, because they will encourage decision makers in European countries to continue to invest in space projects and fund the ESA. One of the most significant interests of this mission, in engineering terms, is in robotics and automation. In the space sector, we’re usually dealing with telecoms satellites or observational satellites orbiting Earth, and thus primarily sensor technology. Rosetta is a spectacular demonstration that these technologies [robotics and automation, ed.] operate well in space, and could thus encourage an increase in launching more robotics-type projects.\nImage: first picture taken by Philae once on the comet's surface.

{"id": 167, "text": "Today’s urbanites are ultra-connected and want to make their voices heard on key issues affecting their cities and neighborhoods. Digital platforms are the most convenient and efficient way to do this – but most cities lack the requisite technological capabilities. That means residents’ input is seldom incorporated into planning decisions. At least that’s the main finding of an architecture thesis carried out at EPFL and defended on 28 November. The study compared Geneva with Singapore, an Asian metropolis recognized as the world’s preeminent smart city.\n“We feel we’re at a pivotal moment. People are adopting new lifestyles – new ways of living, working and getting around. But the tools used for urban planning haven’t changed. Geneva’s district maps date back to 1929! So there’s a gap between the way city residents live today and the methods used to design their neighborhoods. That’s what made me want to investigate this topic further,” says Stéphanie Hasler, an architecture researcher at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT), a research center headed by Jérôme Chenal and Marc Soutter.\nDozens of tools at hand\nThis gap exists despite the dozens of tools urban planners have at their disposal for collecting data on how residents use city services: social media, crowdsourcing platforms and mobile apps, to name just a few (see photos galery). Hasler visited Singapore and saw that its city officials use such tools on a daily basis because city residents willingly share their personal data and ideas with local authorities. A few years ago, the city set up a website where residents can view plans for current and future projects and give their opinions. The website encourages dialogue and prevents residents from having to make a trip to the local planning office.\nChanging city\nSo what tools does Geneva have? “Things are changing and I wanted my thesis to make a positive contribution to the city’s development,” says Hasler. She found that Geneva currently uses data only for broader management purposes, such as to reduce traffic congestion or improve energy efficiency. And efforts to solicit residents’ opinions relate primarily to getting feedback on existing projects rather than spawning new ideas. However, Hasler stresses that involving residents in the planning phases is essential for making cities more sustainable, particularly in the areas of transportation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. She also points out a dichotomy unique to Switzerland: “This country has a highly developed sense of democracy as well as advanced technology, but the two are not always combined,” she says.\nList of digital platforms\nSo how can city officials improve things? Hasler’s thesis includes a list of digital platforms that they could use to better listen to and incorporate residents’ ideas. She came up with the list after testing around 50 such platforms worldwide, which she grouped by type of urban project they are meant to address.\nHasler prefers to talk about “responsive cities” rather than “smart cities,” as the former implies putting residents’ needs first. “Urban planners have to serve as coordinators between politicians, experts and residents. Digital technology is essential to doing this effectively, because it helps incorporate the interests of all stakeholders in decision-making,” she says. However, Hasler sensed resistance to the concept of connected urban planning among some of the Geneva planners she interviewed in her research. “Staff training or continuing education programs will be necessary,” she adds.\nCombining the 15 district maps\nIn addition to efforts to more fully involve city residents, Hasler states that Geneva city officials could also work on streamlining their processes and combining the 15 district maps into a single application that all city staff could use. That would help prevent people from working in silos and eliminate discrepancies among the maps. Singapore has been using such an application since 2016, which can also display real-time information on the types of transportation that city residents are using, for example.\nThis thesis research was carried out at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT) in association with ETH Zurich’s Future Cities Lab in Singapore.", "summary": "By comparing the cities of Geneva and Singapore, an EPFL thesis found that urban planners can reap multiple benefits by better leveraging digital technology.

{"id": 171, "text": "For humans, it comes perfectly naturally. But walking on two legs is actually a complicated task, requiring several muscles to perform delicate balancing acts. That’s why, in spite of years of major technological advancements in the field, humanoid robots are still far from being able to get around easily and reliably. Engineers at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory are testing new walking algoritms on a plateform called COMAN, short for COmpliant HuMANoid. This 95-cm-tall humanoid is designed specifically for studying walking – which is why it has no head.\nCOMAN was developed under the EU AMARSi project and is being used by several research teams. The EPFL team is looking specifically at the “brains” of the machine. “We developed algorithms that can improve the robot’s balance while it’s walking,” says Hamed Razavi, a researcher scientist at the Biorobotics Lab.\nIn harmony with symmetries\nOne of COMAN’s distinguishing features is its joints, which are integrated with elastic elements that give it greater flexibility when performing different tasks. The EPFL team came up with a novel control algorithm for the robot, based on the existing symmetries in the structure and dynamics of the robot’ as well as the mathematical equations representing the robot dynamics. “You could say we’re working in harmony with these symmetries rather than against them. As a result, we obtain a more natural and robust walking gait,” says Razavi.\nThe control algorithm uses sophisticated computer programs to carefully analyze the date received from the robot – including its position, velocity, joint angles, etc. – and sends appropriate commands to the motors, telling them what to do in order to maintain the robot's balance. “For example, if someone pushes COMAN, for example, our algorithms will calculate exactly where its foot should land in order to counteract the perturbation,” says Razavi.\nClimbing stairs and opening doors\nThe algorithms are geared towards three types of realworld applications. The first is carrying out rescue missions in disastrous scenarios. “In environments designed by humans - like a nuclear power plant where there are stairs to climb and doors to open – humanoid robots can get around more easily than robots with wheels,” says Razavi. The second is helping with tasks like carrying heavy boxes or moving objects (see box). And the third is creating exoskeletons for the disabled.\n“Making the robots more stable is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Razavi. The next step is refining the algorithms so that the humanoids have a wider range of movement and can overcome obstacles and walk on irregular or sloped surfaces.\nHumanoids helping humans\nAs part of this project, Jessica Lanini and Hamed Razavi studied how two people carrying an object together are able to walk, turn and speed up in a coordinated manner – without communicating with each other. Their findings, recently published in , indicate that the two people automatically synchronize their steps, like a quadruped. Now the researchers plan to apply their results to humanoid robots.\n“Whether for manufacturing or natural disasters, we need robots that can interact with humans and help us carry heavy objects,” says Lanini. “But such robots don’t exist. That’s because, in order to operate safely and effectively, the robots would need to be able to make decisions and respond to unexpected circumstances.”\nThe researchers decided to observe humans, who do things better and more naturally than robots. They analyzed the way humans move and found that some factors like speed, force and hand position play a pivotal role in understanding “commands” like speeding up or stopping. The next step is modeling these observations in order to program the robots. “What is exactly that makes us realize to slow down or turn? The applied force? A combination of force and speed? The boundary is not yet clear,” says Razavi. \nClara Marc", "summary": "Walking on two legs isn’t as easy as it seems. For robots and their designers, it is an even bigger challenge!

Moreover, the nerves of non-amputees can also be stimulated to feel roughness, without the need of surgery, meaning that prosthetic touch for amputees can now be developed and safely tested on intact individuals.\nThe technology to deliver this sophisticated tactile information was developed by Silvestro Micera and his team at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and SSSA (Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna) together with Calogero Oddo and his team at SSSA. The results, , provide new and accelerated avenues for developing bionic prostheses, enhanced with sensory feedback.\n\"The stimulation felt almost like what I would feel with my hand,\" says amputee Dennis Aabo Sørensen about the artificial fingertip connected to his stump. He continues, \"I still feel my missing hand, it is always clenched in a fist. I felt the texture sensations at the tip of the index finger of my phantom hand.\"\nSørensen is the first person in the world to recognize texture using a bionic fingertip connected to electrodes that were surgically implanted above his stump.\nNerves in Sørensen's arm were wired to an artificial fingertip equipped with sensors. A machine controlled the movement of the fingertip over different pieces of plastic engraved with different patterns, smooth or rough. As the fingertip moved across the textured plastic, the sensors generated an electrical signal. This signal was translated into a series of electrical spikes, imitating the language of the nervous system, then delivered to the nerves.\nSørensen could distinguish between rough and smooth surfaces 96% of the time.\nIn a , Sorensen's implants were connected to a sensory-enhanced prosthetic hand that allowed him to recognize shape and softness. In this new publication about texture in the journal eLife, the bionic fingertip attains a superior level of touch resolution.\nSimulating touch in non-amputees\n This same experiment testing coarseness was performed on non-amputees, without the need of surgery. The tactile information was delivered through fine needles that were temporarily attached to the arm's median nerve through the skin. The non-amputees were able to distinguish roughness in textures 77% of the time.\nBut does this information about touch from the bionic fingertip really resemble the feeling of touch from a real finger? The scientists tested this by comparing brain-wave activity of the non-amputees, once with the artificial fingertip and then with their own finger. The brain scans collected by an EEG cap on the subject's head revealed that activated regions in the brain were analogous.\nThe research demonstrates that the needles relay the information about texture in much the same way as the implanted electrodes, giving scientists new protocols to accelerate for improving touch resolution in prosthetics.\n\"This study merges fundamental sciences and applied engineering: it provides additional evidence that research in neuroprosthetics can contribute to the neuroscience debate, specifically about the neuronal mechanisms of the human sense of touch,\" says Calogero Oddo of the BioRobotics Institute of SSSA. \"It will also be translated to other applications such as artificial touch in robotics for surgery, rescue, and manufacturing.”\nThe research was carried out by EPFL and SSSA in collaboration with Università di Pisa, IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Università Campus Biomedico.\nThis work was partly supported by EU Grants TIME, NEBIAS and NANOBIOTOUCH, by the Italian grants NEMESIS (funded by the Italian Ministry of Health), PRIN/HandBot (funded by the Italian Ministry of Research), and PPR2 (funded by the National Institute for Insurance against Industrial Injuries), by the ENABLE project funded by the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering, and by the Swiss National Competence Center in Research in Robotics.", "summary": "An amputee feels rough or smooth textures in real-time — in his phantom hand — using an artificial fingertip connected to nerves in the arm.

{"id": 182, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.

{"id": 183, "text": "One day, a virtual version of your own heart pumping may help doctors diagnose heart disease and determine the best treatment for you, without the need of surgical intervention or other invasive clinical practices. EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni’s goal is precisely this as he builds mathematical tools to simulate heart function with increasing accuracy and that can be personalized to your heart based on medical scans. He recently added the behavior of a patient-specific aortic valve to his overall functioning heart model. The results are published June 7th in \nBiomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology\n.\nA personalized virtual heart for preventing cardiovascular disease\nThe human heart is an extraordinarily complex organ that pumps an estimated 180 million liters of blood, which would fill more than seven Olympic-sized swimming pools in one’s lifetime, thereby ensuring that oxygenated blood reaches the entire body. Cardiovascular problems may lead to malfunction, disease, or death. Heart disease causes 40% of deaths in the EU and costs an estimated 196 billion a year, yet 80% of acquired heart diseases and stroke episodes are preventable.\nQuarteroni aims to help prevent or treat cardiovascular disease by providing a personalized virtual heart to patients, essentially a detailed mathematical description of a patient’s heart and how it functions – or malfunctions.\nEvery person’s heart is unique. Correctly modeling the intricacies of each individual heart therefore requires a customizable mathematical description of both its geometry and its dynamics. But doing so in a mathematically sound way is no easy task; it requires large amounts of patient-specific data and computational power to solve complex equations. Thanks to increasingly powerful computers, building a realistic virtual heart is becoming a reality.\nHow to build a virtual aortic valve\nIn constructing a virtual heart that is complete and functional, the aortic valve cannot be neglected. Quarteroni and his team recently added to their heart model the way blood flows from inside the heart into the aorta, taking into account the complex shapes and properties of the aorta’s physiological membranes: the valve leaflets.\n“A mathematical description of the aortic valve and its interaction with blood flow exists in the literature, but not at this level of detail for a specific patient,” says Quarteroni.\nFrom MRI scans of a patient, they reconstructed the shape of the aorta, which they represented using a 3D computational mesh. Using mathematical tools to characterize the mechanics of the valve, they described the movement of three triangular-shaped leaflets that make up the aortic valve. To determine how blood flows inside of the atria, the heart’s cavities, they next approximated and numerically solved the mathematical equations (Navier-Stokes) that describe viscous fluid dynamics, adapting them for a patient-specific geometry. Even with this preliminary work, it is a relatively easy task to personalize the model to another patient by using a new set of MRI scans.\nAs the director of iHeart, an EU-funded project, Quarteroni’s long-term vision is to build patient-specific virtual models of the entire cardiovascular system, including the heart, all of the body’s blood vessels, and of the approximately five liters of blood flowing through the body. \n“If successful, \niHeart \nwill help clinicians to tackle important questions efficiently, both in diagnostics and treatment, with a tremendous impact for society,” says Quarteroni. “It will provide a unique, unprecedented research environment for exploring the heart with an immensely powerful and non–invasive mathematical microscope, making it possible to simulate cardiovascular disease, like carotid stenosis and aneuryisms that can affect the heart, the abdomen, the brain and other parts the body.”\nQuarteroni believes that a personalized virtual heart model may become clinically available in less than a decade. Earlier prototypes of the virtual model may be developed and tested sooner, possibly within a five-year horizon. This will require significant investment in the development of robust mathematical and numerical tools to simulate heart function that is tailored to a specific patient.", "summary": "EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni and his team are building a virtual heart model based on personalized medical images that may one day help cardiologists and cardiac surgeons non-invasively diagnose pathological heart conditions.

Equipped with an autopilot and a miniature high-definition camera, it is used by hundreds of professionals worldwide. This start-up installed at the gates of EPFL hopes to increase its sales tenfold in the next years and create dozens of new jobs in the field of airborne drones. It does so thanks to an investment of 5 million Swiss Francs from the publicly traded French company Parrot, making them a majority shareholder in senseFly.\nsenseFly drones demonstrate the full extent of their capabilities when combined with software developed by Pix4D, a spin-off of EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB). The algorithms developed by Pix4D make it possible to assemble hundreds of aerial pictures and, within minutes, to get an extremely accurate 3D and geo-referenced image of the observed terrain. This young company based at EPFL’s Science Park is also of interest to Parrot, which invested 2.4 million Swiss Francs for a minority share in Pix4D. “In the 1980’s the algorithms were really unreliable, and I was convinced it would take well over thirty years to become the basis of fully-automated, reliable and useful commercial products. This is a wonderful example of how curiosity-driven research, for example the ability of a human to make sense of the world around him through what he sees, eventually led to useful results,” said Pascal Fua, director of the CVLAB.\nLike an Insect\nUsing one of senseFly’s small high-performance drones is a breeze. The course can be programmed with software pre-flight and still be modified throughout the flight’s duration. No runway necessary: three movements back-and-forth are enough to start the engine, and the 500-gram wing takes off. The drone reaches a cruising speed of 40 km/h to autonomously map areas ranging from a few hectares to several square kilometers in one flight, with a resolution ranging from 3 to 30 cm/pixel depending on the distance above ground. Within a maximum of thirty minutes, the drone returns to its starting point without further assistance. All that is necessary for the next mission is to change the battery.\nThe technology on which these devices are based was created in 2001, when a team of robotics researchers in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) at EPFL began to investigate the strategies of control and navigation in flying insects. Early research led to the development of an integrated autopilot using intelligent control strategies similar to that of flies and bees. “By 2008 it was included in an ultra-light flying wing, which incorporated all the advantages of insects: efficient, elegant, light, elemental and intelligent,” recalls Jean-Christophe Zufferey, founder and CEO of senseFly. “I am very pleased that our robotic flying insect has not only helped to elucidate biological issues, but has also been able to promote the socio-economic development of our region by creating dozens of new high-value jobs. In collaboration with the newly created National Competence Center in Robotics, senseFly contributes to making EPFL and the surrounding region an important center for artificial intelligence and robotics,” says Dario Floreano, director of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and of the National Competence Center in Robotics.\nWhile the legislation for the usage of drones is being discussed in most countries, the low mass and speed of these ultra-light drones gives them a unique advantage by limiting the potential damage they could cause and thereby favored for civilian use.\nEPFL’s Pole of Expertise in Civilian Drones\nParrot, a global leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones, has recently invested in drones for the consumer market. It has released a Wi-Fi controllable quadricopter, of which it has sold more than 300,000 since its launch in 2010. The collaboration with the French group will create synergies for both EPFL start-ups.\nThe increasing need of data for Geographical Information Systems (GIS), such as Google Earth & Street View, should drive the market of ultra-light professional civilian drones to one billion dollars by 2020. The combination of senseFly trouble-free hardware, Pix4D’s unique mapping software and Parrot high volume manufacturing expertise provide the key elements to address this fast emerging market. Furthermore, the collaborations with the National Competence Centers (www.nccr-robotics.ch & www.MICS.org), both managed by EPFL, provide a heart to this internationally recognized center of expertise in civilian UAV technologies.\nSenseFly, founded in 2009 in “Le Garage”, EPFL’s incubator, will remain in the region and its management team will stay at the helm. “We can benefit from the technological expertise of Parrot, from its externalized industrial organization and its financial strength to accelerate our worldwide distribution,” said Jean-Christophe Zufferey, senseFly CEO. This strategic investment will give the French company access to the expertise and the technology for specialized drones.\nAs for Pix4D, created in 2011, Parrot’s investment enables the exploration of new business horizons. “This reinforces our position as a leader in software for professional drones,” adds Christoph Strecha, the company’s CEO.", "summary": "The French company Parrot, world leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones and already in the market for consumer drones, acquired for 5 million Swiss Francs a majority share in senseFly, a start-up from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL.

{"id": 187, "text": "Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers that affect white blood cells of the immune system called B-lymphocytes or B cells. Like cells in all cancers, the B cells begin to grow out of control, creating tumors in the lymph nodes, spleen or other tissues. In 2010 alone, it was estimated that non-Hodgkin lymphomas caused 210,000 deaths worldwide.\nOne of the driving forces behind non-Hodgkin lymphomas is the over-activation of a receptor on the surface of B cells. This receptor normally stimulates the growth of B-cells only when it is needed, but in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the growth signal is constantly on, making B-cells grow uncontrollably.\nTo block this signal, recent clinical studies have focused on inhibiting the activation of the B-cell receptor as a treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, but with variable success. For example, a drug called ibrutinib has been tested in clinical trials to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Ibrutinib blocks the enzyme BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase), which is involved in maturing and activating B cells as part of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway. Unfortunately, the response to ibrutinib has been limited only to a subgroup of DLBCL patients.\nThe  has now carried out a study to identify mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib. Using tumor cells from DLBCL patients, the scientists discovered that the inactivation of BTK in resistant tumors triggers the over-activation of alternative signals that promote tumor cell survival and proliferation.\nTo prevent this mechanism of resistance and block the B-cell receptor signaling at its root, Elena Battistello, the PhD student who led this project, targeted the three enzymes (LYN, FYN, and BLK) that initiate the propagation of the signals.\nRepresentation of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway (right).

Before a panel of international judges, forty finalists in three categories presented their projects that use new technologies for social purposes.\nInspired by insects, the flying machine is not afraid of collisions. Instead, it bounces off of obstacles thanks to a small spherical cage that surrounds it. “The idea is that the body of the robot remains in equilibrium after a collision, so that it can maintain its trajectory,” explains the start-up CTO Adrien Briod in previous article on the EPFL website. “It can be sent to hard-to-reach locations during a disaster, for example to film the environment with its onboard camera and provide valuable information to rescuers.” Based in EPFL’s Innovation Park, Flyability was founded in 2014 as a spin-off of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and the NCCR Robotics.\nAccording to company CEO Patrick Thévoz, the prize, which was awarded in the presence of the Ruler of Dubai, will enable the drone to clear a path towards commercialization.

{"id": 192, "text": "Instead of going on a diet, why not leave the suburbs and move downtown to drop some weight? In reality, it might not be quite that simple, but a recent study by researchers from the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and EPFL has shown that, for adults, place of residence has an impact on body-mass-index, an indicator used to classify people’s weight, that goes beyond income levels. Their findings rely on data gathered over 10 years in the canton of Geneva and were published in the journal Nature Nutrition and Diabetes. They highlight the need for a fine-grained assessment of public health and provide insights that could help guide campaigns to prevent obesity.\nPublic health specialists long ago connected the dots between people’s socioeconomic context and social networks on their health and obesity rates. In particular, body-mass-index (BMI) – a measure that describes body shape based on height and weight – has been believed to reflect the income and the average BMI of their social circles. As a result, obesity prevention campaigns have typically targeted large swaths of the population in low-income neighborhoods. But the data gathered from thousands of adults and children living in Geneva beg for a subtler interpretation.\nHealth data for more than 6600 adults, including measured height and weight, were collected from 2001 to 2010 as part of the Bus Santé population-based study, initiated and carried out by Idris Guessous of the Geneva University Hospitals. The campaign included several units including a mobile examination unit that went to several places in the State to evaluate the health of the canton’s residents. The dataset was rounded off with health evaluations of more than 3600 children, obtained in schools across the canton in 2011.\nEvaluating these data geographically confirmed that adults’ and children’s BMI values are not distributed randomly on a map of the canton. Instead, they were found to divide the map into regions with predominantly high or low values, and a larger one where neither trend prevailed. To the south of the Rhone River, the researchers detected a region characterized by low BMI values. North or the Rhone, and to the west of the Praille district, values of high BMI were overrepresented. Between the two, the researchers detected a large “neutral” belt, with a mixed population.\nRed dots represent adults with a high BMI that are surrounded by adults with similarly high BMI values (high-high). Blue dots represent the opposite situation (low-low). White dots mean that neither trend is detected. Purple and pink dots represent low-high and high-low respectively.\n Source:\nNature, 2014.\nThe study revealed two surprising features. First, high adult BMI values did not always overlap with those for children, especially in the heart of the city, north of the Rhone River. And second, at least for adults, the researchers found that differences in income were not enough to explain their findings. But according to the researchers, there are a number other of potential causes, including urban planning, social networks, sport infrastructure, and the promotion of softer forms of mobility, such as walking, biking, or public transportation. In the future, the researchers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographical Information Systems, who performed the spatial analysis of the results, will seek to tease out the effect of each of these and other factors on BMI.\nThe study brings to light the importance of finer-grained analysis of community health, both in terms of to geography and age. Lessons learned will primarily benefit other communities seeking to more accurately analyze the health of their residents. But they will also help those involved in setting up anti-obesity campaigns, allowing them to more accurately tailor adult or child specific interventions to the target audience they aim to reach.", "summary": "Whether you live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the canton of Geneva.", "claim": "Whether her live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the canton of Geneva.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 1], "noise": false}
{"id": 194, "text": "In our information society, the synthesis, distribution, and processing of radio and microwave signals are ubiquitous in wireless networks, telecommunications, and radars. The current tendency is to use carriers in higher frequency bands, especially with looming bandwidth bottlenecks due to demands for e.g. 5G and the “Internet of Things”. “Microwave photonics”, a combination of microwave engineering and optoelectronics, might offer a solution.\nA key building block of microwave photonics is optical frequency combs, which provide hundreds of equidistant and mutually coherent laser lines. They are ultrashort optical pulses emitted with a stable repetition rate that corresponds precisely to the frequency spacing of comb lines. The photodetection of the pulses produces a microwave carrier.\nIn recent years there has been significant progress on chip-scale frequency combs generated from nonlinear microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers. These frequency combs rely on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons, which are ultrashort coherent light pulses circulating inside optical microresonators. Because of this, these frequency combs are commonly called “soliton microcombs”.\nGenerating soliton microcombs needs nonlinear microresonators, and these can be directly built on-chip using CMOS nanofabrication technology. The co-integration with electronic circuitry and integrated lasers paves the path to comb miniaturization, allowing a host of applications in metrology, spectroscopy and communications.\nPublishing in \nNature Photonics\n, an EPFL research team led by Tobias J. Kippenberg has now demonstrated integrated soliton microcombs with repetition rates as low as 10 GHz. This was achieved by significantly lowering the optical losses of integrated photonic waveguides based on silicon nitride, a material already used in CMOS micro-electronic circuits, and which has also been used in the last decade to build photonic integrated circuits that guide laser light on-chip.\nThe scientists were able to manufacture silicon nitride waveguides with the lowest loss in any photonic integrated circuit. Using this technology, the generated coherent soliton pulses have repetition rates in both the microwave K- (~20 GHz, used in 5G) and X-band (~10 GHz, used in radars).\nThe resulting microwave signals feature phase noise properties on par with or even lower than commercial electronic microwave synthesizers. The demonstration of integrated soliton microcombs at microwave repetition rates bridges the fields of integrated photonics, nonlinear optics and microwave photonics.\nThe EPFL team achieved a level of optical losses low enough to allow light to propagate nearly 1 meter in a waveguide that is only 1 micrometer in diameter –100 times smaller than that a human hair. This loss level is still more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value in optical fibers, but represents the lowest loss in any tightly confining waveguide for integrated nonlinear photonics to date.\nSuch low loss is the result of a new manufacturing process developed by EPFL scientists – the “silicon nitride photonic Damascene process”. “This process, when carried out using deep-ultraviolet stepper lithography, gives truly spectacular performance in terms of low loss, which is not attainable using conventional nanofabrication techniques,” says Junqiu Liu, the paper’s first author who also lead the fabrication of silicon nitride nanophotonic chips at EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi). “These microcombs, and their microwave signals, could be critical elements for building fully integrated low-noise microwave oscillators for future architectures of radars and information networks.”\nThe EPFL team is already working with collaborators in US to develop hybrid-integrated soliton microcomb modules that combine chip-scale semiconductor lasers. These highly compact microcombs can impact many applications, e.g. transceivers in datacenters, LiDAR, compact optical atomic clocks, optical coherence tomography, microwave photonics, and spectroscopy.", "summary": "Using integrated photonic chips fabricated at EPFL, scientists have demonstrated laser-based microwave generators.

{"id": 195, "text": "When the World Wide Web was invented at CERN 30 years ago, no one talked about open science. But the internet has become one of the pillars of open science, providing researchers with a way of sharing information with colleagues around the world.\nIn January 2017, soon after taking office, EPFL President Martin Vetterli launched the  in order to raise awareness about this important topic. One key element was the creation of the Open Science Strategic Committee (OSSC), whose members provide EPFL’s Senior Management with input on how to best promote open science. We met with Professor Katrin Beyer, who chairs the OSSC, to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by open science at EPFL and beyond.\nHow open is science today?\nScience is definitely more open now than it was five or ten years ago, and almost certainly less than it will be five or ten years from now. It is increasingly common to share research outputs beyond the traditional manuscript - such as code and data - and this practice will soon be ubiquitous. One thing we notice when discussing the topic of open science among colleagues is that significant differences exist between disciplines. This does not necessarily mean that some are more open than others – they’re simply open in different ways.\nIn some fields it is standard to share preprints; in others open data has a long tradition. Open data seems to be particularly well-established in places where researchers use a large shared infrastructure, such as CERN. These communities have worked for a long time on establishing data-format and documentation standards. It seems much harder to create such standards when everybody has their own laboratory and, often, their own experimental set-up.\nOpen science initiatives touch on several key aspects of the research process – publications, research evaluation, career promotion, funding allocation and so on. Does that mean the whole process is flawed?\nThe process is certainly flawed when it comes to access to scientific literature. Some big legacy publishers now control the majority of the journals in most fields and have profit margins of 30–40%, effectively channeling public money into the pockets of private investors. Many universities simply cannot afford to pay the subscription fees. And while illegal services such as Sci-Hub bring more equality to researchers around the globe, relying on pirated access to knowledge is not a sustainable strategy. We need to do better.\nThat said, open access as it is implemented today does not necessarily solve the economic or equality issue. If it becomes expensive to publish, everyone will be able to read the literature, but only a few will be able to publish it. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\nIn terms of career promotion and evaluating candidates for funding, in theory, the framework is already in place. Many universities, including EPFL, have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which states that researchers should be judged not just on how many articles write and the prestige of the journals in which they publish, but on all types of research output, and that quality should come before quantity. However, in practice, hiring committees evaluating large numbers of applications within a short period of time can find it difficult to implement DORA, because assessing the quality of a variety of research outputs is more time consuming than looking at numbers and journal titles. This remains a challenge.\nHow will open science affect the research community?\nOne major objective of open science is to increase the reproducibility and reusability of published work, and I think this will accelerate science in general and increase its impact. Open science also implies a more inclusive research environment. Being part of an established network of researchers is not necessary anymore to get access to data or code – any researcher anywhere in the world can build on these research outputs.\nYoung researchers may benefit the most from open science. They also have a key responsibility: they contribute a significant part of the research and need to make sure it’s produced and documented so that others can easily build on it. Research institutions need to support them in this endeavor and ensure they have all the methodological tools they need.\nWhat is EPFL’s strategy?\nThe OSSC wants to promote a bottom-up approach to open science. Researchers know best where their disciplines are going, how to innovate in the way their community shares information, and what will have a real impact in making their field more open. But it is EPFL’s responsibility to listen to its researchers and develop the services and infrastructure that will make a clear difference in supporting those striving to implement open science in their daily routine.\nIt is important for EPFL to provide training opportunities at the same time. The summer school session called “Open Science in Practice,” which took place in September, gave PhD students a look at projects and tools that other early career researchers have used in their research practice. Teaching by example is the best way to convince people that open science is possible and has a greater impact, and that good practice does not necessarily require a lot of time. The School’s library also offers a range of courses on tools that make it easier to implement open science, along with expert advice on topics such as open access and data management. We recommend expanding this catalogue even further.\nIs EPFL a pioneer in open science?\nI think EPFL is ahead of the curve, since it works hard to explore the most promising avenues and tries to be innovative in its support for open science on campus. Martin Vetterli is very outspoken about it. And to be fair, many EPFL researchers started working openly well before the OSSC was set up. The Swiss Data Science Center, for example, is a driving force in this area and a real asset. Its Renku platform may change how we track the research process, and it could significantly reduce the time required for careful documentation.", "summary": "As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, EPFL is highlighting his commitment for open and reproducible research through an exceptional Open Science Day, today.

It uses them simultaneously, then aggregates the data obtained to deliver the final content to each unit. As a result the download speed can be doubled when two devices work together. “Videos represent 60% of the traffic on mobile networks, and the demand is growing faster than the ability of the network to provide bandwidth,” says Christina Fragouli, co-founder of the start-up. This results in increasing interruptions while viewing a video.\nThis ingenious system comes with many constraints. “To accomplish this, we must solve the problem of resource allocation, all the while accounting for variabilities in the wireless network,” explains Lorenzo Keller, the other co-founder of this spin-off from EPFL and University of California Irvine (UCI). The algorithms behind this system provide for any wireless device which transmits, via any network, at any time. Moreover, it necessarily does this effeciently: devices are carefully coordinated so that the overall coordination does not interfere with the benefits. Several applications are being developed. The bandwidth can be shared either when it is not in use by one of the users, or when a group of users simultaneously attempts to access the same content.\nVideobee, designed for Android smartphones, will be launched any day now. This application facilitates video viewing from websites like YouTube or DailyMotion by reducing both the waiting time at the beginning of the video as well as interruptions. The download speed is doubled. The bandwidth of another device nearby is used, albeit with the agreement of the owner.\nStarting in September a specific version for MOOCs (massive open online course) in Africa becomes available.

{"id": 200, "text": "Coral reefs are dying on a massive scale around the world, and global warming is driving this extinction. The planet’s largest reef, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, is currently experiencing enormous coral bleaching for the second year in a row, while last year left only a third of its 2300-km ecosystem unbleached. The demise of coral reefs heralds the loss of some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching in the Maldives. Photo credit: The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers\nNow, scientists have shown that corals in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Northern Red Sea are particularly resistant to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The results are published today in the journal \nRoyal Society\nOpen Science.\nThe implications are important, as the Gulf of Aqaba is a unique coral refuge. The corals may provide the key to understanding the biological mechanism that leads to thermal resistance, or the weakness that underlies massive bleaching. There is also the hope that the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs could be used to re-seed deteriorated reefs in the Red Sea and perhaps even around the world.\nScientists at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (Université de Lausanne) in Switzerland, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period. They found that the corals did not bleach.\n “[Under these conditions,] most corals around the world would probably bleach and have a high degree of mortality,” says EPFL scientist Thomas Krueger. “Most of the variables that we measured actually improved, suggesting that these corals are living under suboptimal temperatures right now and might be better prepared for future ocean warming.”\nInterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nAt the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, the scientists exposed corals of the species \nStylophora pistillata\n, collected from the Gulf of Aqaba, to water temperatures and acidification. The conditions resemble the summer conditions of a future ocean in this region if local ocean warming continues at its current rate of approximately 0.4-0.5°C per decade. They performed an overall health check of all the major physiological functions of the corals, measuring variables like energy metabolism, the ability to build a skeleton, and nutrient exchange at the molecular level between the coral-host and their algae symbionts. These physiological variables were mostly unaffected by the harsh experimental treatment. Still, further work on ecologically relevant variables like fertility or competitive performance is needed.\nSymbiotic corals live together with an algae partner, much in the same way humans are in symbiosis with gut bacteria. Just as bacteria in the gut aid with digestion, providing valuable nutrients to the rest of the body, the algae that live within the coral-partner provide nutrients to the corals. The bacteria in our body thrive within our digestive tract, just as the algae benefit from living within the coral partner. Bleaching occurs when the colored algae are ejected by their coral-partner, and the symbiosis breaks down. If the algae do not return, the coral dies.\nCorals growing at the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nPre-acclimated to thermal tolerance\nThe coral species \nStylophora pistillata \noccurs in other regions of the world, and beyond the Gulf of Aqaba, does not necessarily demonstrate thermal resistance. The biological mechanism that underlies the robustness of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs is still unknown, but the scientists have an idea of how the species evolved to become thermally resistant.\n“Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba are pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance due to the special geography and recent history of the Red Sea,” says scientist Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences.\nAt the end of the last ice age, corals started recolonizing the whole of the Red Sea through the southern connection to the Indian Ocean. The thermal bottleneck at the southern entrance with summer water temperatures rising to 30-32°C provided a selective barrier, allowing only highly resistant individuals to move north. Ironically, this heat-resistant founding population encountered much cooler waters once reaching the northern end, where the Gulf of Aqaba is located.\nBased on this, the study hypothesized that these corals might be able to better cope with today’s ocean warming, considering that they not only descended from a heat-selected founding population, but they also started their warming trajectory from a lower temperature, compared to their counterparts in the central and southern Red Sea.\nProtection of the Gulf of Aqaba Reef\nDespite being resistant to global warming, the corals from the Gulf of Aqaba are still vulnerable to other stresses like pollution.\n“Local disturbances, such as local oil pollution, nutrients from fish farms, herbicides from gardening, may reduce the exceptionally high tolerance of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs,” says Fine.\n“This reef should receive international recognition as a natural site of great importance, because it might very well be one of the last reefs standing at the end of this century,” says Anders Meibom of EPFL. “I would like to encourage the countries around the Gulf of Aqaba – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel – to get together and create a strong protection environmental program, because even if these corals are resistant to rising water temperatures, they are still sensitive to local pollution, overfishing etc, and they need to be protected from this now.”\nScientists Anders Meibom (left) of EPFL/ UNIL and Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel.", "summary": "Coral reefs in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures.

{"id": 204, "text": "Do you speak Scala? Many big companies active on the Web now reply in the affirmative. Twitter, Foursquare , LinkedIn and the internet site of the British newspaper The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) have adopted this programming language, developed at EPFL by Martin Odersky, Professor in the computer science section of the school.\nLast week, its creator announced the launch of a new company, with its offices at the Science Park at Ecublens. It’s called Typesafe, has just raised three million dollars, and will give a serious boost to the Scala language. The main investor in this round of financing – Greylock, based in Boston and in Silicon Valley – is not just any old investor. The company supported Facebook at the time when the social networking site was opening to a mass audience, and had also invested in LinkedIn, from 2004.\nScala is becoming more and more popular with programmers, especially for internet applications. But what’s behind this success? “This language is concise, and enables reductions of on average 50% of the lines of code”, Martin Odersky begins by explaining. What’s more, being very close to Java and completely compatible, it’s very easy to adopt for programmers who are familiar with Java, which has become a true standard on the Internet. Finally, it’s open source, which means that the people who contribute to its development exist in their hundreds, spread across the whole world – although EPFL remains the owner of the copyright.\nLeveraging the multiplication of “cores”\n One of the strengths of Scala is to combine two approaches that are popular in the programming world. One is “object-oriented” – which has always up to now been preferred by industry – and the other “functional programming”, which has been used mainly in academia. The advantage of the latter is that it’s very efficient when it comes to distribute tasks to several processors working in parallel. “Today, progress in IT is exemplified by the multiplication of the number of ‘cores’ in the processors, and no longer in terms of increases in speed”, explains the Professor. “Creating new applications that take advantage of this aspect of the processors is a natural development in programming.” Another advantage is that this approach is perfectly suited to distributed computing, or “cloud computing”, which is becoming more popular with big companies that are active on the Internet. This approach –concentrating on the distribution of tasks to multiple processors – gives Scala its name (from “scaling”).\nWith his new company, Martin Odersky is paving the way for the future of computing. Typesafe provides free-of-charge downloading of a pack of software including Scala, a development tool, and also the Akka platform, created in Sweden, whose inventor Jonas Bonér is also a co-founder of Typesafe. Complementary to Scala, Akka is a middleware designed for the distribution of tasks in large computing centers.\nIn parallel, Typesafe is putting in place a technical support service for its clients. “From around 15 employees today, our team will increase to 25 by the end of the year”, continues Martin Odersky. Most of the employees are developers, working in the EPFL Science Park, Cambridge, Boston – where the company is headquarted – and Uppsala. In just over a couple of weeks, Typesafe will be in the limelight during the second annual « Scala days » event – a meeting of programmers – whose initial occurrence last year at EPFL attracted many specialists.\nTypesafe should thus give a real boost to the Scala language. With a smile on his lips, Martin Odersky expresses his confidence that the “really big players” in this domain will soon be joining in.

By carefully measuring the path of light in fibers up to 100 kilometers long, we can glean information on the temperature, pressure and intensity of magnetic fields along the entire length of the fiber. It’s similar to a nerve, which tells us the intensity and location of a stimulus.\nBut this method is nearing its limits. Depending on the planned use, it’s necessary to sacrifice length, accept a lower resolution or add more equipment – a costly undertaking.\nOne hair, a million measurements\nThanks to the work done by EPFL’s Group for Fibre Optics (GFO), it will now be possible to maintain an extremely fine resolution even when the fiber gets longer. “We have no trouble getting a million measurement points from one optical fiber the width of a hair, for a resolution of one centimeter over 10 kilometers,” said Luc Thévenaz, the director of GFO. That’s 100 times more precise than current techniques.\nMeasurements made with this type of instrument have to be processed, because they include ‘parasites’. But the ratio between useful signals and noise cannot go below a certain threshold, otherwise the measurements will not be reliable.\nGraphic arts to the rescue\nThe EPFL researchers were able to boost this ratio significantly by borrowing a technology from an entirely different field: graphic arts. “The values collected from these measurement points on the fiber can be represented as a matrix of pixels – a two-dimensional image,” said Dr. Thévenaz. \"By applying standard graphic filters to this image, like those found in Photoshop, we were able to reduce the noise inherent in this measurement technique very effectively and identify the desired values more precisely.”\nPursuing this logic further, his teams also transformed more complex measurements, which take into account several parameters simultaneously, into video sequences. Here again, the magic of ‘standard’ video filters was at work.\nIn Dr. Thévenaz’s view, these advances, which are described in articles appearing in \nLight: Science & Applications – Nature\n and \nNature Communications\n, bring the field of distributed optical fiber sensors into a new era simply by using software techniques. This approach is, by definition, less expensive than adding more measuring devices.", "summary": "Image processing tools can improve our ability to monitor the soundness of infrastructure like bridges and gas pipelines.

{"id": 213, "text": "Katie Bouman was one of 200 scientists who helped create the first-ever image of a black hole, released this past April. The 30-year old researcher, who was recently named an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), came to speak at EPFL’s Open Science Day. Martin Vetterli took advantage of that opportunity to sit down with her and ask her a few questions about their field of shared interest.\nMV: “It’s pretty unusual for someone to become a star researcher at such a young age. How did you get into science?\nKB: I was very interested in science as a kid. When I was in third grade, I remember looking under rocks all the time. And as I got older, I was constantly drawn to the different science topics covered in class. In sixth grade, I first got involved in science fair projects, and I continued doing that on and off through high school. Then, when I tried out research for the first time, I was thrilled: it was so different from a homework set, where you know there’s a solution even if it’s difficult to find. Research was a new way of thinking and problem-solving for me, and I found that very exciting.\nHow did you get into computer science?\nIt wasn’t until high school, when a friend convinced me to take a computer science class. At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago. Initially, they didn’t believe their results and reran the experiment several times. Some things have changed since then, but we’re still dealing with noisy data, right?\nYes, when we first created the black-hole image, or at least the day we got the data, we entered it into an imaging script and a ring appeared. I actually went from being really excited to being mad at the colleagues who gave us the data – which I was convinced were fake. It just seemed too good to be true! Nothing ever works like that the first time. It was just so much more beautiful than any synthetic data we had created. It actually took weeks before I believed the data were real, and that our colleagues weren’t trying to trick us or test us.", "summary": "The first-ever image of a black hole was unveiled to the public this past April.

It enables you to plan a complete journey, practically door-to-door. Imagine that I’d like to go from Ecublens to Cambridge in the UK: there are hundreds of combinations of ways to get there. I can take the metro to Lausanne and then the train to Geneva, where I can fly to London Luton and finish my journey by taxi.

Working together and with our team of scientists and engineers, these partners will create new ways for scientists to use information about healthy and diseased cells. Their efforts will help to accelerate progress toward our goal of curing, preventing, or managing all diseases by the end of the century.”\n“We are excited to begin working on these promising projects with new partners from across the globe. These grantees include experts in experimental biology, engineering, and computational biology. Enabling them to collaborate and bring their diverse perspectives to the work is the core of our approach to advancing biomedical science,” added Cori Bargmann, Head of Science for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\nThe Human Cell Atlas is an international effort to map every type of cell in the healthy human body as a resource for studies of both health and disease.

Alongside the CZI, the HCA is supported by stalwarts of modern biological research such as the , the , the , the , and \nOne of the cornerstones of the HCA is analyzing the transcriptome, a term that refers to all the messenger RNA molecules expressed by an organism’s genes to represent all the proteins it produces. Analyzing the transcriptome of single cells requires in-depth bioinformatics expertise, which makes the approach inaccessible to many research groups.\nTo address this limitation, Vincent Gardeux, a postdoc in the Deplancke lab together with Fabrice David of the Gene Expression Core Facility of EPFL developed an “automated single-cell analysis pipeline” (ASAP). This web-based platform allows scientists to analyze their own data and compare algorithms used in studying transcriptomes. ASAP can also detect differential expression of genes and gene clustering, produce heat-maps and analyze functional enrichment to identify and characterize novel cell clusters or specific cell types. ASAP has already attracted a significant number of users.\nAbout the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative \nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was launched in December 2015 by Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, and Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician and founder and CEO of The Primary School in East Palo Alto.

{"id": 219, "text": "Pharmaceuticals, energy, perfumes, polymers – all are industrially produced via chemical reactions. To carry out reactions, one needs reactors (vessels of different types and sizes ) to mix the various reagents and some catalysts, while controlling the pressure, temperature, and other parameters.\nUsually, industrial chemical reactions take place in large vessels, producing big quantities of substances. The use of these vast reactors has many drawbacks. For example, it’s difficult to obtain uniform mixing at constant temperatures, and one has to stop the process regularly to empty the reactor. Moreover, chemical reactions are often successfully performed in small reactors in the laboratory, but many problems arise in achieving the same results when the production is scaled-up in industry. This is like preparation of a dish for two people doesn’t involve too much difficulty, but preparing the same dish for 100 people is a different matter!\nThe EPFL’s Group of Chemical Reaction Engineering (GGRC) headed by Lioubov Kiwi has studied the use of microreactors for many years. They produce the required substances in tiny pipes, quickly enabling a highly uniform mixing that is perfectly controlled in terms of temperature (which also avoids the risk of explosion), often without the use of solvents, and in a continuous flow. For example, the reagents could be injected through two separate pipes in a Y-shaped system. They react when they meet, and the resulting product comes out through the third pipe. Detractors say that only insufficient quantities can be produced, but these reactors can be used by thousands in parallel. The products created in these microreactors are purer and therefore higher quality, as the process avoids the manufacturing of undesirable by-products inherent in large reactors.\nProfessor Kiwi and her team have received 2.4 million Swiss francs from the European Union to develop these microreactors. 650 thousand Swiss francs have been allocated to a new project, POLYCAT, which started up on November 15. The goal is to combine the advantages of a microreactor and a nano-catalyst. “To reach our objective, we employ micro- and nano-technologies together”, explains Lioubov Kiwi. The concept/process consists of the deposition on the micro-reactor walls of a polymer thin film that anchors the catalyst nanoparticles (gold, palladium etc.). These nanoparticles remain exposed to the reacting liquids or gases while being firmly fixed to the walls of the micro-capillaries.\nSuch a catalytic reactor could become a reality within two to three years, significantly improving the performance of industrial chemical reactions in terms of their quality, as well as their environmental and safety-related impact.", "summary": "EPFL’s Lioubov Kiwi and her group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "claim": "EPFL’s Lioubov Kiwi and our group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 5], "noise": false}
{"id": 220, "text": "Many phenomena occurring in nature and industry happen very quickly: a tear running through a piece of fabric, a rubber ball bouncing off a hard floor, a drop of water wetting a dry surface and a piece of scotch tape peeling off, for example. Capturing images of these phenomena would help scientists better understand them, but conventional cameras aren’t fast enough – and high-speed cameras are prohibitively expensive. \nBut scientists at EPFL’s , working in association with Harvard University researchers in the , have developed a new imaging method called Virtual Frame Technique (VFT) that can generate thousands of images of these phenomena as they occur step by step, using a photo taken from any kind of device, including a smartphone. What’s more, VFT has been shown to perform better than high-speed cameras. \nWorking with a conventional photo\nThe method starts by analyzing a conventional photo. “If you use a regular camera to take a picture of a drop of water hitting a dry surface, the water’s movement will cause the picture to be blurry. But these blurred areas are precisely where the phenomenon is taking place, both spatially and temporally. That’s what our technique uses to piece together the underlying phenomenon,” says John Kolinski, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. In other words, VFT works by deconstructing the blurry parts of pictures. \nA method for binary phenomena\nThe first step is to shine light on the phenomenon just as the conventional picture is taken, so that the blurry parts can be exploited. “This initial illumination step must be done correctly so that the blurry parts of the picture contain the right information and can be used. At this point the object must have a quantifiable instantaneous state of either completely blocking the light or completely letting it through,” says Kolinski. The next step is to employ advanced image-processing methods to improve the conventional picture’s temporal resolution and specific illumination scheme, and then turn it into a binary image – that is, containing either black or white pixels. \nThis method offers an advantage because many natural phenomena are binary; for example, a piece of fabric is either torn or it isn’t, a surface is either wet or dry. That means only two greyscale values are necessary to depict them – no need for the 15,000+ intensity values available with conventional cameras. By sacrificing the ability to resolve intensity, the scientists were able to use the camera sensor’s bit depth, or the amount of information the sensor can obtain, to increase the frame rate while retaining full spatial resolution. Temporal resolution can be improved even further by adjusting the timing of a light pulse.\nTime-lapse photos over extremely short periods \nVFT therefore breaks down a conventional photo of an object in rapid motion into thousands of images that show every step of the process. “It’s like taking time-lapse photos of a nearly instantaneous phenomenon,” says Kolinski. The scientists tested their technique on pictures taken by all kinds of devices, from smartphones to sophisticated professional cameras, and found that it consistently resulted in a faster frame rate. While careful illumination is required, the method is quite general, and has been used to record a rich variety of phenomena, from droplet impacts to fracture mechanics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a new image-processing method that can capture extremely rapid phenomena using any type of camera.

{"id": 228, "text": "The goal of the Human Brain Project is to pull together all our existing knowledge about the human brain and to reconstruct the brain, piece by piece, in supercomputer-based models and simulations. The models offer the prospect of a new understanding of the human brain and its diseases and of completely new computing and robotic technologies. On January 28, the European Commission supported this vision, announcing that it has selected the HBP as one of two projects to be funded through the new FET Flagship Program.\nFederating more than 80 European and international research institutions, the Human Brain Project is planned to last ten years (2013-2023). The cost is estimated at 1.19 billion euros. The project will also associate some important North American and Japanese partners. It will be coordinated at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, by neuroscientist Henry Markram with co-directors Karlheinz Meier of Heidelberg University, Germany, and Richard Frackowiak of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL).\nThe Swiss Contribution \nSwitzerland plays a vital role in the Human Brain Project. Henry Markram and his team at EPFL will coordinate the project and will also be responsible for the development and operation of the project’s Brain Simulation Platform. Richard Frackowiak and his team will be in charge of the project’s medical informatics platform; the Swiss Supercomputing Centre in Lugano will provide essential supercomputing facilities. Many other Swiss groups are also contributing to the project. Through the ETH Board, the Swiss Federal Government has allocated 75 million CHF (approximately 60 million Euros) for the period 2013-2017, to support the efforts of both Henry Markram’s laboratory at EPFL and the Swiss Supercomputing Center in Lugano. The Canton of Vaud will give 35 million CHF (28 million Euros) to build a new facility called Neuropolis for in silico life science, and centered around the Human Brain Project. This building will also be supported by the Swiss Confederation, the Rolex Group and third-party sponsors.\nThe selection of the Human Brain Project as a FET Flagship is the result of more than three years of preparation and a rigorous and severe evaluation by a large panel of independent, high profile scientists, chosen by the European Commission. In the coming months, the partners will negotiate a detailed agreement with the Community for the initial first two and a half year ramp-up phase (2013-mid 2016). The project will begin work in the closing months of 2013.\n---\nA scientific portrait of the Human Brain Project \nThe Human Brain Project will provide new tools to help understand the brain and its fundamental mechanisms and to apply this knowledge in future medicine and computing.\nCentral to the Human Brain Project is Information and Computing Technology (ICT). The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior.\nA novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and to speed up the search for new treatments.\nFinally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems.\nThe HBP will fund independent scientists to use the new platforms for their own research, reserving a substantial part of its budget for this purpose. In brief, the HBP will create a CERN for the brain.", "summary": "The European Commission has officially announced the selection of the Human Brain Project (HBP) as one of its two FET Flagship projects.

{"id": 231, "text": "Patients fitted with an orthopedic prosthetic commonly experience a period of intense pain after surgery. In an effort to control the pain, surgeons inject painkillers into the tissue during the operation. When that wears off a day or two later, the patients are given morphine through a catheter placed near the spine. Yet catheters are not particularly comfortable, and the drugs spread throughout the body, affecting all organs.\nResearchers in EPFL’s  at the School of Engineering are now working on a biodegradable implant that would release a local anesthetic on-demand over several days. Not only would this implant reduce patients’ post-op discomfort, but there would be no need for further surgery to remove it. They developed a tiny biodegradable electronic circuit, made from magnesium, that could be heated wirelessly from outside the body.\nOnce integrated into the final device, the circuit will allow to release controlled amounts of anesthetic in a specific location over several days. After that, the implant will degrade safely inside the body. This research has been published in .\nOne capsule with several reservoirs\nThe electronic circuit – a resonant circuit in the shape of a small spiral – is just a few microns thick. When exposed to an alternating electromagnetic field, the spiral resonator produces an electric current that creates heat.\nThe researchers’ end-goal is to pair the resonators with painkiller-filled capsules and then insert them into the tissue during surgery. The contents of the capsules could be released when an electromagnetic field sent from outside the body melts the capsule membrane.\n“We’re at a key stage in our project, because we can now fabricate resonators that work at different wavelengths,” says Matthieu Rüegg, a PhD student and the study’s lead author. “That means we could release the contents of the capsules individually by selecting different frequencies.” The heat-and-release process should take less than a second.\nA novel manufacturing technique\n The researchers had to get creative when it came time to manufacture their biodegradable resonators. “We immediately ruled out any fabrication process that involved contact with water, since magnesium dissolves in just a few seconds,” says Rüegg. They ended up shaping the magnesium by depositing it on a substrate and then showering it with ions. “That gave us more flexibility in the design stage,” he adds. They were eventually able to create some of the smallest magnesium resonators in the world: two microns thick, with a diameter of three millimeters.\nThe team’s invention is not quite ready for the operating room. “We still need to work on integrating the resonators into the final device and show that it’s possible to release drugs both \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n,” concludes Rüegg.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed biodegradable microresonators that can be heated locally with a wireless system.

{"id": 234, "text": "Will there be lots of gadgets under the family Christmas tree this year? By the back door, robotic vacuums are bringing cyberstuff into daily life; they’re among the first autonomous devices that can be easily used by ordinary households.\nThat’s all the impetus scientists needed to seize the opportunity and do a study. Understanding to what extent robots will influence daily life in the future is in fact one of the central issues being studied in the EPFL-based National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Robotics.\n In 2011, a team from EPFL’s Pedagogical Research and Support team (CRAFT) conducted a qualitative study on household robots. Nine compositionally diverse families (young, older, with and without children) were given a machine from one of the most common brands. “We interviewed the families before they got the robot, and then we followed them for six months, starting with their first contact with the device,” explains anthropologist and study co-author Valérie Bauwens.\nRapid and irrevocable decisions\n Seven criteria of varying importance – practical, but also emotional - were developed to judge the degree to which the families adopted the robots. Put to the test and further refined by this first field study, these criteria will be useful to engineers at EPFL and elsewhere who are thinking about the domestic robots of the future.\nIn the end only three of the nine families liked the automatic vacuum cleaners. “It was interesting to observe that the decision whether or not to abandon them was made really fast, after about only two weeks,” Bauwens says. “Our robots had very little time to prove themselves!”\nAmong the elements that the users didn’t like, the researchers listed the need to modify the setup of an apartment so that the robot could do its work correctly. In addition, they didn’t like having to change certain behaviors, such as leaving things on the floor, which compromised the machine’s performance. “We even had one user who was careful to put the coffee table up on the couch to make room for the robot to work,” says second author Julia Fink.\nKids are quickly bored\n The scientists also looked at the influence that these new “companions” might have on the family ecosystem. “Overall, we didn’t see many changes,” Bauwens says. “The mother is still generally in control of household organization, even with this tool.” Two of the study subjects, however, appropriated the device, giving it a name or talking to it. The children were at first very excited by the arrival of the new toy, but the older ones quickly lost interest. “It’s just a vacuum cleaner!” said one of them.\n The first robot to get a foothold in apartments is thus a kind of guinea pig. Its successors - such as “Ranger,” a robotic box under development at EPFL that encourages kids to put away their toys by amusing interactions such as speaking and moving its eyes - can benefit from the problems it encountered. As for the robotic vacuums, resellers will certainly have a good idea by mid-January, high season for returns, whether or not their statistics confirm the result of the qualitative study.\nSwiss TV TSR1 consumers' show A Bon Entendeur will talk about vacuum robots and this EPFL research in its January 10 edition.", "summary": "Are robots welcome in our homes?

{"id": 235, "text": "Treatments for beating tumours are mainly based on CD8 T lymphocytes, which specialise in detecting and eliminating intracellular infections and in killing cancer cells. A large proportion of patients, however, do not respond to these treatments. This prompted a research team from the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman (SCCL, Switzerland) to bring together the universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL), the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), EPFL and CHUV to investigate CD4 T lymphocytes. While these play a supporting role with CD8 T cells, their ability to eliminate tumour cells directly has been a matter of controversy. Using innovative nanoimaging technologies designed at the EPFL's School of Engineering laboratory, the scientists found that when the CD4 T lymphocytes were directly put in close contact to the cancer cells, up to a third of them could also kill them. This discovery, the subject of an article in \nScience Advances\n, is significant and broadens the therapeutic perspectives based on administering CD4 T lymphocytes to patients who are resistant to conventional therapies.\nWhen cancer cells proliferate in our bodies, our immune system kicks in. The first line of fighters capable of destroying tumour cells are CD8 T lymphocytes known as cytotoxic T cells, backed up by CD4 T lymphocytes. The latter secrete factors that help the former in many ways. “That’s why lots of cancer treatments are based on CD8 T lymphocytes,” begins Camilla Jandus, last author of the study and a pro- fessor in the Department of Pathology and Immunology in UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and adjunct scientist at LICR. “Unfortunately, some patients don’t respond to these treatments, and so we have to find new ones.”\nThe SCCL team turned their focus to CD4 T lymphocytes, which offer invaluable support to our immune system, as Pedro Romero, a professor in the Department of Fundamental Oncology in UNIL’s Faculty of Medicine and Biology, explains: “These have a much wider spectrum of functional specialisations than CD8 T lymphocytes, and for a long time we didn’t know for sure whether they had the capacity to diffe- rentiate into killer lymphocytes.”\n20,000 individual “boxing rings”\nTo address this question, the scientists examined CD4 T lymphocytes from around twenty patients with melanoma who were being treated at CHUV. “Although melanoma isn’t the most common skin cancer, it is the deadliest, and it’s particularly sensitive to immunotherapies,” spells out Professor Jandus. The researchers isolated the CD4 T lymphocytes from both the blood and fragments of the tumours with the idea of comparing them directly. Dissociated tumour cells and CD4 T cells were co-incubated to observe their behaviour individually. Observation tools were then required to provide highly-advanced resolution down to the single cell level. “We created chips of over 20,000 mini-wells of 65 picolitres (1 picolitre = 10-12 litre) that can accommodate a CD4 T cell and a tumour cell in each of them, and function like boxing rings,” says Hatice Altug, a professor in EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory. The researchers then photographed all these thousands wells simultaneously every five minutes for 24 hours in order to observe the interactions occurring between the two cells from a large set of pairs. “We know that it takes about two and a half hours for a CD8 to kill a tumour cell, and we decided to observe these boxing rings for 24 hours without knowing how, and if, the CD4s would react,” continues Professor Altug.\nA third of the CD4s emerged victorious\nTo the great satisfaction of the scientists, the high-throughput inte- gration of dynamic imaging data showed that up to a third of the CD4 T lymphocytes succeeded in killing the tumour cell to which they were closely linked within five hours. As Professor Romero stresses: “These direct observations at the level of individual lymphocytes, which were revealed for the first time at such a level of sensitivity, definitively confirm the existence of CD4 T lymphocytes capable of killing tumour cells. And this happens while the tumour cells sometimes manage to divert them from their function of providing protective support to make allies of them.”\nPicowell array chip in a standard microscope slide with separated chambbers.\n © 2021 EPFL\nBy analysing the killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes in detail, the scientists found that they expressed the SLAMF7 molecule, which promoted their tumor killer activity. “That’s why we’re now going to isolate and cultivate in vitro the best killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes so we can turn them into a veritable army of trillions of cells, which we can then inject into patients on whom CD8-based treatments don’t work,” says Dr Jandus. The human body naturally has only a small number of CD4 T lymphocytes directed against tumours, and not enough to defeat them. “The ability to visualise this close combat with our picowell chip paves the way for expanding the arsenal in the fight against cancer, which we now need to develop,” concludes Professor Altug.", "summary": "A team from EPFL and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy them.", "claim": "A team from EPFL and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy us.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [34, 34], "noise": false}
