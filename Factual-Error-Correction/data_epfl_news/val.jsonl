{"id": 0, "text": "She left with an empty suitcase and came back with one full of hair! Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples. Her results showed that people are exposed to a number of pesticides, and that this is not due solely to their work. The farmers are affected the most, but the village's inhabitants were also exposed to pesticides through other vectors, like food and water.", "summary": "Summer series on student projects – For her Master’s project in environmental sciences, Christelle Oltramare collected 110 hair samples in Burkina Faso and came up with a process for identifying several types of pesticides.", "claim": "Summer series on student projects – For our Master’s project in environmental sciences, Christelle Oltramare collected 110 hair samples in Burkina Faso and came up with a process for identifying several types of pesticides.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [7, 7], "noise": false}
{"id": 1, "text": "Even though silicon is one of the most abundant elements, the energy required to make silicon from sand is immense. It is for this reason, but also to reduce manufacturing costs, that Professor Christophe Ballif and his team from the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory at the EPFL have been working for several years on thin-film silicon solar cells that are a thousand times thinner than conventional cells.\nThere’s just one catch: the thinner the cells, the less they absorb the rays of the sun and the less electricity they produce. So researchers are trying to trap light in the thin silicon layers to increase their absorption. Traditionally, thin layers of zinc oxide—a material that is very abundant, completely non-toxic, and that grows in the form of small pyramid-shaped crystals—are used for this purpose. These crystals scatter light efficiently into the underlying silicon layer. With such zinc oxide layers, even a new world record cell efficiency was achieved.\nReducing costs\nBut scientists are attempting to beat this record. “It is difficult to modify the natural pyramidal shape of these crystals in order to obtain even better light scattering,” explains researcher Corsin Battaglia, “so we had the idea to force the crystals to grow on a different support, an inverted mould with the desired structure.” The idea is as ingenious as it is simple. Once the thin layer of zinc oxide is deposited on the mould all that needs to be done is to “demould” it—as you would a tarte tatin, for example—to obtain a film with the desired structure.\nThis procedure, described in the September edition of the journal Nature Photonics, not only increases the amount of light that is trapped, thereby increasing output, but it also has the potential to reduce the cost of the cells because of its compatibility with mass production. These are interesting arguments at a time when photovoltaics is seeking to produce electricity at a lower price than the current grid price.", "summary": "Do better with less.

{"id": 2, "text": "Space technologies, and above all satellites, have enormous potential in many areas such as logistics, natural resource exploitation, safety and environmental protection. But these possibilities are poorly known and largely underutilized. To address this shortcoming, the European Space Agency (ESA) has launched a program called the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP). José Achache, former director of ESA’s Earth Observation programs and Group on Earth Observations (GEO) in Geneva, is now the IAP programs’ Swiss Ambassador. Based in EPFL’s Innovation Square, he also collaborates with EPFL’s Space Center.\n-\tWhat is your job?\nOur goal is to reach out to companies and communities in order to make them aware of the advantages of space technologies, to encourage them to invest in these applications, and in this way to boost the development of space technologies and expand the range of their usage. The IAP program provides funding to help develop these applications, and we provide assistance in setting them up, both technically and financially. I am responsible for representing the IAP program in Switzerland, and for promoting the applications of satellite data in three main sectors: telecommunications, Earth observation, and positioning.\n-\tAre these sectors particularly promising?\nDefinitely! A recent study on the potential of geo-spatial services estimated that they will generate $150-270 billion per year in coming years. And there are even more companies that don’t use space technologies even though they have every reason to do so. So there’s still a lot to be done.\n-\tDo you have examples of the kinds of companies or activities that could benefit?\nThere was an international maritime transport company that lost track of thousands of containers every year. Using a system that linked telecommunications and GPS, they were able to better monitor shipments and reduced their losses by a factor of a thousand. All companies that produce, buy and transport foods could benefit from space technologies to verify the origin of their imports, monitor production conditions and assess the efficiency of the negotiation and transportation chains. In the safety sector, I can give the example of an application developed with IAP support that used local and satellite radar to detect birds flying near airports. This service, particularly beneficial for those in charge of nighttime takeoffs, significantly increases safety and reduces the loss of material. Another example: satellite imaging systems that can reveal subsidence on the order of a millimeter are systematically used to monitor large infrastructures such as dams, bridges and mountain roadways.\n-\tAre any public sector groups interested in these technologies?\nYes, many political bodies are interested. Thanks to geolocation, it’s possible for countries that don’t have land survey data to better identify and manage their territory. For everything related to environmental protection and the development of renewable energy, satellites provide precise and valuable information on the state of crops, forests, soils and seas. The great thing about satellites is that they are global, they operate 24/7, and they’re designed to last for at least 40 years. They’re a great tool for statistics and for managing Earth-based activities and resources, and it’s in everyone’s best interests to share these data. It’s also a way of providing communications and high-speed Internet access all over the world, in areas without optical fibers or mobile phone reception.\n- Which sectors are the most promising in Switzerland?\nAnything that involves infrastructure monitoring, ski area management, water supply and risks associated with water. There’s also agriculture and harvest forecasts, insurance against bad weather and most of all certification and traceability. Finally, I am convinced that air safety, with the advent of pilotless aircraft, will be a huge growth sector for the use of space technologies. The number of sectors concerned is boundless.

{"id": 3, "text": "Swiss democracy produces lots of data: municipality-by-municipality ballot results and the votes of the National Council are publicly available, as are the responses of the candidates and voters who filled in the questionnaire on the \"smartvote\" voter recommendation website before the 2011 Federal elections. Under the supervision of professors Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran, Vincent Etter and Julien Herzen, PhD students in the Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory, explored these data to reveal a number of interesting facts. They are currently continuing their research by creating a platform, Predikon.ch, that will be able to predict the results of a federal vote based on initial results coming in from municipalities and past data.\nYes, the “Röstigraben” exists! “And it was a bit of a surprise,” admits Etter. They performed a dimensionality reduction on the municipal results for all votes since 1981. This is a standard tool used by statisticians who specialize in data analysis to produce a graphical representation of data. Two groups emerged: one French-speaking and one of German-speaking. (You can see it at ). “The municipalities closest to the intersection of the groups on the graph are also those that are geographically closest to the linguistic border,” notes Herzen.\nWhile the linguistic divide is easy to see on this representation, it’s a bit more difficult to make sense of the graph’s axes, obtained by the dimensionality reduction. “It’s not the traditional left-right and conservative-liberal divisions,” explains Etter. Over time, the Italian-speaking regions seem to move away from the French-speaking districts to join their German-speaking compatriots. In a future version of their interactive graphic, the scientists plan to add a temporal cursor that will highlight this.\nRight and Left are alive and well \nAlthough the Röstigraben can’t be explained by either the left-right or conservative-liberal divide, these classical political categories are alive and well when it comes to politicians, as the duo found when they applied the same data visualization tools to information from the 2011 Federal elections obtained from the voter recommendation website smartvote.ch.\nWith the same data analysis approach, the researchers explored whether the political parties were really all that different from one another. They showed that the positions of 25.8% of the socialist candidates were closer to the median of the green party positions than to their own party’s position. Inversely, the proportion was 18.8%. But the overlap was greatest in the PBD, with more than half of its politicians closer to the median of another party (most often the PDC, 33.1%) than aligned with their own.\nEtter and Herzen also showed that it would be easy for a candidate who filled in his or her own smartvote profile to choose responses that would optimize the number of times they would be recommended to voters that trusted the site. However, this was evidently not exploited in 2011, since the difference between the voting records of parliamentary politicians and their smartvote profile was very small.\nEbikon, a small town that has it right\nThe next step for the two computer scientists is to predict the result of an vote by combining the initial votes coming in from a small number of municipalities with the database of past results. The platform they are developing with Victor Kristof, a student in Communication systems, is called Predikon.ch, a combination of the words “Prediction” and “Ebikon.” This small town near Lucerne (population 12,000) appeared in their preparatory studies to be the one whose results most reliably predicted the federal result. “By doing the exercise with past votes, in 96% of the cases, the result in Ebikon gave us the correct result at the federal level,” explains Herzen.\nThe project’s development is hampered by the fact that each of Switzerland’s 26 cantons has a different system for presenting its data, and that often these platforms are only online for a few hours the day the vote is held, while ballots are still being counted; but nonetheless there’s a good chance that the Predikon index will soon be mentioned in the news updates on these Sundays.\nThe Predikon project, along with all of Etter and Herzen’s research, will be presented at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences Open House, Saturday November 22 at 3:30 pm in room BC420, during a seminar entitled “La démocratie suisse vue par les données.” Throughout the Open House, a Predikon demo will be held on the fourth floor of the BC building.

One feels dizzy in such a remote spot, nestled among meadows ready for the harvest. This is the setting Maartje Bastings has chosen for our interview. The professor in the Programmable Biomaterials Laboratory is about to embark on a 16-kilometer training run, with 1,400 meters in positive altitude change. But it’s all in a day’s work for this trailblazing scientist: her run will clock in at 2 hours and 40 minutes.\nDeparture from the small hamlet of Commeire above Orsières. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nBastings expertly combines a career as a research scientist with her enthusiasm for mountain running. For her, the two are inseparable: “Running requires physical effort, but in return, it fuels my mental energy. Without it, I’d never be able to work as efficiently as I do. I see training in the mountains as part of my work,” she says. In fact, it is precisely when the 36-year-old researcher is running along the ridges that she finds solutions to scientific problems. Up there, she can step back and take in the big picture. Most of her ideas come to her while running. \n\"At this altitude, nothing is level: it’s either up or down.\" ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nNo pain, no gain\nCompetitive by nature, Bastings knew ever since her first university class that she wanted to become a professor. Just as she does with sports, she has given her all to reach that goal. “People don’t always understand, but it takes a great deal of work to get to this point. It requires a considerable amount of sacrifice. But I have no regrets, since I have a job I love.”\nIt's in the mountains that Maartje Bastings finds the mental energy. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nThe mother of a one-year-old boy, Bastings spends weekends in her campervan roaming the Alps.

I hope that the next generation of researchers will not see this as barrier.”\nMaartje Bastings in full effort. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nIn her lab and in the mountains, Bastings lives by one and the same motto: no pain, no gain. “If you want to achieve something, whether in sports or science, you have to put in the effort, knowing that there will be some less enjoyable moments. Two straight days of sampling is no fun. Neither is climbing a slope for several kilometers. But if you keep your mind on your goal – the one that drives you forward – you can overcome any hurdle.”\nNothing like cooling your feet in the water. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nAn insatiable curiosity\nTo summon the energy needed to tackle her research and train for her sport – she considers herself an amateur-professional trail runner – Bastings is highly organized and makes to-do lists. “I try to remain focused and efficient. I map out my day so that I don’t waste any time.” The most important thing is maintaining a balance between her work and the mountains. “Do I get tired? No, because everything I do interests me.

{"id": 5, "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an extremely common herpes-family virus that infects people for life. It infects 60% of the population in industrialized countries, and almost everybody in poorer regions. Its symptoms are easily fought off by a healthy immune system, but can be devastating to individuals with defective immunity, e.g. newborn babies, people with AIDS, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs after receiving organ transplants. After infection, HCMV hides (\"lies dormant\") in blood-making stem cells, occasionally reactivating as these cells mature. Scientists at EPFL have now discovered the molecular switch that allows HCMV to either lie dormant in these cells or reactivate and start infecting again. The switch can be manipulated with simple drugs to force HCMV reactivation, making the virus easy to target and kill. Published in \neLife\n, the study shows how HCMV could be fought in high-risk patients and purged from organs before transplantation.\nThrowing the switch\nThe lab of Didier Trono at EPFL discovered a protein that switches HCMV between dormancy and reactivation. They found this protein to be bound to the HCMV genome in latently infected hematopoietic stem cells and, upon a variety of external stimuli, to undergo a modification that allows for viral activation. The researchers were able to control this switch with a drug called chloroquine, usually used against malaria. When they treated blood-making stem cells that contained dormant HCMV with chloroquine, the virus reactivated and became exposed, opening the door to maneuvers aimed at eliminating virus-infected cells.\nThe simplicity of the study’s design underlies its enormous significance. On one hand, it sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which HCMV becomes dormant in hematopoietic stem cells, possibly offering insights into similar infections by other herpes viruses. On the other hand, the study provides a straightforward method for forcing HCMV out of dormancy in infected tissue. Coupled with a simultaneous dose of an antiviral, this could become a standard regimen for eradicating HCMV from high-risk patients and purging it from tissue before transplantation.\nTrono’s team is now testing the method’s efficiency in purging HCMV from cells to be used for bone marrow transplantation. Following that step, the group will be developing the first trials in humans.\nReference\nRauwel B, Jang SM, Cassano M, Kapopoulou A, Barde I, Trono D. \nRelease of Human Cytomegalovirus from latency by KAP1/TRIM28 phosphorylation switch.\neLife\n DOI: 10.7554/eLife.06068", "summary": "EPFL scientists have discovered the switch that can awake a dormant cytomegalovirus, a dreadful pathogen in immuno-compromised patients.

When they do go to class, it is not to learn new material but to take what was presented online into further detail. This concept of ‘flipped classroom’ requires a considerable investment on the part of the instructor. This is the method Jamila Sam and Jean-Cédric Chappelier used to create four MOOCs – online courses that they customize, which take weeks of preparation and filming. Making these courses fit the traditional curriculum is a real pedagogical feat for the pair, who have been working together for the past 15 years in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences.\nImproved performance\nThe results of these novel courses speak for themselves. Because they are actively involved in learning, students are more motivated and do better on exams – and this is particularly true of students who were struggling. For example, 16% more students received a passing grade during an exam given in 2014 compared to the same exam in 2007.\nThe success of this new approach is largely thanks to Jamila Sam and Jean-Cédric Chappelier's passion for their work and the enjoyment they derive from passing along their knowledge.

{"id": 7, "text": "Martin Odersky, an EPFL professor, wrote the Scala language by combining two opposing branches of programming. “This started out as a research project aimed at fusing two approaches – object-oriented programming and functional programming – in a third way,” said the researcher. Scala offers the best of both worlds in a modern, effective and high-level language that developers can use to concisely and elegantly express current programming models. \n The Scala language, whose name comes from scalable, is not particularly difficult and can be used for large-scale projects. It can also work alongside existing systems, something that makes it appealing for companies. All these features underpinned its success, particularly in industry: it was released in 2004 and now has over 500,000 developers worldwide. It is used by companies like Twitter, Netflix, Swisscom, the Swiss stock exchange; banks and financial institutions; and media concerns like the New York Times and Huffington Post; and Spark, the largest data science project in the past 10 years.\n To ensure this important language receives the long-term support it needs, EPFL is launching the today with the support of five partners: IBM, Goldman Sachs, Nitro, Lightbend and Verizon. The center, based at EPFL, will be devoted to improving the language. “Our main goal is to ensure that the Scala language is always freely available to everyone,” said Heather Miller, the director of the new center. EPFL will focus in particular on fine-tuning Scala as a programming tool. “EPFL must coordinate and guide developers in the open-source community in the effort to improve the language, its tools and its documentation,” said Dr. Odersky. “There are so many discoveries remaining to be made in our field, and I hope that EPFL will contribute to this in the future.”\n The Scala Center will also develop MOOCs.

{"id": 8, "text": "EPFL’s Doctoral School turns 15 this year, marking a decade and a half of courses and research programs designed specifically for PhD students. The school – modelled after PhD programs in the US – offers young engineers a comprehensive range of educational and support services. We spoke with Pierre Vandergheynst, Vice President for Education, and Andreas Mortensen, Vice President for Research and the professor who spearheaded the school’s creation, about how they set up the only doctoral school of its kind in Switzerland.\nWhy did you decide to create a doctoral school?\nAndreas Mortensen (A.M.):\n The school was a long time in the coming. Patrick Aebischer initially put forward the idea soon after he became EPFL president. Before, each EPFL lab recruited its own PhD students – sometimes just by posting an ad on the wall! And there were huge disparities in the qualifications required by each lab. So we wanted to improve the recruitment process, but also provide better support to PhD students. We especially wanted to give them an opportunity to develop skills in ways beyond just their thesis projects, as is done at US graduate schools. For the first few years that the Doctoral School was open, professors could choose whether or not to follow the new system; I’m proud to say that most of them did. Our system is the result of a decision and a collective effort, and it has stood the test of time.\nHow do you select which students to admit?\nA.M.:\n Each of our 21 PhD programs is managed separately. Students wishing to enroll in a program must submit an application that is similar to those required at US universities, complete with three letters of recommendation, their grades and their research objectives. An admissions committee reviews all the applications and decides which ones to accept. The selected students must find a thesis supervisor, obtain the necessary credits and pass an entrance exam – this process takes about a year – and then they are officially enrolled. We currently have over 2,000 PhD students, and our students typically obtain their degrees in four years.\nPierre Vandergheynst (P.V.): \nBecause our focus has been on creating a collegial atmosphere, the Doctoral School benefits everyone involved. Our professors no longer have to rely solely on their reputations to attract top PhD students, and in turn our students can count on valuable support from the school.\nWhat are the advantages of having a separate doctoral school?\nA.M.: \nWe are better equipped to recruit and instruct our students, and can continually enhance our PhD programs within a solid framework. The Doctoral School gives PhD students a community extending beyond their research lab and offers a host of activities they can take part in. What’s more, we can better detect conflict situations and spot students who are struggling – students have more people they can talk to since each one is teamed up with a mentor who is not his or her thesis supervisor.\nP.V.: \nWe’ve seen that we can attract higher quality students and share best practices more easily, whether in terms of recruitment, course planning, mentorship or guidance. Our PhD students get all-around support and form part of a vibrant community.\nHow would you define a good PhD student?\nP.V.: \nPhD research is not a 9-to-5 job. You have to be passionate about what you’re doing and willing to put in long hours. You have to enjoy coming up with solutions to open-ended problems and be very creative – while being willing and able to adapt to the world of academia.\nA.M.: \nGood PhD students are those who are highly motivated, committed to their fields and eager to push the boundaries of existing knowledge. They should be creative and have bold ideas, and they should be ready to learn how to lead a large-scale research project so that one day they can set out on their own.\nDo your graduates generally pursue careers in research? \nP.V.: \nNo, most of them leave teaching and research and go into industry. But studies have shown that salaries rise more rapidly for people with a PhD degree.\nA.M.: \nIn Switzerland – unlike in other countries – PhD degrees are recognized for their intrinsic value and not seen as a way for people to prolong their studies.\nWhat do you remember from your own thesis projects?\nP.V.: \nI did my thesis in mathematical physics at the University of Louvain. That was my first real experience conducting research and it felt like groping around in the dark for a light switch. It’s exciting to work on a problem nobody has solved, even if you hit some dead ends along the way and occasionally get things seriously wrong. For instance, I spent a year developing a theory, but then realized – after a few long days and sleepless nights – that my initial hypothesis was wrong. At that point I was glad beer is cheap in Belgium.\nA.M.:\n My thesis was in materials science, at MIT, and at one point I almost threw in the towel. I had destroyed a machine and changed my thesis topic twice. But I hung in there because I really liked my thesis supervisor – even though I didn’t see myself becoming a researcher or a teacher.

{"id": 9, "text": "Grouped together under the unassuming name φ92, a family of bacteriophage viruses has perfected its specialty: they attack salmonella and coliform bacteria. The centerpiece of their arsenal is a needle-like tip that pierces its victim’s membrane. EPFL scientists have measured this miniscule weapon; at a single nanometer, it’s roughly 20 times the diameter of a helium atom. This discovery, published in \nStructure\n, a \nCell Press\n journal, will allow researchers to better understand the attack strategy used by bacteriophages, which are being intensively studied for their therapeutic potential.\n φ92’s armor-piercing weapon is made up of three chains of identical proteins. These three long intertwined molecules form an appendage sharp enough to penetrate the bacterial membrane. This molecular needle, discovered recently in EPFL’s Laboratory of Structural Biology and Biophysics, led by Petr Leiman, appears to be characteristic of all species belonging to the φ92 family of bacteriophage viruses.\n The body of a phage is made up of two main parts. The first, a hollow head called a “capsid,” contains the genetic material. The second consists of a tube, a group of appendages resembling feet, and a device designed to penetrate the membrane of its host – the needle-like tip is at the furthest extremity of the virus.\n Phages recognize sugars and proteins on the surface of their preferred host bacteria. The virus then attaches its feet to the victim, and a complex process is set in motion. A chain of proteins uncoils, pushing the injection tube and its tip through the victim’s membrane like a hypodermic needle. The tip then detaches from the tube and, like an uncorked bottle of champagne, the pressurized genetic material in the capsid is injected into the bacterium. The phage then begins to reproduce inside its victim. \n By determining the exact structure of the tip, the EPFL scientists have filled in all the missing details in our understanding of φ92’s lethal weapon. To reach this level of detail – at most a dozen or so atoms at the extremity of the tip – they used x-ray crystallography techniques, which are of high enough resolution to determine the shape of individual molecules.\n “We managed to determine not only the size, but the complete structure of the tip as well,” explains EPFL postdoctoral researcher Christopher Browning, who is first author on the article. In addition, the researchers discovered an iron atom in the appendage. “We still are not sure what it’s used for, but to the extent that this element is toxic, we have very good reason to think that it’s not there by accident.”\n This research has implications far beyond simple biological curiosity. Bacteriophages are considered promising weapons in the fight against infectious bacteria, to complement or replace traditional antibiotics. The scientists believe the shape of the needle-like tip determines in part the bacterial species that can be attacked by a phage. \n Among the avenues being explored are incomplete bacteriophages called “pyocins,” which are naturally produced by some infected bacteria. Pyocins consist of just the injection apparatus of the virus, a kind of mechanical component, but of biological origin. They’re of interest to scientists precisely because they don’t have a capsid, and thus don’t carry genetic material, explains Browning. “These things can penetrate the bacterial membrane, which can kill the bacterium, but without injecting genetic material. That sidesteps the possibility that the phage could mutate and then attack “good” bacteria. This option is being extensively studied at the moment, but we need to understand the potential of each phage with respect to the various bacteria. The form of the tip is one of those parameters.”\n--\nThe video is created by Seyet LLC (http://www.seyet.com), Petr Leiman (EPFL) and Michael Rossmann (Purdue University) and funded by NSF (http://www.nsf.gov).\nPublication: \nChristopher Browning, Mikhail M.

{"id": 10, "text": "The apps created by Uber and its competitors put peers in touch with each other when one of them is looking for a ride. But the online platforms these companies have developed also collect users’ personal data – from passengers and drivers alike. Multiplied by millions of users each day, that comes out to be a goldmine of information, especially in the era of Big Data. Researchers from EPFL and the Faculty of Business and Economics at UNIL looked at how the same level of service could be achieved without disclosing users’ personal data. Their software, called  (O for oblivious), can be used to set up a ride where only the driver and passenger know the starting point, route and destination.\n“Ride-hailing apps like Uber have created a lot of buzz and controversy. But the issue of data protection has been less discussed,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, a professor at EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences. Some data security concerns have already been reported in the press, such as a flaw that revealed data about hundreds of drivers and – even worse – a threat by a Uber executive to dig up dirt on unfriendly journalists. The members of the project team, who are all experts on data protection, could not pass up the challenge of seeing whether it would be technically possible to keep personal data confidential in ride-hailing platforms. They will present the results of their research at two conferences in North America this summer.\nStill convenient and fast\nORide uses a cryptographic system similar to homomorphic encryption. It can carry out operations on encrypted data and get the same result as if the data was not encrypted. For example, it can add an encrypted 2 + 2 to get an encrypted 4. So when someone uses ORide to search for a driver, the system will receive encrypted location data about the passenger and the drivers who are available. It will then identify the closest drivers, and – still using encrypted data – let the passenger select a driver. Once the two app users are matched up, ORide will display the location of each one on the other’s smartphone.\nThe route that the driver takes is also coded in the users’ smartphones. The only data seen by the ride-hailing company is the distance travelled and the cost of the ride, since this information is what the company will use to take its cut of the fee and what passengers will use as a record of their travel expense. What’s more, ORide doesn’t affect the app’s convenience – passengers can still pay with their credit cards and evaluate their drivers. “Our protocol was designed not to provide complete anonymity, but to make it very hard to track the passengers’ and the drivers’ movements,” says Hubaux. The researchers also realized that their system needs to allow passengers to hunt down a lost item or provide evidence in case of a dispute with a driver. In the event of such a dispute, the data can be re-identified, but only with the agreement of the party making the complaint.\nConfidentiality: a selling point\nThe project team tested their system using public data on New York taxi drivers. They wanted to make sure in particular that the encryption protocol doesn’t slow down the process of searching for a driver. New York – whose population is roughly the same size as Switzerland’s – has just as many Uber and Lyft drivers as taxi drivers. “The encryption with a high-security key adds just a few milliseconds to the search time and doesn’t require a faster internet connection,” says Hubaux. “On the downside, ORide won’t necessarily find the closest driver, which means passengers could have to wait one or two extra minutes.”\nUber and its rivals are now free to decide whether they’re interested – especially since the researchers purposely chose not to patent their technology. “This is a highly competitive market, and confidentiality could be a selling point or a way to avoid a legal battle if a firm has to share the data it has access to with the secret services,” adds Hubaux.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping their personal data secret.", "claim": "Researchers from North America and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping their personal data secret.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 3], "noise": false}

{"id": 12, "text": "Spintronics is an emerging field of technology where devices work by manipulating the spin of electrons rather than their charge. The field can bring significant advantages to computer technology, combining higher speeds with lower energy consumption. Spintronic circuits need ways to control electron spin without interference from electron charge. Scientists at EPFL, working with Université Paris-Sud and Paul Scherrer Institut, have discovered that a common insulating material behaves as a perfect spintronic conductor because it is not affected by background electron charge. In addition, the material’s properties make it an ideal platform for directly observing a strange subatomic particle that could one day lead to a different, more stable type of quantum computers. Their work is published in \nNature Materials\n.\nSpintronics\nSpintronics (spin-transport or spin-based electronics) is a technology that exploits a quantum property of electrons called spin. Although difficult to describe in everyday terms, electron spin can be loosely compared to the rotation of a planet or a spinning top around its axis. Spin exists in either of two directions: “up” or “down”, which can be described respectively as the clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the electron around its axis. Ultimately, spin is what gives electrons their magnetic properties, influencing the way they behave when they enter a magnetic field.\nThe different directions of electron spin can be used to encode information, much like the binary code used in digital communication. Spintronics can therefore open up a new generation of devices that combine conventional microelectronics with spin-dependent effects, overcoming the limitations of today’s electronics like speed and energy consumption. The main challenge is being able to actually control electron spin, turning “up” or “down” as needed. This can be achieved with certain materials, but the problem is that these are often susceptible to interference from the charge of electrons.\nAn ideal material for spintronics\nThe team of Hugo Dil at EPFL, working with scientists from Paris and the PSI, has shown that a transparent insulating material, which normally does not conduct electrical charge, shows spin-dependent properties. The scientists used a method called SARPES, which has been perfected by Hugo Dil’s group. The data showed that the electron gas at the surface of strontium titanate (SrTiO\n3\n) is spin-polarized, which means that it could be used to control the spin of electrons.\n“This is interesting because it is the first evidence of a large spin polarization effect on a truly insulating substrate”, says Hugo Dil. The discovery has significant implications for the future of spintronics, because it can lead to the development of spin-polarized materials that are not susceptible to interference from non spin-polarized electrical charge, allowing for finer and better control of electron spin.\nA new particle for a different kind of quantum computer\nBeyond spintronics, this insulating material might also be important for quantum computing, as it could be used to directly observe an elusive, strange particle called the Majorana fermion. This particle is unique because it actually is its own antiparticle as well. Sometimes referred to as the “ghost particle”, the Majorana fermion has zero energy, zero moment, zero spin, and, so far, has never been observed unambiguously. In the future, Majorana fermions could become the foundation for a different kind of quantum computer that would, in theory, be exceptionally stable, as it would not be susceptible to external interference and noise.\n This work represents an equal collaboration between Hugo Dil’s group at EPFL (ICMP-SOIS), a group from the Université Paris-Sud (CSNSM & CNRS/IN2P3), and experts at Paul Scherrer Institut (Swiss Light Source).

This discovery was made while looking for ways to improve the conductivity of , which are used as electrolytes in . The peculiarity of these liquids is that they contain only ions and no neutral solvent molecule. Evaporation of the liquid and its degradation are, thus, prevented.\nIn the belief that viscosity was limiting the capacity of the medium to let current flow through it, the scientists studied its conduction properties between its solid state, cooled to –93°C, and its liquid state, at room temperature. They were very surprised to discover that more than twenty degrees below the melting point, the conduction was almost identical to that of the liquid. This observation, contrasting with the existing model of mobile electrical charges, demanded further research.\nThe phenomenon was therefore studied in more details by applying terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The resulting measurements enabled the detection of the vibrations of the ions, as well as their way to associate with each other. This achievement was made possible thanks to ultra-short laser pulses that generate THz radiation, which lies between the infrared and the microwave frequency range. This radiation has the property of interacting with mobile electrical charges and low-frequency vibrations of the matter.\nIt was thus possible to observe in an ionic liquid, containing iodide and triiodide ions, a bond-exchange phenomenon. In this scenario, an iodide ion (I-) binds to a neighboring triiodide (I3-) ion, while at the other end of the chain a bond is broken and a new I- ion is liberated. This mechanism governing the displacement of electrical charges only implies back-and-forth movements over very short distances, of the order of 3 angstroms, and does not require the transport of ions over longer ranges. Thanks to the bond-exchange between ions, electrical conduction remains efficient, even in viscous liquids and at very low temperature.\nA similar mechanism was suggested by  at the beginning of the 19th century to explain the conductivity of water, but had never been demonstrated for an ionic liquid.\nThis breakthrough opens up a new field of research. It paves the way towards interesting and innovative applications, for instance in the design of more stable and efficient third-generation solar cells and of new high-capacity batteries.\nLinks:", "summary": "Electrolytes are usually conducting media, in which charged ions move freely in a solvent.

{"id": 14, "text": "Most modern buildings are composed of several layers of materials, each with its own important function: the concrete core supports its weight; the insulation regulates its heat exchange; the facade contributes to its aesthetics. Now, engineers at EPFL are developing a single building block that does all of that, and produces electricity. This new component will provide a sleek alternative to traditional construction materials, and will be lighter, safer, and more energy efficient.\n“We use a composite sandwich construction to make this multi-functional building element,” explains Thomas Keller of the Composite Construction Laboratory (CCLab). The sandwich comprises a dense foam interior encased between layers of glass-fibre reinforced polymer. “We started working on these composite materials over 10 years ago and used them in 2009 for the roof of the Main Entrance Building at the Novartis Campus in Basel, Switzerland,” he says.\nAnd now, with funding from, they are trying to add electricity generation to the mix. “Now our goal is to encapsulate a thin flexible sheet of photovoltaic cells beneath a translucent layer of glass fiber reinforced polymer,” he continues. If they succeed, this material could contribute to making solar panels more attractive to architects by offering them more flexibility than traditional construction materials based on reinforced concrete, rigid solar panels, and glass.\nThe solar cell technology comes from Flexcell, a startup from IMT Neuchâtel (since 2009 part of EPFL), that became famous for its flexible sheets of photovoltaic cells. Despite lower efficiencies than conventional photovoltaic cells, their light weight, small volume, and low production costs make them ideal for encapsulation into building elements. And the ease of fitting curved surfaces with them will open new avenues in sustainable architectural design.\nOn top of that there are the other, already demonstrated advantages of these lightweight sandwich components. Prefabrication means that they can be assembled in a factory under ideal conditions before being transported to the construction site, increasing the quality and the safety of the buildings and shortening construction times. And since they are modular, individual elements are easy to repair or to replace if they fail.\nPerfecting the ingredients\n The glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) plays a double role in this sandwich. A layer of GFRP a few millimeters thick encases the foam core, giving the building block its remarkable stability. Another layer of it encapsulates and protects the solar cells, drawing on an interesting optical property of the GFRP: when applied thinly, it is almost as transparent as glass, with an optical transmittance only four percent lower. Currently, a PhD student at the CCLab is perfecting this layer’s thickness to find the best compromise between structural stability and optical translucence.\n“Besides the optical issues,” says Keller, “we are dealing with temperature related issues. Heating the resin leads to a loss of efficiency in light transmission. Beyond a certain critical temperature, the material could degrade and fail to recover its original state when it cools down.” But so far it has withstood temperatures beyond those expected even in the hotter parts of the world, without showing signs of degradation.\nNot yet two years in to the project, the scientists involved are optimistic. Solar electricity generation is here to stay, and considering the widespread use of curved concrete surfaces in contemporary architecture, there could be great potential for this new solar sandwich.", "summary": "All in one: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at EPFL", "claim": "All in only four percent: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at EPFL", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 4], "noise": false}
{"id": 15, "text": "Neurons are brain cells that communicate with each other by sending electrochemical signals along axons. When a neuron is about to release a signal – in the form of an electric charge – it allows ions to pass through its membrane via ion channels. This ion transfer creates an electrical potential difference between the inside and outside of the cell, and that difference is referred to as the membrane potential.\nA team of researchers at the  within EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI) has come up with a way to monitor changes in membrane potential and to observe ion fluxes by studying the behavior of the water molecules surrounding the membranes of the neurons. The researchers, who successfully tested their method on \nin vitro\n mouse neurons, have just published their findings in \nNo more electrodes or fluorophores\nA better understanding of the electrical activity of neurons could provide insight into a number of processes taking place in our brains. For example, scientists could see whether a neuron is active or resting, or if it is responding to drug treatment. Up until now, the only way to monitor neurons was by injecting fluorophores into, or attaching electrodes onto, the part of the brain being studied – but membrane potential sensitive fluorophores are toxic, and electrodes can damage the neurons.\nRecently, the LBP researchers developed a way of tracking electrical activity in neurons simply by looking at the interactions between water molecules and the neural membranes. “Neurons are surrounded by water molecules, which change orientation in the presence of an electric charge,” says Sylvie Roke, director of the LBP. “When the membrane potential changes, the water molecules will re-orient – and we can observe that.”\nIn their study, the researchers altered the neuronal membrane potential by subjecting the neurons to a rapid influx of potassium ions. This caused the ion channels on the neurons’ surface – which serve to regulate the membrane potential – to open and let the ions through. The researchers then turned off the flow of ions, and the neurons released the ions that they had picked up.\nIn order to monitor this activity, the researchers probed the hydrated neuronal lipid membranes by illuminating the cells with two laser beams of the same frequency. These beams consist of femtosecond laser pulses -using technology for which the 2018 Nobel prize in physics was awarded- so that the water molecules on the interface of the membrane generate photons with a different frequency, known as second-harmonic light.\n“We see both fundamental and applied implications of our research. Not only can it help us understand the mechanisms that the brain uses to send information, but it could also appeal to pharmaceutical companies interested in \nin vitro\n product testing,” adds Roke. “And we have now shown that we can analyze a single neuron or any number of neurons at a time.”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a method to observe the electrical activity of neurons by analyzing the behavior of surrounding water molecules.

{"id": 16, "text": "Mission accomplished! The CHEOPS satellite, named for “CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite,” successfully blasted off into space on Wednesday after a technical fault with the carrier rocket pushed the launch back by 24 hours. The satellite, which will search for planets orbiting around distant stars, is now flying along its planned path, some 700 km above the Earth’s surface. CHEOPS is the culmination of six years of work, much of which was carried out at the University of Bern and University of Geneva, in collaboration with researchers from EPFL’s Space Center (eSpace) and with support from the European Space Agency (ESA). The launch comes seven days after two astrophysicists from the University of Geneva – Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz – received the Nobel Prize in Physics in Stockholm for their 1995 discovery of the first exoplanet.\nThe satellite, which is equipped with a high-precision telescope, will seek out new exoplanets by looking for tiny variations in a star’s brightness as a planet passes between it and Earth – a method known as transit photometry. CHEOPS will also gather more information about known exoplanets, including their size, orbital elements, atmosphere and evolution, as well as their composition and nature: telluric, gas, ice giant, surface water and other features.\nEPFL involved from the outset\nThe project was a collaborative effort between three Swiss institutions: EPFL, the University of Geneva and the University of Bern. Engineers at eSpace were involved in the early phases of the mission, and worked on the satellite’s initial design. In 2012 the ESA selected CHEOPS, based on that initial design, as its first small-class (or S-class) mission, a type of smaller-scale program intended to promote innovation and education. From that point on, EPFL’s involvement largely revolved around designing the software that would be used to analyze the raw data sent back by the satellite.\nSince the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995, over 4,000 more have been added to the list – orbiting around some 3,000 stars, and all within 400 light years of the Sun. Thousands of other candidates have been detected, mainly by ground-based telescopes, but are pending confirmation. Extrapolating these numbers suggests that there could be at least 100 billion exoplanets in our galaxy alone.\nCHEOPS separated from its carrier rocket around 2 hours and 30 minutes after launch and is expected to begin sending back data in early 2020.\nPicture: (c)ESA", "summary": "The CHEOPS satellite was put into orbit on Wednesday, a day later than planned, from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.

{"id": 17, "text": "Can a home run entirely on solar facades? Apparently so, according to NeighborHub, a house designed and built for the 2017 Solar Decathlon by Swiss students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg (HEIA-FR), the Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD Genève) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR). With NeighborHub, the students wanted to show that it makes both practical and economic sense to install solar panels on a home’s facade – thereby maximizing the surface area put to use – even though sunlight can sometimes struggle to penetrate urban areas. “Unlike rooftops, facades are more likely to be in the shade since other buildings can block the sunlight,” says Philippe Couty, the engineer coordinating the project for HEIA-FR. “That could sharply reduce the amount of power that solar panels generate. But we wanted to show that solar energy can indeed be produced on facades, even in areas packed with a lot of buildings.” The project team went about searching for technology that could prove them right. Peter Cuony, head of solar power systems at Groupe E Connect and a member of the project team from the very beginning, came up with the idea of using power optimizers. The students found that these optimizers fit the bill perfectly, and they installed one in each panel to continuously monitor and adjust the solar panels’ performance.\nMaximizing each panel’s output\n In conventional solar power systems, the panels are connected in series, which means each one can generate only as much energy as the lowest-producing one. Power inverters, taking their cue from the least productive panel, convert the direct current into the alternating current that the home can use. But this method can be a major handicap for the efficiency of solar panels installed on building facades, since the weakest link (e.g. the most shaded panel) could pull down the entire system’s power generation. And that was exactly what happened before the power optimizers were installed on each panel. “Even if each panel has a different level of sun exposure and consequently generates a different amount of energy, the optimizers draw on the instantaneous maximum power generation of each panel, regardless of how much sunlight they do – or don’t – receive,” says Victor Saadé, an EPFL electrical engineering student who is leading the project group responsible for solar panels.\nAchieving energy independence\n Thanks to this novel way of using existing technology, NeighborHub can run entirely on the power generated from its facade-installed solar panels. It even generates more energy than it needs. What’s more, its rooftop remains free for other purposes, like promoting biodiversity – the space can be used to cultivate a variety of plants.\nThe energy independence achieved by the one-story house offers encouraging prospects for residential buildings. Each story could generate enough power for its own needs. That could be a major benefit for cities that are growing vertically.\n“Our house demonstrates that it is possible to produce enough energy for an entire building using solar panels installed only on the building facades,” says Cuony.\nNeighborHub’s open house next Saturday will give the public a unique opportunity to check out the next-generation house before it heads off to the Solar Decathlon competition, which will be held in Denver from 5 to 15 October 2017.\nNeighborHub open house at a glance\n “\nNeighborHub ready to head off to the United States\n”\n Saturday, 10 June 2017, 10am to 5pm\n Smart Living Lab, Halle bleue, blueFACTORY, Passage du Cardinal 13B, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland\n Free of charge, no sign-up required\n Learn more at\nThe project is supported by the following partners:\nThree public-sector partners: Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Canton of Fribourg, City of Fribourg and Smart Living Lab\nAnd the following private partners: Groupe E and Landolt & Cie SA, JPF-Ducret, Régent SA, La Mobilière and Setimac", "summary": "EPFL, in association with the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design and the University of Fribourg, is taking part in the 2017 international Solar Decathlon competition.

{"id": 18, "text": "Today’s consumers want a cleaner, greener society. There are a number of concepts out there addressing this goal, such as green economy, green growth, sustainable development, bioeconomy and circular economy. These terms have even been adopted by non-profit organizations, lobbies and international organizations for use in their names and initiatives. But that doesn’t necessarily mean we’re all clear on exactly what these concepts mean. At least that’s according to a recent study carried out at EPFL. The research, published this month in \nJournal of Cleaner Production\n, looked specifically at the concept of the green economy. Scientists compared 140 definitions found in journal articles (117) and white papers (23) published over the past ten years. 95 of these definitions were of “green economy” and 45 of “green growth,” a similar term that is often used as a synonym. \nThe concept of a green economy first appeared in the scientific literature in the 1990s but didn’t really gain traction until 2008 – in the wake of the global financial crisis – especially in political and academic circles. The United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were also major drivers of this trend. “The number of journal articles published on this topic every year went from zero in 2008 to 200 in 2018,” says Albert Merino-Saum, the study’s lead author and a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS). But the problem is that each article has its own definition of what the green economy is. While everyone seems to agree that a green economy is based on various social, economic and technological factors, the way each one is described and the importance given to each one can vary from one study to the next.\n“We were surprised to see that all these articles were being published without referring to a seminal study or benchmark paper giving a clear definition of ‘green economy.’ That’s highly unusual for scientific research, where people first try to establish a common conceptual basis. So in our study we aimed to clarify the term and thereby help policymakers evaluate different options in view of the consequences,” says Merino-Saum.\nThree conceptual families\n The first step was to establish a framework of around 40 conceptual elements for evaluating the 140 definitions. The scientists found that the definitions could be grouped into three main families. The first is what they call “econocentric,” or focused on economic factors like trade and finance to achieve environmental and social goals. “This family is closest to the idea of ‘green growth,’ except that discussions of green growth generally don’t account for the fact that natural resources are limited,” says Merino-Saum. The second family focuses more heavily on human well-being. Here the emphasis is on reducing inequality in the distribution of wealth and access to natural resources. The third family sees science and technology as a solution for environmental problems and a vector for sustainable economic growth. “Going forward, we’d like to see journal articles start by stating which ‘green economy’ conceptual family they are referring to,” says Merino-Saum. \nAn idea on its way out? \n But that assumes that the green economy concept is here to stay. Some people think it’s merely a fad that will soon go out of fashion. “Right now we’re seeing a lot of articles about the ‘circular economy.’ From 2008 to 2018, the number of these articles has swelled from zero per year to 800, with a sharp rise in 2015,” says Merino-Saum. This surge could be due in part to reports issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has become a thought leader on the topic, and to the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan. Merino-Saum believes that the green economy concept will only last if researchers make a clear distinction between it and its cousin, sustainable development – such as the fact that the former is more practice-oriented. One sign that ‘green economy’ could be on the way out is its rejection by the UN, which, in its 2030 Agenda, talks about 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe irony isn’t lost on Merino-Saum that the terms coming in and out of fashion relate to sustainability. “Of course, some of the terms are only used for green washing,” he says bluntly, “but most of them are genuinely intended to spur a transition to a more sustainable society.” According to Merino-Saum, the keys are: using the right indicators to measure how effectively concepts are being implemented, and adapting implementation to the actual conditions in a given situation. For instance, priorities like access to water, water quality and access to healthcare can differ from one country – or region – to the next. Now that this study is finished, Merino-Saum and his team plan to dissect some other concepts. Next up? ‘Smart cities’ and ‘urban sustainability.’", "summary": "Concerns about climate change have given rise to a whole series of concepts that are widely used despite their lack of a concrete definition.

The inner image shows two mitochondrial haplotypes: green linked to low food intake and red to high food intake. Credit: Maria Litovchenko/Roel Bevers\nMany of the characteristics that make people so different from each other, are often the result of small differences in the DNA between individuals. Variation in just a single base in our DNA can cause significant variation in traits like sleep length, weight, height etc. And, unfortunately, they can also become a source of disease.\nTo confidently connect variation within a gene or genome (what biologists call “genotypes”) and variation in traits (“phenotypes”), scientists ideally need standardized genetic tools. One of these is the \nDrosophila\n Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), which consists of more than 200 lines of the fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster\n. Each line in the DGRP has had its genome fully sequenced so that scientists can spot differences between genotypes and then connect these to differences between phenotypes of interest.\nMost of the DNA in eukaryotic cells – the cells that make up higher organisms like fruit flies and humans – sits tightly packed inside the cell’s nucleus. But almost all eukaryotic cells also have mitochondria, an organelle often referred to as the “powerhouse of the cell”. Mitochondria are unique in that they have their own DNA with its own distinct set of genes.\nStudies have hinted that variation in mitochondrial genes is associated with diseases like obesity, type-2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. The problem is that, unlike “regular” genes in nuclear genomes, we actually know very little about how variation in mitochondrial genes relates to variation in phenotypes.\nThis is what Roel Bevers and Maria Litovchenko from  at EPFL have addressed in a paper published in \nNature Metabolism\n. The researchers carried out a comprehensive study connecting variation in mitochondrial DNA with various traits in DGRP fruit-fly lines. The findings can be incorporated into future genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to gain more detailed information about how variation in genes – nuclear and mitochondrial, and their interactions – affect various traits and diseases.\n“So far, DGRP studies have mostly focused on genetic variants in the nucleus because of low mitochondrial DNA coverage,” says Deplancke. “In this study, we wanted to investigate the impact of mitochondrial DNA variation on traits in these fly lines.”\nHis team re-sequenced mitochondrial genomes of 169 DGRP fruit-fly lines, which allowed them to identify 231 gene variants. They then looked at “mitochondrial DNA haplotypes”, which are groups of variants which are always inherited together, identifying 12 distinct haplotypes among the studied fly lines.\nInterestingly, these haplotypes were found to be associated with a range of metabolic phenotypes and diseases. “We found many links to stress- and metabolism-related traits, including food intake in males,” says Deplancke. To confirm this, the researchers swapped mitochondrial genomes between fruit fly lines, which actually changed the eating behavior of males: the mitochondrial haplotype associated with high food intake could increase food intake in fly lines that initially displayed a low food-intake.\nThe work can help future studies by providing a higher resolution to connect genes and traits, e.g. feeding behavior. “There is important mitochondrial haplotype-specific metabolic variation in the DGRP,” conclude the authors. “This demonstrates the importance of incorporating such haplotypes in genotype-phenotype relationship studies.”\nOther contributors\nEPFL (Laboratory of Integrative Systems Physiology)\nSwiss Institute of Bioinformatics\nUniversity of Lausanne (Complex Trait Genetics Group, Robinson Lab)", "summary": "To uncover the relationship between variation in genes and phenotypic diversity, geneticists use a set of fully sequenced fruit-fly genomes.

High-precision technology is used in numerous space instruments, EPFL’s CleanSpace One satellite project is aimed at one day cleaning up space debris, and Swiss chocolate has now been sent into space. Each of the six astronauts* currently serving on the International Space Station (ISS) has received a box with six brand-name chocolate bars. They were included in the latest resupply mission, which was carried by a SpaceX rocket launched on 8 April. The special delivery, sponsored by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), was carefully prepared by the Swiss Space Center (SSC), at EPFL. As a thank you, the British astronaut Tim Peake sent a picture yesterday.\n“This initiative was undertaken as part of Switzerland’s co-presidency of the European Space Agency Ministerial Council,” said Volker Gass, the director of the SSC. “The aim is to encourage and support the astronauts in their work in a symbolic way that reflects our country’s spirit and culture.”\nBut sending food into space is no cakewalk. As for any object or person preparing to leave Earth’s atmosphere, strict conditions must be met.

The weight of the boxes had to be minimized as well, which was done by removing all unnecessary paper and cardboard. And the manufacturer had to provide a full and detailed list of ingredients, thus revealing part of its trade secret.\nNo sharp corners\nThe boxes were then sent to the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), in the Netherlands, whose work includes testing satellites and their sub-systems by simulating the conditions they will experience when launched and once in space.\n“All objects going to the ISS have to undergo testing to ensure they are not flammable, do not produce fragments that could spread around the cabin, and cannot injure the astronauts,” said Bernd Rattenbacher, from the Center of Competence in Aerospace Biomedical Science & Technology at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\nESTEC’s main task was to ensure that the boxes did not have any sharp corners or edges presenting a risk of injury. Once approved, the boxes were sent to the Aerospace Logistics Technology Engineering Company (ALTEC), another ESA center, in Italy. There, the contents of the package were verified and the customs documentation was completed. The package was finally sent to NASA, which delivered it to the ISS from the Cape Canaveral launch site in Florida.\nThe latest word was that it took 10 days after launch for the chocolates to reach the hands of the astronauts, who were busy unpacking three tons of food, equipment and scientific experiments included in the latest resupply mission.

{"id": 23, "text": "Mapping a construction site, landscape, cityscape or mine, monitoring industrial sites, managing agricultural land… The drone developed by senseFly, the result of 6 years of research in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL, facilitates the work of experts across various fields. Equipped with an autopilot and a miniature high-definition camera, it is used by hundreds of professionals worldwide. This start-up installed at the gates of EPFL hopes to increase its sales tenfold in the next years and create dozens of new jobs in the field of airborne drones. It does so thanks to an investment of 5 million Swiss Francs from the publicly traded French company Parrot, making them a majority shareholder in senseFly.\nsenseFly drones demonstrate the full extent of their capabilities when combined with software developed by Pix4D, a spin-off of EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB). The algorithms developed by Pix4D make it possible to assemble hundreds of aerial pictures and, within minutes, to get an extremely accurate 3D and geo-referenced image of the observed terrain. This young company based at EPFL’s Science Park is also of interest to Parrot, which invested 2.4 million Swiss Francs for a minority share in Pix4D. “In the 1980’s the algorithms were really unreliable, and I was convinced it would take well over thirty years to become the basis of fully-automated, reliable and useful commercial products. This is a wonderful example of how curiosity-driven research, for example the ability of a human to make sense of the world around him through what he sees, eventually led to useful results,” said Pascal Fua, director of the CVLAB.\nLike an Insect\nUsing one of senseFly’s small high-performance drones is a breeze. The course can be programmed with software pre-flight and still be modified throughout the flight’s duration. No runway necessary: three movements back-and-forth are enough to start the engine, and the 500-gram wing takes off. The drone reaches a cruising speed of 40 km/h to autonomously map areas ranging from a few hectares to several square kilometers in one flight, with a resolution ranging from 3 to 30 cm/pixel depending on the distance above ground. Within a maximum of thirty minutes, the drone returns to its starting point without further assistance. All that is necessary for the next mission is to change the battery.\nThe technology on which these devices are based was created in 2001, when a team of robotics researchers in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) at EPFL began to investigate the strategies of control and navigation in flying insects. Early research led to the development of an integrated autopilot using intelligent control strategies similar to that of flies and bees. “By 2008 it was included in an ultra-light flying wing, which incorporated all the advantages of insects: efficient, elegant, light, elemental and intelligent,” recalls Jean-Christophe Zufferey, founder and CEO of senseFly. “I am very pleased that our robotic flying insect has not only helped to elucidate biological issues, but has also been able to promote the socio-economic development of our region by creating dozens of new high-value jobs. In collaboration with the newly created National Competence Center in Robotics, senseFly contributes to making EPFL and the surrounding region an important center for artificial intelligence and robotics,” says Dario Floreano, director of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and of the National Competence Center in Robotics.\nWhile the legislation for the usage of drones is being discussed in most countries, the low mass and speed of these ultra-light drones gives them a unique advantage by limiting the potential damage they could cause and thereby favored for civilian use.\nEPFL’s Pole of Expertise in Civilian Drones\nParrot, a global leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones, has recently invested in drones for the consumer market. It has released a Wi-Fi controllable quadricopter, of which it has sold more than 300,000 since its launch in 2010. The collaboration with the French group will create synergies for both EPFL start-ups.\nThe increasing need of data for Geographical Information Systems (GIS), such as Google Earth & Street View, should drive the market of ultra-light professional civilian drones to one billion dollars by 2020. The combination of senseFly trouble-free hardware, Pix4D’s unique mapping software and Parrot high volume manufacturing expertise provide the key elements to address this fast emerging market. Furthermore, the collaborations with the National Competence Centers (www.nccr-robotics.ch & www.MICS.org), both managed by EPFL, provide a heart to this internationally recognized center of expertise in civilian UAV technologies.\nSenseFly, founded in 2009 in “Le Garage”, EPFL’s incubator, will remain in the region and its management team will stay at the helm. “We can benefit from the technological expertise of Parrot, from its externalized industrial organization and its financial strength to accelerate our worldwide distribution,” said Jean-Christophe Zufferey, senseFly CEO. This strategic investment will give the French company access to the expertise and the technology for specialized drones.\nAs for Pix4D, created in 2011, Parrot’s investment enables the exploration of new business horizons. “This reinforces our position as a leader in software for professional drones,” adds Christoph Strecha, the company’s CEO.", "summary": "The French company Parrot, world leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones and already in the market for consumer drones, acquired for 5 million Swiss Francs a majority share in senseFly, a start-up from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL.

The IAEA is the world's central inter-governmental forum for scientific and technical co-operation in the nuclear field. It works for the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, contributing to international peace and security and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. For its work, the IAEA won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.\nThe IAEA endorses the EPFL for spearheading the creation of an international network of industries and research institutions that will develop an advanced, open-source simulation platform for the analysis of nuclear reactors. “This will be a unique opportunity to work on a major paradigm shift in the nuclear sector towards open, collaborative, and efficient R&D,” says Carlo Fiorina, the main initiator of this activity and a researcher at EPFL’s , headed by Professor Andreas Pautz.\nThe need for a new development strategy in the nuclear sector comes from its ever more stringent safety requirements, but also from the vibrant worldwide research activities dedicated to the development of new nuclear technologies for CO\n2\n-free energy generation, production of medical radioisotopes, incineration of existing nuclear waste, water desalination, and hydrogen production.\nThe EPFL Collaborating Centre’s objective will be to step beyond traditional development strategies, which are based on relatively old and often proprietary software and data. At the core of the Centre’s activities will be the promotion of R&D work fostering the concepts of open-source and shared development. This will boost R&D activities and contribute to a safe operation of nuclear plants by increasing synergies, limiting inefficiencies, promoting networking, and contributing to standardization.\nIn addition to leading this international effort, EPFL will produce new, open, and high-quality validation data at its . “This is an exciting chance to use our unique facility to bring about a real impact in the nuclear sector,” says Pavel Frajtag, who heads the reactor.\nThe open software and experimental data produced during the project will be distributed to the IAEA member states.

{"id": 25, "text": "Today’s “intelligent” cars, equipped with multiple sensors and algorithms, can react to emergency situations, regulate speed, assist with parking and respond to voice commands. But they don’t know who’s at the wheel or how that driver is feeling. The face is a valuable source of this information, and a project initiated by EPFL’s Transportation Center involving EPFL’s Signal Processing 5 Laboratory (LTS5) and PSA Peugeot Citroën aims to mine it for use in the automobiles of the future.\nFace-related technologies have progressed rapidly in recent years, and are used in many areas. Facial recognition is used in real time to relay the exact position of an individual, and eye-tracking devices indicate the direction in which he or she is looking. Analyzing the movements of the head and eyes can also indicate a state of fatigue or sleepiness. EPFL’s LTS5 and its start-up, nViso, are conducting research into capturing facial expressions and exploring the wide range of possible scientific, behavioral and commercial applications that the technology offers.\nTechnological challenges\nThe scientists had to tackle the challenge of adapting the technology for use in cars. “Our goal is to build the technological base to detect and situate a driver’s face at any moment in time,” explains LTS5 director Jean-Philippe Thiran. “Using this tool, it will then be possible to build and test various driver assistance applications such as eye tracking, fatigue detection, lip reading, and so on.”\n“With this study we are trying to make the interface between the car and the driver more intuitive; reading intentions from facial features is a very natural interactive mode,” adds Olivier Pajot, PSA Peugeot Citroën’s representative on the EPFL campus.\nThe instrument, developed using a prototyping platform provided by the French car manufacturer, is currently operational, although the research is still far from finished. Vehicles impose a number of specific limitations, beginning with the question of where to place the camera. It cannot obstruct the driver’s field of vision. “One of the possible options is to place it behind the steering wheel, which would require a system that’s quick enough to recapture the face detection after the arms of the steering wheel interrupt it,” explains Thiran. Another issue is adapting to changing lighting conditions, in order to track the driver’s face as the car goes into a tunnel, for example, or when driving into a setting sun. And, finally, the tool must perform as well when the driver is facing it as when she turns her head to the side.\nImproving performance\n“We are currently working on improving the system’s performance, particularly by increasing the number of images processed,” continues Thiran. “The next step is to test it in realistic conditions. PSA Peugeot Citroën will install the platform on a car and our lab will test the system under various application scenarios.”\nPSA Peugeot Citroën opened an office in EPFL’s Innovation Square in summer 2011, with the goal of collaborating on research and innovation projects.

Which routines will they keep once the lockdown is over? Which people are suffering most from this unprecedented situation? In order to better understand how Swiss residents are coping with the lockdown, researchers from EPFL, Idiap and UNIL have created . \nIn addition to asking a series of questions, the survey displays emergency phone numbers, options for online chats and links to useful websites and videos in order to provide support resources to people who are distressed, bored or suffering from domestic violence. The survey results will be used to identify the inequalities that are arising in the face of the pandemic and to develop coordinated and collaborative strategies to avoid them in the future, should a similar situation arise. \nThe survey takes around 15 minutes and is designed to get a better idea of what types of housing and living conditions make people more mentally resilient – or susceptible – to the lockdown. For instance, are women taking on more of the household chores and childcare responsibilities? If so, to what extent, under what conditions and predominantly in which areas of Switzerland? Which people feel loneliest? Which people are the least informed about existing support networks? \nCitizen research\nAt the end of the survey, participants can leave their email address if they would like to use a new application called Civique App (available on iPhone and Android). The app will enable them to report on how they are adapting week after week by sending in text messages, remarks from friends and family, and photos of individual spaces serving as home office, gym and school at the same time. The developers are using the app to create citizen research groups. By leaving their email address, participants will also have the option of scheduling a video conference where they can discuss their feelings, situation and coping mechanisms in more detail with a psychosociological expert. Once all the data are collected – on people’s emotions, creative ways of adapting and overall experience – they will provide policymakers with valuable information on Swiss residents’ basic needs and how emergency response measures can be better targeted, whether in the short-term for this crisis or to help anticipate future ones.\nInterdisciplinary cooperation\nThe researchers taking part in this cross-disciplinary initiative are Claudia Binder, a full professor at EPFL and head of EPFL’s Laboratory on Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS); Ulli Vilsmaier, a visiting professor at HERUS; Livia Fritz, a post-doc researcher at HERUS; Anna Pagani, a PhD student at HERUS; Daniel Gatica-Perez, an adjunct professor at Idiap and at EPFL’s Digital Humanities Institute; Vincent Kaufmann, associate professor and head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR); Laurie Daffe and Garance Clément, post-doc researchers at LASUR; and Marie Santiago Delefosse, a full professor at UNIL’s Institute of Psychology.\nContacts\nFor English and German \n Claudia Binder, full professor, EPFL; Tel.: +41 21 693 93 62; Email:  \nFor English and French\n Marie Santiago Delefosse, full professor, UNIL; Tel.: +41 21 692 31 11; Email:  \n Vincent Kaufmann, associate professor, EPFL; Tel.: +41 21 693 62 29; Email:", "summary": "A new nationwide study being conducted jointly by EPFL, the Idiap Research Institute and the University of Lausanne (UNIL) aims to understand the emotional effects of the lockdown on Swiss residents and what steps they are taking to cope with it.

{"id": 27, "text": "“The status quo on the software market needs to change, explains Viktor Kuncak, Associate Professor at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences' . All too often, developers adopt a software patch strategy for products that are already being sold on the market!” And yet there are tools out there that can improve the reliability of software before products reach consumers. Moreover, these tools are already widely used for hardware development. “Once a microchip has been manufactured, it’s too late to fix an error.” In fact, the later an error is detected, the more expensive it becomes to fix it.” Greater software reliability can also bring benefits to many different areas such as aviation or medical equipment, making them more reliable. \nViktor Kuncak and post-doctoral researcher Andrew Reynolds are currently working to develop automatic software verification tools. Just like a mathematical demonstration seeks to prove that an affirmation may be true for a given set of values, software verification is aimed at ensuring that a function will not cause a crash or produce an outlier for the full range of possible user entries or actions.\nIf there is one tool that mathematicians regularly use, it is mathematical induction. This method consists of proving that a theorem holds true for a given natural number (n) and that what is true for n is also true for the natural number that follows (n+1). Once this has been done, one must also prove the validity of the theorem for the smallest natural number: 0. This form of demonstration was previously not possible with an SMT solver (satisfiability modulo theories), which is an essential component of automatic software verification. The two researchers have now managed to overcome this obstacle, developing an approach that allows one to automatically use mathematical induction in a constraint resolution process. The code input language to be verified is Scala, “we chose it because of its similarity with mathematical formulations and reasoning,” explains Viktor Kuncak.\nApart from the computerization of mathematical induction, this approach is also remarkable because it breaks down tasks. “Whenever a verification cannot be executed directly, our tool breaks the problem down into sub-problems that it may be able to resolve. When there is a known path, this path will be used. Otherwise, other paths will be explored and a new breakdown may be performed, thereby allowing a large number of potential problem-solving pathways to be explored, explains Viktor Kuncak.\nAlthough the EPFL researchers are more specifically interested in potential applications to software verification, advances in the area of automated mathematical proofs can also benefit other fields. “The primary focus of SMT solvers has been for problems faced by industry (including software verification). Only more recently have SMT solvers been used for solving more difficult problems, which would include solving open mathematical problems. So far, this has been somewhat limited, but is starting to become more common,” states Andrew Reynolds. “One project along these lines is the TPTP library of problems pursued by the University of Miami. The use of SMT solvers such as the one I work on (CVC4) has led to solving several previously unsolved problems in this library.”\nThe approaches that the EPFL researchers are focused on are interesting both in terms of success rates and speed of execution. What are the limits of this tool? “It’s a bit like having a brilliant student,” explains Viktor Kuncak, “We cannot ascertain the theoretical limits but empirically, we have observed that the tool has more difficulty handling certain formulas than others,” The research conducted with Andrew Reynolds at the EPFL began in 2014. “We have obtained good results in only a few months, notes Viktor Kuncak. The EPFL has a certain lead in this field and we hope to consolidate this position.”", "summary": "It is possible to test computer programs using tools borrowed from mathematicians and their famous demonstrations.

The “Deep Artificial Composer” could one day generate convincing music for multiple instruments in real time, with applications ranging from video games to helping composers in the creative process. What’s new with the DAC is that the artificial intelligence learns to compose complete melodies without any music theory from start to finish, solely based on a large database of existing music. No human postproduction is necessary.\n19.07.17 - Scientists from NCCR Robotics at EPFL and at the Lausanne University Hospital developed an algorithm that adjusts how a mobile harness, suspended from the ceiling, assists patients suffering from spinal cord injury or stroke. In a clinical study with over 30 patients, the scientists showed that the patients wearing the smart walking assist immediately improved their locomotor abilities, enabling them to perform activities of daily living that would not be possible without the support.\n31.07.17 - Scientists at the Lab of Andrea Ablasser have now discovered that a DNA-sensing mechanism of the innate immune system — which is pivotal for the immediate defense against pathogens — controls cellular senescence. The work highlights potential novel anti-tumor and perhaps anti-ageing strategies.\n23.08.17 - A researcher at the Ecological Systems Laboratory discovered a sustainable method for improving the slash-and-burn farming practices traditionally used in Madagascar, whereby a wooded area is burned to create a field for growing crops. Slash-and-burn farming also plays a role in the island’s deforestation. The environmental engineering student spent two years conducting tests in two villages in the southwest of the country. The fruit of her labors is a socially responsible and environmentally friendly system that involves generating compost and refurbishing water wells.\n04.09.17 - More than 5,000 visitors came on EPFL's campus for three days to attend the EPFL Drone Days. Drones races certainly, but research and innovation were also in the spotlight with booths presenting the drones of the future, an exhibition of robotics, conferences, demonstrations and workshops for young and old. Switzerland’s fastest drone pilot was crowned following a spectacular race.\n12.09.17 - A new drone, developed at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems with funding of NCCR Robotics, uses cutting-edge technology to deliver parcels weighing up to 500 grams. The device will never get stuck in traffic, it’s programmed to avoid obstacles, and it can reach destinations on steep or uneven terrain. Its protective cage and foldable design mean that it can be carried around in a backpack and used in total safety.\n13.09.17 - Many cancers are known to metastasize and spread by expanding nearby lymphatic vessels. This process, lymphangiogenesis, also helps the tumor evade the patient’s own immune system, and it would be expected that inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, which are only effective in a minority of patients. But scientists from EPFL and the US found the opposite: lymphangiogenesis actually enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy against melanoma. The study has significant implications for new types of cancer therapies.\n15.10.17 - The Swiss team and their solar house, the NeighborHub, has won the prestigious Solar Decathlon 2017 competition in the Unites States. The Swiss Living Challenge and its multidisciplinary team - 4 schools, 250 students (44 in Denver), 150 supervisors from the professional and academic sectors, and close to 50 sponsors - received the highest award. This unique experience is not only an important victory, but also an unforgettable and educational human adventure. The Swiss team made the audacious bet of coming up with a different concept, proposing a house at the service of a community, rather than a family home. \n17.10.17 - Given the growing number of users and the widening range of devices, streaming is no longer viable in its current form owing to the substantial amount of power and storage capacity it requires. But researchers at EPFL’s Embedded Systems Laboratory have found a way to reduce those requirements without impacting the quality of the video itself. \n31.10.17 - Paraplegics suffer from no longer feeling their legs, but the condition is often accompanied by neuropathic pain due to the spinal cord lesion. The patient feels pain originating from the legs, even though nothing else can be felt below the lesion. Now, virtual reality may be the key to providing pain relief for this type of pain, and the solution comes from restoring a sense of touch. In breakthrough research the scientists of the Foundation Bertarelli Chair in Cognitive Neuroprosthetics show that phantom body pain can be reduced in paraplegics by creating a bodily illusion with the help of virtual reality. \n08.11.17 - Researchers at EPFL’s Robotic Systems Laboratory have developed a miniature robot that can integrate perfectly into schools of zebrafish. It can swim with fish, learn how they communicate with each other and make them change direction or come together.

The EPFL Extension School is particularly well suited to professionals looking to study in an innovative field without having to give up their day job. It offers courses on concrete topics that are directly linked to the job market. The school's first continuing education course, Applied Data Science – Machine Learning, offers students who successfully complete the course a Certificate of Open Studies, a new type of academic qualification for the moment offered only by EPFL.\n29.11.17 - Professor Xile Hu, an expert in catalysis, has been awarded the 2017 National Latsis Prize. Hu, who was born in China and came to Switzerland in 2007, founded the Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Catalysis at EPFL. He is known for his innovative approach, which consists of combining the concepts and methods associated with three different types of catalysis (homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic), which traditionally have remained separate. This approach has led to unprecedented understanding of fundamental catalysis and enabled the discovery of new catalysts with properties superior to those of previous materials.\n01.12.17 - In artificial intelligence (AI), machines carry out specific actions, observe the outcome, adapt their behavior accordingly, observe the new outcome, adapt their behavior once again, and so on, learning from this iterative process. But could this process spin out of control? Possibly. AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped. EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots. Their work makes a major contribution to the development of autonomous vehicles and drones, for example, so that they will be able to operate safely in numbers.\n12.12.17 - Thanks to a donation from the Werner Siemens-Foundation, EPFL will set up a Center for Artificial Muscles, collaborating initially with the University Hospital of Bern (Inselspital) and then with the University Hospital of Zurich. The first project, slated to span the next four years, will focus on developing a less invasive cardiac assistance system for treating heart failure. This prosthetic device – a ring around the aorta – will avoid the complications of hemorrhaging and thrombosis because it will not be in contact with blood.

This low-power device plugs directly into a computer or mobile phone to add another dimension to the applications they run. The force feedback lets users feel the texture, stiffness and shape of virtual objects. This little robot joystick, which clearly punches above its weight, has already been presented at a number of specialized trade shows. From 23 to 27 April, visitors at the Hannover Messe – the leading industrial technology trade show in the world – will be able to give it a try.\nHaptic-feedback systems, which are used mainly for gaming, hit the market a few years ago but had until recently disappointed users. They were just not very realistic in the way they simulated a collision by vibrating or imitated acceleration by increasing the feeling of resistance. “Systems offering more refined tactile force feedback have come out recently,” says Marco Salerno, the cofounder of Foldaway Haptics. “But they are bulky, hard to carry around and very expensive.” His company’s foldable joystick offers a very similar experience to that of the newer systems but is easy to stow in a laptop bag or even in your pocket.\nWith the help of a small magnet, this ultralight device opens up into a joystick with an upward flick of the wrist. It goes from flat – less than two millimeters thick – to three dimensions in a fraction of a second. It is stable and solid thanks to its origami-like folding mechanism and the composite materials used to make it. When closed, it is so flat that you may wonder where the sensors and motors are. It took several years of research in the Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory for the researchers to overcome a number of technical challenges.\nThe little robot’s leading feature is the way it is manufactured, through a combination of thin layers of various materials already cut into the shape required for the folding mechanism to work. Because assembly is automated, it will be easy to mass-produce. “The fact that no manual action is required keeps manufacturing costs relatively low,” says Stefano Mintchev, the other cofounder of the startup, which received funding from NCCR Robotics to develop its technology.

{"id": 30, "text": "“Tutu” by Miles Davis and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple have already made their mark on music history. Now they have entered the annals of science, for eternity. Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA!

{"id": 31, "text": "Even though silicon is one of the most abundant elements, the energy required to make silicon from sand is immense. It is for this reason, but also to reduce manufacturing costs, that Professor Christophe Ballif and his team from the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory at the EPFL have been working for several years on thin-film silicon solar cells that are a thousand times thinner than conventional cells.\nThere’s just one catch: the thinner the cells, the less they absorb the rays of the sun and the less electricity they produce. So researchers are trying to trap light in the thin silicon layers to increase their absorption. Traditionally, thin layers of zinc oxide—a material that is very abundant, completely non-toxic, and that grows in the form of small pyramid-shaped crystals—are used for this purpose. These crystals scatter light efficiently into the underlying silicon layer. With such zinc oxide layers, even a new world record cell efficiency was achieved.\nReducing costs\nBut scientists are attempting to beat this record. “It is difficult to modify the natural pyramidal shape of these crystals in order to obtain even better light scattering,” explains researcher Corsin Battaglia, “so we had the idea to force the crystals to grow on a different support, an inverted mould with the desired structure.” The idea is as ingenious as it is simple. Once the thin layer of zinc oxide is deposited on the mould all that needs to be done is to “demould” it—as you would a tarte tatin, for example—to obtain a film with the desired structure.\nThis procedure, described in the September edition of the journal Nature Photonics, not only increases the amount of light that is trapped, thereby increasing output, but it also has the potential to reduce the cost of the cells because of its compatibility with mass production. These are interesting arguments at a time when photovoltaics is seeking to produce electricity at a lower price than the current grid price.", "summary": "Do better with less.

Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples. Her results showed that people are exposed to a number of pesticides, and that this is not due solely to their work.

{"id": 34, "text": "Before cell division, the long strings of the cell’s DNA are wrapped tightly into the structures we know as chromosomes. This protects the cell’s genetic material from physical and chemical damage.\nThe ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. These are specialized structures that have to be replicated with each cell division cycle. But the complete replication of telomeres up to the very ends of chromosomes also requires specialized mechanisms, and these are limited. Telomeres are also very sensitive to oxidative damage, which affects their ability to replicate.\nBecause of this, telomeres shrink over time, limiting the lifespan of cells. Telomere shortening is essentially the cause of cell aging.\nNow,  and Wareed Ahmed at EPFL have discovered two antioxidant enzymes that work together to prevent oxidation of telomeric DNA at chromosome ends. The scientists disrupted both the enzymes, called PRDX1 and MTH1, in cancer cells, and found that the cells’ telomeres shrunk with every round of cell division, eventually disappearing altogether.\nOne of the promising targets in cancer therapy is the enzyme telomerase. Normally, telomerase prevents telomeres from shortening in germ and stem cells, which helps with development. But telomerase is also highly active in cancer cells, keeping their telomeres intact and making the cells virtually immortal. The new work shows that disrupting PRDX1 and MTH1 prevents telomerase from counteracting telomere shortening.\nSo far, attempts to efficiently block telomerase in cancer have not been fruitful in the clinic. The discovery of the co-operating enzymes opens up a new opportunity to indirectly block telomerase. “Instead of inhibiting the enzyme itself, we target its substrate – the chromosome end – making it un-extendable by telomerase,” says Lingner.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have identified two enzymes that protect chromosomes from oxidative damage and shortening.

{"id": 35, "text": "Pharmaceuticals, energy, perfumes, polymers – all are industrially produced via chemical reactions. To carry out reactions, one needs reactors (vessels of different types and sizes ) to mix the various reagents and some catalysts, while controlling the pressure, temperature, and other parameters.\nUsually, industrial chemical reactions take place in large vessels, producing big quantities of substances. The use of these vast reactors has many drawbacks. For example, it’s difficult to obtain uniform mixing at constant temperatures, and one has to stop the process regularly to empty the reactor. Moreover, chemical reactions are often successfully performed in small reactors in the laboratory, but many problems arise in achieving the same results when the production is scaled-up in industry. This is like preparation of a dish for two people doesn’t involve too much difficulty, but preparing the same dish for 100 people is a different matter!\nThe EPFL’s Group of Chemical Reaction Engineering (GGRC) headed by Lioubov Kiwi has studied the use of microreactors for many years. They produce the required substances in tiny pipes, quickly enabling a highly uniform mixing that is perfectly controlled in terms of temperature (which also avoids the risk of explosion), often without the use of solvents, and in a continuous flow. For example, the reagents could be injected through two separate pipes in a Y-shaped system. They react when they meet, and the resulting product comes out through the third pipe. Detractors say that only insufficient quantities can be produced, but these reactors can be used by thousands in parallel. The products created in these microreactors are purer and therefore higher quality, as the process avoids the manufacturing of undesirable by-products inherent in large reactors.\nProfessor Kiwi and her team have received 2.4 million Swiss francs from the European Union to develop these microreactors. 650 thousand Swiss francs have been allocated to a new project, POLYCAT, which started up on November 15. The goal is to combine the advantages of a microreactor and a nano-catalyst. “To reach our objective, we employ micro- and nano-technologies together”, explains Lioubov Kiwi. The concept/process consists of the deposition on the micro-reactor walls of a polymer thin film that anchors the catalyst nanoparticles (gold, palladium etc.). These nanoparticles remain exposed to the reacting liquids or gases while being firmly fixed to the walls of the micro-capillaries.\nSuch a catalytic reactor could become a reality within two to three years, significantly improving the performance of industrial chemical reactions in terms of their quality, as well as their environmental and safety-related impact.", "summary": "EPFL’s Lioubov Kiwi and her group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "claim": "Kiwi’s Lioubov Kiwi and her group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 0], "noise": false}

{"id": 37, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.

{"id": 38, "text": "Switzerland is one of the countries in Europe that relies the most on geothermal energy for residential heating. A study conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy in 2019 found that the country has  (GSHPs) – the “highest concentration per square kilometer in the world.” Many of these pumps are installed in residential yards at depths of up to 400 meters and use a vertical closed-loop system to circulate heat up to the surface.\nThe advantage of GSHPs is that they have little impact on the environment. They can heat homes and buildings all year long since geothermal energy is a stable heat source. And they offer a promising alternative for decarbonizing the heating sector. In Switzerland, buildings’ heating and cooling systems account for a third of total energy demand, and 75% of the country’s energy comes from fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. \nOperation of a vertical ground-source heat pump. © ADEME\nA finite energy source\nIn 2017, Doris Leuthard, then-president of the Swiss Confederation, called geothermal energy an “incredible energy source” but warned that it’s not infinite; it needs to be extracted according to specific rules. For instance, the borehole heat exchangers used in GSHPs should be installed a certain distance apart to prevent thermal interference – the heat-exchanger equivalent of a short circuit – and prevent the ground from cooling. “The heat-transfer fluid absorbs the heat that’s in the ground,” says Alina Walch, a PhD student at EPFL’s . “If too many of these exchangers are packed into a tiny space, the ground will cool off, which is something we absolutely need to avoid.”\nThermal interference is one of the factors that a team of scientists, including Walch, took into account in  on 18 November. They calculated the technical potential of GSHPs in the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva. “The technical potential is the maximum amount of geothermal energy that can be extracted by the heat pumps using all the available area in the two cantons, assuming they operate at at least 80% of their rated power,” she says.\nThe research team estimated the available area using existing topographical data on Switzerland, excluding built environments and natural habitats like forests from their study. They then simulated GSHPs installed throughout that area based on factors such as ground temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. “We incorporated the various technical constraints and estimated the optimal borehole spacing that would both comply with installation standards and maximize the extractable heat,” says Walch.\nRegional variation of ground data in the case study region. a) Restriction zones for geothermal installations, b) Ground surface temperature at 1m depth, c) Thermal conductivity, d) Thermal diffusivity derived from the geothermal cadastres. Grey zones are outside the study area. © LESO-PB\nInsufficient capacity in urban centers \nTheirs is the first study of its scale in Switzerland to consider not just the ground’s geothermal capacity but also the technical limitations of GSHPs. The scientists estimate that the annual technical potential of the region they studied is 4.6 TWh, which corresponds to about a third of its total heating demand. They also calculated a maximum energy density of 15.5 kWh/m\n2\n. “Geothermal energy has only limited potential to serve as the region’s only source. It could cover demand in many suburban and rural areas, but would fall considerably short in urban centers,” says Walch. Urban planners can use this information in their technical and economic feasibility studies of GSHP system deployment. \nThe research team also found that the cumulative installed borehole depth shouldn’t exceed 2 km per hectare in order to avoid over-exploitation of the heat capacity of the ground. \nWalch stresses that their findings are only theoretical for now; the study doesn’t factor in local phenomena like phreatic zones and groundwater flows, which can affect the time needed for the ground to cool. It will be essential to drill test bores before installing borehole heat exchangers. \nThe team hopes that by quantifying the heat-generation capacity of shallow geothermal energy, and by pinpointing areas where additional energy sources will be required, their work will inform decarbonization strategies for Switzerland’s heating sector. “Our ultimate goal is to conduct nationwide studies and combine these findings with similar ones for other types of renewable energy,” says Walch, also worked on a study to evaluate . “It’s important to estimate the technical potential independent of heat demand.

In the same way, the noise of jet engines could be deflected towards the sky rather than the ground, and certain types of vehicle could be rendered undetectable by sonar.\nScientists at EPFL’s Laboratory for Electromagnetism and Acoustics have succeeded in creating a device that implements the principle of negative refraction in the domain of acoustics. This was achieved by applying recent findings from the domain of electromagnetism, and the results could mean that one day objects are no longer an obstacle to sound.\n“Even though it’s only at the experimental stage, the study of this phenomenon has become a burning topic in acoustics over the last three or four years”, describes Hervé Lissek, scientist and co-author of an article recently published in the journal Physical Review B*.\nAlready well understood in the area of optics, the phenomenon of refraction is illustrated by the deflection of a light beam when it encounters an alteration in the propagation medium. This explains why a straw, when dipped into a glass of water, appears to be broken at the point where it enters the liquid – the trajectory of the light is deflected when it passes from one medium (air) to another (water). Refraction is also responsible for mirages and rainbows. \nTo “flow” around an object\nNegative refraction is not found in nature. It can be produced by using artificial structures called “metamaterials”, which have the property of further bending – or inverting the path of – light rays, resulting in their potential to “flow” around an object, at least theoretically. Some scientists believe that this phenomenon could one day be used to make objects invisible or transparent, a bit like Harry Potter’s cape!\nFor the first time, EPFL scientists have succeeded in demonstrating the possibility of obtaining negative refraction in the domain of acoustics using a discrete device; this work was based on a recent PhD thesis in the domain of electromagnetism**. Sound is defined by two essential properties of a fluid (a material medium) in which it travels: its mass, put in movement by an acoustic disturbance, the acceleration of which is normally directed according to the forces of acoustic pressure (inertial force); and its compressibility, which allows it naturally to oppose such forces (restoring force).\nUsing the device they conceived, the EPFL scientists obtained, simultaneously, negative values for these two parameters; that is to say, to further compress the particle of fluid subjected to excessive acoustic pressure, and to determine that its acceleration oppose the forces of pressure. This combination is a prerequisite in obtaining negative refraction, a property that has been initially observed in a digital model of acoustic metamaterial. Similar results have also been observed in a second phase, using an experimental prototype which enabled the validation of the theoretical concept.\nEven though we are still a long way from a genuine acoustic “invisibility cape”, these results demonstrate the performance of a tangible physical system representing negative refraction, while constituting an important achievement for research in this area.\n*“Acoustic transmission line metamaterial with negative/zero/positive refractive index”, published in Physical Review B – Frédéric Bongard, Hervé Lissek and Juan R.

It also sets the stage for the development of new therapies to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. “We could, for example, select the most effective immune cells to combat a given disease,” says Hatice Altug, a co-author of the study and head of the Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory at EPFL's School of Engineering.\nCells individually housed, fed and analyzed\n The nanophotonic biosensor developed by the researchers is a glass slide coated with a thin gold film, perforated with billions of nanopores arranged in a precise pattern. A small chamber whose walls are made of porous membranes is placed above the slide. The chamber receives a steady flow of water and nutrients through tiny microfluidic channels. Temperature and humidity are carefully regulated. The device contains valves that let scientists insert a cell into the chamber, in which ligands or antibodies are positioned to recognize and capture specific molecules secreted by the cell.\nA broadband light source shines on the chamber. Thanks to an optical phenomenon called plasmons, the nanopores let only one light-wave frequency or color through. When a cell secretes a molecule, it attaches to the antibodies, thereby changing the frequency transmitted by the nanopores. This is how minutes of specific molecules can be identified.\nThe researchers have used their new technique to study cytokine secretion levels in lymphoma cells. “Until now, the methods used to study individual cells have always required fluorophores,” says Altug. “Yet these compounds interfere with the cells’ functioning and make real-time studies impossible.” Maria Soler, the study’s co-lead author, adds: “In our device, each nanopore is a separate sensor. Cells can thus settle naturally anywhere in the chamber, and we can analyze them the same way.”\nThere are numerous potential applications. “Our approach could be used to identify the most aggressive cancer cells in a tumor and decide exactly which treatment to administer to the patient,” concludes Xiaokang Li, the study’s co-lead author.\n / EPFL\nIntegrated Photonics and Application Center /  University\n / University of Lausanne", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed an innovative label-free method for studying the behavior of single cells continuously and in real time.

{"id": 45, "text": "“Tutu” by Miles Davis and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple have already made their mark on music history. Now they have entered the annals of science, for eternity. Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA! I've been a part of this festival for decades and it truly is a magnificent representation of what happens when different cultures unite for the sake of music. Absolute magic. And I'm proud to know that the memory of this special place will never be lost.”", "summary": "Thanks to an innovative technology for encoding data in DNA strands, two items of world heritage – songs recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival and digitized by EPFL – have been safeguarded for eternity.

The Delta robot made light work of hundreds of packets of Smarties at the Triennial Interpack Exhibition in Düsseldorf. The inventor of the concept, Reymond Clavel, was presenting in Germany the most recent version of the Delta robot, resulting of a collaboration with Bosch. The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. \nIncreasing speed and maintaining precision\n The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot. Scientists have now been able to take advantage of the progress made in motorization – in both power and cost – and this avoids the use of any such linking components. Thus, they have really gone up a gear. Reymond Clavel reveals: “The idea of direct drive had been tucked away in a drawer for ages, but then again, twenty years ago the cost of such motors would have been much too high.”\nA success story\nFrom chocolates to neurosurgery\nOriginally conceived to manipulate small, light objects such as chocolates, over time the Delta has been used for many other applications. Together with the team from the Laboratoire de systèmes robotiques, Mohamed Bouri is developing new variants of the highly dynamic tool: “In particular, we have developed ultra-high-precision robots, designed for use in the areas of electro-erosion, which involves machining very hard materials. These robots are also used in the manipulation and positioning of optical elements.”\nOther members of the Delta family have been developed in areas which demand the highest possible speed and precision, for example in watchmaking. Working together with neurosurgeons at the University Hospital Center of the canton of Vaud, a tactile feedback device has been developed to enable the surgeon to perform his hand movements. Reymond Clavel is convinced – the future of the Delta robot is assured. It will be adapted for use in many important areas: processing; packaging, surgery, watchmaking and – wait for it – chocolates!", "summary": "It’s the story of a long dynasty of industrial robots.

{"id": 47, "text": "In 2017, Enrico Felcini began his PhD in Applied Superconductivity under the supervision of Bertrand Dutoit, the head of \n.\n His work was on a revolutionary hadron therapy gantry concept invented by Luca Bottura, who leads CERN’s magnet group. Three years later, he is the proud co-creator of a new gantry design, based on superconducting magnets, that has the potential to change the future of how we treat cancer.\nHadron therapy is of great interest to the medical community as a pioneering radiation therapy that makes use of charged particles to deliver a highly localized dose to a tumor. Unlike traditional radiotherapy, because it minimizes radiation to any neighboring tissue, it may cause fewer side effects and avoid the generation of secondary tumors.\nHowever, because a hadron is made up of charged particles, a magnetic field is needed to ensure that it goes to exactly the right place in the patient. This requires a complex assembly of magnets in giant machines. It also needs to rotate around the patient with 0.5 mm (5 human hairs!) of precision, making it an incredibly complex piece of engineering. Currently, there are only two facilities in the world, at Heidelberg in Germany where the machine is around 13 meters tall, 25 meters in length and weighing more than 600 tons, and Chiba in Japan, where it is 11 meters tall, 13 meters in length and 250 tons in weight, because it is superconductive.\nEnter GaToroid, which, as Felcini says, aims not just to reduce the size of hadron therapy machines but also their complexity, “using toroidal superconducting magnets, the idea of GaToroid is to have a machine that looks like an MRI, so instead of a gigantic rotating magnetic arm that moves around the patient, we have something circular that is in a steady state with the patient inside. This has enabled us to make the machine much smaller. However, unlike an MRI, the patient is not immersed in the magnetic field, but it is confined by the coils around them.” The idea is that this technology will make hadron therapy far more accessible as it won’t require machines the size of a four-story building.\nReflecting on his PhD research, Felcini feels it has been an honor to work on such a visionary project, “My CERN mentor, Luca Bottura is the ‘yoda-master’ of magnets and it has been amazing to work with him. I’m really proud of my contribution to GaToroid requiring the integration of several aspects of physics and engineering, such as superconductivity, beam optics, mechanics, cryogenics, vacuum, and qualification for therapy. I specifically focused on the design of the superconducting coils and integrating magnet engineering with beam dynamics through particle tracking. With all of these different aspects coming together I had an amazing chance to not focus on a single thing but the opportunity to think very broadly.”\nDr Bertrand Dutoit is looking forward to following Felcini’s career and future achievements and extolled the virtue of working in a region with such top-class research facilities, “having CERN at such close proximity is a fantastic collaboration opportunity for EPFL and Enrico had access to top scientists as well as the technical workshop team where he was able to start building the system he designed and calculated. Enrico was challenged by many different aspects of the GaToroid project, each dictating his constraints but still managed a great PhD, becoming a highly attractive scientist for research institutes and companies in the cancer treatment business.”\nWork is currently underway to construct the first demonstration model, scaled down by a factor of 3 with the aim of taking the next step and building a full-scale machine in the next decade.\n(Video: (c) CERN)", "summary": "Joint CERN-EPFL doctoral research has led to the design of a new machine to deliver cutting edge hadron therapy to treat cancer.", "claim": "Felcini doctoral research has led to the design of a new machine to deliver cutting edge hadron therapy to treat cancer.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 0], "noise": false}
{"id": 48, "text": "It has circled the Earth nearly 38,000 times, sent back 150 million reports, transmitted dozens of megabytes of data and stood up surprisingly well to the damaging effects of solar particles on the electronic components. SwissCube, the little satellite developed by EPFL in partnership with several other specialized universities, is celebrating seven years in space today. EPFL's Space Engineering Center, eSpace, is planning a series of birthday events: a reunion of the satellite’s designers, conferences, personal accounts, previously unseen videos, and the retransmission of one of the satellite’s overhead passes. Plus, a mobile app will soon be available for those interested in keeping tabs on the satellite.\nThere is good reason to celebrate. This little CubeSat – measuring only 10 cm x 10 cm – is now playing with the big boys: it’s the oldest European satellite in its category to still be active. Only four other CubeSats have lasted longer, and they are all of Japanese design. The world record holder has been in orbit for 13 years.\nEarly on, no one thought SwissCube had the stamina. When it was launched, it was expected to function for about four months. And it even got off to a bad start: when it reached orbit it started spinning and couldn’t be used until it stabilized several months later.\nRisky decisions\nSwissCube’s long lifespan is a tribute to the 200 or so students who worked in succession on the project under the guidance of Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace. Over the years, a number of decisions that were considered highly risky at the time proved to be judicious. This includes the use of low-cost components that had never before been used in space.\nThe little satellite, orbiting at an altitude of 720 kilometers and a speed of nearly 7,500 meters per second – 28,000 kilometers per hour – still regularly transmits its position, system status and images back to Earth. That said, the satellite had to be completely rebooted on two separate occasions in recent years owing to system failures. The CubeSat rebooted properly both times, offering further proof of its sound design.\nIt is now starting to show more serious signs of fatigue. “It’s probably nearing the end of its travels,” said Simon Dandavino, the executive director of eSpace. “Its communications system is less responsive, and its data transmission capability is faltering.”\nSwissCube should eventually be picked up by CleanSpace One, the space cleanup satellite currently being built at eSpace. The purpose of that project is to develop solutions to the problem of space debris and demonstrate the feasibility of applying them in the space environment. SwissCube will therefore serve experimental purposes up to the very end.\nAn app, never-before-seen images and a replica\nSwissCube’s birthday celebration has a lot in store for its fans. A mobile app called Elveti mobile will soon be released, allowing users to track SwissCube and receive live data from it. The app will also work with other satellites like CleanSpace One. Enthusiasts will also be able to see images of SwissCube released by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB), which was able to film the small and fast-moving satellite from the ground using the ZIMLAT telescope at Zimmerwald Observatory.\nFinally, an exact replica of the little satellite is currently being made.

Inspired by muscle contraction, its individual soft components are activated (they collapse) when negative pressure (vacuum) is applied to them. The robot uses suction to grab objects or to stick to a smooth wall for climbing, so it can really achieve a wide range of tasks because of the unique properties of vacuum. The robot can be reconfigured to perform different tasks, making it highly modular and versatile, with a wide range of applications in both research and in industry. The invention is published today in \nScience Robotics\n.\n“What we have is a fully functional robot which is entirely powered by vacuum, which has never been done before,” says EPFL roboticist Matt Robertson who worked on the project. “Previous work has shown individual components powered by vacuum, but never in a complete system.”\nVacuum-powered components are a recent addition to robotics – and, more importantly, they’re safe. Today, most actuators on the market are activated by applying positive pressure, i.e. by injecting air into their components. But containing positive pressure requires stiff high-pressure pneumatics, which also pose a safety threat: in extreme situations, they can explode. By comparison, vacuum-powered actuators are safe, soft, and simple to build.\n“What's more is that our soft building blocks are designed to be plug-and-play, so ultimately we can assemble several types of robots from the same basic units,” says EPFL scientists and lead researcher Jamie Paik. “They can be reconfigured to perform different tasks like crawling, gripping canisters, and climbing a vertical wall.”\nA five-module robot can move like a tentacle; a four-module robot with a suction gripper can grab an object and drop it on a target; a three-module robot can crawl on the ground; a two-module robot can be equipped with suction-cup feet to climb a smooth, vertical surface, like glass.

Halfway between a car and a bike, these electric vehicles are available to users on campus for free. And testers have not been hard to find. “We were expecting about 50 people to sign up, but we’ve had more than 250. We had planned for each vehicle to do two or three runs a day, but they’ve actually done between eight and 13!” exclaims Yoann Loetscher, one of the two founders of the startup, ENUU.\nWorking in partnership with EPFL’s Sustainable Campus initiative, the Biel-based company is using the campus as a micro lab until 1 June. Users have been testing everything about the vehicles, from how easy they are to reserve and operate using the app to their technical features, fleet management and battery recharging. The aim is to fine-tune the design before a fleet of self-service vehicles is rolled out for public use in Biel in mid-July.\nThis initiative is a first for shared mobility. Let’s start with the vehicle itself. It’s manufactured in China and modified slightly for use in Switzerland. It’s electric, about as wide as a scooter, and has handlebars and a seat – you ride it like a bike but it’s as stable as a car. You don’t need a driver’s license, and the vehicle is allowed on bike paths up to a speed limit of 30km/h. For Loetscher, what makes the vehicles stand out is that they offer the advantages of electric bikes along with protection from the rain like cars.\nThe concept is also a first. Once you’ve signed up for the service, you can locate and reserve one of these mini vehicles via an app. The vehicle’s door will open automatically when the reservation begins – and off you go! At EPFL, the vehicles are available free of charge, but the journey can’t last more than 15 minutes. In Biel, where 13 vehicles will be available, users will be able to take three free trips a day lasting a total of 30 minutes. After that, they’ll have to pay.\nResearch projects in the pipeline\n“This pilot phase is crucial for ENUU because it allows us to collect a whole range of data on everything from battery life to areas of use. We’ve noticed, for example, that people use the vehicles a lot around avenues Piccard and Forel and less so near the SG building and at EPFL Innovation Park,” explains Loetscher, an automotive engineer who graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Biel.\nFirst time users are thrown a little off kilter at the start but then get used to driving the egg-shaped vehicle in no time. Some testers regularly take the vehicles for a short 15-minute spin, while others use them to get from point A to point B. Some students have even tried racing two of the vehicles. The pilot project includes a qualitative analysis that will soon be conducted with the testers, even though the campus is not the target location for this type of vehicle.\nThe partnership between ENUU and EPFL began a year ago when the startup contacted the Transport Center. “It’s our role to encourage projects that combine research, innovation and the economy,” says Simone Amorosi, the Center’s Deputy Director. “ENUU is now in talks with two EPFL labs about possible research projects.

{"id": 53, "text": "Scientists from EPFL and WSL have been studying soils in oil palm cultivation for years, in an effort to develop more sustainable methods for growing this crop. Palm oil production has been criticized by environmentalists because of its large carbon footprint and negative impact on biodiversity. For instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia – the world’s two biggest producers – it has directly or indirectly caused large-scale deforestation, thereby reducing biodiversity and releasing significant amounts of CO\n2\n into the atmosphere. And planting oil palm trees in the deforested areas does not make up for the lost carbon storage capacity, according to a . \nBut the findings of a new study by EPFL and WSL – appearing today in \nScience Advances\n – indicate there may be a carbon-friendly alternative to deforestation. The scientists investigated oil palm crops that had been planted on former pastures in the Los Llanos region of Colombia, the world’s fourth-largest palm oil producer. There, large areas of pastures – which themselves had been planted in the past on savannas – were replaced by oil palm plantations 56 years ago. By calculating the crops’ carbon footprint since then, the scientists found that the total carbon storage – taking into account both vegetation and soil stocks – was unchanged relative to when the land had been used for pastures.\n“Our study is the first to look at the carbon footprint of palm oil production over the long term – that is, across two plantation cycles, since oil palm trees are replaced every 25–30 years,” says Juan Carlos Quezada, a PhD student at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS) and the study’s lead author. “It’s also the first to explore how converting pastures into oil palm farms affects soil quality and fertility over the long term, looking at all soil layers, not just the surface.”\nCarbon capture\nIn tropical climates, pastures – especially those that have been neglected and degraded – commonly consist of large grassy areas with a few small trees scattered around. Planting dense populations of oil palm trees – which can reach 15 meters in height – on these pastures can increase the carbon capture rate per unit of surface area, thanks to the palm trees’ roots, trunks and leaves, as well as the vegetation around them.\nUnder typical farming methods, oil palm trees are cut down every 25–30 years and replaced with young trees to start a new plantation cycle. As the roots and other parts of the old trees decompose, they nourish the soil and partially offset the carbon initially lost in the upper soil layer when the pastureland was converted. As a result, over the long term cultivation period, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem remains unchanged compared to the initial level before land conversion took place. \nAn alternative worth exploring \n“We should bear in mind that palm oil in and of itself is not harmful – neither to our health, when eaten in moderation, nor to the economy. And we’re not talking just about multinationals – the incomes of hundreds of small farmers in Colombia and other countries depend on it,” says Alexandre Buttler, head of ECOS and a co-author of the study. “The problem lies with the negative carbon impact and loss of biodiversity caused by deforestation. But the main palm oil producing countries have large abandoned pastures that could be converted favorably, thus limiting the massive carbon loss resulting from deforestation.” \nThis study was conducted as part of the  project, a cross-disciplinary initiative funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and led by ETH Zurich.

{"id": 54, "text": "How can we bring to life a musical heritage now preserved in a digital format? How does this newly digitised heritage change our perception of the past? And what new cultural perspectives does it open? An interdisciplinary research project by the EPFL + ECAL Lab, Metamedia Center and the ALICE laboratory set out to address these questions. It all began when Audemars Piguet joined forces with Montreux Sounds and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) to digitise, restore and preserve the treasured archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was founded by the late Claude Nobs exactly 50 years ago. The tremendous collection comprises thousands of hours of recordings by the finest musicians on the planet. It is the first audiovisual library to have earned the accolade of UNESCO Memory of the World. “The project was inspired by the work of Claude Nobs. He was a faithful friend and so we are delighted to take part in this initiative. We are proud to participate in the colossal technological efforts needed to transform this unique heritage into a first-class digitised resource for future generations,” says Olivier Audemars, Vice-Chairman of the Audemars Piguet Board of Directors.\nWork to preserve this legacy began in 2008 and is almost complete. Over the years the archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival have taken many different formats. “All the master copies have now been digitised and work on the original tapes will be finished by the end of the summer. We can now make full use of this heritage for research purposes,” continues Alain Dufaux, Operations Director at Metamedia Center. In the past 8 years, more than 11,000 hours of video recordings (in HD since 1991) and 6,000 hours of high-quality audio recordings have been preserved in uncompressed digital formats utilizing the very latest technology. Since 2010, this unique collection has used as a database for a number of research projects at EPFL.\nLiving heritage\n The study conducted by the EPFL+ECAL Lab, the research centre for design at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the ALICE architecture studio ALICE (at EPFL), proposes a new vision for this digitised heritage. The aim is not to reconstitute the past, but instead to create a specific experience for a digitised archive. “The original concert experience is the backdrop of Lake Geneva and the mountains, the ambiance of festival-goers in their thousands, the unfolding of events on-stage, and above all the flesh-and-blood presence of the musicians. We can’t recreate this. Instead we need to make the most of what digital has to offer to create an alternative experience, a complementary experience,” explains Project Manager Nicolas Henchoz. The first private booth was launched in 2012 and awarded the Design Preis Schweiz the following year.\nA ramped-up version of the booth, dubbed Montreux Heritage Lab2, opens to the public in November in the brand new Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL. Montreux Heritage Lab2 unlocks the lion’s share of the archive footage, immersing up to 20 viewers at a time in an intense audiovisual experience.\nEPFL was guided by three principles in developing the new booth. First, the content and its cultural value take front and center. Stunning, well-preserved archival footage dominates the space, appearing on a screen whose sophisticated geometry gives the viewer a sense of depth and proximity to the stage. Then comes the surround sound – so fundamental to the immersive effect – which was orchestrated by Audioborn and Illusonic (two startups founded by former members of the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory, LCAV) with help from Hervé Lissek's Acoustic Group (LTS2) and the Yverdon-les-Bains company Relec with its PSI Audio high-precision speakers. The viewer’s experience is thus shaped by live footage and music – the very essence of the archive. The sense of immersion is further enhanced by the lateral walls of the booth, where mirrors reflect the selected footage and display information and visuals through an LED underlay. The experience is rounded out by anecdotes on the history of the festival showing up on the screens. The booth is structured to direct its light toward the Montreux Jazz Café next door and, in the evening, towards the heart of the campus. \nPurpose-designed controls afford an overview of the archive footage, placing more than 44,000 tracks at your fingertips.\n---\nFrom the outset, the project saw the light of day thanks to the crucial support from Audemars Piguet, who has been involved since the beginning.

{"id": 55, "text": "At 5:01 pm Wednesday evening, the Philae lander touched down on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko – Chury, for short – seven hours after taking leave of its mothership, the Rosetta orbiter. Although there are still concerns about its anchoring and the resulting feasibility of some operations, the washing-machine sized robot has already gotten to work, sending data and spectacular images of its new surroundings.\nLaunched in 2004 by the European Space Agency, the probe made a 10-year voyage, traveling 500 million kilometers from Earth, to wind up somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In March, Rosetta’s systems were rebooted successfully as it approached the comet, and in August it began to orbit. The first photos of the comet revealed a fascinating shape, seemingly the result of an agglomeration of two rocky cores. The images sent yesterday by Philae indicate that the comet seems to be made up primarily of rock, and not ice. Grégoire Bourban space engineer and Deputy Director of the EPFL Swiss Space Center, gives us his engineer’s viewpoint on this exceptional event.\n-\tWhy was this operation such a huge challenge, from a space engineering point of view? \nIn the heat of the operation, Wednesday, someone dared to compare this adventure with the first human moon landing. And I share that opinion. Because this operation is very different from others that have involved a lander. For the missions on Venus or Mars, for example, we were dealing with bodies that had been studied for a long time, and we understood the precise nature of the ground we’d be landing on. In addition, they were much larger targets, with many appropriate landing spots. What is unique about Chury is that we knew next to nothing about it in August 2014; but we had to choose a landing site, then make millions of descent calculations, studying various trajectories. Managing to do this successfully, from 500 million miles away, is quite simply incredible!\n-\tWhat will Philae allow us to study, and how will it operate? \nThe Philae mission is a true success, even if the lander has experienced some anchoring issues and only two of its three feet appear to be stable. We still don’t know what the consequences of this will be on the analysis operations. If all goes as planned, the lander and orbiter will remain for an entire year in this configuration, accompanying a comet for the first time ever in its trip around the Sun. As it approaches the sun, its core will begin to melt, and thus it will release gases that will react with others already in suspension. Comets are considered to be a possible origin of the presence of water on Earth, and studying this comet’s composition could thus give us valuable information about our origins.\nTo carry out these tasks, Philae is equipped with various instruments for analyzing particles, electromagnetic radiation, various gases, soil properties and even the sounds that the comet emits. It can bore up to 20 centimeters beneath the surface and remove samples. It’s these soil-sampling operations that are in question due to the failure of the harpoons to anchor the lander. And given the weak gravity, even a very small perturbation could eject the robot from the surface.\n-\n\tSome elements or instruments on board Philae and Rosetta were made in Switzerland. Which ones are they and what do they do?\nThere was a significant Swiss involvement in this project. The most well known instrument is Rosina; developed at the University of Bern, it’s what we call a mass spectrometer. Its objective is to analyze the composition of the comet’s atmosphere, the temperature and density of the gases, and their evolution as the comet approaches the Sun. Several companies, including APCO and Clemessy, also developed ground-based support systems, that is, everything used to test the electrical and mechanical properties of the instruments before they’re launched into space. Certain components, most notably the mechanisms for pointing the communications antenna and the solar panel supports, were built by Mecanex in Nyon, which is now part of the company RUAG Space. Finally, some of Philae’s micro-cameras were developed at the CSEM in Neuchâtel. The first images sent from the surface of the comet, made public yesterday morning, came from these instruments!\n-\tWhat lessons can we learn from this for future space operations and exploration?\nMissions like this are very rare, because they are terribly costly in terms of both money and time – more than €1.5 billion and 20 years of work went into Rosetta. The concrete results that she will provide and the public enthusiasm we’re seeing are extremely positive signals for us, because they will encourage decision makers in European countries to continue to invest in space projects and fund the ESA. One of the most significant interests of this mission, in engineering terms, is in robotics and automation. In the space sector, we’re usually dealing with telecoms satellites or observational satellites orbiting Earth, and thus primarily sensor technology. Rosetta is a spectacular demonstration that these technologies [robotics and automation, ed.] operate well in space, and could thus encourage an increase in launching more robotics-type projects.\nImage: first picture taken by Philae once on the comet's surface.

{"id": 57, "text": "Obviously, wind farms work best when it is windy. But aside from wind-speed and direction, there are other more subtle factors that influence their power output. Using a mathematical model, researchers from EPFL’s  have shown the impact of vertical movements of the air on the productivity of wind farms. They found that increased turbulence caused by convective movements, common on hot, sunny days, increased the output of wind farms by shortening the lifespan of the turbulent wake downstream of the individual turbines. They published their  in the journal Physics of Fluids early this month.\nMahdi Abkar and Fernando Porté-Agel, the authors of the study, used a mathematical model to study the turbulence generated by a wind turbine as its rotors slice through the wind that drives them. With turbines often set up to form dense wind farms, understanding the turbulent wakes generated by upwind turbines and how long it takes for them to recover are important in predicting the overall power output of these wind farms, as turbines set up in the wind shadow of others are driven by strong wind. Today, turbines are spaced between five and seven turbine diameters apart – about 500 to 700 meters for large turbines – to maximize the amount of power that can be produced on a given area.\nOptimizing production over a 24-hour cycle\n“What we were interested in was understanding the effect of thermal stability on the characteristics and dynamics of the turbulent wake behind wind-turbines,” says Abkar. In other words, how do temperature-driven vertical movements in the lower atmosphere influence the turbulent wind shadow cast by a wind turbine. On sunny days, the hot ground causes the air above it to heat up and rise. This vertical motion is a characteristic of an unstable, convective atmosphere. On a typical night, by contrast, the earth’s cold surface cools the air above it, leading to a stable situation.\nAbkar used simulations to study the power output of a wind farm under convective and stable conditions and found a significant difference between both cases. “In the convective case, downwind turbines were about 30% less productive than those in the front lines. Under a stable atmosphere, the losses were even higher, on the order of 60%,” he says. His findings are important to optimize the power output of wind farms over a 24-hour cycle, as the lower atmosphere goes its stable nocturnal state to the convective state typical of daytime.\nSo, why does the turbulence recover so much faster in the convective case? According to Abkar, this is mostly due to the higher levels of turbulence in the incoming wind, which enhances turbulent mixing within, thereby breaking apart the turbulent wake behind the turbines. By contrast, in the stable setting, the turbulence is allowed to linger on for much longer, as turbulent mixing remains low.\nAccounting for windfarms in weather models\nUnraveling the detailed physics at play within wind farms is not only important to optimize their power output. Wind turbines alter the atmospheric dynamics by absorbing some of the wind and increasing turbulence, which can modify a number of other properties, such as atmospheric humidity and temperature. That is why meteorologists are interested in improving how they account for them in weather models. In a second paper, published in the journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, Akbar and Porté-Agel propose a new way to account for wind farms in large-scale atmospheric models that considers the number of turbines in the wind farm, the way that they are set up, and the wind direction.", "summary": "When set up in groups, wind turbines in the front rows cast a wind shadow on those behind them, lowering their performance.

Commissioned by the Federal Roads Office, this research involves testing the stress resistance of pre-cast concrete beams. These tests are performed on the campus in a large hall. The objective is to develop a model of calculation that will be used in the future checking of freeway bridges.\nThe enormous project to construct the freeway network in Switzerland took place between 1960 and 1980, and deployed a number of bridges made of pre-cast concrete. The checking of these structures according to current Swiss standards can sometimes cause problems, as theycontain very little shear reinforcement.\nWhat is the impact in relation to the resistance of the bridge if the load is increased; for example, to accommodate an emergency lane? Or if there is rusting in the structure? At what juncture should the bridge be reinforced?\nTo address these critical safety issues, le doctoral student Michael Rupf and his team are checking concrete beams in the laboratory. These bridge components are deformed by loads applied by precisely defined levels of kilonewtons. Each level corresponds to a given stress resistance. The beam is deformed up to breaking point, and every five seconds a computer measures the strength, movement and tilt of the beam.\nA measurement matrix is applied to the beam. At each level, the matrix is measured to the nearest thousandth of a millimeter and the cracks are re-drawn. The data are then sent to a computer. The analysis of the measurements enables an understanding of the behavior of the specimen beam. The model developed using the experience gained will be validated by the trial data. The goal is thus to obtain and refine a robust predictive tool.\nThe Federal Roads Office has a significant interest in this project, because this calculation tool will allow the validation of the decision whether or not to begin large-scale and costly repair work.

And the manufacturer had to provide a full and detailed list of ingredients, thus revealing part of its trade secret.\nNo sharp corners\nThe boxes were then sent to the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), in the Netherlands, whose work includes testing satellites and their sub-systems by simulating the conditions they will experience when launched and once in space.\n“All objects going to the ISS have to undergo testing to ensure they are not flammable, do not produce fragments that could spread around the cabin, and cannot injure the astronauts,” said Bernd Rattenbacher, from the Center of Competence in Aerospace Biomedical Science & Technology at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\nESTEC’s main task was to ensure that the boxes did not have any sharp corners or edges presenting a risk of injury. Once approved, the boxes were sent to the Aerospace Logistics Technology Engineering Company (ALTEC), another ESA center, in Italy. There, the contents of the package were verified and the customs documentation was completed. The package was finally sent to NASA, which delivered it to the ISS from the Cape Canaveral launch site in Florida.\nThe latest word was that it took 10 days after launch for the chocolates to reach the hands of the astronauts, who were busy unpacking three tons of food, equipment and scientific experiments included in the latest resupply mission.

{"id": 62, "text": "Spintronics is an emerging field of electronics, where instead of using the charge of electrons, devices work by manipulating electron spin. Already tested in hard drives, spintronics are poised to replace current information technology, providing increased data transfer speeds, processing power, memory density and storage capacity. Controlling electron spin can be achieved with topological insulators; a novel class of materials that behave as insulators on the inside, but are highly conductive on their surfaces. However, it has been unclear how exactly a normal material can become a topological insulator, and also how to implement them for real technological impact. Publishing in \nPhysical Review Letters\n, EPFL scientists offer solutions to both problems by studying the spin structure of few atoms-thick films of a common topological insulator.\n Future electronics will most likely utilize an intrinsic property of electrons called spin. This spin can take either of two possible states: “up” or “down”, which in a classical picture corresponds to a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the electron around its axis. The electron spin can also be viewed as an extremely small magnetic field surrounding the electron. The field of spintronics aims to exploit spin in order to develop a new era of technological applications. Information technology in particular stands to gain the most, as spintronics can offer considerably higher overall computing speeds and storage capacities at lower power consumption. \n Just like conventional electronics requires switching between high and low current states, spintronics require the control of electron spin states and switch between “up” and “down”. Recent interest has focused on topological insulators, which can conduct spin-polarised electrons on their surface while their inner bulk acts as an insulator. However, manufacturing and implementing topological insulators has been limited because of technical limitations and because the formation of their unusual properties has not been entirely clear.\n An international team of researchers led by Hugo Dil at EPFL has now shown how spin-polarised electrons evolves on the surface of atomically flat bismuth-selenide topological insulator films no more than 30 atoms thick. The researchers used a spectroscopic technique called SARPES, which allowed them to determine the different spin states of electrons travelling across the conducting surface of a topological insulator. They found that the ability of the topological insulator to control the electron spin depends on its interface to the substrate and, surprisingly, not on the film thickness. \n The team’s findings show that tuning the chemical make-up of a topological insulator can directly manipulate the spin of electrons flowing across its surface. The discovery not only contributes to the understanding of the function of topological insulators, but also provides a fundamental means of designing spintronics devices in the future. \nReference\nLandolt G, Schreyeck S, Eremeev SV, Slomski B, Muff S, Osterwalder J, Chulkov EV, Gould C, Karczewski G, Brunner K, Buhmann H, Molenkamp LW, and Dil JH. 2014.

The goal is to develop concrete solutions to stem the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate the pandemic’s consequences. Possible topics include systems for letting store employees work risk-free, methods for detecting biases in different testing strategies, and technology for making online learning easier. Some of the best ideas that come out of the hackathon will be developed further either by EPFL students as part of their semester projects, or outside of EPFL.\nThe event will last 72 hours. Mentors will help project teams plan out and organize their work – then participants will work day and night to develop open-source prototypes of their applications. The hackathon will end on Monday so that the mentors and judges have enough time to provide useful feedback. “We hope that our event will lead to some tangible, actionable ideas that can be implemented quickly, like the ventilators that an Italian doctor created out of scuba masks to help treat COVID-19 patients,” says Blagovesta Kostova, the president of LauzHack. A panel of judges will select the best projects. Some EPFL students who participate in the hackathon will be able to use their work as the basis for their semester projects, as agreed with the Vice Presidency for Education. However all participants will retain the rights to the applications they develop, and they can take their work further if they wish.\nHackathons have become highly popular in recent years as a way to discover new ideas and spur innovation while meeting and working with new people. Unlike previous hackathons organized by LauzHack, this one will not take place on the EPFL campus but be conducted entirely online, and is open to not just EPFL students but anyone. The goal is to attract a group of participants as diverse as possible in order to draw from a broad range of skills and leverage synergies.\nLauzHack, founded at EPFL in 2016, has put on some of Switzerland’s biggest student hackathons. However, Kostova says that this time they faced unique challenges given how quickly it had to be set up and how many different online communication channels they had to manage between themselves, supporters and participants. LauzHack has received no outside funding for this event beyond that from EPFL.

People need to know the basics if they want to ride that wave confidently and have trust in it,” says Martin Vetterli, President of the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). Vetterli intends to help anchor that trust, which is essential for an open, democratic society, economic prosperity, and personal freedom, and to that end has announced a new \nCenter for Digital Trust\n based at EPFL. The statement was made during the 2017 Cybersecurity day (), held at EPFL in the presence of Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin.\nIndividual citizens and major multinationals alike must adapt to the changes being imposed by digitalization – whether that involves learning how to use new software or adapting to new working methods. Such technological progress is paving the way to Industry 4.0, a new paradigm where companies must rethink their entire business models. These challenges are at the top of the agenda for business leaders and policymakers alike; Switzerland alone counts over 80 recent parliamentary actions on the issue.\nSwitzerland is in key position to catch the opportunities\n The digital revolution is nothing less than a goldmine of opportunity for Switzerland. The country’s long tradition of neutrality, together with its world-caliber expertise recognized by research institutions across the globe, make it ideally placed to lay the groundwork for the new concept of digital trust. “Digital trust will be at the core of our strategy,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, the Center’s academic director. “We want to become a center of excellence in the field, where all of our partners – regardless of how they are using digital services – can find answers to their questions and support for their goals.”\nThe Center will address the three critical challenges of this digital era: cybersecurity, which involves making sure that data transferred across networks cannot be hacked; transparency, which means making it clear how data is processed, sent and stored; and personal data protection, so that sensitive information, such as bank account details and medical records, stays out of malevolent hands. Engineers at the Center will work in parallel to develop new systems and methods in all three areas.\nHigh-level partners in close relationship to the citizens and the industry\n The Center will combine EPFL’s renowned expertise in cybersecurity, sensitive data protection and blockchain and smart-contracting technology with the advanced capabilities of institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), as well as companies including ELCA, SICPA, Swisscom, Swissquote, SGS and SwissRe, who have already stated their strong interest in joining the Center.\nThese partner organizations are in direct contact with individuals and businesses, and will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution. The organizations will also contribute their own experts to the research being done at EPFL in order to develop solutions to concrete problems, and will help to fund the Center.\nTwo new EPFL chairs and 24 labs involved\n EPFL has created two new teaching and research chairs in digital trust, and the search for candidates is already under way. The School also has 24 research labs in this field, mostly within the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, the School of Life Sciences and the College of Management of Technology. “It’s a genuine ecosystem that addresses the needs of the entire population. The challenges are so great that there’s no way we could overcome them without a cross-disciplinary approach,” says Hubaux. The first step will be to develop trust technologies and systems that can form a bedrock of trust between users and service providers – thereby encouraging the adoption and effective use of new technology.\nDesigned with ambitious goals in mind, the Center got an additional boost from the Swiss Federal Parliament’s decision to cap budget cuts in the areas of education, research and innovation. EPFL will leverage this opportunity to invest in research that will tackle not only the challenges mentioned above, but also those that are bound to come.\nSupport from the Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland\n The Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland (the cantons of Vaud, Neuchatel, Valais, Geneva, Bern, Fribourg and Jura), currently headed by Pierre Maudet, a member of Geneva’s cantonal government, has applauded the initiative. “This new partnership between the public and private sectors will position Switzerland as a major player in both cybersecurity and the digital trust that our society needs. We encourage all companies and research institutions working in this field to join in,” says Maudet. Philippe Leuba, the member of the Vaud cantonal government who handles innovation-linked relations between the cantonal government and EPFL, adds: “Our region is home to businesses and institutions at the forefront of digital technology, and which attract top-quality international investment. Their position as pioneers in this new partnership with EPFL augurs well for the development of Industry 4.0 in our country.”", "summary": "EPFL President Martin Vetterli has today unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust.

{"id": 66, "text": "Concrete has been around since the 19\nth\n century. Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

{"id": 67, "text": "At 5:01 pm Wednesday evening, the Philae lander touched down on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko – Chury, for short – seven hours after taking leave of its mothership, the Rosetta orbiter. Although there are still concerns about its anchoring and the resulting feasibility of some operations, the washing-machine sized robot has already gotten to work, sending data and spectacular images of its new surroundings.\nLaunched in 2004 by the European Space Agency, the probe made a 10-year voyage, traveling 500 million kilometers from Earth, to wind up somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In March, Rosetta’s systems were rebooted successfully as it approached the comet, and in August it began to orbit. The first photos of the comet revealed a fascinating shape, seemingly the result of an agglomeration of two rocky cores. The images sent yesterday by Philae indicate that the comet seems to be made up primarily of rock, and not ice. Grégoire Bourban space engineer and Deputy Director of the EPFL Swiss Space Center, gives us his engineer’s viewpoint on this exceptional event.\n-\tWhy was this operation such a huge challenge, from a space engineering point of view? \nIn the heat of the operation, Wednesday, someone dared to compare this adventure with the first human moon landing. And I share that opinion. Because this operation is very different from others that have involved a lander. For the missions on Venus or Mars, for example, we were dealing with bodies that had been studied for a long time, and we understood the precise nature of the ground we’d be landing on. In addition, they were much larger targets, with many appropriate landing spots. What is unique about Chury is that we knew next to nothing about it in August 2014; but we had to choose a landing site, then make millions of descent calculations, studying various trajectories. Managing to do this successfully, from 500 million miles away, is quite simply incredible!\n-\tWhat will Philae allow us to study, and how will it operate? \nThe Philae mission is a true success, even if the lander has experienced some anchoring issues and only two of its three feet appear to be stable. We still don’t know what the consequences of this will be on the analysis operations. If all goes as planned, the lander and orbiter will remain for an entire year in this configuration, accompanying a comet for the first time ever in its trip around the Sun. As it approaches the sun, its core will begin to melt, and thus it will release gases that will react with others already in suspension. Comets are considered to be a possible origin of the presence of water on Earth, and studying this comet’s composition could thus give us valuable information about our origins.\nTo carry out these tasks, Philae is equipped with various instruments for analyzing particles, electromagnetic radiation, various gases, soil properties and even the sounds that the comet emits. It can bore up to 20 centimeters beneath the surface and remove samples. It’s these soil-sampling operations that are in question due to the failure of the harpoons to anchor the lander. And given the weak gravity, even a very small perturbation could eject the robot from the surface.\n-\n\tSome elements or instruments on board Philae and Rosetta were made in Switzerland. Which ones are they and what do they do?\nThere was a significant Swiss involvement in this project. The most well known instrument is Rosina; developed at the University of Bern, it’s what we call a mass spectrometer. Its objective is to analyze the composition of the comet’s atmosphere, the temperature and density of the gases, and their evolution as the comet approaches the Sun. Several companies, including APCO and Clemessy, also developed ground-based support systems, that is, everything used to test the electrical and mechanical properties of the instruments before they’re launched into space. Certain components, most notably the mechanisms for pointing the communications antenna and the solar panel supports, were built by Mecanex in Nyon, which is now part of the company RUAG Space. Finally, some of Philae’s micro-cameras were developed at the CSEM in Neuchâtel. The first images sent from the surface of the comet, made public yesterday morning, came from these instruments!\n-\tWhat lessons can we learn from this for future space operations and exploration?\nMissions like this are very rare, because they are terribly costly in terms of both money and time – more than €1.5 billion and 20 years of work went into Rosetta. The concrete results that she will provide and the public enthusiasm we’re seeing are extremely positive signals for us, because they will encourage decision makers in European countries to continue to invest in space projects and fund the ESA. One of the most significant interests of this mission, in engineering terms, is in robotics and automation. In the space sector, we’re usually dealing with telecoms satellites or observational satellites orbiting Earth, and thus primarily sensor technology. Rosetta is a spectacular demonstration that these technologies [robotics and automation, ed.] operate well in space, and could thus encourage an increase in launching more robotics-type projects.\nImage: first picture taken by Philae once on the comet's surface.

{"id": 70, "text": "Neurons communicate with each other at synapses through complex mechanisms. The synapses establish contact between the neurons and convert their electrical signals into chemical signals, the release of neurotransmitters. Study of these phenomena is one of the essential keys to understanding the brain. The team from the EPFL’s Laboratory of Synaptic Mechanisms, headed by Ralf Schneggenburger, has shed some light on previously unknown functions of proteins in the release of neurotransmitters.\n In the first paper (1), the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to deactivate a protein selectively in the calyx of Held, the brain’s largest synapse. This novel method enabled them to discover a direct, unexpected role for the protein RIM (Rab3 interacting molecule), which increases the density of calcium ion (Ca2+) channels, a type of ion channel that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release.\n In the second article (2), the scientists used mice that had been genetically modified so they would not produce a specific protein, synaptotagmin. This Ca2+-sensing protein is known to bind calcium ions (Ca2+), thus initiating neurotransmitter release. The researchers used a virus to reintroduce the missing gene in the nerve terminal and reestablish the gene function at the calyx of Held.\nA Protein’s Double Life\n Subsequently, the scientists used viruses expressing slightly modified versions of the gene coding for the protein. Careful comparison enabled them to reveal a double role of this protein. The function of synaptotagmin is in fact not limited to initiating neurotransmitter release; it also inhibits other Ca2+- sensing proteins present in the nerve terminal. In doing so, it increases the amplitude of the release signal while suppressing background release events. In other words it optimizes the signal quality, similarly to what occurs in an electronic circuit.\n The approaches developed by Ralf Schneggenburger’s team are promising. They should also help us gain more insight into the function of other proteins that are active in the synapses. Since synaptic transmission is the basis of all fast communication between neurons in the brain, misfunction at synapses can underlie several neurodegenerative- and psychiatric disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's Disease. \"Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular bases of synapse function will contribute to the development of treatment strategies of these disorders in the future,” the researcher explained.\n (1)Neuron, January 27, 2011, “”\n (2)Neuron, February 24, 2011, “”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have made a step forward in understanding signal transmission in neuronal networks, thanks to new methods to molecularly influence the nerve terminal.

{"id": 71, "text": "On 12 June 2019, EPFL was officially designated as a  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the fields of open-source data and code development for nuclear applications. The IAEA is the world's central inter-governmental forum for scientific and technical co-operation in the nuclear field. It works for the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, contributing to international peace and security and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. For its work, the IAEA won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.\nThe IAEA endorses the EPFL for spearheading the creation of an international network of industries and research institutions that will develop an advanced, open-source simulation platform for the analysis of nuclear reactors. “This will be a unique opportunity to work on a major paradigm shift in the nuclear sector towards open, collaborative, and efficient R&D,” says Carlo Fiorina, the main initiator of this activity and a researcher at EPFL’s , headed by Professor Andreas Pautz.\nThe need for a new development strategy in the nuclear sector comes from its ever more stringent safety requirements, but also from the vibrant worldwide research activities dedicated to the development of new nuclear technologies for CO\n2\n-free energy generation, production of medical radioisotopes, incineration of existing nuclear waste, water desalination, and hydrogen production.\nThe EPFL Collaborating Centre’s objective will be to step beyond traditional development strategies, which are based on relatively old and often proprietary software and data. At the core of the Centre’s activities will be the promotion of R&D work fostering the concepts of open-source and shared development. This will boost R&D activities and contribute to a safe operation of nuclear plants by increasing synergies, limiting inefficiencies, promoting networking, and contributing to standardization.\nIn addition to leading this international effort, EPFL will produce new, open, and high-quality validation data at its . “This is an exciting chance to use our unique facility to bring about a real impact in the nuclear sector,” says Pavel Frajtag, who heads the reactor.\nThe open software and experimental data produced during the project will be distributed to the IAEA member states. This will empower innovation and spread IAEA’s safety culture, notably in developing countries that aim to include nuclear technologies as part of their strategic development targets for public welfare and reduced CO\n2\n emissions.\n“The designation as an IAEA Collaborating Center is a big honor and a strong recognition of EPFL’s reputation, the high nuclear safety standards in our country, and the excellence of nuclear research in Switzerland,” says Andreas Pautz. “It will put the CROCUS reactor on the map of outstanding nuclear facilities, and open pathways to global collaboration.”\nDuring the inauguration ceremony on 12 June, the IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy Mikhail Chudakov presented Professor Andreas Mortensen, vice president of research at EPFL, with the official nomination document (photo).

{"id": 72, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.

However, this information is still far from those of the human hand in terms of naturalness and effectiveness. The solution to this important clinical and scientific problem is in a new research published on \nNeuron, \none of the most prestigious journals in the field of neuroscience, by a group of researchers of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), of the University of Freiburg in Germany and of the Policlinico Gemelli in Rome. The working group coordinated by Prof. Silvestro Micera, professor of Bioengineering at the BioRobotics Institute of the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, and Bertarelli Chair in Translational Neuroengineering at the EPFL, has in fact developed a code capable of transmit for the first time to the nerves of the amputated arm all the variety of perceptions that it would have received from the nerve fibers connected to the tactile receptors of one's hand and then communicate the information useful for the movement in an extremely natural way.\nThe study, entitled \"Biomimetic intraneural sensory feedback enhances sensation naturalness, tactile sensitivity and manual dexterity in a bidirectional prosthesis\", opens up new scenarios in the research on artificial prostheses and their ability to recover as much as possible the naturalness of the missing limb. Through an interdisciplinary approach, which integrates practices deriving from neuroengineering, clinical neurology, and robotics, with computer simulations of the behavior of neurons, it was possible to ascertain that by stimulating the peripheral nerve with information very similar to those that natural finger sensors would provide under normal conditions, the patient is able to receive more natural and effective information.\n\"In this work, we did not start from the robotic hand - explains Giacomo Valle, a doctoral student at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies and first author of the study - but from the source of tactile information, trying to reproduce the dynamics of the natural sensors and nerve fibers that spread from the fingers when a hand touches an object. In this way, we transmitted a signal to the patient's nervous system that was immediately recognized as natural\".\nThis is a significant step forward towards an even more natural hand prosthesis because for the first time all aspects of tactile perception are taken into account. Furthermore, the code developed by the authors of the study can be applied to all prosthetic models, ensuring the sensitivity of perceptions and the effectiveness of movements.\n\"Our results - says Silvestro Micera - will allow prostheses to be both effective and usable in a natural way and not felt like a foreign body. This will significantly increase the clinical impact of these technologies\".\nThe use of the code allows greater sensitivity when the robotic hand comes into contact with an object, exceeding the \"sensory\" limits of traditional prostheses.\n\"Our hand allows us to explore the environment around our person and interact with it. - commented Prof. Paolo Rossini, clinical principal investigator of the study - It allows us to hit hard or to stroke. It allows us to play a keyboard or lift a heavy barbell. All this variety of actions (and a thousand others) is also possible thanks to the sensory information that every movement and contact with an object sends to our nervous system. Losing sensory information is like living in a world without colors and without light / dark contrasts.\"\n\"Being able to feel sensations in a phantom limb, or in a hand that no longer exists - comments Loretana Puglisi, one of the two patients who has experienced the system - is a significant step forward towards the development of truly functional prostheses.

{"id": 74, "text": "Do you speak Scala? Many big companies active on the Web now reply in the affirmative. Twitter, Foursquare , LinkedIn and the internet site of the British newspaper The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) have adopted this programming language, developed at EPFL by Martin Odersky, Professor in the computer science section of the school.\nLast week, its creator announced the launch of a new company, with its offices at the Science Park at Ecublens. It’s called Typesafe, has just raised three million dollars, and will give a serious boost to the Scala language. The main investor in this round of financing – Greylock, based in Boston and in Silicon Valley – is not just any old investor. The company supported Facebook at the time when the social networking site was opening to a mass audience, and had also invested in LinkedIn, from 2004.\nScala is becoming more and more popular with programmers, especially for internet applications. But what’s behind this success? “This language is concise, and enables reductions of on average 50% of the lines of code”, Martin Odersky begins by explaining. What’s more, being very close to Java and completely compatible, it’s very easy to adopt for programmers who are familiar with Java, which has become a true standard on the Internet. Finally, it’s open source, which means that the people who contribute to its development exist in their hundreds, spread across the whole world – although EPFL remains the owner of the copyright.\nLeveraging the multiplication of “cores”\n One of the strengths of Scala is to combine two approaches that are popular in the programming world. One is “object-oriented” – which has always up to now been preferred by industry – and the other “functional programming”, which has been used mainly in academia. The advantage of the latter is that it’s very efficient when it comes to distribute tasks to several processors working in parallel. “Today, progress in IT is exemplified by the multiplication of the number of ‘cores’ in the processors, and no longer in terms of increases in speed”, explains the Professor. “Creating new applications that take advantage of this aspect of the processors is a natural development in programming.” Another advantage is that this approach is perfectly suited to distributed computing, or “cloud computing”, which is becoming more popular with big companies that are active on the Internet. This approach –concentrating on the distribution of tasks to multiple processors – gives Scala its name (from “scaling”).\nWith his new company, Martin Odersky is paving the way for the future of computing. Typesafe provides free-of-charge downloading of a pack of software including Scala, a development tool, and also the Akka platform, created in Sweden, whose inventor Jonas Bonér is also a co-founder of Typesafe. Complementary to Scala, Akka is a middleware designed for the distribution of tasks in large computing centers.\nIn parallel, Typesafe is putting in place a technical support service for its clients. “From around 15 employees today, our team will increase to 25 by the end of the year”, continues Martin Odersky. Most of the employees are developers, working in the EPFL Science Park, Cambridge, Boston – where the company is headquarted – and Uppsala. In just over a couple of weeks, Typesafe will be in the limelight during the second annual « Scala days » event – a meeting of programmers – whose initial occurrence last year at EPFL attracted many specialists.\nTypesafe should thus give a real boost to the Scala language. With a smile on his lips, Martin Odersky expresses his confidence that the “really big players” in this domain will soon be joining in. But as for their names, we’ll just have to be patient . . .", "summary": "Thanks to the raising of three million dollars, Martin Odersky has just created the company Typesafe.

{"id": 75, "text": "Governments across Switzerland are embracing civic technology. This is one of the headline findings of the first Civic Tech Barometer, a survey conducted by researchers from EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR) in partnership with Geneva Canton’s Consultation and Communication Department. The team’s conclusions are based on responses to an online survey sent to municipal, city and cantonal authorities nationwide between August and November 2019. In total, 83 government employees from the French, German and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland submitted answers.\n The idea behind civic technology, or civic tech, is to change the way citizens participate in democratic processes. The LaSUR survey found that the Swiss civic tech landscape is far from uniform. The most common platform types include websites, blogs, open-data repositories, social media, participatory spaces where citizens can submit ideas and suggestions, and open forums for discussion and debate. Yet half of the technologies mentioned by survey respondents are not truly participatory because they are designed more for one-way communication than two-way interaction. \n The survey did, however, reveal a handful of more collaborative platforms, including Crossiety (dubbed the “digital village square”) and Decidim. With such a wide variety of options available, governments are free to choose how involved they want citizens to be in the decision-making process.\nPlanning leads the way\n “Swiss authorities use civic tech across a broad spectrum of policy areas,” says Armelle Hausser, a doctoral assistant at LaSUR who carried out the survey as part of her PhD research. “Chief among these are planning and development, youth services, sport, environment and social action.” In most cases, local executive bodies are the driving force behind civic tech usage – and legal requirements have little to no bearing on such initiatives. In fact, just one-third of the platforms and technologies reported by respondents were developed to meet a legal obligation. \n Conversely, other interested parties – such as project and department managers, citizens’ groups, charities and non-profits – rarely call for the use of civic tech in consultation and participation processes. “This finding is counter-intuitive,” says Professor Vincent Kaufmann, who heads LaSUR. “It suggests that, in Switzerland, citizens still prefer to voice their views through conventional channels, for instance by objecting to planning proposals or by taking part in popular initiatives and referendums.”\nLimited resources\n The team also found that local governments currently allocate little in the way of funding and human resources to civic tech initiatives, preferring in the majority of cases to outsource the process to external providers. “Authorities don’t yet have a clear idea of the roles and skills required for this kind of initiative,” explains Hausser. Yet expectations were high among the respondents, who said they planned to use civic tech to produce more information for public consumption, keep citizens better informed and understand their views, improve transparency, secure public support and widen participation more generally.\n “There are many other plans in the pipeline, including online surveys and participatory mapping platforms,” adds Hausser. “In terms of technology types, a general direction of travel seems to be emerging. But we’ll need to run the survey again to make doubly sure.” What is certain is that Swiss authorities are keen to embrace civic tech, with no fewer than 31 high-priority initiatives planned for the coming year. \nRoom to improve\n The LaSUR team found clear room for improvement in two areas. First, although citizens’ views obtained using civic tech are reflected in accompanying reports, Swiss authorities still tend not to give these views due weight in the final decision-making process. And second, it is still too early to properly assess the impact of the technology on citizen participation. The researchers will have a clearer picture after running their second survey, scheduled for fall 2020.\n The results of the initial survey will be presented at a special event – open to practitioners and other interested parties as well as the wider public – on 3 February 2020 at the 3DD Espace de Concertation in Geneva. Hausser will incorporate the findings into her thesis, which focuses on wider issues around the use of civic tech for public participation in planning processes in Switzerland. Her research is supervised by Prof. Kaufmann and Boris Beaude, in partnership with Geneva Canton.\n«Résultat de l’enquête Baromètre des civic tech en Suisse 2019», Armelle Hausser and Prof. Vincent Kaufmann, 3 February 2020 1.30pm, in French, 3DD espace de concertation, Rue David Dufour 3, Geneva.

The results are .\nA hard drive functions as a data storage device in a computer, where a large amount of data can be stored with an electromagnetically charged surface.\nNowadays, the demand for high capacity hard drives has increased more than ever. Computer users handle large files, databases, image or video files, using software, all of which require a large amount of memory in order to save and process the data as quickly as possible.\nThe EPFL scientists used a halide perovskite/oxide perovskite heterostructure in their new method for reversible, light-induced tuning of ferromagnetism at room temperature. Having a perovskite structure represents a novel class of light-absorbing materials.\nAs reported in the publication,\n“The rise of digitalization led to an exponential increase in demand for data storage. Mass-storage is resolved by hard-disk drives, HDDs, due to their relatively long lifespan and low price. HDDs use magnetic domains, which are rotated to store and retrieve information. However, an increase in capacity and speed is continuously demanded. We report a method to facilitate the writing of magnetic bits optically. We use a sandwich of a highly light sensitive (MAPbI\n3\n) and a ferromagnetic material (LSMO), where illumination of MAPbI\n3\n drives charge carriers into LSMO and decreases its magnetism. This is a viable alternative of the long-sought-after heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology, which would heat up the disk material during the writing process.”\nThe method is still experimental, but it may be used to build the next generation of memory-storage systems, with higher capacities and with low energy demands. The method provides a stand for the development of a new generation of magneto-optical hard drives.

{"id": 77, "text": "Before cell division, the long strings of the cell’s DNA are wrapped tightly into the structures we know as chromosomes. This protects the cell’s genetic material from physical and chemical damage.\nThe ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. These are specialized structures that have to be replicated with each cell division cycle. But the complete replication of telomeres up to the very ends of chromosomes also requires specialized mechanisms, and these are limited. Telomeres are also very sensitive to oxidative damage, which affects their ability to replicate.\nBecause of this, telomeres shrink over time, limiting the lifespan of cells. Telomere shortening is essentially the cause of cell aging.\nNow,  and Wareed Ahmed at EPFL have discovered two antioxidant enzymes that work together to prevent oxidation of telomeric DNA at chromosome ends. The scientists disrupted both the enzymes, called PRDX1 and MTH1, in cancer cells, and found that the cells’ telomeres shrunk with every round of cell division, eventually disappearing altogether.\nOne of the promising targets in cancer therapy is the enzyme telomerase. Normally, telomerase prevents telomeres from shortening in germ and stem cells, which helps with development. But telomerase is also highly active in cancer cells, keeping their telomeres intact and making the cells virtually immortal. The new work shows that disrupting PRDX1 and MTH1 prevents telomerase from counteracting telomere shortening.\nSo far, attempts to efficiently block telomerase in cancer have not been fruitful in the clinic. The discovery of the co-operating enzymes opens up a new opportunity to indirectly block telomerase. “Instead of inhibiting the enzyme itself, we target its substrate – the chromosome end – making it un-extendable by telomerase,” says Lingner.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have identified two enzymes that protect chromosomes from oxidative damage and shortening.

In all, more than 70 individuals could be working in the centre. The research areas concerned – notably engineering, health-related and electronics – correspond to activity sectors identified as crucial for Croatia’s improved economic development. \nInvesting in young researchers – a strategy for a scientific Europe\n EPFL has established a highly effective means of recruiting promising young scientific talents and giving them the means to realize their potential: the “Tenure Track” system, in which they are placed at the head of a research team with a significant budget at their disposal for a seven-year probationary period. Currently, EPFL has 60 of these young tenure track assistant professors in its faculty. In a sign of its success, out of 100 Tenure Track professors who have started their careers at EPFL, more than a third obtained an ERC starting grant – the most prestigious grant awarded by the European Research Council to young researchers, carrying up to €2 million in funding. \n According to EPFL President Patrick Aebischer, measures such as these are necessary not only to stimulate research, but also to enable Europe to retain its most talented researchers. “Young European scientists must often wait for many years before a professorship becomes available. Many of them leave for the U.S., never to return,” he explains. “Whether it’s in Switzerland or in Croatia, we must put a system in place that allows them to reach their full potential and establish their careers in Europe, and in doing so make a local contribution to value and job creation.” \nThe project proposal will soon be submitted to the European Commission \n \"We must promote the career of our young researchers. This is the main expectation of our joint project with EPFL,” explains Saša Zelenika, Croatia’s Vice-Minister of Science, Education and Sports.\n Based on its experience, EPFL will take responsibility for launching and initial management of the institute, with help from international and Croatian scientific committees. The project will be part of the European Horizon 2020 programme, which includes a section entitled “Teaming” that is dedicated to the transfer of expertise and strategies between countries.\n The project proposal will be submitted in September 2014. If approved by the European Commission, EPFL and the Croatian partners will have an additional year to submit a detailed action plan. After a second round of approvals, the winning “Teaming” projects will be funded by the European Commission for up to €15-20 million over a maximum period of seven years.", "summary": "Croatia and EPFL have unveiled the outlines of a project proposal they are jointly submitting to the European Commission that will create a stimulating centre to launch the careers of young professors and stem the “Brain drain” tide.", "claim": "Sport Saša Zelenika and EPFL have unveiled the outlines of a project proposal they are jointly submitting to the European Commission that will create a stimulating centre to launch the careers of young professors and stem the “Brain drain” tide.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 2], "noise": false}

{"id": 80, "text": "Every year, more than a million fish are used for toxicity testing and scientific research in the EU alone, and around 400 fish are needed for a single fish early-life stage test. Such toxicity tests are often required by regulatory authorities for new chemical substances, as fish are particularly sensitive to contaminants in water at early developmental stages. However, the increasing use of experimental animals is ethically questionable. In addition, conventional tests are complex, expensive and take weeks or months to complete. Alternative approaches are therefore being sought by scientists, regulators and industry.\nA promising new method has now been demonstrated by an Eawag study, conducted in collaboration with the ETH, the EPFL and the University of York (UK). The results have been published in the journal Science Advances\n1\n : rather than using live fish (in vivo), the tests are performed with fish cells (in vitro). After just five days, cell-population growth, inhibited to a greater or lesser extent under chemical stress – combined with modelling of toxicological effects – shows excellent agreement with data from independently conducted in vivo experiments.\nEnvironmental toxicologist Professor Kristin Schirmer, who is leading Eawag’s efforts to reduce the use of experimental animals, comments: “This is a major step towards simpler, less expensive and more rapid toxicity testing for the authorisation and use of new chemicals. It’s the first time we’ve been able to use cell cultures to accurately predict chemical effects on growth which would only emerge after weeks or even months in live fish.”\nThe mechanism underlying the new method appears simple: the pesticides used in the study inhibit fish growth – the higher the concentrations to which the animals are exposed, the more their growth is reduced. The same effects were shown for the gill cell populations cultured in the laboratory. Kristin Schirmer explains: “The reason why the results can be extrapolated so well is that bigger fish don’t have bigger cells, but more cells, and we calculate the concentration of the substance in the cells.” The model thus predicts what happens if the fish is exposed to the test substance in water – which in turn can help to refine other tests and predictive models.\nThe new approach is not, however, as simple as it initially appears. To determine what concentrations in cultured cells have the same effects as in live fish requires elaborate modelling and a detailed knowledge of substance properties. In addition, it is not clear whether gill cells will prove to be representative for all types of fish tissue. Other cells may react differently, and other substances may be biotransformed. Nonetheless, the study is of considerable interest for experts because of the novel approach pursued.\nDr Roman Ashauer, who initiated the study and is now working at the University of York, says: “The traditional work flow for chemical risk assessment has been ‘test first, interpret later’. We’ve taken a different approach, by first modifying a relatively simple mathematical model of fish growth and then feeding the necessary experimental data into this model.” The authors hope that this approach will be taken up by other scientists to test its wider applicability, and the initial signs are en-couraging: at a recent Annual Meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC Europe) held in Glasgow, Dr Julita Stadnicka-Michalak, the study’s first author, received the prestigious Young Scientist Award.\n15,000 new substances a day\nAs recently reported\n2\n, the 100 millionth substance has now been registered in the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry – the world’s largest database of chemical substances. With around 15,000 new substances added every day, very few are regulated and even fewer have undergone chemical safety testing. In the past, only about 10 high production volume chemicals have been assessed per year, and throughput would need to be increased 300-fold in order to comply with the EU REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). The main goal of chemical risk assessment is to prevent environmental pollution, thus maintaining a balance between the social and economic benefits of synthetic compounds and the risks they pose to ecosystems.\nOriginal article and reference: \n1\nToxicology across scales: cell population growth in vitro predicts reduced fish growth; Julita Stadnicka Michalak, Kristin Schirmer, Roman Ashauer (2015); Science Advances.

{"id": 81, "text": "Rising temperatures, increasingly intense rainfall and extended periods of drought are some of the known effects of climate change. But how are trees reacting to them? To find out, a team of researchers from EPFL and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) studied two of the most common plant species found in Switzerland and the rest of Europe: beech and spruce trees. The study,* which was recently published in \nGlobal Change Biology\n, revealed that each species reacts differently, with the amount of moisture in the air playing a greater role than was previously thought.\n\"To find out what forests may look like in the future, we have to understand how each plant species will respond to climate change,\" explains Constant Signarbieux, the scientist in charge of the study, which was carried out at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS).\nThe researchers observed five-to-seven-year-old saplings of the two species for four years, from 2012 to 2015. The saplings were collected at the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura mountains during the colder months, and then replanted in three locations at different altitudes: in the small village of St-Georges (at 1,010 meters), in the Vallon Arboretum in Aubonne (at 570 meters), and in the grounds of the EPFL-run Fondation des Bois Chamblard on the shores of Lake Geneva (395 meters). A fourth group of saplings was kept at its original altitude of 1,350 meters and used as a control group.\nYoung trees at the Aubonne's site, and one reference tree at Marchairuz. (c)ECOS\n\"Transplanting these young trees at lower altitudes meant we could simulate the impact of an average temperature increase of between 1 and 6\n°\nC, in keeping with what is forecast to occur between now and 2100 based on a number of climate-change scenarios,” explains Signarbieux.\nTo beech or not to beech? \nBy regularly measuring each tree's trunk and four main branches, the researchers were able to estimate the trees’ biomass. They noticed that the rise in temperature prolonged the growing season – the period from when the first new leaves or needles appear in the spring until they turn yellow in the autumn – in a similar way for each species. However, the two species demonstrated very different biomass growth. The beech trees did well from the rising temperatures, flourishing quickly and becoming more easily acclimatized to the warmer temperatures than the spruce trees. \"Spruces are a more conservative species and perhaps adapt more slowly,\" says the researcher. \"This could have an immediate impact on our forests, as beech trees are more likely to be predominant going forward.\"\nThe researchers didn't stop there. They wanted to learn more about why the two species grew at different rates – and the reason came as quite a surprise. Their analyses revealed that it had nothing to do with either photosynthesis or the amount of water in the ground. Instead, it was all down to the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) – the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can potentially hold at a given temperature. This gives an indication of how dry the air is and how much pressure the plant's water system is under as a result.\nIt’s all about suction\nA plant's leaves contain microscopic pores, called stomata, which regulate how gases move between the leaves and the atmosphere. \"Plants use these stomata to absorb CO\n2\n from the air through diffusion,\" explains Signarbieux. \"When the pores open to let the gas in, water escapes from the leaves at the same time. This process is known as transpiration and occurs because there is always more moisture in the plant than in the air. It is what creates the suction that pulls water and sap from the soil through the roots, up the stalk and into the leaves.\"\nThe drier the air, the higher the VPD and the greater the suction effect will be. When there are several consecutive days with a high VPD – an ever more regular occurrence due to climate change – plants are put under increasing strain. But different plants react in different ways, as shown by the two species studied. Even before there is no water left in the ground, spruce trees close their stomata to prevent any more hydric stress. Beech trees, however, are more tolerant of this type of stress and wait longer before closing their stomata, which enables them to continue absorbing CO\n2\n and therefore keep growing. This gives them a competitive advantage over the spruces.\nIn the past, average seasonal or annual temperatures and rainfall were used to analyze plants' responses to their environment. But those factors alone don’t explain why the beech and spruce trees grow at such different rates. What makes this study truly original and groundbreaking is that the researchers took account of another variable that is often overlooked: the number of hours during which the VPD was above a certain critical level, indicating that the plant was experiencing exceptionally dry conditions. The biologists now intend to expand their research to other species, in the hope of creating a graphic representation of what Europe’s forests will look like in the future – and to help ensure that they are managed and used sustainably.\n*\nConducted as part of the doctoral thesis by Paula Sanginés, a researcher in the ECOS lab.", "summary": "How do trees adjust to the effects of global warming?

In an effort to control the pain, surgeons inject painkillers into the tissue during the operation. When that wears off a day or two later, the patients are given morphine through a catheter placed near the spine. Yet catheters are not particularly comfortable, and the drugs spread throughout the body, affecting all organs.\nResearchers in EPFL’s  at the School of Engineering are now working on a biodegradable implant that would release a local anesthetic on-demand over several days. Not only would this implant reduce patients’ post-op discomfort, but there would be no need for further surgery to remove it. They developed a tiny biodegradable electronic circuit, made from magnesium, that could be heated wirelessly from outside the body.\nOnce integrated into the final device, the circuit will allow to release controlled amounts of anesthetic in a specific location over several days. After that, the implant will degrade safely inside the body. This research has been published in .\nOne capsule with several reservoirs\nThe electronic circuit – a resonant circuit in the shape of a small spiral – is just a few microns thick. When exposed to an alternating electromagnetic field, the spiral resonator produces an electric current that creates heat.\nThe researchers’ end-goal is to pair the resonators with painkiller-filled capsules and then insert them into the tissue during surgery. The contents of the capsules could be released when an electromagnetic field sent from outside the body melts the capsule membrane.\n“We’re at a key stage in our project, because we can now fabricate resonators that work at different wavelengths,” says Matthieu Rüegg, a PhD student and the study’s lead author. “That means we could release the contents of the capsules individually by selecting different frequencies.” The heat-and-release process should take less than a second.\nA novel manufacturing technique\n The researchers had to get creative when it came time to manufacture their biodegradable resonators. “We immediately ruled out any fabrication process that involved contact with water, since magnesium dissolves in just a few seconds,” says Rüegg. They ended up shaping the magnesium by depositing it on a substrate and then showering it with ions. “That gave us more flexibility in the design stage,” he adds. They were eventually able to create some of the smallest magnesium resonators in the world: two microns thick, with a diameter of three millimeters.\nThe team’s invention is not quite ready for the operating room. “We still need to work on integrating the resonators into the final device and show that it’s possible to release drugs both \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n,” concludes Rüegg.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed biodegradable microresonators that can be heated locally with a wireless system.

They must spend 2–6 months working for a company, after which they can also opt for an in-company master’s project to cap off their studies (\nsee text box\n). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.\nA wellspring of innovation\nBut EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.\nThe reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”\nJosep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.\nSupport for small businesses\nThe students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&D.\n“The best possible transition”\nAs delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.\nEve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said. And it was clearly a positive experience on both sides, because the firm hired her as soon as she graduated. Indeed, many students go on to be hired by the companies they work for. “We hire about 20% of our interns,” said Solà i Carós. “The advantage is that they already know our company. Internships bring us a lot of benefits in the short and long term.”\nInternships also give businesses an opportunity to form ties with EPFL laboratories. That could open the door to broader joint research projects financed by Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which aims to encourage technology transfer to industry.\nEPFL internships and master’s projects\nInternships are in general paid and give engineering students an opportunity to spend several months working for a company. They take place away from an academic setting, and the subject must be approved by the school.\nMaster’s projects are students’ final research projects and are closely overseen by an EPFL professor.

{"id": 84, "text": "How can the challenges presented by the ever-growing number of wireless mobile devices and the demand for increasingly high data be met without increasing energy consumption and emission power? Currently MIMO (\nmultiple-input, multiple outputs\n) uses several antennas to transmit and receive signals. This technique is progressively being implemented in devices such as wireless modems and is to be used for the next generation of mobile phones. However, it poses problems because it is costly and difficult to integrate into hardware. \n At EPFL, Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s group has demonstrated that a single antenna can simultaneously transmit two separate signals that have the same throughput as a MIMO solution. The results were published at the beginning of the year, and part of the new findings will be presented by Julien Perruisseau-Carrier, at the IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation in Chicago, at the beginning of July.\t\n In a MIMO system, antennas generally have to be placed at a certain distance from each other, which makes inserting them into mobile and miniature devices a complicated process. An even greater problem with this technique is that each separate transmitting antenna must have its own encoding and amplifying signal device, which is costly and energy-consuming.\nOne antenna, two signals \nAs part of collaboration with researchers from Athens Information Technology (AIT), Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s team developed an antenna capable of emitting simultaneously two information flows, transmitting two independent signals with the same throughput, just as two antennas would do in a MIMO system. This technique called \"Beamspace MIMO\" allows to significantly reduce the number of physical antennas.\n Contrary to what one might think, an antenna does not emit signals in a homogeneous and circular manner. Instead, the repartition of the antenna's radiation is called \"radiation pattern.\" Scientists have managed to decompose this pattern in two, allowing simultaneous emission of two distinct information flows.\n Another advantage of this technique is that only one coding and amplifying device is required to treat the first information flow. The second signal is treated only upstream and then used to make the radiation pattern decomposable. The latter signal acts therefore both as an information carrier and as a mean to decompose the principal pattern. \"This technique allows us to get rid of part of the usual hardware,\" says Julien Perruisseau-Carrier. The process is however difficult and complex. \"One of the biggest challenges is to ensure that each pattern is really independent, to allow an efficient treatment of the information.”\nSuccess thanks to a global approach\t\n The results were obtained through a cross-disciplinary approach. \"This work required us to look at both antennas, particularly reconfigurable ones, and radio coding. Although they are closely linked, these two disciplines are unfortunately often considered separately, which hinders this kind of innovative work,\" explains the scientist.\nJulien Perruisseau-Carrier and his doctoral student Moshen Yousefbeiki are now focusing on a new antenna prototype that will be much more compact and adapted to small mobile devices, such as cell phones and miniature antennas that can be implanted for medical purposes.\nPublication:", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have developed a single antenna that is capable of transmitting the same data as a two-antenna system.

The research team, led by Mirjam Münch, also showed that the effects of light exposure last until the early evening, and that light intensity has an impact on cognitive mechanisms. The results of this research were recently published in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience. \n Light synchronizes our biological clocks. It is collected in the eye by photoreceptors that use photopigments (pigments that change when exposed to light), known as melanopsin. These cells, which differ from rods and cones, are considered a third class of photoreceptors in the retina and were discovered just ten years ago. They’re not there to form an image, but to perceive and absorb photons in the visible light spectrum. In addition, they are stimulated by blue light. \nExploring office lighting \n Münch and her team wanted to know how our circadian rhythm could be influenced by our perception of light during the daytime. They created realistic office lighting conditions and recruited 29 young participants. “For this study, we took into account the intensity of natural and artificial light without specifically evaluating their spectra.”\nFrom daytime to dusk\n To synchronize their internal biological clocks, the volunteers had to maintain a regular sleep schedule during the seven days leading up to the test. They wore bracelets equipped with light sensors and accelerometers, so that the scientists could monitor their movements. \n The study itself took place over two eight-hour sessions. The participants spent the first six hours in an experiment room, first in well-lighted conditions (1000-2000 lux, more or less equivalent to natural light in a room). In the second session, the light intensity was about 170 lux, which is what the eye perceives in a room without a window, lit with artificial light. For this experiment, light intensity was measured at eye-level. Every 30 minutes, the subjects were asked to assess how alert or sleepy they felt. \n Finally, at the end of each session, the participants underwent two hours of supplemental memory tests in a darkened room – less than 6 lux. During these last two hours, the researchers took saliva samples in order to measure cortisol and melatonin concentrations.

When they were subjected to light intensity ten times weaker, however, they showed signs of sleepiness and obtained lower scores on the memory tests. \n These results were observed even in the absence of changes in cortisol and melatonin concentrations in their saliva. “With this study, we have discovered that light intensity has a direct effect on the subjective feeling of sleepiness as well as on objective cognitive performance, and that the benefits of more intense light during the daytime last long past the time of exposure,” concludes Münch.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences our cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until early evening.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences our cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until daytime.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [24, 24], "noise": false}
{"id": 86, "text": "A leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, colon cancer is famously resistant to treatment. There are many reasons for this, but one has to do with a group of persisting cancer cells in the colon that cause relapses. Conventional therapies against them are mostly ineffective. EPFL scientists have now identified a biological mechanism that can be exploited to counteract colon cancer relapses. The approach activates a protein that is lost in the persisting cancer cells. The researchers were able to reactivate it using vitamin A, thus eliminating the cancer cells and preventing metastasis. The study  and introduces a new way to treat colon cancer.\nWhen a colon-cancer patient receives treatment, e.g. chemotherapy, most of the cancer cells die off. But the genetic mutations that caused the cancer in the first place can survive in a specific group of cells of the colon. These are actually stem cells, meaning that they are premature cells waiting to grow into full-blown, normal cells of the colon. After cancer treatment ends, the surviving stem cells, still containing the cancerous mutations, can reappear and cause a relapse.\n studied how differentiated colon cells come from stem cells in the gut. Using an array of different techniques, the team looked at cells, mouse models and samples from human patients.\nProteins and signaling pathways \nThe study focused on a protein called HOXA5, which belongs to a family of proteins that regulate the development of the fetus. These proteins are made during early development and work together to make sure that every tissue is correctly identified and that the fetus’s body and limbs are patterned properly. In the adult body, proteins like HOXA5 regulate the body’s stem cells to maintain both the identity and function of different tissues. Huelsken’s team found that in the gut, HOXA5 plays a major role in restricting the number of stem cells, as well as the cells that make them.\nLike all proteins, HOXA5 originates from a specific gene. The study showed that the cancerous stem cells of the colon use a biological mechanism that blocks it. This mechanism is called a “signaling pathway” because it involves a domino of molecules, each activating the next one down the line. The purpose of a signaling pathway is to transmit biological information from one part of the cell to another, e.g. from the outer membrane all the way to the nucleus. By blocking the HOXA5 gene, the cancerous stem cells of the colon can grow uncontrollably and spread, causing relapses and metastasis.\nRetinoids: a way to fight back \nThe researchers looked for ways to reverse the blocking of HOXA5. The answer came from vitamin A. This small chemical structure is called a retinoid, and it has been known to induce differentiation of stem cells in the skin. The EPFL scientists found that retinoids can re-activate HOXA5. In mice that had colon cancer, the treatment with retinoids blocked tumor progression and normalized the tissue. By turning the gene for HOXA5 back on, this treatment eliminated cancer stem cells and prevented metastasis in the live animals. The researchers got similar results with samples from actual patients.\nThe new study suggests that patients that may profit from this well-tolerated treatment can be identified based on their expression pattern for the HOXA5 gene. Retinoid differentiation therapy could be significantly effective against colon cancer, not only for treatment of existing disease but also as a preventive measure in high-risk patients.\nThis study included contributions from EPFL’s core facilities, Kyoto University, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency. It was funded by EMBO, the Swiss League against Cancer, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the NCCR in Molecular Oncology.\nReference\nOrdóñez-Morán P, Dafflon C, Imajo M, Nishida E, Huelsken J. \nHOXA5 Counteracts Stem Cell Traits by Inhibiting Wnt Signaling in Colorectal Cancer.\nCancer Cell \n14 December 2015.

{"id": 87, "text": "“Digititalization is often compared to a huge wave surging across the earth. People need to know the basics if they want to ride that wave confidently and have trust in it,” says Martin Vetterli, President of the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). Vetterli intends to help anchor that trust, which is essential for an open, democratic society, economic prosperity, and personal freedom, and to that end has announced a new \nCenter for Digital Trust\n based at EPFL. The statement was made during the 2017 Cybersecurity day (), held at EPFL in the presence of Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin.\nIndividual citizens and major multinationals alike must adapt to the changes being imposed by digitalization – whether that involves learning how to use new software or adapting to new working methods. Such technological progress is paving the way to Industry 4.0, a new paradigm where companies must rethink their entire business models. These challenges are at the top of the agenda for business leaders and policymakers alike; Switzerland alone counts over 80 recent parliamentary actions on the issue.\nSwitzerland is in key position to catch the opportunities\n The digital revolution is nothing less than a goldmine of opportunity for Switzerland. The country’s long tradition of neutrality, together with its world-caliber expertise recognized by research institutions across the globe, make it ideally placed to lay the groundwork for the new concept of digital trust. “Digital trust will be at the core of our strategy,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, the Center’s academic director. “We want to become a center of excellence in the field, where all of our partners – regardless of how they are using digital services – can find answers to their questions and support for their goals.”\nThe Center will address the three critical challenges of this digital era: cybersecurity, which involves making sure that data transferred across networks cannot be hacked; transparency, which means making it clear how data is processed, sent and stored; and personal data protection, so that sensitive information, such as bank account details and medical records, stays out of malevolent hands. Engineers at the Center will work in parallel to develop new systems and methods in all three areas.\nHigh-level partners in close relationship to the citizens and the industry\n The Center will combine EPFL’s renowned expertise in cybersecurity, sensitive data protection and blockchain and smart-contracting technology with the advanced capabilities of institutions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), as well as companies including ELCA, SICPA, Swisscom, Swissquote, SGS and SwissRe, who have already stated their strong interest in joining the Center.\nThese partner organizations are in direct contact with individuals and businesses, and will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution. The organizations will also contribute their own experts to the research being done at EPFL in order to develop solutions to concrete problems, and will help to fund the Center.\nTwo new EPFL chairs and 24 labs involved\n EPFL has created two new teaching and research chairs in digital trust, and the search for candidates is already under way. The School also has 24 research labs in this field, mostly within the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, the School of Life Sciences and the College of Management of Technology. “It’s a genuine ecosystem that addresses the needs of the entire population. The challenges are so great that there’s no way we could overcome them without a cross-disciplinary approach,” says Hubaux. The first step will be to develop trust technologies and systems that can form a bedrock of trust between users and service providers – thereby encouraging the adoption and effective use of new technology.\nDesigned with ambitious goals in mind, the Center got an additional boost from the Swiss Federal Parliament’s decision to cap budget cuts in the areas of education, research and innovation. EPFL will leverage this opportunity to invest in research that will tackle not only the challenges mentioned above, but also those that are bound to come.\nSupport from the Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland\n The Conference of Ministers of Economy of Western Switzerland (the cantons of Vaud, Neuchatel, Valais, Geneva, Bern, Fribourg and Jura), currently headed by Pierre Maudet, a member of Geneva’s cantonal government, has applauded the initiative. “This new partnership between the public and private sectors will position Switzerland as a major player in both cybersecurity and the digital trust that our society needs. We encourage all companies and research institutions working in this field to join in,” says Maudet. Philippe Leuba, the member of the Vaud cantonal government who handles innovation-linked relations between the cantonal government and EPFL, adds: “Our region is home to businesses and institutions at the forefront of digital technology, and which attract top-quality international investment. Their position as pioneers in this new partnership with EPFL augurs well for the development of Industry 4.0 in our country.”", "summary": "EPFL President Martin Vetterli has today unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust.

On the screen of the device developed by Aïmago, a start-up company located in EPFL’s Science Park, the microcirculation in the tissue is displayed in real time. It’s a gain in both time and reliability for the specialist. “In comparison, the expert’s eye or the “needle test” to measure sensitivity only provide an accurate assessment of the severity of the burn about two times out of three,” notes the company’s leader, Michael Friedrich. Other areas of medicine such as plastic surgery, wound healing, diabetes, rheumatology and neurosurgery could also benefit from this innovative device.\n The EasyLDI device, invented in EPFL’s Biomedical Optics Laboratory (LOB), is extremely simple to use. Its screen faces the user, and on the other side is a camera. The whole thing is mounted on a flexible arm. When the device is held above the zone in question, the microcirculation is displayed like a topographical map. The color variations reveal differences in microcirculation intensity over a volume of skin some 50 cm2 in area and 1-2 mm deep. Heartbeat and vasomotion are also displayed. Covered with a sterile sleeve, the device can also be used in the operating room.\n The apparatus is based on laser Doppler technology, a method that has already been proven reliable in evaluating wound depth. But existing machines are bulky and complicated to use. In this device, a laser beam is reflected by red blood cells and static tissue. The Doppler effect (the frequency lag between the emitted and reflected light beam) is transformed into color variations on the interface using a camera developed in the Biomedical Optics Laboratory that can obtain 20,000 images per second and analyze them pixel by pixel.\nIn late August, EPFL professor Theo Lasser from the LOB and Friedrich (Aïmago) were awarded the 2011 CTI Swiss MedTech Award. Their project was selected to win the 10,000 Swiss franc award by an expert audience of around 550 representatives from the fields of research and industry, who designated it the best of the three nominated projects.", "summary": "A device developed by Aïmago, a start-up in EPFL’s Science Park, shows how blood is circulating in the skin.

Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

{"id": 90, "text": "One day, a virtual version of your own heart pumping may help doctors diagnose heart disease and determine the best treatment for you, without the need of surgical intervention or other invasive clinical practices. EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni’s goal is precisely this as he builds mathematical tools to simulate heart function with increasing accuracy and that can be personalized to your heart based on medical scans. He recently added the behavior of a patient-specific aortic valve to his overall functioning heart model. The results are published June 7th in \nBiomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology\n.\nA personalized virtual heart for preventing cardiovascular disease\nThe human heart is an extraordinarily complex organ that pumps an estimated 180 million liters of blood, which would fill more than seven Olympic-sized swimming pools in one’s lifetime, thereby ensuring that oxygenated blood reaches the entire body. Cardiovascular problems may lead to malfunction, disease, or death. Heart disease causes 40% of deaths in the EU and costs an estimated 196 billion a year, yet 80% of acquired heart diseases and stroke episodes are preventable.\nQuarteroni aims to help prevent or treat cardiovascular disease by providing a personalized virtual heart to patients, essentially a detailed mathematical description of a patient’s heart and how it functions – or malfunctions.\nEvery person’s heart is unique. Correctly modeling the intricacies of each individual heart therefore requires a customizable mathematical description of both its geometry and its dynamics. But doing so in a mathematically sound way is no easy task; it requires large amounts of patient-specific data and computational power to solve complex equations. Thanks to increasingly powerful computers, building a realistic virtual heart is becoming a reality.\nHow to build a virtual aortic valve\nIn constructing a virtual heart that is complete and functional, the aortic valve cannot be neglected. Quarteroni and his team recently added to their heart model the way blood flows from inside the heart into the aorta, taking into account the complex shapes and properties of the aorta’s physiological membranes: the valve leaflets.\n“A mathematical description of the aortic valve and its interaction with blood flow exists in the literature, but not at this level of detail for a specific patient,” says Quarteroni.\nFrom MRI scans of a patient, they reconstructed the shape of the aorta, which they represented using a 3D computational mesh. Using mathematical tools to characterize the mechanics of the valve, they described the movement of three triangular-shaped leaflets that make up the aortic valve. To determine how blood flows inside of the atria, the heart’s cavities, they next approximated and numerically solved the mathematical equations (Navier-Stokes) that describe viscous fluid dynamics, adapting them for a patient-specific geometry. Even with this preliminary work, it is a relatively easy task to personalize the model to another patient by using a new set of MRI scans.\nAs the director of iHeart, an EU-funded project, Quarteroni’s long-term vision is to build patient-specific virtual models of the entire cardiovascular system, including the heart, all of the body’s blood vessels, and of the approximately five liters of blood flowing through the body. \n“If successful, \niHeart \nwill help clinicians to tackle important questions efficiently, both in diagnostics and treatment, with a tremendous impact for society,” says Quarteroni. “It will provide a unique, unprecedented research environment for exploring the heart with an immensely powerful and non–invasive mathematical microscope, making it possible to simulate cardiovascular disease, like carotid stenosis and aneuryisms that can affect the heart, the abdomen, the brain and other parts the body.”\nQuarteroni believes that a personalized virtual heart model may become clinically available in less than a decade. Earlier prototypes of the virtual model may be developed and tested sooner, possibly within a five-year horizon. This will require significant investment in the development of robust mathematical and numerical tools to simulate heart function that is tailored to a specific patient.", "summary": "EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni and his team are building a virtual heart model based on personalized medical images that may one day help cardiologists and cardiac surgeons non-invasively diagnose pathological heart conditions.

These visits are becoming more popular every year: 2050 have registered for this year’s event, 400 more than in 2010, and 600 more than in 2009. “The growing reputation of EPFL certainly accounts for the high attendance”, comments Maya Fruehauf, who is responsible for promoting undergraduate courses. The large majority of the sixth formers come from French-speaking Switzerland (a special day is organized in January for those from the German-speaking area and Ticino), but over 450 are travelling from France. “Our visits to certain high schools and a stand at the “Salon de l’Etudiant” student fair in Paris, as well as word-of-mouth, have all worked well”, she points out. It’s also worth remembering that the degrees awarded by the School are accredited in France by the Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur (CTI), and that students selected by the ENS in Lyon, and who have passed its entrance test, may join various departments without examination. Other young people are coming from even further afield: in particular from the USA, Sweden, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Despite this surge of interest, the percentage of girls attending the open days remains stable at around 35%.\nFaced with this wave of interest, Thursday’s general information event has been reorganized for lack of a hall big enough, to be replaced by three sessions over the course of the day at the Rolex Learning Center conference hall. To get a general idea of the range of courses, the sixth-formers will take part in information sessions offered by the departments. The current students will also help by showing them around “their” campus. The second day will enable those with a greater level of interest – that is, over 75% of the participants – to soak up the atmosphere of a department, attend workshops and meet the specialists. Almost 200 people (including undergraduates and doctoral students, professors, and those working in industry) will be called upon to answer questions from the sixth-formers during the practical exercises, discussion sessions, mealtimes, etc. “The aim is to attract new students who have made an informed choice,” points out Maya Fruehauf, “and not to promise them a ‘perfect’ education.” The number of sixth-formers registered for each department reflects the proportion of students in the department. For example, architecture and life sciences have over 100 signed up, which is more than communication systems, electricity or materials. “We don’t know how many of those attending the open days will actually enrol at the start of the 2011 academic year,” emphasizes Maya Fruehauf, “but a survey conducted among new students indicated that around half of them rated these information events most highly in the list of factors that influenced their choice.”", "summary": "There will be quite a crowd on campus today!

Two minutes and forty-two seconds. That was the first round of the day’s competition, and Jules and his teammates were pretty happy with their performance. Their top spun for longer than their opponents’, who used a drill to get theirs going.\nForty-five teams came from all over French-speaking Switzerland to compete in one of three age groups. The teams comprised three or four kids from the same age group, together with a coach. Three months before the competition, the teams were all given the same experimental challenge. This year, it was to build a top that would spin for as long as possible. “We used really basic materials,” said ten-year-old Eline. “We took a ten-centimeter-long piece of ash wood, sharpened the end with a pencil sharpener, and hammered it into a piece of fiberboard that we had cut into a round shape using a hole saw.” Good explanation from this extremely enthusiastic team, which was competing in the middle age group.\nPresenting the results of their research project\n In the second round of the competition, the kids had to present the results of a scientific project that they had completed before the competition, along with their conclusions. A team from the youngest age category explained to a jury how to make various types of vortexes with different liquids and vessels. Eight-year-old Clément, backed by a diagram projected onto a screen, used his hands to illustrate the direction in which the earth rotates. Matias, also eight years old, then continued: “I asked my brother, who’s in Australia, to check whether vortexes really do turn the other way down there.” His brother also participated in this competition once. “This interest in science runs in the family,” said his dad, who was the team’s coach that day.\nThat’s just what this competition is designed to bring out: the goal is to get kids interested in science and research. “They may not yet have the mathematical tools to understand and model a scientific problem,” said Andrea Fabian Montabert, who was in charge of organizing the competition. “But they can still come up with hypotheses, set up an experiment and improve their results through trial and error. And they can make observations and draw conclusions.” The competition lets kids try their hand at scientific and technical experiments in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\nTeamwork and cooperation\n After taking a short quiz designed to test their general science knowledge, the competitors played a fun game that required solid teamwork. They had to cross an imaginary swamp and feed a paper crocodile – but they had to be quick and nimble and work together effectively. Professor André Châtelain, who used to run EPFL’s Experimental Physics Institute, brought the competition to a close with a short talk on scientific curiosity.\nAt the end of the competition, the kids all went home.

The 30-year old researcher, who was recently named an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), came to speak at EPFL’s Open Science Day. Martin Vetterli took advantage of that opportunity to sit down with her and ask her a few questions about their field of shared interest.\nMV: “It’s pretty unusual for someone to become a star researcher at such a young age. How did you get into science?\nKB: I was very interested in science as a kid. When I was in third grade, I remember looking under rocks all the time. And as I got older, I was constantly drawn to the different science topics covered in class. In sixth grade, I first got involved in science fair projects, and I continued doing that on and off through high school. Then, when I tried out research for the first time, I was thrilled: it was so different from a homework set, where you know there’s a solution even if it’s difficult to find. Research was a new way of thinking and problem-solving for me, and I found that very exciting.\nHow did you get into computer science?\nIt wasn’t until high school, when a friend convinced me to take a computer science class. At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago. Initially, they didn’t believe their results and reran the experiment several times. Some things have changed since then, but we’re still dealing with noisy data, right?\nYes, when we first created the black-hole image, or at least the day we got the data, we entered it into an imaging script and a ring appeared. I actually went from being really excited to being mad at the colleagues who gave us the data – which I was convinced were fake. It just seemed too good to be true! Nothing ever works like that the first time. It was just so much more beautiful than any synthetic data we had created. It actually took weeks before I believed the data were real, and that our colleagues weren’t trying to trick us or test us.", "summary": "The first-ever image of a black hole was unveiled to the public this past April.

{"id": 94, "text": "Most rod-shaped bacteria divide by splitting into two around the middle after their DNA has replicated safely and segregated to opposite ends of the cell. This seemingly simple process actually demands tight and precise coordination, which is achieved through two biological systems: nucleoid occlusion, which protects the cell’s genetic material from dividing until it replicates and segregates, and the “minicell” system, which localizes the site of division around the middle of the cell, where a dividing wall will form to split it in two. But some pathogenic bacteria, e.g. \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n, don’t use these mechanisms. EPFL scientists have now combined optical and atomic force microscopy to track division in such bacteria for the first time, and have discovered that they use instead an undulating “wave-pattern” along their length to mark future sites of division. The findings are .\nThe work was carried out jointly by the labs of  and  at EPFL. The scientists wanted to understand how bacteria that do not have the genes for nucleoid occlusion and the minicell system “decide” where and when to divide. This is important, as many pathogenic bacteria fall into this category, and knowing how they divide can open up new ways to fight them.\nThe researchers focused on \nMycobacterium smegmatis\n, a non-pathogenic relative of \nM. tuberculosis\n. Neither of these bacteria uses the two “conventional” biological systems for coordinating division, meaning that a non-conventional approach was needed for studying them. \nThe researchers combined two types of microscopy to track the life cycle of the bacteria. The first technique was optical microscopy, which uses fluorescent labels for “seeing” various biological structures and biomolecules. The second technique was atomic force microscopy, which provides extremely high-resolution images of structures on the cell surface by “feeling” the surface with a tiny mechanical probe, much like a blind person can form a three-dimensional mental image of an object by passing their hands over its surface.\n“This experiment constitutes the longest continuous atomic force microscopy experiment ever performed on growing cells,” says Georg Fantner, while John McKinney adds: “It illustrates the power of new technologies not only to analyze the things we already knew about with greater resolution, but also to discover new things that we hadn’t anticipated.”\nArmed with a custom-built instrument that combines the two techniques, the scientists created long-term time-lapses of the growth and division of the bacteria over multiple generations. Unexpectedly, they found that the bacteria produce undulating “trough-like” patterns across their length. These morphological landmarks on the undulating surface of mycobacterial cells correspond to future sites of cell division. \nThe troughs are roughly repeating waves, which the scientists calculated to have an average wavelength of ~1.8 μm, and an amplitude too small to resolve with conventional microscopes (about 100 nm). This might be the reason why waveform troughs have not been reported before. \nThe time-lapse images also showed that, after the mycobacterium divides, the new “daughter” cells inherit the “mother” cell’s wave-trough pattern, and ultimately divide at the center-most wave-trough.\nWave-troughs can form up to three generations before they are used as division sites. According to Alexander Eskandarian, the lead author of the study, these morphological features are “by far the earliest known landmark of future division sites in bacteria.\" Building on these observations, future research will focus on identifying the underlying mechanisms responsible for wave-trough formation and propagation and recruitment of the cell division machinery.\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the Innovative Medicines Initiative, the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7), and the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO).\nReference\nHaig A.

{"id": 95, "text": "Katie Bouman was one of 200 scientists who helped create the first-ever image of a black hole, released this past April. The 30-year old researcher, who was recently named an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), came to speak at EPFL’s Open Science Day. Martin Vetterli took advantage of that opportunity to sit down with her and ask her a few questions about their field of shared interest.\nMV: “It’s pretty unusual for someone to become a star researcher at such a young age. How did you get into science?\nKB: I was very interested in science as a kid. When I was in third grade, I remember looking under rocks all the time. And as I got older, I was constantly drawn to the different science topics covered in class. In sixth grade, I first got involved in science fair projects, and I continued doing that on and off through high school. Then, when I tried out research for the first time, I was thrilled: it was so different from a homework set, where you know there’s a solution even if it’s difficult to find. Research was a new way of thinking and problem-solving for me, and I found that very exciting.\nHow did you get into computer science?\nIt wasn’t until high school, when a friend convinced me to take a computer science class. At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago. Initially, they didn’t believe their results and reran the experiment several times. Some things have changed since then, but we’re still dealing with noisy data, right?\nYes, when we first created the black-hole image, or at least the day we got the data, we entered it into an imaging script and a ring appeared. I actually went from being really excited to being mad at the colleagues who gave us the data – which I was convinced were fake. It just seemed too good to be true! Nothing ever works like that the first time. It was just so much more beautiful than any synthetic data we had created. It actually took weeks before I believed the data were real, and that our colleagues weren’t trying to trick us or test us.", "summary": "The first-ever image of a black hole was unveiled to the public this past April.

{"id": 96, "text": "For many poor farmers in India and Africa, finger millet is a major staple food. The crop species is not only a rich source of minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and zinc, and it contains many vitamins and essential amino acids. The plant is also characterized by its resistance to drought and heat. As it is very healthy and gluten-free, it is finding increased use as a food in industrial countries as well. Despite its importance, finger millet has been given very little scientific attention until now.\nLarge and complex genome due to fusion of two plant species\nFinger millet arose through the hybridization of two different plant species. The plant is therefore polyploid, which means it has a four-fold set of chromosomes and almost twice as many genes as its original species. The size and complexity of the genome are thought to have conferred the broad environmental tolerance of finger millet, while making genome research extremely difficult. For the first time, an international team of researchers from the University of Zurich has now managed to decode the complex genome of finger millet in great detail. It comprises about 2.6 million base pairs and has more than 62,300 genes – about twice as many as rice, for example.\nNew strategy for genome sequencing and mapping\nA good 57,900 finger millet genes – over 90 percent – occur in more than two copies. As their DNA sequences are very similar, it was difficult to correctly allocate the numerous, decoded DNA sections within the entire genome. In cooperation with Ralph Schlapbach and Sirisha Aluri from the Functional Genomics Center at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, the team headed up by Kentaro Shimizu, professor at the UZH Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, has managed to overcome these difficulties. For this purpose, the scientists combined a sophisticated bioinformatics strategy developed by Masaomi Hatakeyama that uses state-of-the-art sequencing methods with a new technology that can optically map the long, individual DNA molecules in the genome. “Our newly developed strategy will help sequence the genome of other polyploid cultivated plants that have not been able to be determined until now,” Shimizu says.\nImproving the supply of nutrients and drought resistance\nAn interdisciplinary team of researchers from Zurich and Bangalore, India, worked together on this project. The work was supported by Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (ISCB), a bilateral research and development program financed by the Swiss and Indian governments, as well as by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The objective is to improve food security and to develop the capacity of biotechnological research in India. “The newly available genome data of finger millet opens up numerous possibilities for modern plant breeding,” Shimizu emphasizes. “On the one hand, to help people with mineral deficiencies in India and in industrialized countries and, on the other hand, to make important crop plants more resistant to drought and aridness.”\nLiterature\n:\nMasaomi Hatakeyama, Sirisha Aluri, Mathi Thumilan Balachadran, Sajeevan Radha Sivarajan, Andrea Patrignani, Simon Grüter, Lucy Poveda, Rie Shimizu-Inatsugi, John Baeten, Kees-Jan Francoijs, Karaba N.

{"id": 98, "text": "Mission accomplished! The CHEOPS satellite, named for “CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite,” successfully blasted off into space on Wednesday after a technical fault with the carrier rocket pushed the launch back by 24 hours. The satellite, which will search for planets orbiting around distant stars, is now flying along its planned path, some 700 km above the Earth’s surface. CHEOPS is the culmination of six years of work, much of which was carried out at the University of Bern and University of Geneva, in collaboration with researchers from EPFL’s Space Center (eSpace) and with support from the European Space Agency (ESA). The launch comes seven days after two astrophysicists from the University of Geneva – Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz – received the Nobel Prize in Physics in Stockholm for their 1995 discovery of the first exoplanet.\nThe satellite, which is equipped with a high-precision telescope, will seek out new exoplanets by looking for tiny variations in a star’s brightness as a planet passes between it and Earth – a method known as transit photometry. CHEOPS will also gather more information about known exoplanets, including their size, orbital elements, atmosphere and evolution, as well as their composition and nature: telluric, gas, ice giant, surface water and other features.\nEPFL involved from the outset\nThe project was a collaborative effort between three Swiss institutions: EPFL, the University of Geneva and the University of Bern. Engineers at eSpace were involved in the early phases of the mission, and worked on the satellite’s initial design. In 2012 the ESA selected CHEOPS, based on that initial design, as its first small-class (or S-class) mission, a type of smaller-scale program intended to promote innovation and education. From that point on, EPFL’s involvement largely revolved around designing the software that would be used to analyze the raw data sent back by the satellite.\nSince the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995, over 4,000 more have been added to the list – orbiting around some 3,000 stars, and all within 400 light years of the Sun. Thousands of other candidates have been detected, mainly by ground-based telescopes, but are pending confirmation. Extrapolating these numbers suggests that there could be at least 100 billion exoplanets in our galaxy alone.\nCHEOPS separated from its carrier rocket around 2 hours and 30 minutes after launch and is expected to begin sending back data in early 2020.\nPicture: (c)ESA", "summary": "The CHEOPS satellite was put into orbit on Wednesday, a day later than planned, from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.

Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

And it can connect users with people outside the home – caregivers, friends or family members can send text or voice messages to Ouay through a special app and Ouay reads the messages out loud. By providing a constant connection, the system allows elderly patients to remain independent while at the same time reassuring everyone involved that help is never far away. It has already been tested by several organizations that provide home-care services to the elderly.\nToday there is a host of new systems for helping the elderly or handicapped live on their own, as well as a growing number of specially equipped apartment buildings. These developments are often motivated by the dual goals of improving patients’ lives and keeping costs down. And recent technological advancements, such as in sensors and alert systems, are supporting this trend. But the two people behind the idea for Ouay – Sven Borden, a first-year Master’s student in microengineering at EPFL, and Loïc Rochat, a student in mechanical engineering – found that there was one key element missing, based on their personal experience with elderly people. “We needed a reliable device that patients can use to easily communicate with people outside the home. That would help them feel more independent,” says Borden. They fleshed out their idea at the Zurich hackathon, a weekend-long brainstorming marathon where would-be entrepreneurs come with a business idea and draft a business plan. Once the hackathon was over, the duo took their business plan and decided to run with it.\nA reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit at EPFL \nBorden and Rochat teamed up with other students from EPFL, HEC and HE-ARC, and then spoke with local caregivers and patients in order to pinpoint their needs. “I think Ouay is a good reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit we have here at EPFL,” says Borden. The students initially set up an association to build up their network and pool their funds. Since this initial investment, Ouay has expanded its reach considerably; the student team received an XGrant (financial support that EPFL provides to student startups) as well as a CHF 20,000 FIT Digital grant from Vaud’s Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). The proceeds were used to create the prototypes that are currently being tested by home-care providers.\nHelping people fall asleep with remote hypnosis \nFor elderly patients, even minor inconveniences – like not being able to find something in their apartment or a nurse showing up late – can cause a great deal of stress. And caring for elderly patients can also cause stress for friends and family.

{"id": 110, "text": "Rising temperatures, increasingly intense rainfall and extended periods of drought are some of the known effects of climate change. But how are trees reacting to them? To find out, a team of researchers from EPFL and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) studied two of the most common plant species found in Switzerland and the rest of Europe: beech and spruce trees. The study,* which was recently published in \nGlobal Change Biology\n, revealed that each species reacts differently, with the amount of moisture in the air playing a greater role than was previously thought.\n\"To find out what forests may look like in the future, we have to understand how each plant species will respond to climate change,\" explains Constant Signarbieux, the scientist in charge of the study, which was carried out at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS).\nThe researchers observed five-to-seven-year-old saplings of the two species for four years, from 2012 to 2015. The saplings were collected at the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura mountains during the colder months, and then replanted in three locations at different altitudes: in the small village of St-Georges (at 1,010 meters), in the Vallon Arboretum in Aubonne (at 570 meters), and in the grounds of the EPFL-run Fondation des Bois Chamblard on the shores of Lake Geneva (395 meters). A fourth group of saplings was kept at its original altitude of 1,350 meters and used as a control group.\nYoung trees at the Aubonne's site, and one reference tree at Marchairuz. (c)ECOS\n\"Transplanting these young trees at lower altitudes meant we could simulate the impact of an average temperature increase of between 1 and 6\n°\nC, in keeping with what is forecast to occur between now and 2100 based on a number of climate-change scenarios,” explains Signarbieux.\nTo beech or not to beech? \nBy regularly measuring each tree's trunk and four main branches, the researchers were able to estimate the trees’ biomass. They noticed that the rise in temperature prolonged the growing season – the period from when the first new leaves or needles appear in the spring until they turn yellow in the autumn – in a similar way for each species. However, the two species demonstrated very different biomass growth. The beech trees did well from the rising temperatures, flourishing quickly and becoming more easily acclimatized to the warmer temperatures than the spruce trees. \"Spruces are a more conservative species and perhaps adapt more slowly,\" says the researcher. \"This could have an immediate impact on our forests, as beech trees are more likely to be predominant going forward.\"\nThe researchers didn't stop there. They wanted to learn more about why the two species grew at different rates – and the reason came as quite a surprise. Their analyses revealed that it had nothing to do with either photosynthesis or the amount of water in the ground. Instead, it was all down to the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) – the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can potentially hold at a given temperature. This gives an indication of how dry the air is and how much pressure the plant's water system is under as a result.\nIt’s all about suction\nA plant's leaves contain microscopic pores, called stomata, which regulate how gases move between the leaves and the atmosphere. \"Plants use these stomata to absorb CO\n2\n from the air through diffusion,\" explains Signarbieux. \"When the pores open to let the gas in, water escapes from the leaves at the same time. This process is known as transpiration and occurs because there is always more moisture in the plant than in the air. It is what creates the suction that pulls water and sap from the soil through the roots, up the stalk and into the leaves.\"\nThe drier the air, the higher the VPD and the greater the suction effect will be. When there are several consecutive days with a high VPD – an ever more regular occurrence due to climate change – plants are put under increasing strain. But different plants react in different ways, as shown by the two species studied. Even before there is no water left in the ground, spruce trees close their stomata to prevent any more hydric stress. Beech trees, however, are more tolerant of this type of stress and wait longer before closing their stomata, which enables them to continue absorbing CO\n2\n and therefore keep growing. This gives them a competitive advantage over the spruces.\nIn the past, average seasonal or annual temperatures and rainfall were used to analyze plants' responses to their environment. But those factors alone don’t explain why the beech and spruce trees grow at such different rates. What makes this study truly original and groundbreaking is that the researchers took account of another variable that is often overlooked: the number of hours during which the VPD was above a certain critical level, indicating that the plant was experiencing exceptionally dry conditions. The biologists now intend to expand their research to other species, in the hope of creating a graphic representation of what Europe’s forests will look like in the future – and to help ensure that they are managed and used sustainably.\n*\nConducted as part of the doctoral thesis by Paula Sanginés, a researcher in the ECOS lab.", "summary": "How do trees adjust to the effects of global warming?

Mirko Kovac, from EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, is a young robotics engineer who has already made leaps forward in the field with his grasshopper-inspired jumping robot.\nHe and his collaborators have created an innovative perching mechanism where the robot flies head first into the object, a tree for example—without being destroyed— and attaches to almost any type of surface using sharp prongs. It then detaches on command. The goal is to create robots that can travel in swarms over rough terrain to come to the aide of catastrophe victims.\n “We are not blindly imitating nature, but using the same principles to possibly improve on it,” explains Kovac, who recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL. “Simple behavioral laws such as jumping, flying and perching lead to complex control over movement without the need for high computational power.”\n Jumping, gliding and perching allow for mobility over rocky territory or destroyed urban areas. This new form of AI takes its inspiration from the insect world, but is more as an abstract reflection on their instincts and design principles than merely imitating their morphology. This simplicity allows for greater mobility since the robots are not bogged down with heavy batteries. Kovac imagines swarms of his robots equipped with different sensors and small cameras that could be deployed over devastated areas to transmit essential information back to rescue command centers.\n The labs most recent innovation, perching a robot, saves valuable energy by allowing the robot to rest like insects or birds do. Many previous perching mechanisms include a complicated swooping maneuver to decrease momentum and land on legs, often without the ability of detaching. The mechanism developed by Dr Kovac and Jürg Markus Germann, recently published in the Journal of Micro-Nano Mechatronics, avoids this problem by using two spring-loaded arms fitted with pins that dig into the surface, whether it is wood or concrete. The snapping of the arms creates a forward momentum, allowing for a soft deceleration of the glider and avoiding mechanical damage. A remotely controlled mini-motor then detracts the pins and allows the robot to continue on its way.\n “I am fascinated by the creative process,” says Kovac, “and how it is possible to use the sophistication found in nature to create something completely new.” The perching mechanism can be easily adapted to other robots. His previous robot, a quarter-gram jumping robot that can achieve heights of up to four and a half feet, could now be fitted with the new perching mechanism as well as wings, thus creating a hybrid creature that gets around much like a flying grasshopper.\n Having recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL, Mirko Kovac is spending this summer in the United States as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.", "summary": "A swarm of flying robots soars into a blazing forest fire.

{"id": 112, "text": "Many phenomena occurring in nature and industry happen very quickly: a tear running through a piece of fabric, a rubber ball bouncing off a hard floor, a drop of water wetting a dry surface and a piece of scotch tape peeling off, for example. Capturing images of these phenomena would help scientists better understand them, but conventional cameras aren’t fast enough – and high-speed cameras are prohibitively expensive. \nBut scientists at EPFL’s , working in association with Harvard University researchers in the , have developed a new imaging method called Virtual Frame Technique (VFT) that can generate thousands of images of these phenomena as they occur step by step, using a photo taken from any kind of device, including a smartphone. What’s more, VFT has been shown to perform better than high-speed cameras. \nWorking with a conventional photo\nThe method starts by analyzing a conventional photo. “If you use a regular camera to take a picture of a drop of water hitting a dry surface, the water’s movement will cause the picture to be blurry. But these blurred areas are precisely where the phenomenon is taking place, both spatially and temporally. That’s what our technique uses to piece together the underlying phenomenon,” says John Kolinski, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. In other words, VFT works by deconstructing the blurry parts of pictures. \nA method for binary phenomena\nThe first step is to shine light on the phenomenon just as the conventional picture is taken, so that the blurry parts can be exploited. “This initial illumination step must be done correctly so that the blurry parts of the picture contain the right information and can be used. At this point the object must have a quantifiable instantaneous state of either completely blocking the light or completely letting it through,” says Kolinski. The next step is to employ advanced image-processing methods to improve the conventional picture’s temporal resolution and specific illumination scheme, and then turn it into a binary image – that is, containing either black or white pixels. \nThis method offers an advantage because many natural phenomena are binary; for example, a piece of fabric is either torn or it isn’t, a surface is either wet or dry. That means only two greyscale values are necessary to depict them – no need for the 15,000+ intensity values available with conventional cameras. By sacrificing the ability to resolve intensity, the scientists were able to use the camera sensor’s bit depth, or the amount of information the sensor can obtain, to increase the frame rate while retaining full spatial resolution. Temporal resolution can be improved even further by adjusting the timing of a light pulse.\nTime-lapse photos over extremely short periods \nVFT therefore breaks down a conventional photo of an object in rapid motion into thousands of images that show every step of the process. “It’s like taking time-lapse photos of a nearly instantaneous phenomenon,” says Kolinski. The scientists tested their technique on pictures taken by all kinds of devices, from smartphones to sophisticated professional cameras, and found that it consistently resulted in a faster frame rate. While careful illumination is required, the method is quite general, and has been used to record a rich variety of phenomena, from droplet impacts to fracture mechanics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a new image-processing method that can capture extremely rapid phenomena using any type of camera.

{"id": 114, "text": "Targeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is a surgical procedure on patients with amputations that reroutes residual limb nerves towards intact muscles and skin in order to fit them with a limb prosthesis allowing unprecedented control. By its nature, TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input; however the detailed brain mechanisms have never been investigated before and the success of TMSR prostheses will depend on our ability to understand the ways the brain re-maps these pathways. Now, EPFL scientists have used ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI to show how TMSR affects upper-limb representations in the brains of patients with amputations, in particular in primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex and regions processing more complex brain functions. The findings are .\nTargeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is used to improve the control of upper limb prostheses. Residual nerves from the amputated limb are transferred to reinnervate and activate new muscle targets. This way, a patient fitted with a TMSR prosthetic “sends” motor commands to the re-innervated muscles, where his or her movement intentions are decoded and sent to the prosthetic limb. On the other hand, direct stimulation of the skin over the re-innervated muscles is sent back to the brain, inducing touch perception on the missing limb.\nBut how does the brain encode and integrate such artificial touch and movements of the prosthetic limb? How does this impact our ability to better integrate and control prosthetics? Achieving and fine-tuning such control depends on knowing how the patient’s brain re-maps various motor and somatosensory pathways in the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. \nThe , in collaboration with Andrea Serino at the University Hospital of Lausanne and teams of clinicians and researchers in Switzerland and abroad have successfully mapped out these changes in the cortices of three patients with upper-limb amputations who had undergone TMSR and were proficient users of prosthetic limbs developed by  and his group at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.\nThe scientists used ultra-high field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow across it. This gave them an unprecedented insight at great spatial resolution into the cortical organization of primary motor and somatosensory cortex of each patient.\nSurprisingly, the study showed that motor cortex maps of the amputated limb were similar in terms of extent, strength, and topography to individuals without limb amputation, but they were different from patients with amputations that did not receive TMSR, but were using standard prostheses. This shows the unique impact of the surgical TMSR procedure on the brain’s motor map.\nThe approach was even able to identify maps of missing (phantom) fingers in the somatosensory cortex of the TMSR patients that were activated through the reinnervated skin regions from the chest or residual limb.\nThe somatosensory maps showed that the brain had preserved its original topographical organization, although to a lesser degree than in healthy subjects. Moreover, when investigating the connections between upper-limb maps in both cortices, the researchers found normal connections in the TMSR patients, which were comparable with healthy controls. However, preservation of original mapping was again reduced in non-TMSR patients, showing that the TMSR procedure preserves strong functional connections between primary sensory and motor cortex.\nThe study also showed that TMSR is still in need of improvement: the connections between the primary sensory and motor cortex with the higher-level embodiment regions in fronto-parietal cortex were as weak in the TMSR patients as in the non-TMSR patients, and differed with respect to healthy subjects.\nThis suggests that, despite enabling good motor performance, TMSR-empowered artificial limbs still do not move and feel like a real limb and are still not encoded by the patient’s brain as a real limb. The scientists conclude that future TMSR prosthetics should implement systematic somatosensory feedback linked to the robotic hand movements, enabling patients to feel the sensory consequences of the movements of their artificial limb.\nThe findings provide the first detailed neuroimaging investigation in patients with bionic limbs based on the TMSR prosthesis, and show that ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI is an exceptional tool for studying the upper-limb maps of the motor and somatosensory cortex following amputation.\nIn addition, the findings suggest that TMSR may counteract poorly adapted plasticity in the cortex after losing a limb. According to the authors, this may provide new insights into the nature and the reversibility of cortical plasticity in patients with amputations and its link to phantom limb syndrome and pain.\nFinally, the study also shows that there is a need of further engineering advances such as the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prosthetics that can enable them to move and feel as real limbs.\nContributors\nUniversity Hospital Lausanne (CHUV)\nThe Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center (Bar-Ilan University)\nFoundation Campus Biotech Geneva\nEPFL Biomedical Imaging Research Center\nSpinoza Centre for Neuroimaging\nClinique Romande de Réadaptation – SUVA\nCentro Protesi INAIL\nRehabilitation Institute of Chicago\nUniversity Hospital Geneva (HUG)\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nBertarelli Foundation\nReference\nAndrea Serino, Michel Akselrod, Roy Salomon, Roberto Martuzzi, Maria Laura Blefari, Elisa Canzoneri, Giulio Rognini, Wietske van der Zwaag, Maria Iakova, François Luthi, Amedeo Amoresano, Todd Kuiken, Olaf Blanke. \nUpper limb cortical maps in amputees with targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation: a 7T fMRI study. \nBrain\n 27 October 2017.

{"id": 115, "text": "We’ve all sat frustrated in rush-hour traffic – either in the morning on the way to work, in the evening on the way home, or both. Some try to get around the problem by leaving a little earlier or a little later. That helps balance out traffic flows and create a certain equilibrium – which many transportation engineers and economists have been studying. Their goal is to better understand the mechanisms behind this equilibrium so that large infrastructure projects can be better designed and help reduce congestion.\nLamotte’s thesis – supervised by Nikolas Geroliminis, a professor at EPFL’s Urban Transport Systems Laboratory – investigates this equilibrium and weighs up different methods for reducing traffic congestion. He shows that most city traffic follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach, but that a more efficient way to regulate traffic would be by introducing a reservation system for specific time slots.\nLamotte’s first finding is that in a multidirectional road system – which is what’s typically seen in and around cities – the drivers who have the longest commute are the ones who make the most effort to avoid rush-hour traffic. That’s because they have a greater incentive to adjust their commute times and find the optimal time for leaving work or home based on how long it will take them to arrive at their destination.\nReserved lanes\nHe also found that one measure that has proven effective for reducing traffic congestion, in Stockholm for example, is a congestion charge. “Even a relatively low charge that varies with the time of day can change people’s behavior,” says Lamotte. However, such charges are not popular and not always feasible. Adopting one in Switzerland, for example, would require a constitutional amendment.\nBased on the observation that traffic congestion results from lose-lose competition among drivers, Lamotte looked to other transportation methods for possible ideas. In air travel, passenger traffic is regulated by reservation systems that let travelers book seats until the plane is full. At that point, travelers have to take another flight. He suggests a similar system for commuter traffic using special reserved lanes. The allowed number of vehicles on the lanes would depend on the roads’ capacity, and the demand for reservations would be used to determine which segments of road to set aside for the system. Commuters who don’t want to use the system would be free to use the regular road lanes whenever they want – but they might find those lanes congested.\nGuiding public policy \n“Today such a system would be hard to implement,” says Lamotte. But he’s already looking ahead to the emergence of new modes of transport. “Car-sharing systems are becoming increasingly common, and self-driving cars are not far off. Commuters will soon start getting used to reserving a vehicle ahead of time. Then it will be just a small step to reserving a time slot as well,” he adds. He hopes his thesis will help inform policymakers’ decisions when it comes to long-term urban planning. “It’s important to be aware that this competition for commuting times bears a cost, and that intelligently designed traffic systems can help cut that cost,” says Lamotte.", "summary": "For his thesis, EPFL PhD student Raphaël Lamotte studied rush-hour traffic congestion.

{"id": 116, "text": "One day as you reach Geneva’s main train station to start your daily commute you notice a new sign showing some kind of underwater train. At first, you focus on the ripples marking the surface of the water. But as you approach and look more closely at the sign, you notice something strange about the rails – the train has no wheels. It seems to be suspended in mid-air.\nYou follow the arrow, which leads you to an elevator a few meters further on. The destination is indicated above the door: Lausanne. That’s where you’re going. So you get on the elevator, and it takes you deep below the ground. Your fellow passengers look as confused as you are. The elevator doors finally open and you step into a brand-new station already packed with commuters. You get on board. As the train pulls out of the station you realize that it’s not running on the rails but ‘levitating’ above them. You get to Lausanne in around ten minutes. You’re lost for words when it dawns on you that your journey has taken you under the waters of Lake Geneva. Another elevator is waiting for you as you get off the train. It takes you back up to the surface into the familiar bustle of Lausanne’s train station.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Swissmetro\nElia Notari has just obtained his Master’s in civil engineering from EPFL. He came up with this visionary train line for his Master’s project, which was supervised by Aurelio Muttoni, a full professor and director of EPFL’s Structural Concrete Laboratory (IBETON). Those with a sharp eye will no doubt notice some similarities with the Swissmetro project, an idea for a futuristic metro system developed at EPFL in the 1990s. Swissmetro was intended to link the main towns in Switzerland at a speed of 500 km/h. Notari’s Master’s project is in fact a variation of the Swissmetro design, which put the trains in underground tunnels rather than through Lake Geneva.\nBut is it really possible to build a metro through Lake Geneva? What some consider sacrilegious is a fascinating technical challenge for others – one that draws on multiple disciplines, covering everything from structural design and hydraulics to geotechnics and the environmental impact.\nA submerged bridge\nNotari focused on designing and calculating the dimensions of a double-track tunnel made out of reinforced concrete: an ‘underwater bridge’ – or to be more specific, a ‘floating underwater tunnel.’ Covering a distance of around 55 kilometers, the tracks would use magnetic levitation – or maglev – to get the train to travel at high speed. With this type of system, one set of magnets is placed on the tracks; a second set on the bottom of the train is repelled by the first, which pushes the train up off the track. In some cases, the repulsive force of the magnet is controlled by a current running along the track.\nFig.1: The double-track tunnel and its compartments containing ballast. © EPFL 2018 / E. Notari\nThis kind of system is not yet used in transportation, but several countries are now testing prototypes and plan to start building soon. In 2015, the Shinkansen Maglev prototype developed by Japanese company JR Central set the world record when it reached a speed of 603 km/h. For his work, Notari drew on policy guidelines developed in Germany, which are better suited to short distances, like that between Geneva and Lausanne.\nSeveral options to choose from\nThere are several options available to an engineer looking to build a train that can run under water. The tunnel can, for example, be set under the ground, as is the case with Eurostar, which was opened in 1994 across the Channel and connects London with several cities in mainland Europe.\nNorway is looking into another option to link its fjords with its cities – an underwater tunnel suspended at a series of floats that can be seen on the surface. Yet another solution involves putting metal rods in the ground to anchor down the tunnel. However, this will only work if the tunnel itself is buoyant enough.\nYet none of these options was quite right for Lake Geneva. This was mainly because its clear waters make it popular among sports enthusiasts and esthetes, which meant the student had to design a tunnel that was at least 20 meters deep and not visible from the surface.\n30 meters underwater\nNotari therefore went with a bridge located 30 meters below the surface and supported by piers made of reinforced concrete. This solution was the most rigid, which is a crucial factor for a high-speed train. It was also the most secure in the event of internal flooding. Other advantages also guided his choice. With this solution, the temperature would be constant throughout the entire structure, which would prevent any thermal deformation as a result of the changing seasons. Waves are also at their weakest at that kind of depth, and the bridge would not get in the way of any existing structures.\nWhat’s more, the hydrostatic pressure would be a bonus in terms of the solidity of the 199 modules making up the concrete tunnels. The engineer’s tunnel measures 14.5 meters in diameter and is designed to withstand earthquakes, internal and external explosions, flooding, tsunamis and landslides. The structure would include compartments containing ballast to make it possible to stabilize the tunnel at any time based on Archimedes’ principle. To adjust to the lake’s varying depth, the height of the pillars, which are 6 meters in diameter, would range from 7.5 to 45 meters. The bridge’s route would follow the lakeshore (see Fig.2. on the left). And the two ends of the line would be connected to the Geneva and Lausanne train stations via elevators.\nToo technically feasible to be utopian\nThe idea of an underwater bridge in Lake Geneva doesn’t seem so utopian to the freshly graduated engineer. “The concept of an underwater bridge has been around for a century,” says Notari. “Our know-how has advanced significantly thanks to projects like oil platforms and offshore wind farms. What’s missing is a pioneering investor who’s ready to put up the money to fund the construction of a prototype.”\nFor Aurelio Muttoni, high-speed transportation projects have great potential: “The solution that Elia studied is technically realistic. I myself came up with a similar solution in the 1990s when studying the feasibility of crossing Lake Lugano as part of the southern extension of the Gotthard high-speed train line.” Muttoni adds that he was inspired by Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s ultra-fast train, when suggesting the topic to his student. (See the .)\nBut given the complexity of the situation, the environmental challenges and the high costs of this kind of project, Muttoni is convinced that it will be many years before Lake Geneva gets an underwater tunnel.", "summary": "Summer series.

{"id": 119, "text": "For many poor farmers in India and Africa, finger millet is a major staple food. The crop species is not only a rich source of minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and zinc, and it contains many vitamins and essential amino acids. The plant is also characterized by its resistance to drought and heat. As it is very healthy and gluten-free, it is finding increased use as a food in industrial countries as well. Despite its importance, finger millet has been given very little scientific attention until now.\nLarge and complex genome due to fusion of two plant species\nFinger millet arose through the hybridization of two different plant species. The plant is therefore polyploid, which means it has a four-fold set of chromosomes and almost twice as many genes as its original species. The size and complexity of the genome are thought to have conferred the broad environmental tolerance of finger millet, while making genome research extremely difficult. For the first time, an international team of researchers from the University of Zurich has now managed to decode the complex genome of finger millet in great detail. It comprises about 2.6 million base pairs and has more than 62,300 genes – about twice as many as rice, for example.\nNew strategy for genome sequencing and mapping\nA good 57,900 finger millet genes – over 90 percent – occur in more than two copies. As their DNA sequences are very similar, it was difficult to correctly allocate the numerous, decoded DNA sections within the entire genome. In cooperation with Ralph Schlapbach and Sirisha Aluri from the Functional Genomics Center at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, the team headed up by Kentaro Shimizu, professor at the UZH Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, has managed to overcome these difficulties. For this purpose, the scientists combined a sophisticated bioinformatics strategy developed by Masaomi Hatakeyama that uses state-of-the-art sequencing methods with a new technology that can optically map the long, individual DNA molecules in the genome. “Our newly developed strategy will help sequence the genome of other polyploid cultivated plants that have not been able to be determined until now,” Shimizu says.\nImproving the supply of nutrients and drought resistance\nAn interdisciplinary team of researchers from Zurich and Bangalore, India, worked together on this project. The work was supported by Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (ISCB), a bilateral research and development program financed by the Swiss and Indian governments, as well as by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The objective is to improve food security and to develop the capacity of biotechnological research in India. “The newly available genome data of finger millet opens up numerous possibilities for modern plant breeding,” Shimizu emphasizes. “On the one hand, to help people with mineral deficiencies in India and in industrialized countries and, on the other hand, to make important crop plants more resistant to drought and aridness.”\nLiterature\n:\nMasaomi Hatakeyama, Sirisha Aluri, Mathi Thumilan Balachadran, Sajeevan Radha Sivarajan, Andrea Patrignani, Simon Grüter, Lucy Poveda, Rie Shimizu-Inatsugi, John Baeten, Kees-Jan Francoijs, Karaba N.

{"id": 120, "text": "How can we bring to life a musical heritage now preserved in a digital format? How does this newly digitised heritage change our perception of the past? And what new cultural perspectives does it open? An interdisciplinary research project by the EPFL + ECAL Lab, Metamedia Center and the ALICE laboratory set out to address these questions. It all began when Audemars Piguet joined forces with Montreux Sounds and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) to digitise, restore and preserve the treasured archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was founded by the late Claude Nobs exactly 50 years ago. The tremendous collection comprises thousands of hours of recordings by the finest musicians on the planet. It is the first audiovisual library to have earned the accolade of UNESCO Memory of the World. “The project was inspired by the work of Claude Nobs. He was a faithful friend and so we are delighted to take part in this initiative. We are proud to participate in the colossal technological efforts needed to transform this unique heritage into a first-class digitised resource for future generations,” says Olivier Audemars, Vice-Chairman of the Audemars Piguet Board of Directors.\nWork to preserve this legacy began in 2008 and is almost complete. Over the years the archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival have taken many different formats. “All the master copies have now been digitised and work on the original tapes will be finished by the end of the summer. We can now make full use of this heritage for research purposes,” continues Alain Dufaux, Operations Director at Metamedia Center. In the past 8 years, more than 11,000 hours of video recordings (in HD since 1991) and 6,000 hours of high-quality audio recordings have been preserved in uncompressed digital formats utilizing the very latest technology. Since 2010, this unique collection has used as a database for a number of research projects at EPFL.\nLiving heritage\n The study conducted by the EPFL+ECAL Lab, the research centre for design at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the ALICE architecture studio ALICE (at EPFL), proposes a new vision for this digitised heritage. The aim is not to reconstitute the past, but instead to create a specific experience for a digitised archive. “The original concert experience is the backdrop of Lake Geneva and the mountains, the ambiance of festival-goers in their thousands, the unfolding of events on-stage, and above all the flesh-and-blood presence of the musicians. We can’t recreate this. Instead we need to make the most of what digital has to offer to create an alternative experience, a complementary experience,” explains Project Manager Nicolas Henchoz. The first private booth was launched in 2012 and awarded the Design Preis Schweiz the following year.\nA ramped-up version of the booth, dubbed Montreux Heritage Lab2, opens to the public in November in the brand new Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL. Montreux Heritage Lab2 unlocks the lion’s share of the archive footage, immersing up to 20 viewers at a time in an intense audiovisual experience.\nEPFL was guided by three principles in developing the new booth. First, the content and its cultural value take front and center. Stunning, well-preserved archival footage dominates the space, appearing on a screen whose sophisticated geometry gives the viewer a sense of depth and proximity to the stage. Then comes the surround sound – so fundamental to the immersive effect – which was orchestrated by Audioborn and Illusonic (two startups founded by former members of the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory, LCAV) with help from Hervé Lissek's Acoustic Group (LTS2) and the Yverdon-les-Bains company Relec with its PSI Audio high-precision speakers. The viewer’s experience is thus shaped by live footage and music – the very essence of the archive. The sense of immersion is further enhanced by the lateral walls of the booth, where mirrors reflect the selected footage and display information and visuals through an LED underlay. The experience is rounded out by anecdotes on the history of the festival showing up on the screens. The booth is structured to direct its light toward the Montreux Jazz Café next door and, in the evening, towards the heart of the campus. \nPurpose-designed controls afford an overview of the archive footage, placing more than 44,000 tracks at your fingertips.\n---\nFrom the outset, the project saw the light of day thanks to the crucial support from Audemars Piguet, who has been involved since the beginning.

SwissCube, the little satellite developed by EPFL in partnership with several other specialized universities, is celebrating seven years in space today. EPFL's Space Engineering Center, eSpace, is planning a series of birthday events: a reunion of the satellite’s designers, conferences, personal accounts, previously unseen videos, and the retransmission of one of the satellite’s overhead passes. Plus, a mobile app will soon be available for those interested in keeping tabs on the satellite.\nThere is good reason to celebrate. This little CubeSat – measuring only 10 cm x 10 cm – is now playing with the big boys: it’s the oldest European satellite in its category to still be active. Only four other CubeSats have lasted longer, and they are all of Japanese design. The world record holder has been in orbit for 13 years.\nEarly on, no one thought SwissCube had the stamina. When it was launched, it was expected to function for about four months. And it even got off to a bad start: when it reached orbit it started spinning and couldn’t be used until it stabilized several months later.\nRisky decisions\nSwissCube’s long lifespan is a tribute to the 200 or so students who worked in succession on the project under the guidance of Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace. Over the years, a number of decisions that were considered highly risky at the time proved to be judicious. This includes the use of low-cost components that had never before been used in space.\nThe little satellite, orbiting at an altitude of 720 kilometers and a speed of nearly 7,500 meters per second – 28,000 kilometers per hour – still regularly transmits its position, system status and images back to Earth. That said, the satellite had to be completely rebooted on two separate occasions in recent years owing to system failures. The CubeSat rebooted properly both times, offering further proof of its sound design.\nIt is now starting to show more serious signs of fatigue. “It’s probably nearing the end of its travels,” said Simon Dandavino, the executive director of eSpace. “Its communications system is less responsive, and its data transmission capability is faltering.”\nSwissCube should eventually be picked up by CleanSpace One, the space cleanup satellite currently being built at eSpace. The purpose of that project is to develop solutions to the problem of space debris and demonstrate the feasibility of applying them in the space environment. SwissCube will therefore serve experimental purposes up to the very end.\nAn app, never-before-seen images and a replica\nSwissCube’s birthday celebration has a lot in store for its fans. A mobile app called Elveti mobile will soon be released, allowing users to track SwissCube and receive live data from it. The app will also work with other satellites like CleanSpace One. Enthusiasts will also be able to see images of SwissCube released by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB), which was able to film the small and fast-moving satellite from the ground using the ZIMLAT telescope at Zimmerwald Observatory.\nFinally, an exact replica of the little satellite is currently being made. It will be put on display, together with information on the satellite’s systems and history, in November at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Lucerne. \nFor more information:", "summary": "The little Swiss satellite was launched on 23 September 2009 and continues to send back regular reports.

Switzerland Innovation Park Network West EPFL is unique in that it is made up of six sites from five cantons: Campus Biotech (Geneva), Bluefactory (Fribourg), Microcity (Neu-châtel), EPFL Innovation Park (Vaud), Biopôle (Vaud) and Energypolis (Valais).\n To maintain its place at the forefront of global innovation, Switzerland must be proactive and take initiatives. This was the message conveyed by Swiss President Johann N. Schneider-Ammann in his introductory remarks: “We want to position Switzerland among the best of the best in terms of research and innovation. That’s how we will maintain our global competitive-ness, our economic prosperity and our strong jobs market.” Hence the need for spaces in which Switzerland's specialized schools and universities can work closely with companies and together create an innovation-friendly environment. Switzerland Innovation now provides these spaces to Swiss and foreign companies through five high-tech sites that are close to the specialized schools and designed to support their ambitions.\n“Five cantons in French-speaking Switzerland have joined forces around EPFL, which is a driving force in the area of innovation. The six sites that together form Switzerland Innovation Park Net-work West EPFL all have links to EPFL-related entities, which means they will operate side by side with academia and the labs. The goal is to replicate the success of EPFL Innovation Park and promote the transfer of innovation into tomorrow’s leading products,” said Adrienne Corboud Fumagalli, Vice-President for Innovation and Technology Transfer (VPIV), the EPFL office that oversees Swiss Innovation Park Network West EPFL.\nThe six entities in the western Swiss hub cover a wide range of innovation-related fields: com-puter science, extreme environments, life science, advanced manufacturing, smart building and energy management.", "summary": "With today’s launch of the nationwide initiative called Switzerland Innovation, Switzerland affirms its position as a global leader in innovation.

A letter of intent has also been signed by the 4 institutions, laying down the common vision for research into cancer. The AGORA – Cancer Centre will be able to accommodate 400 researchers and clinicians on 11,500 m2 as early as 2016.\nThe AGORA - Cancer Centre exists specifically to bring together scientists and practitioners under one roof as part of a community of expertise.\n Created as a gigantic “toolbox” in the fight against cancer, the interactive, integrated AGORA centre allows everyone to draw on the pool of resources available in an effort to combat the disease: ground-breaking progress in understanding the mechanisms specific to each pathology, optimized management of targeted therapies, networking of advances benefiting patients under treatment. ‘Bringing together doctors, researchers and bio-engineers under one roof will stimulate collaborative efforts that will lead to major breakthroughs in therapeutic strategies aimed at cancer sufferers’, stated enthusiastically Professor Georges Coukos, Head of the oncology department at CHUV and Director of the Ludwig Centre at Lausanne University.\nBehnisch Architekten: an iconic building dedicated to tomorrow’s research\nBoth interdisciplinary and disciplinary communication as the central element of successful research will be evident in the organization of the floor plans. Communication plays a central role both inside and outside the entire building,’ commented prize-winning architect, Stefan Behnisch, at the opening of the competition exhibition on CHUV premises today. The agora, the public level of the Cancer Research Center, connects as well to the existing pathways of the campus and beyond as internally, within the building to the laboratory and office levels with their individual communication areas and informal workplaces.\n The internal organization of the programmatic areas offers the users a high level of flexibility to provide the necessary freedom for future changes.\n The building skin is designed to enhance daylight use in the depth of the building. In specific areas operable windows allow for natural ventilation. This provides for a better individual climate control. The daylight enhancement systems, optimized sunlight protection, a responsible management of natural resources in the construction and maintenance of the building, as well as the use of both renewable and the existing energy systems on the site, are the preconditions for a successful and sustainable working environment. This, together with the outstanding research goals will create the future oriented image for the new facility.\nThe SCCL – Swiss Cancer Center Lausanne\n Many rich and complementary collaborations have long existed between the researchers at UNIL and EPFL and the clinicians at CHUV. The creation of the SCCL formally marks the ambition of three major Institutions to pool and co-ordinate their different areas of expertise in the field of oncology and improve the synergies between fundamental researchers and clinicians. The goal?

Inspired by muscle contraction, its individual soft components are activated (they collapse) when negative pressure (vacuum) is applied to them. The robot uses suction to grab objects or to stick to a smooth wall for climbing, so it can really achieve a wide range of tasks because of the unique properties of vacuum. The robot can be reconfigured to perform different tasks, making it highly modular and versatile, with a wide range of applications in both research and in industry. The invention is published today in \nScience Robotics\n.\n“What we have is a fully functional robot which is entirely powered by vacuum, which has never been done before,” says EPFL roboticist Matt Robertson who worked on the project. “Previous work has shown individual components powered by vacuum, but never in a complete system.”\nVacuum-powered components are a recent addition to robotics – and, more importantly, they’re safe. Today, most actuators on the market are activated by applying positive pressure, i.e. by injecting air into their components. But containing positive pressure requires stiff high-pressure pneumatics, which also pose a safety threat: in extreme situations, they can explode. By comparison, vacuum-powered actuators are safe, soft, and simple to build.\n“What's more is that our soft building blocks are designed to be plug-and-play, so ultimately we can assemble several types of robots from the same basic units,” says EPFL scientists and lead researcher Jamie Paik. “They can be reconfigured to perform different tasks like crawling, gripping canisters, and climbing a vertical wall.”\nA five-module robot can move like a tentacle; a four-module robot with a suction gripper can grab an object and drop it on a target; a three-module robot can crawl on the ground; a two-module robot can be equipped with suction-cup feet to climb a smooth, vertical surface, like glass. The enormous versatility of the new robots can be exploited for studying locomotion and for future applications at an industrial level.\nThis research was funded in part by NCCR Robotics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have created the first functional robot powered entirely by vacuum: made up of soft building blocks, it moves by having air sucked out of them.

{"id": 126, "text": "Superfluidity refers to a state in which matter behaves like a liquid with zero viscosity. Much like superconductivity, this phenomenon occurs at extremely low temperatures and can cause a liquid like helium to behave in the strangest ways, e.g. roll up out of a container or even create a perpetual fountain. But beyond just a fascinating curiosity, superfluidity is frequently used in high-precision applications like quantum gyroscopes and even satellites that measure infrared radiation in space. With a few exceptions, superfluidity has generally been regarded as a macroscopic phenomenon, resulting from ‘bulky’ collections of particles rather than individual atoms. But in a recent \nPhysical Review Letters\n paper, EPFL researchers have now shown that, at least in liquids, superfluidity involves dynamics that go down to the nanoscale.\nThe most common superfluid element is helium-4, which is used in both research and applications like cooling down the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. With the exception of Bose-Einstein condensates – a state of matter that occurs at extremely low temperatures where particles reach their lowest energy – superfluidity has been thus far considered to be macroscopic. Consequently, helium-4 is usually employed in bulk in relevant studies, which do not take into account the contributions of individual atoms to the overall phenomenon.\nOne of the classical parameters that is used to measure superfluidity is the critical Landau velocity. This is the cut-off velocity above which the frictionless flow of the material is lost. If an object moving through a superfluid medium exceeds the Landau velocity, it generates elementary excitations in the medium called rotons, which are somewhat similar to sound waves. The creation of rotons takes up energy from the moving particle, causing it to slow down and “gain” viscosity. In the case of superfluid helium-4, an object can move through it without friction as long as its velocity stays below ~58 m/sec. But although the Landau velocity has been experimentally verified in bulk helium-4, thus confirming superfluidity, it has never been observed in small-size systems (e.g. nanodroplets), even though these are increasingly being used in superfluidity studies.\nA research team led by Marcel Drabbels has now shown that a critical Landau velocity exists in helium-4 droplets a few nanometers in diameter, down to only twenty helium-4 atoms across. The researchers designed an experiment where a single atom (e.g. silver) or molecule (e.g. nitric oxide) was introduced into helium-4 nanodroplets of various sizes (one thousand to five million helium-4 atoms). The system was then excited with a laser beam until the so-called ‘impurity’ was ejected from the droplet. The ejected particle was then ionized and projected onto a position-sensitive detector. At this point, the ion’s velocity in three-dimensional space was calculated and determined.\nThe results showed that the velocity distribution for the ‘impurities’ was consistent with a critical Landau velocity. This shows for the first time that superfluidity can arise even in finite-size systems, and creates further questions as to the fundamental properties of the phenomenon. One question that the authors pose concerns the minimum droplet size in which a critical Landau velocity can be consistently demonstrated, which is now crucial in the design of follow-up studies.\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL with the University of Amsterdam and the University of Barcelona.\nReference\nBrauer NB, Smolarek S, Loginov E, Mateo D, Hernando A, Pi M, Barranco M, Buma WJ, Drabbels M. 2013.

{"id": 127, "text": "Governments across Switzerland are embracing civic technology. This is one of the headline findings of the first Civic Tech Barometer, a survey conducted by researchers from EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR) in partnership with Geneva Canton’s Consultation and Communication Department. The team’s conclusions are based on responses to an online survey sent to municipal, city and cantonal authorities nationwide between August and November 2019. In total, 83 government employees from the French, German and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland submitted answers.\n The idea behind civic technology, or civic tech, is to change the way citizens participate in democratic processes. The LaSUR survey found that the Swiss civic tech landscape is far from uniform. The most common platform types include websites, blogs, open-data repositories, social media, participatory spaces where citizens can submit ideas and suggestions, and open forums for discussion and debate. Yet half of the technologies mentioned by survey respondents are not truly participatory because they are designed more for one-way communication than two-way interaction. \n The survey did, however, reveal a handful of more collaborative platforms, including Crossiety (dubbed the “digital village square”) and Decidim. With such a wide variety of options available, governments are free to choose how involved they want citizens to be in the decision-making process.\nPlanning leads the way\n “Swiss authorities use civic tech across a broad spectrum of policy areas,” says Armelle Hausser, a doctoral assistant at LaSUR who carried out the survey as part of her PhD research. “Chief among these are planning and development, youth services, sport, environment and social action.” In most cases, local executive bodies are the driving force behind civic tech usage – and legal requirements have little to no bearing on such initiatives. In fact, just one-third of the platforms and technologies reported by respondents were developed to meet a legal obligation. \n Conversely, other interested parties – such as project and department managers, citizens’ groups, charities and non-profits – rarely call for the use of civic tech in consultation and participation processes. “This finding is counter-intuitive,” says Professor Vincent Kaufmann, who heads LaSUR. “It suggests that, in Switzerland, citizens still prefer to voice their views through conventional channels, for instance by objecting to planning proposals or by taking part in popular initiatives and referendums.”\nLimited resources\n The team also found that local governments currently allocate little in the way of funding and human resources to civic tech initiatives, preferring in the majority of cases to outsource the process to external providers. “Authorities don’t yet have a clear idea of the roles and skills required for this kind of initiative,” explains Hausser. Yet expectations were high among the respondents, who said they planned to use civic tech to produce more information for public consumption, keep citizens better informed and understand their views, improve transparency, secure public support and widen participation more generally.\n “There are many other plans in the pipeline, including online surveys and participatory mapping platforms,” adds Hausser. “In terms of technology types, a general direction of travel seems to be emerging. But we’ll need to run the survey again to make doubly sure.” What is certain is that Swiss authorities are keen to embrace civic tech, with no fewer than 31 high-priority initiatives planned for the coming year. \nRoom to improve\n The LaSUR team found clear room for improvement in two areas. First, although citizens’ views obtained using civic tech are reflected in accompanying reports, Swiss authorities still tend not to give these views due weight in the final decision-making process. And second, it is still too early to properly assess the impact of the technology on citizen participation. The researchers will have a clearer picture after running their second survey, scheduled for fall 2020.\n The results of the initial survey will be presented at a special event – open to practitioners and other interested parties as well as the wider public – on 3 February 2020 at the 3DD Espace de Concertation in Geneva. Hausser will incorporate the findings into her thesis, which focuses on wider issues around the use of civic tech for public participation in planning processes in Switzerland. Her research is supervised by Prof. Kaufmann and Boris Beaude, in partnership with Geneva Canton.\n«Résultat de l’enquête Baromètre des civic tech en Suisse 2019», Armelle Hausser and Prof. Vincent Kaufmann, 3 February 2020 1.30pm, in French, 3DD espace de concertation, Rue David Dufour 3, Geneva.

{"id": 128, "text": "Gone are the days when the United States and the Soviet Union competed to achieve firsts in spaceflight capability – first in space, first to the moon. That golden age cast a decades-long shadow over space exploration. But that is all changing now, not least with the arrival of new players on the scene. The EPFL Space Center (eSpace) is marking UN World Space Week, the annual October celebration that officially starts today, with a clear statement of its intent to capture the opportunities offered by this decisive turning point.\neSpace, founded in 2014, is expanding and redefining its research priorities with the launch of a new initiative dubbed Sustainable Space Logistics. The move is part of the unit’s ambitious plans to become a center of excellence in equipment and data for space exploration, and in the development of lasting, sustainable space infrastructure.\n“There’s growing talk in space circles of mankind returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent base there,” says eSpace director Jean-Paul Kneib. “But before we can do that, we need to think long and hard about how we design consumables – energy, fuel, water and food – from the standpoint of both recycling and sustainability.”\nIn recent years, more and more governments have launched space programs. Countries like China and India are rising rapidly up the list of world space powers. But the biggest change has been the arrival of private companies on the scene. Firms like SpaceX and EPFL spin-off Astrocast are now sending their own rockets and satellites into space, bringing incredible energy and ground-breaking ideas to the table.\nSatellite constellations\nIn the new space age, satellites are becoming ever smaller – and smarter. Looking ahead, it seems as though satellite constellations are the future, with smaller devices such as CubeSats operating in tandem and forming a robust network that covers more of the Earth’s surface. This development owes much to advances in Internet of Things (IoT) systems.\n“It’s incredible to see how fast technology is evolving,” says Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace who specializes in space debris. “We’re on the cusp of the space research 4.0 era.”\nSince the world’s first satellite was launched over 60 years ago, space has become increasingly cluttered with junk – thousands of pieces of debris ranging from tiny paint chips to rocket stages and entire obsolete satellites. All that debris orbiting the Earth poses a major collision risk, with serious implications for space exploration. In fact, the problem has become so acute in recent years that scientists are having to rethink mission design with junk in mind. The need for sustainable solutions has never been greater.\nSought-after expertise\nEPFL is ideally placed to make the most of this new landscape. “Our skills and expertise are exactly what the space industry is looking for,” says Sonia Ben Hamida, a researcher who recently joined the eSpace team. “In many respects, it’s the perfect fit.”\neSpace’s logistics services could support operations and activities across a broad spectrum of fields, ranging from transport, storage, packaging and distribution, to location, telecommunications, navigation, repair and resupply. Other potential applications include in-orbit manufacturing and assembly, drilling, human presence, surveillance, cleaning, recycling – and more.\nTechnologies developed for other applications by various EPFL labs and startups – especially in microengineering, electronics and robotics – could also be repurposed for use in the space industry. Examples include solar radiation and cosmic ray protective equipment, cleaner propulsion systems, next-generation transport vehicles, and space robots designed to capture junk or move objects around in space. And, of course, artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize viewing, tracking, orientation recognition, and in-orbit assembly systems.\neSpace will define its research priorities after consulting with the European Space Agency (ESA), the Swiss Space Office and other bodies. Pending that decision, manufacturers, scientists, students and other interested parties are invited to contact the center to express their interest.\nTo get in touch with the Sustainable Space Logistics initiative, please write to: \nEPFL Space Center invite participants of all ages, from all around the world to take part in an essay competition to introduce new ideas on the topic of how to develop space logistics services, in a sustainable way:", "summary": "Things are changing in outer space: it is filling with debris, attracting private companies, and raising new technological challenges.

{"id": 132, "text": "In artificial intelligence (AI), machines carry out specific actions, observe the outcome, adapt their behavior accordingly, observe the new outcome, adapt their behavior once again, and so on, learning from this iterative process. But could this process spin out of control? Possibly. “AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped,” says Rachid Guerraoui, a professor at EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory and co-author of the EPFL study. That means AI engineers must prevent machines from eventually learning how to circumvent human commands. EPFL researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots; they will present their findings on Monday, 4 December, at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in California. Their work makes a major contribution to the development of autonomous vehicles and drones, for example, so that they will be able to operate safely in numbers.\nOne machine-learning method used in AI is reinforcement learning, where agents are rewarded for performing certain actions – a technique borrowed from behavioral psychology. Applying this technique to AI, engineers use a points system where machines earn points by carrying out the right actions. For instance, a robot may earn one point for correctly stacking a set of boxes and another point for retrieving a box from outside. But if, on a rainy day for example, a human operator interrupts the robot as it heads outside to collect a box, the robot will learn that it is better off staying indoors, stacking boxes and earning as many points as possible. “The challenge isn’t to stop the robot, but rather to program it so that the interruption doesn’t change its learning process – and doesn’t induce it to optimize its behavior in such a way as to avoid being stopped,” says Guerraoui.\nFrom a single machine to an entire AI network\nIn 2016, researchers from Google DeepMind and the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University developed a learning protocol that prevents machines from learning from interruptions and thereby becoming uncontrollable. For instance, in the example above, the robot’s reward – the number of points it earns – would be weighted by the chance of rain, giving the robot a greater incentive to retrieve boxes outside. “Here the solution is fairly simple because we are dealing with just one robot,” says Guerraoui.\nHowever, AI is increasingly being used in applications involving dozens of machines, such as self-driving cars on the road or drones in the air. “That makes things a lot more complicated, because the machines start learning from each other – especially in the case of interruptions. They learn not only from how they are interrupted individually, but also from how the others are interrupted,” says Alexandre Maurer, one of the study’s authors.\nHadrien Hendrikx, another researcher involved in the study, gives the example of two self-driving cars following each other on a narrow road where they can’t pass each other. They must reach their destination as quickly as possible – without breaking any traffic laws – and humans in the cars can take over control at any time. If the human in the first car brakes often, the second car will adapt its behavior each time and eventually get confused as to when to brake, possibly staying too close to the first car or driving too slowly.\nGiving humans the last word\nThis complexity is what the EPFL researchers aim to resolve through “safe interruptibility.” Their breakthrough method lets humans interrupt AI learning processes when necessary – while making sure that the interruptions don’t change the way the machines learn. “Simply put, we add ‘forgetting’ mechanisms to the learning algorithms that essentially delete bits of a machine’s memory. It’s kind of like the flash device in \nMen in Black\n,” says El Mahdi El Mhamdi, another author of the study. In other words, the researchers altered the machines’ learning and reward system so that it’s not affected by interruptions. It’s like if a parent punishes one child, that doesn’t affect the learning processes of the other children in the family.\n“We worked on existing algorithms and showed that safe interruptibility can work no matter how complicated the AI system is, the number of robots involved, or the type of interruption. We could use it with the Terminator and still have the same results,” says Maurer.\nToday, autonomous machines that use reinforcement learning are not common. “This system works really well when the consequences of making mistakes are minor,” says El Mhamdi. “In full autonomy and without human supervision, it couldn’t be used in the self-driving shuttle buses in Sion, for instance, for safety reasons. However, we could simulate the shuttle buses and the city of Sion and run an AI algorithm that awards and subtracts points as the shuttle-bus system learns. That’s the kind of simulation that’s being done at Tesla, for example. Once the system has undergone enough of this learning, we could install the pre-trained algorithm in a self-driving car with a low exploration rate, as this would allow for more widespread use.” And, of course, while making sure humans still have the last word.\nDynamic Safe Interruptibility for Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n, El Mahdi El Mhamdi, Rachid Guerraoui, Hadrien Hendrikx and Alexandre Maurer.

Scala offers the best of both worlds in a modern, effective and high-level language that developers can use to concisely and elegantly express current programming models. \n The Scala language, whose name comes from scalable, is not particularly difficult and can be used for large-scale projects. It can also work alongside existing systems, something that makes it appealing for companies. All these features underpinned its success, particularly in industry: it was released in 2004 and now has over 500,000 developers worldwide. It is used by companies like Twitter, Netflix, Swisscom, the Swiss stock exchange; banks and financial institutions; and media concerns like the New York Times and Huffington Post; and Spark, the largest data science project in the past 10 years.\n To ensure this important language receives the long-term support it needs, EPFL is launching the today with the support of five partners: IBM, Goldman Sachs, Nitro, Lightbend and Verizon. The center, based at EPFL, will be devoted to improving the language. “Our main goal is to ensure that the Scala language is always freely available to everyone,” said Heather Miller, the director of the new center. EPFL will focus in particular on fine-tuning Scala as a programming tool. “EPFL must coordinate and guide developers in the open-source community in the effort to improve the language, its tools and its documentation,” said Dr. Odersky. “There are so many discoveries remaining to be made in our field, and I hope that EPFL will contribute to this in the future.”\n The Scala Center will also develop MOOCs. EPFL’s first MOOC on Scala, “Functional Programming Principles in Scala,” is given by Dr. Odersky and is the school’s most popular online course.

{"id": 134, "text": "Vincent Kaufmann, a sociologist who specializes in mobility studies, decided to expand his usual focus on urban areas to include Switzerland and the European Union (EU). Kaufmann, who is also the head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, teamed up with Spanish researcher Ander Audikana to write an essay on mobility and the free movement of people in the EU and in Switzerland. The authors’ starting point was the “Stop mass immigration\" initiative, which was approved by voters on 9 February 2014.\nTheir essay provides a Swiss perspective that people concerned about a borderless EU and its unintended consequences might do well to consider. Clive H. Church, researcher at the University of Kent,\nalso draws an interesting parallel between Switzerland and post-Brexit UK in the book’s preface. Vincent Kaufmann tells us why this essay is important.\nWhat gave rise to this essay?\nSwitzerland has been dealing with mobility-related issues for decades: the introduction of the Erasmus program, truck traffic crossing the Alps, limiting trucks to 40 tons, the AlpTransit initiative, the free movement of people, the modal shift from road to rail, and so on. All these issues have one thing in common: mobility. And yet, they are never analyzed together. On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people voted on two separate questions that, in reality, were both rooted in mobility. On that day, the people approved the “Stop mass immigration” initiative, which called for immigration quotas. They also gave the go-ahead for a fund to upgrade the country’s rail infrastructure. In a way, Swiss people paradoxically voted for “less mobility” and “more mobility” at the same time. Since then, there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric but very little sociological analysis of what really happened in that vote. Seeing this, Ander Audikana and I wanted to show how important it is to look at all these mobility issues together, in Switzerland but also in the EU, in order to get a better idea of what the consequences will be.\nWhat are your main conclusions?\nIn the first part of our essay, we look at the EU’s founding documents. It’s clear that the free movement of people – much more than economic interests – was at the core of the European project. These documents show that mobility was considered the only way of unifying the member states and erasing the differences in their political and welfare systems. The Erasmus program, for example, clearly states this goal in its founding texts. But there are two sides to mobility: movement and “moorings”. Moorings refer to the connections a person makes once they have moved to a new place: building meaningful social relationships, absorbing the culture, learning the language, making use of public spaces, coming to identify with the place and building an emotional bond with it etc. Unfortunately, EU policies largely overlook this, and instead demand that people move from place to place while failing to assess the consequences of widespread geographical mobility on regional development, the ability of diverse groups of people to live alongside each other, and wage dumping. These problems are left to the individual member countries, and we think this is a major shortcoming.\nHow does this shortcoming affect Switzerland?\nIn theory, an EU company could win a contract to plant trees in a small Swiss town, and no local landscaping companies would be able to compete on price. This is a good example of mobility without moorings: the cross-border deal is encouraged without first looking at whether this scenario is fair. While people consider these types of situations totally unfair, the EU has created a legal apparatus that is simply oblivious to this. It’s this type of mechanism that Europeans are now rallying against, as we see in the rise in populism. The mobility demanded by the EU creates as many problems as it solves.\nYou interviewed the leaders of the six main political parties in Switzerland about this issue. Yet they are cited anonymously in your essay. Why did you do this?\nWe wanted to get away from partisan politics and take an anthropological approach. Rereading these interviews, we saw that mobility-related questions did not fit neatly into the left-right paradigm. We see, for example, very liberal views on both sides: the idea that the world will be a better place the more people move around. At the same time, there’s a need for the state to be more assertive and get a better grip on the flow of money, people and goods. We think that where these two positions meet is where we can find compromises and solutions. In Switzerland, local identity is important and is currently seen as being under threat. The people want the government to do something about this.\nIs this what the EU could learn from the Swiss experience when it comes to rethinking mobility and the elimination of borders? \nSwitzerland is seeking a better balance between mobility and moorings. The fact that the EU is so dogmatic about being borderless is a problem for Switzerland, since this country doesn’t work that way. The Swiss don't subscribe to dogmas – they reach compromises through discussion and direct democracy. For EU countries, Switzerland is an interesting laboratory. Debates that do not happen elsewhere take place here. We feel that the way in which the Swiss achieve compromises on questions of mobility and the free movement of people could help the EU overcome some of the hurdles it faces. Our analysis shows, for example, that the EU should not have focused so much on a policy of \nmobility\n in its founding documents but rather on a policy of \naccessibility\n: access to services, to infrastructure and to other countries. The EU’s overriding goal should not be to make sure that people move from here to there at all costs. It should be to guarantee a certain level of fairness when people, goods, and services move across borders. Returning to the example of EU companies competing in Switzerland: in order to gain access to the Swiss market, these companies should apply Swiss prices.\nIn your essay, you foresee a return to medieval, walled-in cities in Europe. Is the situation that dire? \nThe current border situation will require a strong political response by the EU. Failing that, we believe there’s a good chance that walls, watchtowers and barbed wire could indeed pop up all over Europe, transforming the continent into a gated community.\nVincent Kaufmann, Ander Audikana, \nMobilité et Libre circulation en Europe: un regard suisse\n, Fondation Jean Monnet, Economica - Les Cahiers rouges, Paris, 2017.", "summary": "Vincent Kaufmann, an EPFL researcher, has co-authored an essay on Switzerland’s recent referendums on mobility and the free movement of people.

{"id": 135, "text": "The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.\nThey realized that one building in particular – the Saint-François parking lot – was at the core of the problem. This building links the city center with the Flon neighborhood, meaning that it could play a strategic role in turning downtown Lausanne car-free. So they decided to expand and completely transform it. “Our building holds a restaurant, a co-op market with local products, and a hotel that offers medium-term accommodations such as for artists, conference-goers and businesspeople,” says Flavien Davin. “There would also be common spaces and a co-working area to promote interaction between these groups.”\nThe students also added a public staircase along the side of the building. “We felt that this ‘patchwork building’ deserved an important role, as it sits above one of Lausanne’s public transport hubs,” says Bernard Valette, co-author of the study. “Currently, people who use the parking lot do not have direct access to the various means of public transport beneath the building. Our aim was to better coordinate the building’s different purposes.”\nPedestrian zone and distribution depots\nTheir project also encompasses the Flon train station, which is the third largest in French-speaking Switzerland in terms of passenger numbers. “Our vision was to transform the downtown area, between the Flon neighborhood and Saint-François, into a huge pedestrian zone. That would require expanding the public transport system and totally redesigning the city’s logistics,” says Valette. The students’ project takes into account the future M3 metro line, which will strengthen the link between the north and south of the city, as well as the future tram line that will connect the western side of the city to its center. They would add yet another tramline, between Morges and Lutry, in order to relieve throughtraffic south of the city.\nMaintaining the flow of goods to stores and residents in a car-free city center would require some radical thinking. For this, the students designed three major ‘automated distribution depots’ in the city through which all goods headed for downtown stores and residents would pass. These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.\nAccording to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.\nChanges ahead \nIs all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”\nSolving two problems at once\nThe students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”", "summary": "A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035.

{"id": 137, "text": "Before new nanoparticles or other nanomedicines can be injected into the human body, a whole series of tests must be conducted in the laboratory, then in living cells, and in the end on humans. But often the results obtained\n in vitro\n do not resemble what actually happens in the animal or human body. Thus, the researchers reconsidered the basis of the \nin vitro\n experimental design.\nIn an article published in the journal \nSmall\n, EPFL researchers explain how such issues can be avoided by replacing conventional static \nin vitro\n tests with dynamic tests that approximate complex living conditions – comparable to those that occur in the body’s blood and lymphatic systems.\nThe researchers were able to “replicate” the varying real-body conditions in a lab, and test the behaviour of nanoparticles in different blood and lymph flows. They also reproduced the “cleaning” effect of nanoparticles, which go through in lymph nodes, by “washing” lymph off them and reinjecting them into the blood serum.\n“Current incubation conditions are static,” says Marijana Mionić Ebersold, a former post-doc at EPFL, leading author of the study in the framework of a Nano-Tera project and currently working as a scientific collaborator at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV). “Nanoparticles or drugs to be tested are carefully added to the typically static fluids and cells, and then there is a waiting period in static conditions before the interaction and the effects can be studied for instance under the microscope”, she adds. “In the human body, fluids and cells never stay nicely static. It’s an extremely dynamic and complex environment. The conventional static \nin vitro\n methods do not therefore allow for the translation of results from \nin vitro\n to \nin vivo\n testing.”\nReproducing the conditions in blood and lymphatic systems\n For their study, the researchers used the protein corona as the parameter which reflects this \nin \nvitro\n/\nin vivo\n discrepancy. The protein corona forms around nanoparticles when they come into contact with a biological environment. Its presence influences the behaviour of nanoparticles in the body by altering their chemical properties, destination, and their interactions with other cells.\nThe protein corona is affected by both the flow and type of fluid, i.e. blood or lymph, as the study shows. “Surprisingly, the influence of lymph on the protein corona and the fate of nanoparticles has so far been completely neglected – although subcutaneously injected nanomedicines immediately contact the patient’s lymph”, says Mionić Ebersold.\nThe study revealed that a change in both the flow and fluids is an extremely important factor when it comes to the formation of the protein corona. For example, the flow conditions would change and the protein corona would be different in a patient with different blood pressure troubles as compared to a healthy person. Nanoparticles may thus behave quite differently and in various patients and have different effects on them.\nDynamic tests would therefore be extremely useful for observing the formation of the protein corona in various \nin vitro\n environments in order to predict how the nanoparticles will ultimately behave \nin vivo\n. “When \nin vivo\n results are different to \nin vitro \nresults, scientists tend to say that they tested their nanomedicine in the wrong animal model or that the chemicals weren’t exactly the same etc.,” says Mionić Ebersold. “We think that the problem begins much earlier, with the \nin vitro \ntests that are performed at the starting point of translational nanomedicine: their static design is what often accounts for the discrepancies with the later \nin vivo \ntests.”\n-----\nSource:", "summary": "EPFL researchers propose a new approach of performing in vitro tests on nanoparticles that could enhance a correlation to in vivo results.

In an effort to control the pain, surgeons inject painkillers into the tissue during the operation.

Not only would this implant reduce patients’ post-op discomfort, but there would be no need for further surgery to remove it. They developed a tiny biodegradable electronic circuit, made from magnesium, that could be heated wirelessly from outside the body.\nOnce integrated into the final device, the circuit will allow to release controlled amounts of anesthetic in a specific location over several days.

They ended up shaping the magnesium by depositing it on a substrate and then showering it with ions. “That gave us more flexibility in the design stage,” he adds. They were eventually able to create some of the smallest magnesium resonators in the world: two microns thick, with a diameter of three millimeters.\nThe team’s invention is not quite ready for the operating room. “We still need to work on integrating the resonators into the final device and show that it’s possible to release drugs both \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n,” concludes Rüegg.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed biodegradable microresonators that can be heated locally with a wireless system.

Scientists at EPFL’s  and the  at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin set out to answer these questions. Using the fossilized skeleton and footprints of \nOrobates pabsti \n– a vertebrate that, on the evolutionary tree, comes between amphibians on one hand and reptiles and mammals on the other – the scientists created computer simulations and a robot. Drawing on experimental studies of four living amphibian and reptile species, they used these tools to gauge how plausible different ways of walking were for the fossilized animal.\n“\nOrobates \nis an ideal candidate for understanding how land vertebrates evolved because it is in the lineage leading to modern amniotes. These animals formed in eggs laid on land and became largely independent of water,” says John Nyakatura, a professor at Humboldt-Universität. What’s more, \nOrobates \nis the oldest-known vertebrate for which scientists have been able to link a fossil with its fossilized footprints. “This combination is what enabled us to carry out our unique quantitative study, which paves the way to replicating the walk of other fossilized animals,” says Auke Ijspeert, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. The researchers’ findings appear in .\nA motion-based model and then a robotic one\nTo better understand how \nOrobates \nwalked and pinpoint just how advanced its locomotion was, the scientists at Humboldt-Universität developed a digital model of its skeleton based on the animal’s fossil and the biomechanics of modern animals with sprawling postures. They used this model to carry out the first kinematic computer simulation of \nOrobates’ \ngait as it walks on its digitalized footprints. This simulation focuses on movements (rather than forces) and identifies gaits where the animal’s bones do not collide or come out of their joints.\nIn parallel, two scientists at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory – post-doctoral researcher Kamilo Melo and PhD student Tomislav Horvat – used the fossilized animal anatomy to build a robot called OroBOT. Designed and scaled to match the shape and movements of the extinct animal, OroBOT was used to calculate the physics of how \nOrobates \nwalked. “We tested our hypotheses about the animal’s locomotion dynamics with our robotic model, which factors in the real-world physics of the animal’s gait,” says Melo.\nTesting hundreds of different gaits, based on contemporary animals\nThe interdisciplinary team of scientists tested hundreds of different gaits with their robot in order to determine which ones \nOrobates \ncould have used – and those that it clearly did not. The gaits they tested were based on biomechanical principles extracted from similar modern-day animals such as caimans, salamanders, iguanas and skinks, which they analyzed through X-ray videos and force measurements. “We studied the biomechanics of their movements and determined which mechanical principles they all followed,” says Nyakatura. The research team looked at three features in particular: how erect the animal stood on its legs; how its backbone bent; and how much its elbow or shoulder joints bent as it walked. These three features determine what the researchers call the animal’s “sprawling gait space.” They created  where fellow scientists – and the wider public – can explore the universe of movements that \nOrobates \ncould have used.\nWith these results, they came up with the most likely ways that \nOrobates \nmay have walked. They scored the gaits based on how much energy was required, how stable the movements were, how the leg forces compared with those of other sprawling animals, and how closely the movements aligned with the fossilized footprints. The gaits with good scores appear quite athletic and most closely resemble the movements of caimans. This suggests that \nOrobates \nprobably already held itself a little upright on its legs – unlike salamanders and skinks. Its locomotion was thus more advanced than had been previously thought. \nThe study concludes that advanced — more upright, balanced and mechanically power-saving —locomotion, as in \nOrobates\n, may have evolved before the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals lived. The novel approach developed for this study can be applied by other scientists in their work, and it could be modified to study other evolutionary transitions, such as the origins of flight or galloping gaits in mammals.\nContacts\nFor inquiries about robotics, in English or Spanish:\nKamilo Melo (robotics engineer, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)\nEmail: \nFor inquiries about robotics, in French:\nAuke J.

Its reduced size is the result of an innovative concept similar to the way a Segway keeps its balance, but instead of relying on an internal system the stabilizer is built right into the magnetic components.\nSo simple\n “It is such a simple solution that it has been patented.” says Francesco Mondada head of the MOBOTS group, where the research was done.\n Power generators are ferromagnetic environments made of metal tubing and shafts. And magnetically adhesive robots have been getting larger and more complicated to rise to more difficult challenges. But Rochat’s solution goes against this trend. Its novel magnetic arrangement in the wheel creates sufficient holding force to keep it attached to surfaces even while going around corners upside-down. At the same time, this magnetic force maintains system balance by keeping the motor in place. He thus radically reduced the robot to a match-book size while making it more agile at the same time.\n Technology transfer to industry\n “It is a design solution that did not seem possible,” explains Rochat, “but now future possibilities have opened up that could save millions in costly shut-downs.”\nThe novel design is already being augmented in the laboratory.

{"id": 142, "text": "The brain uses glucose for energy in a very efficient manner. However, given the brain’s structure and metabolic constraints, the way it achieves this efficiency is a mystery. The key is the little-understood relationship between neurons, blood vessels and the other cells of the brain, the glia. Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have now developed the first computer model of this relationship, which has successfully matched previous experimental in vivo and in vitro data in the field. The model, published in \nPLOS Computational Biology\n, is now being integrated into the detailed brain model of the Blue Brain Project.\nThe brain is more than neurons passing information between them. Over half of the brain is actually composed by glial cells, which support and insulate neurons, supply them with energy substrates, protect them from pathogens and even clear out dead neurons from the brain. In fact, glial cells, neurons and the brain’s blood vessels form a functional unit, the neuron-glia-vascular unit (NGV) that regulates the brain’s energy management.\nA team led by Pierre Magistretti (EPFL, KAUST), working with Renaud Jolivet (University College London), has now developed a detailed computer model that accurately captures the dynamics of this relationship. Specifically, the model shows how glucose is shuttled between the three elements of the unit to produce energy for activated neurons.\nPrevious experiments from Magistretti’s group show that glucose flows from a type of glia cells called “astrocytes” to neurons in the form of lactate. However, some theoretical studies have proposed that lactate could go the other way – from neurons to astrocytes. This has major implications for our understanding of brain energy metabolism.\nThe model has now confirmed in quantitative terms that lactate flows from astrocytes to neurons. It is also the first such model to successfully simulate the actual timeframe of this process, a breakthrough that provides a measurable picture of how neurons and glial cells tightly coordinate brain energy metabolism.\nA better understanding of the metabolic relationships between neurons and glia has also important implications for understanding the signals detected with functional brain imaging techniques, such as fMRI and PET, which monitor glucose utilization, blood flow or oxygen consumption changes that occur in register with neuronal activity.\n“This is the first time-dependent and multi-scale model of the neuron-glia-blood vessel that accurately reflects experimental observations from multiple cells types and organisms,” says Pierre Magistretti. The model is now being integrated with the accurate brain model being developed by the Blue Brain Project at EPFL. “By adding the extra layer of neuron-glial dynamics, we can take a step toward more accurately modeling the real working of the brain.”\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL with the University College London, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

{"id": 144, "text": "At  – educational facilities designed to promote cross-disciplinary research – a groundbreaking new device is in the works. Eight Master’s students in microengineering, bioengineering and life sciences () developed a portable biosensor for the  competition, which was held at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands on 7–8 September 2018. Their device can provide precise measurements of the amount of vancomycin, an antibiotic used as a last-resort treatment, in a patient’s blood plasma. This information will help doctors deliver exactly the amount of drug needed and therefore reduce the occurrence of harmful side effects. For instance, vancomycin is known to cause damage to the kidneys and to hearing.\n“We started working on the biosensor last fall alongside our coursework, and this summer have been working on it full-time. Being able to use the DLL has made our research a lot easier, since they have all the equipment we need,” says Alix Faillétaz, a Master’s student in bioengineering. This is the second year in a row that EPFL is participating in SensUs, where its team will be up against students from 12 other universities from around the world. “The competition was launched three years ago. It’s really demanding and is a huge challenge for the students. They must overcome a series of problems and learn to work together, trust each other and delegate tasks based on each individual’s specific skills,” says Professor Philippe Renaud, who is coaching the team.\nPolarization-based measurements\nSensUs aims to encourage the development of biosensors, targeting a different application each year – although the objective always relates to measuring a biomarker with an impact on public health. The objective is chosen by a panel of experts that includes Professor Renaud. Existing tests to measure vancomycin require a great deal of time, a considerable amount of blood and a special machine that costs tens of thousands of Swiss francs. But the EPFL team’s portable biosensor can take measurements in less than five minutes with just a few drops of blood, and costs under 5,000 francs. Their device shines polarized light on a sample containing a homogeneous mixture of the patient’s blood plasma and a synthetized peptide (an amino-acid sequence) solution.\nHow does it work? “We first created a peptide that bonds specifically to vancomycin, and then we added a fluorescent compound,” says Faillétaz. “As the vancomycin bonds to the fluorescent peptide, the peptide’s movement slows and the light it emits becomes more and more polarized. By measuring the degree of light polarization, we can calculate the vancomycin concentration in a patient’s blood.” According to Professor Renaud, this method already exists but has never been used to make a portable biosensor.\nAt the competition, the EPFL team will have to not only prove their biosensor’s efficacy by analyzing various samples, but also demonstrate its benefits for the healthcare industry and its market potential. “By changing the synthesis compound, our biosensor could be used to detect other antibiotics and biomarkers,” says David Vilela, a Master’s student in life sciences.\nEPFL on the first step of the podium\n The SenSwiss team won the most awards in the SensUs international competition. They won the technical award, and placed second for the awards related to creativity and entrepreneurship. Their biosensor has proven to be the most effective in accurately measuring the amount of vancomycin in blood plasma samples. This can be done in less than five minutes, with only a few drops of blood and innovative technology. The team also demonstrated the commercialization potential of his invention, its usefulness to medical personnel and the possibility of adapting the test to other antibiotics.\nThe SenSwiss team: \nMatthieu Pinto (microengineering student) optical detection part, Victor Steininger (bioengineering student) electrical and mechanical parts, Mathieu Jeckelmann (bioengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Jacopo Oswald (microengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Paul Philipp (life sciences student) biological part, Aly Makhlouf (bioengineering student) biological part, David Vilela (life sciences student) biological part, Alix Faillétaz (bioengineering student) electrical part.", "summary": "A team of eight EPFL students won the technical prize in the SensUs international competition, designing a portable biosensor that can measure the amount of vancomycin in a patient’s blood stream, enabling doctors to better control the dosage and reduce harmful side effects.

SwissCube, the little satellite developed by EPFL in partnership with several other specialized universities, is celebrating seven years in space today. EPFL's Space Engineering Center, eSpace, is planning a series of birthday events: a reunion of the satellite’s designers, conferences, personal accounts, previously unseen videos, and the retransmission of one of the satellite’s overhead passes. Plus, a mobile app will soon be available for those interested in keeping tabs on the satellite.\nThere is good reason to celebrate. This little CubeSat – measuring only 10 cm x 10 cm – is now playing with the big boys: it’s the oldest European satellite in its category to still be active. Only four other CubeSats have lasted longer, and they are all of Japanese design. The world record holder has been in orbit for 13 years.\nEarly on, no one thought SwissCube had the stamina. When it was launched, it was expected to function for about four months. And it even got off to a bad start: when it reached orbit it started spinning and couldn’t be used until it stabilized several months later.\nRisky decisions\nSwissCube’s long lifespan is a tribute to the 200 or so students who worked in succession on the project under the guidance of Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace. Over the years, a number of decisions that were considered highly risky at the time proved to be judicious. This includes the use of low-cost components that had never before been used in space.\nThe little satellite, orbiting at an altitude of 720 kilometers and a speed of nearly 7,500 meters per second – 28,000 kilometers per hour – still regularly transmits its position, system status and images back to Earth. That said, the satellite had to be completely rebooted on two separate occasions in recent years owing to system failures. The CubeSat rebooted properly both times, offering further proof of its sound design.\nIt is now starting to show more serious signs of fatigue. “It’s probably nearing the end of its travels,” said Simon Dandavino, the executive director of eSpace. “Its communications system is less responsive, and its data transmission capability is faltering.”\nSwissCube should eventually be picked up by CleanSpace One, the space cleanup satellite currently being built at eSpace. The purpose of that project is to develop solutions to the problem of space debris and demonstrate the feasibility of applying them in the space environment. SwissCube will therefore serve experimental purposes up to the very end.\nAn app, never-before-seen images and a replica\nSwissCube’s birthday celebration has a lot in store for its fans.

{"id": 147, "text": "Bacteria are everywhere. They are the most abundant form of life on our planet. Pick up just about any surface and its likely covered in bacteria. The aquatic environment is no different. Indeed, the ocean is full of small particles and debris, some inert, some highly nutritious. But how do bacteria differentiate between these surfaces, how do they hold onto them in moving water and how do they recognise each other so that they can work together?\nTake the cholera bacterium, \nVibrio cholerae\n, which infects the small intestine, causing diarrhoea and severe dehydration. It lives in salty water, such as seas, oceans, and estuaries, attaching itself to the shells of crustaceans. These exoskeletons are composed of a sugary polymer called chitin, and provide a rich source of food for the cholera bacterium – allowing it to grow and survive in the environment.\nTo do all this, \nV. cholera\ne uses an appendage that’s “a bit like a grappling hook’’ says lead researcher David Adams. “The idea is that bacteria can throw out these long ropes, hook onto something, and reel it back in’’. These ‘ropes’ are actually the product of highly versatile nano-machines known as type IV pili, which are used by many different bacterial species for motility, sensing surfaces and sticking to them, and even taking up . Consequently, type IV pili are considered critical for the environmental survival and pathogenesis of not just \nV. cholerae\n but a wide range of bacteria.\nOver the course of the last decade or so, the group of  established that \n only when growing on chitinous surfaces and showed that they are essential for DNA-uptake. But how exactly they functioned and what else they might be capable of doing had remained somewhat elusive and was therefore the focus of the current study published in \nNature Microbiology\n.\nTo directly observe the DNA-uptake pili in live \nV. cholerae\n bacteria, the researchers used a technique called cysteine labelling. With that, they were able to establish that, as predicted, the pili are highly dynamic, extending and retracting to take up DNA. “This was an important milestone’’ says laboratory head Melanie Blokesch “even though we’d established some time ago that these structures were there, to see them moving in real-time was something quite special’’.\nThe biggest insight came however, when researchers disrupted the motor that powers pilus retraction, revealing that these ropes could also self-interact with each other, and in doing so, allow cells to stick together. Curiously, different strains of \nV. cholerae\n produce slightly different variants of the PilA subunit, which forms the major building block of the pilus. Remarkably, this creates a set of highly specific interactions that can be used as an identifier between strains ensuring that like only pairs with like.\nFinally, when researchers visualised \nV. cholerae\n growing under more realistic conditions upon chitin surfaces, they revealed that these DNA-uptake pili naturally form dense networks of self-interacting pili. These pili bind tightly to the chitin surface and are required for the bacterium to stay attached during water flow. Thus, the DNA-uptake pilus is a multifunctional toolkit for chitin surface colonisation and kin recognition and the results of this work will help to advance our understanding of how the cholera bacterium survives in the natural environment. This knowledge, on the other hand, is important to better understand the transmission to humans in cholera endemic regions.", "summary": "The cholera bacterium uses a grappling hook-like appendage to take up DNA, bind to nutritious surfaces and recognise ‘family’ members, EPFL scientists have found.

Hopefully without harm, and it will soon be forgotten.\nBut for the longer-term studies, Asteroid Vesta is a kind of movie star for planetologists. With 500 km in diameter, it is one of the three largest objects of the asteroid belt that formed simultaneously to the solar system we live in, four billion years ago. It is considered a “protoplanet” or a precursor of a planet. Moreover, it is the only known asteroid to have an earth-like structure – with a core, mantle and crust.\nComputer simulation reconstructs collisions between asteroids \n Using a three-dimensional computer simulation, Martin Jutzi from the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern has now accurately reconstructed how Vesta collided with other asteroids twice over a billion years ago. The models show that the protoplanet owes its elliptical shape to these collisions and that they also scarred its surface structure. They are presented in a study published today on the front page of \nNature \nmagazine.\nThe simulations also enable detailed conclusions on the composition and properties of Vesta’s interior to be drawn for the first time, which helps us to better understand the evolution of the solar system. «Based on the sort and distribution of this material at the surface of the asteroid, we are able to precisely reconstruct the various inner layers of Vesta down to a depth of 100 km», explains Philippe Gillet, head of EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory.\nBased on this information, the computer simulations demontrarte exactly how two consecutive impacts of celestial bodies led to the formation of the observed overlapping basins, which almost span the entire southern hemisphere of Vesta. The models show the size (66 and 64 kilometres in diameter), velocity (5.4 kilometres per second) and the impact angle of the bodies that collided with Vesta. This reveals a lot about the properties of the objects that were near the protoplanet a billion years ago.\nThe final images of the simulations closely resemble the shape and topography of Vesta’s southern hemisphere as observed by the Dawn mission. The models even accurately reproduce the spiral-shaped structures inside the youngest crater which are visible on images from the Dawn mission. «This shows how reliable our method is», rejoices Jutzi. “It also proves that the method we used to determine the composition of Vesta’s inner layers are accurate, adds Gillet.

One of them is the Reality Substitution prototype RealiSM.\nReality Substitution is on track to replace traditional virtual reality \nUntil recently, virtual reality’s widespread use, both commercially and in scientific research, has been hampered by the need to develop custom virtual worlds using labor-intensive 3D animation. Researchers and engineers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and the W Science Initiative are unveiling a Reality Substitution Machine prototype at The Brain Forum that could change all of that. The project, known as RealiSM, has developed an easy-to-use virtual world creator that captures real-world situations to be played back in head-mounted displays (HMD). The system will soon be employed in the lab to study memory and peri-personal space (the space defined by what is within one’s reach) and will have numerous clinical uses for treating phobias and PTSD therapy.\n“There is a positive feedback loop between virtual reality and cognitive neuroscience,” says EPFL researcher and project leader Bruno Herbelin. “On one hand, with a Virtual Reality setup we have an environment that can be completely controlled and endlessly repeated—which are ideal experimental conditions. On the other hand, insights from the cognitive sciences are leading to more immersive, extremely realistic experiences for increasingly effective clinical therapies, behavioral experiments and even better gameplay for entertainment.”\nThe RealiSM project aims to make this technology more accessible to the average clinician and could also bring the technology to developing countries. Other potential uses include immersive, real-time video recording to bring business calls to the next level or even help those working or serving their country abroad feel closer to home.\nReal-time demonstrations at The Brain Forum 2015\n An immersion booth, dedicated to the RealiSM project and designed especially for The Brain Forum, will house a real-time demonstration of the teleconferencing ability of the new reality substitution platform until April 1, 2015.\nProgram information: http://thebrainforum.org/program", "summary": "The Brain Forum 2015 in Lausanne opened today and is generating huge interest: more than 1000 people have registered.

{"id": 152, "text": "Image caption: Loss of ANTXR2 leads to the accumulation of extracellular material in mice uterus and sterility (Left). Collagen 6 removal in mice without ANTXR2 restore uterine structure and function (Right). This result indicates that collagen 6 accumulation is the cause of uterine tissue disruption in mice devoid of ANTXR2, the latter playing a crucial role in collagen 6 degradation.\nHyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS) is a rare but severe genetic disease that affects babies, children, and adults. A glassy substance called hyaline accumulates in the skin and various organs of patients, causing painful deformities and may lead to early death. The disease is caused by gene mutations that destroy the function of a protein whose physiological function is little understood. EPFL scientists have now studied and characterized its function for the first time, showing that it binds and controls the body levels of an important type of collagen. The work is published in \nNature Communications\n.\nHFS is caused by a mutation of a gene called \nCMG2,\n also abbreviated as \nANTXR2\n because it renders cells sensitive to anthrax infections. The gene produces a protein that is embedded in the membrane of cells, and is known to bind anthrax toxins internalizing them into the cell where they exert their action. This is however not the physiological function of this protein.\nThe HFS mutation of the gene causes the protein to lose its function. A hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of collagen in large nodules under the skin. Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, found in skin, cartilage, blood vessels, and even teeth. There are many different types of collagen, which surround cells and support the body’s various tissues and organs by forming elastic or rigid structural networks.\nThe lab of  has now shown for the first time that the CMG2 protein interacts with a type of collagen called collagen VI. Normally, CMG2 binds collagen VI and, when there is too much, internalizes it into the cell’s lysosomes for degradation. The study suggests that, in HFS, the mutation of the CMG2 gene disrupts the function of the protein, leading to accumulation of collagen VI in various parts of the body.\nCollagen VI is a type of collagen that recent studies have found in multiple sites in the body, such as the heart, neurons, immune cells, tendons, lungs, and the skin. Depending on the type of tissue, it plays different protective and mechanical roles, but it has also been shown to be involved in a number of diseases, including the growth of cancer tumors.\nThe EPFL researchers studied HFS nodules in mouse models as well as a human patient. The female HFS mice characteristically suffer from accumulation of collagen in the uterus, which makes them sterile. The human patient had nodules at various body sites including the scalp and behind the ear. Studying tissue samples, the researchers found that the nodules in both mice and human were rich in collagen VI.\nWanting to understand the relationship between CMG2 and collagen VI, the team developed double-knockout mice in which the genes for both proteins — CMG2 and collagen VI — had been deleted. Previous studies have shown that CMG2-knockout mice are infertile due to uterine nodules that render them infertile. But remarkably, the scientists found that when the gene for collagen VI was deleted too, the mice regained their fertility, confirming that CMG2 and collagen VI are somehow connected in HFS.\nFurther studies showed that CMG2 physically binds collagen VI through a specialized domain. The CMG2 protein then acts as a receptor, sending a signal into the cell, causing collagen VI to be internalized and degraded inside the cell’s lysosomes.\nThe study reveals a major physiological function for CMG2 and demonstrates its interaction with collagen VI. This interaction explains how major HSF symptoms arise when mutation of the \nCMG2\n gene disrupts the ability of the CMG2 protein to control the levels of collagen VI, which then over-accumulates and produces the painful and disfiguring symptoms of the disease.\nThis study was led by EPFL’s Global Health Institute in collaboration with the University of Bern, the Medical University of Innsbruck, the University of Freiburg, the Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV), and the University of Padova.

{"id": 153, "text": "Is lightning born of an angry sky? Not always. In some circumstances, it can also be initiated from the ground. Upward-moving discharges can easily be distinguished from downward ones by the inverted branches of the lightning which point to the clouds rather than the ground. Upward strikes are a poorly understood phenomenon and mainly occur where tall and slender structures are located on high ground. A researcher from EPFL’s Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory (EMC) took an interest in this topic, analyzed it and ended up writing his thesis on it. The results of his research were published in a recent issue of the \nJournal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics\n.\n“Ground-to-cloud lightning strikes have been observed since the 1930s, but it is only recently, with the growing use of wind turbines, that it has become a real concern,” said Aleksandr Smorgonskii, a doctoral student at the EMC Lab.\nDespite their power, these discharges are harmless when it comes to communication antennas and skyscrapers. These metallic structures, equipped with lightning rods, conduct the electricity from the ground to the top where they escape without causing any damage. The same is not true of wind turbines, however.\nBlades destroyed\n“In order to optimize wind capture, wind turbines are commonly built in the mountains – on crests no less,\" said Smorgonskii. “The combination of a tall structure and high altitude corresponds exactly to the conditions in which ground-to-cloud lightning forms. If the tower is made of metal, the blades are the weak point. Not only are they long and light, and thus fragile, but they are also made of non-conductive composite materials. As a result, they are often damaged, if not destroyed, by the extreme electrical charge.\"\nSmorgonskii’s’ idea was to analyze the mechanisms underlying this type of lightning strike in order to adapt the design of wind farms to account for these risks. He analyzed data that had been recorded over the course of around 15 years at two mountaintop radio transmitters, one on Gaisberg Mountain in Austria and the other on Säntis Mountain in central Switzerland. The latter transmitter, perched over 2,500 meters above sea level, is known for being the most lightning-prone spot in Europe.\nThunderstorm activity\nAmong the most interesting figures revealed by the study is the fact that, in one year, these high structures can record up to 100 more upward than downward strikes. It also appears that most ground-to-cloud strikes occur in the absence of existing thunderstorm activity. Using the Europe-wide lightning-detection system Euclid, Smorgonskii determined, for a given upward strike, whether a downward strike had taken place within a 50-kilometer radius less than one second before. This was true in only 15% of cases. Which means that more than 80% of ground-to-cloud strikes are initiated independently.\n\"Weather conditions, especially the temperature and its distribution in the air, also appear to be an important factor in triggering these lightning strikes,” said Smorgonskii. Determining the exact nature of the risks will require careful study of both geographical and climatological data specific to each site.\nA Youtube video of upward lightening flashes can be viewed .

{"id": 154, "text": "A group of spintronics researchers at EPFL is using new materials to reveal more of the many capabilities of electrons. The field of spintronics seeks to tap the quantum properties of “spin,” the term often used to describe one of the fundamental properties of elementary particles – in this case, electrons. This is among the most cutting-edge areas of research in electronics today.\nResearchers working in the Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES), which is run by Professor Andras Kis, were able to quantify these quantum properties for a category of two-dimensional semiconductors called transition metal dichalcogenides, or TMDCs. Their research projects, which were published recently in \nACS Nano\n and today in \nNature Communications\n, confirm that materials like graphene (C), molybdenite (MoS\n2\n) and tungsten diselenide (WSe\n2\n) offer, either alone or by combining some of their characteristics, new perspectives for the field of electronics – perspectives that could ultimately lead to smaller chips that generate less heat.\n“With the methods we’ve recently developed, we’ve shown that it is possible to access the spin in these TMDC materials, quantify it and use it to introduce new functionalities,” says Kis.\nThe device developed at the LANES is composed of monolayer MoS2 is the active channel, encapsulated between atomically flat h-BN layers and contacted to multilayer graphene.\nThis all takes place at an extremely small scale. In order to access these quantum properties, the researchers must work with high quality materials. “If we want to examine certain characteristics of electrons, including their energy, we need to be able to watch them move over relatively long distances without there being too much dispersion or disruption,” explains Kis.\nIn the form of waves\nThe researchers’ method allows them to obtain samples of sufficient quality both to observe how electrons move around in the form of waves and to quantify their energy.\nBut the LANES team was also able to access another quantum property. Spins of electrons and holes in this type of a 2D semiconductor can be in one of two states, which are conventionally described as being oriented upward – spin up – or downward – spin down. Their energy will be slightly different in each of these two states. That’s called spin splitting, and the EPFL researchers have measured it for the first time for electrons in TMDC materials.\nIn the second publication, the researchers wrote about how they used the spin splitting in a TMDC in order to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene without using a magnetic field.\nSpin splitting used in a TMDC to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene.\nThese discoveries are a step forward for the emerging field of spintronics and make it increasingly likely that a different property of charge carriers – i.e. spin, in addition to the electrical charge – will play a role in tomorrow’s electronic devices.\nThe work was performed in collaboration with Takashi Taniguchi and Kenji Watanabe from NIMS Japan (ACS Nano and Nature Comm. papers) and Barbaros Özyilmaz from National University of Singapore (ACS Nano paper).", "summary": "EPFL researchers have successfully measured some of the quantum properties of electrons in two-dimensional semiconductors.

{"id": 155, "text": "Bees and fish don’t often have the occasion to meet, nor would they have much to say to each other if they did. However, under the ASSISIbf project, engineers from EPFL and four other European universities* were able to get groups of bees and fish to communicate with each other. The bees were located in Austria and the fish in Switzerland. Through robots, the two species transmitted signals back and forth to each other and gradually began coordinating their decisions. The study was published today in \nScience Robotics.\n“We created an unprecedented bridge between the two animal communities, enabling them to exchange some of their dynamics,” says Frank Bonnet, a researcher at EPFL’s Mobile Robots Group (MOBOTS), which is now part of the school’s Biorobotics Laboratory (BioRob). Researchers at MOBOTS have designed robots that can blend into groups of animals and influence their behavior. They have tested their robots on communities of cockroaches, chicks and, more recently, fish – one of these  was able to infiltrate a school of fish in a circular aquarium and get them to swim in a given direction.\nFor this study, engineers took the fish experiment and went one step further, connecting the robot and school of fish with a colony of bees in a laboratory at the Karl-Franzens-University of Graz, Austria. There the bees live on a platform with robot terminals on each side which they naturally tend to swarm around.\nActing as a go-between \nThe robots within each group of animals emitted signals specific to that species. The robot in the school of fish emitted both visual signals – in terms of different shapes, colors and stripes – and behavioral signals – like accelerations, vibrations and tail movements. The robots in the bee colony emitted signals mainly in the form of vibrations, temperature variations and air movements. Both groups of animals responded to the signals; the fish started swimming in a given direction and the bees started swarming around just one of the terminals. The robots in the two groups recorded the dynamics of each group, exchanged that information with each other, and then translated the information received into signals appropriate for the corresponding species.\n“The robots acted as if they were negotiators and interpreters in an international conference. Through the various information exchanges, the two groups of animals gradually came to a shared decision,” says Francesco Mondada, a professor at BioRob.\nDuring the experiment, the two animal species “talked” to each other even though they were some 700 kilometers apart. The conversation was chaotic in the beginning, but eventually led to a certain amount of coordination. After 25 minutes, the animal groups were synchronized – all the fish swam in a counterclockwise direction and all the bees had swarmed around one of the terminals.\nSwapping certain characteristics \n“The species even started adopting some of each other’s characteristics. The bees became a little more restless and less likely to swarm together than usual, and the fish started to group together more than they usually would,” says Bonnet.\nThe study’s findings could help robotics engineers develop an effective way for machines to capture and translate biological signals. And for biologists, the study could enable them to better understand animal behavior and how individuals within an ecosystem interact. Further out, the research could be used to develop methods for monitoring natural habitats by using animals’ exceptional sensory capabilities. For instance, scientists could encourage birds to avoid airports and the related dangers or direct pollinators toward organic crops and away from crops with pesticides.\n*University of Lisbon, Portugal; Karl-Franzens-University Graz, Austria; University of Paris Diderot, France; and University of Zagreb, Croatia", "summary": "Through an imaginative experiment, researchers were able to get two extremely different animal species located far apart to interact with each other and reach a shared decision with the help of robots.", "claim": "Through an imaginative experiment, researchers were able to get two extremely different animal species located far apart to interact with each other and reach a shared decision with the help of robots.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 156, "text": "The “deep artificial composer”, or “DAC” for short, generates brand-new melodies that imitate traditional folk music of Irish or Klezmer origin. It does so without plagiarising already existing ones, since melodies it writes are as original as those produced by a human composer. The results were presented in April at this year’s edition of the .\nThe DAC actually produces musical scores of melodies, symbolic music written using notation, and does not generate audio files. “The deep artificial composer can produce complete melodies, with a beginning and an end, that are completely novel and that share features that we relate to style,” says EPFL scientists Florian Colombo who developed the artificial intelligence under the guidance of Wulfram Gerstner, director of the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory.\nColombo continues, “To my knowledge, this is the first time that an artificial neural network model has produced entire and convincing melodies. We also provide a new tool to evaluate the originality of a piece.”\nAlgorithmic music composition was first suggested in the literature by English mathematician Ada Lovelace in the 19\nth\n century, requiring an “Analytical Machine” which could be programmed to solve even the most complex problems, like writing music. The computational power of modern computers and the sheer amount of digitized musical scores are now making automatic music composition a reality.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is already capable of composing symbolic music and is often based on implementing music theory. What’s new with the DAC is that the AI learns to compose complete melodies without any music theory from start to finish, solely based on a large database of existing music. No human postproduction is necessary.\nExtracting music style with probabilities\nEPFL’s deep artificial composer avoids traditional music theory altogether. Each style of music has its own set of rules, and existing AI generated music often uses the Western musical language of harmony and counterpoint. In fact, the EPFL algorithm determines its own composition rules by extracting probability distributions from existing melodies using neural networks, requiring only the computation power of graphic cards that can speed up calculations by a factor of ten compared to standard computers.\nThe DAC extracts the style of the music by learning how a given piece of music transitions from one note to the next, and calculates the probability of the next note’s pitch and duration. The algorithm then trains on multiple scores of music, of any given style, in order to improve its ability to correctly predict the pitch and duration of the upcoming note.\nOnce the training is complete, which means that the predictive performance of the deep artificial composer has reached its target value, set at 50% successful pitches and 80% successful durations, it no longer needs to be trained and can be used to generate new melodies, one note at a time. The deep artificial composer builds a string of notes from beginning to end, including the very first note and the length of the composition, that resembles melodies of the dataset that was used for the training. Listen to a  based on Irish and Klezmer melodies and interpreted by Colombo on the cello.\nOf course, the DAC can compose melodies before the training process is complete, but this leads to , even to the untrained ear. It can also be trained beyond the target value, but the generated pieces tend to resemble existing compositions. The DAC can also determine itself if the composition is original enough by comparing phrases of notes with existing patterns in its database of melodies. Similarly, the algorithm can determine the musical genre – Irish or Klezmer folk in this case – of the generated scores.\nThe generated music is not limited to Irish or Klezmer traditional folk music: any style of music could be used. It just so happens that many Irish and Klezmer melodies are already digitized and easily accessible.\nInsight into the human brain\nThe computing power behind the artificial intelligence is an artificial neural network, known as “long short-term memory” and invented twenty years ago at the IDSIA in Lugano. It has already proven useful for speech recognition and is widely used by the largest software companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.\n“The success of the deep artificial composer provides insight into how the human brain works,” says Gerstner. “Neural networks with memory spanning different time scales are needed to successfully create music, implying that the ability of the human brain to retain information, even after a long period of time, is key to composing music.”\nFor Colombo and Gerstner, the work is preliminary since the DAC is limited to single voice compositions. In the long-run, Colombo hopes to generate a score for an entire orchestra.", "summary": "A deep-learning algorithm developed by EPFL scientists can generate melodies that imitate a given style of music.

{"id": 157, "text": "EPFL’s Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI) has developed a method for reducing the power requirement of computer chips by mapping out their logic flows in an entirely new way. By using a different set of logic functions for the gates on the billions of transistors on electronic circuits, this system shortens the circuits’ calculation steps. That means chip designers can make their chips either smaller, faster or more energy efficient. Industry leader Synopsys has just acquired the rights to use the technology through a non-exclusive license agreement.\nStreamed logic structures for more powerful chips \nToday most engineers use electronic design automation software to design circuits. This software programs translate complex computational models into a labyrinth of billions of microscopic transistors. The LSI laboratory, directed by Giovanni De Micheli, has a longtime and worldwide renowned experience in design automation. There are only few companies and commercial products in use that sustain the entire semiconductor industry effort. Luca Amarù – while he was a PhD student at LSI – set out to radically change how design automation software generates logic diagrams in order to produce better designs.\nLuca Amarù, who holds a doctoral degree in computer science, came up with a method that uses only two logic primitives: majority and inverter. These functions are displayed in majority-inverter graphs (MIGs). Initial studies indicated that his approach could cut the number of logic steps needed to execute a given task. Later experiments confirmed this, finding that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18% on average relative to standard programs. That frees up transistor capacity for other tasks; engineers could also use these gains to make their chips faster or their devices smaller.\nAmarù, now a senior R&D manager at Synopsys, took his findings even further. He also developed a new Boolean algebra for representing the logic functions, which resulted in additional efficiency gains for his system.\nChips that are smaller and faster than ever before \nLab tests have shown that Amarù’s method also works exceptionally well with components already in the market, such as adders and dividers.

{"id": 158, "text": "Most modern buildings are composed of several layers of materials, each with its own important function: the concrete core supports its weight; the insulation regulates its heat exchange; the facade contributes to its aesthetics. Now, engineers at EPFL are developing a single building block that does all of that, and produces electricity. This new component will provide a sleek alternative to traditional construction materials, and will be lighter, safer, and more energy efficient.\n“We use a composite sandwich construction to make this multi-functional building element,” explains Thomas Keller of the Composite Construction Laboratory (CCLab). The sandwich comprises a dense foam interior encased between layers of glass-fibre reinforced polymer. “We started working on these composite materials over 10 years ago and used them in 2009 for the roof of the Main Entrance Building at the Novartis Campus in Basel, Switzerland,” he says.\nAnd now, with funding from, they are trying to add electricity generation to the mix. “Now our goal is to encapsulate a thin flexible sheet of photovoltaic cells beneath a translucent layer of glass fiber reinforced polymer,” he continues. If they succeed, this material could contribute to making solar panels more attractive to architects by offering them more flexibility than traditional construction materials based on reinforced concrete, rigid solar panels, and glass.\nThe solar cell technology comes from Flexcell, a startup from IMT Neuchâtel (since 2009 part of EPFL), that became famous for its flexible sheets of photovoltaic cells. Despite lower efficiencies than conventional photovoltaic cells, their light weight, small volume, and low production costs make them ideal for encapsulation into building elements. And the ease of fitting curved surfaces with them will open new avenues in sustainable architectural design.\nOn top of that there are the other, already demonstrated advantages of these lightweight sandwich components. Prefabrication means that they can be assembled in a factory under ideal conditions before being transported to the construction site, increasing the quality and the safety of the buildings and shortening construction times. And since they are modular, individual elements are easy to repair or to replace if they fail.\nPerfecting the ingredients\n The glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) plays a double role in this sandwich. A layer of GFRP a few millimeters thick encases the foam core, giving the building block its remarkable stability. Another layer of it encapsulates and protects the solar cells, drawing on an interesting optical property of the GFRP: when applied thinly, it is almost as transparent as glass, with an optical transmittance only four percent lower. Currently, a PhD student at the CCLab is perfecting this layer’s thickness to find the best compromise between structural stability and optical translucence.\n“Besides the optical issues,” says Keller, “we are dealing with temperature related issues. Heating the resin leads to a loss of efficiency in light transmission. Beyond a certain critical temperature, the material could degrade and fail to recover its original state when it cools down.” But so far it has withstood temperatures beyond those expected even in the hotter parts of the world, without showing signs of degradation.\nNot yet two years in to the project, the scientists involved are optimistic. Solar electricity generation is here to stay, and considering the widespread use of curved concrete surfaces in contemporary architecture, there could be great potential for this new solar sandwich.", "summary": "All in one: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at EPFL", "claim": "All in one: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at EPFL", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 159, "text": "The Solar Decathlon was established as an international competition between universities in the United States in 2002. The goal is to design and build a home powered only by solar power in the space of 18 months. Indeed, the Swiss Team has been preparing for the Solar Decathlon 2017 since 2015. This year’s event will take place in Denver, Colorado from October 5-15th. The Swiss Team is made up of around 50 students from four higher education institutions: the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the School of Engineering and Architecture Fribourg (HEIA-FR / HES-SO), the Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD / HES-SO) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR) united under the banner of the Swiss Living Challenge.\nA multifunctional space...\nThe Swiss team has designed an instigator of change, a neighborhood house that can be integrated into various urban settings. The aim of NeighborHub, as it is called, is to bring neighbors together, working with them on more energy-efficient solutions. There are seven issues to consider: energy, mobility, choice of materials, biodiversity, food, waste management and water management. Visitors can get advice and take part in interactive events and discussions on these seven themes. NeighborHub’s architectural design includes a large multifunctional space to facilitate these various interactions.\n...that speaks to you\nInside NeighborHub there is a temperate zone, the \nskin\n, with a heated space, the \ncore\n, in the middle. These two areas are divided into four modules: an equipment room, a kitchen, a bathroom with a separate dry toilet and a private space with a bedroom. In this shared dwelling, not only the walls but also the furniture and other surfaces speak, as it were, to the building’s occupants by means of printed text and a system of signage devised specially for a shared space. ‘We came up with some catchy phrases to tell visitors about NeighborHub’s features so that they can settle in quickly,’ explains Flavia Viscardi, the student in charge of communication in the building. ‘To complete the house’s vibrant and informative visuals, we’ve used color coding and illustrations.’\nSunshine and plants for the building envelope\nIn line with the Solar Decathlon’s competition rules, solar panels have been installed on NeighborHub’s exterior surfaces, providing 100% of its power. Contrary to common practice, however, these panels are not fixed to the roof; instead, you’ll find the solar and thermal panels on the building’s façades and doors. The external surface consists of photovoltaic cells, together with opaque polycarbonate panels and transparent acrylic panes. ‘The unit also has vertical greenhouses, and an aquaponic system for growing fruit and vegetables with a fish tank below,’ adds Axelle Marchon, the student in charge of coordinating the architectural team.\nA closed water cycle\nThe roof of the building is partly covered by plant matter, and rainwater is collected in the middle. The water used in the NeighborHub can be separated out into various types – much like for waste recycling. The rainwater collected on the roof is used for some domestic appliances, as its low mineral content minimizes scaling. The waste water from these appliances, as well as from showers and sinks, gets used as grey water, which is treated using a phyto-purification process: the water is filtered and purified using a reed bed with different layers of gravel. There is no ‘black water’ from conventional toilets in NeighborHub, as the building is instead equipped with dry toilets. ‘The compost we get from them will provide nutrients for the crops that are grown around the NeighborHub and on the roof, thus completing the circle,’ explains Camilla Wiseman, who, together with her student colleagues, designed the entire water system.\nTimber rooms shipped across the ocean\nThe international nature of the Solar Decathlon competition means the project is subject to an extremely tight timetable. After the building has been constructed, it will be disassembled and must then be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean before reaching the competition venue. This journey cuts down the time allocation for the only two teams based in Europe. This crucial logistical factor was taken into account from the start of the project, however, and so the NeighborHub is made up of modules whose dimensions are suitable for the containers in which they will be shipped. These modules are made entirely out of wood, which is light and has a positive carbon balance. ‘Once the prefabricated modules arrive at the competition venue in Denver, Colorado, they will be assembled, a bit like a Lego house,’ says Matias Cesari, the student in charge of the building site.\nA house like no other\nAs a competition, the Solar Decathlon has focused on traditional dwelling models, featuring a single family home with a car, with various proposed energy and environmental solutions. The competition criteria and rules were therefore devised from this perspective. But are detached houses really in keeping with today’s social and environmental imperatives? ‘NeighborHub not only satisfies the Solar Decathlon criteria, it boldly presents an alternative way of living on a neighborhood scale, that is both collective and environmentally friendly,’ explains Marilyne Andersen, Dean of EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) and the Faculty Advisor of the project.\nSolid long-term diamond partners\nThe Swiss Living Challenge project could not have made it out of the classrooms without the considerable support of its partners, who provided not just their financial backing but also their expertise.

The bank  has been a loyal supporter of the project from the very beginning, in keeping with its traditional stance of encouraging Swiss innovation and environmental protection.

{"id": 162, "text": "Whether you are a human or a bacterium, your environment determines how you can develop. In particular, there are two fundamental problems. First: what resources can you draw on to survive and grow? And second: how do you respond if your environment suddenly changes? \nA group of researchers from Eawag, ETH Zurich, EPFL Lausanne, and the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen recently discovered that the number of individualists in a bacterial population goes up when its food source is restricted. Their finding goes against the prevailing wisdom that bacterial populations merely respond, in hindsight, to the environmental conditions they experience. Individualists, the study finds, are able to prepare themselves for such changes well in advance.\nScarcity fosters diversity, diversity promotes flexibility\n In a recent paper in the journal \nNature Microbiology\n, researchers working with Frank Schreiber have shown that individual cells in bacterial populations can differ widely in how they respond to a lack of nutrients. Although all of the cells in a group are genetically identical, the way they process nutrients from their surroundings can vary from one cell to another. For example, bacteria called \nKlebsiella oxytoca \npreferentially take up nitrogen from ammonium (NH4+), as this requires relatively little energy. When there isn’t enough ammonium for the entire population, some of the bacteria start to take up nitrogen by fixing it from elementary nitrogen (N2), even though this requires more energy. If the ammonium suddenly runs out altogether, these cells at least are prepared. While some cells suffer, the group as a whole can continue to grow. “Although all of the bacteria in the group are genetically identical and exposed to the same environmental conditions, the individual cells differ among themselves,” says Schreiber.\nDetailed insights thanks to the latest technology\n Schreiber and his colleagues were only able to reveal the astonishing differences between the bacteria by studying them very closely. “We had to measure nutrient uptake by individual bacterial cells – even though these are only 2 μm large,” explains Schreiber. “Usually, microbiologists study the collective properties of millions or even billions of bacteria. It was only thanks to the close collaboration between the research groups, and by pooling our expertise and technical equipment, that we were able to study the bacteria in such detail.”\nBacteria are individualists, too\n The present study shows to what extent individuality – in bacteria and in general – can be essential in a changing environment. Differences between individuals give the group new properties, enabling it to deal with tough environmental conditions. “This indicates that biological diversity does not only matter in terms of the diversity of plant and animal species but also at the level of individuals within a species,” says Schreiber. \n Next, Schreiber and his colleagues plan to study whether the individualistic behavior of specific individuals is of equal importance in natural environments.\nOriginal publication\nPhenotypic heterogeneity driven by nutrient limitation promotes growth in fluctuating environments \n Frank Schreiber, Sten Littmann, Gaute Lavik, Stéphane Escrig, Anders Meibom, Marcel Kuypers, Martin Ackermann.

{"id": 163, "text": "Today’s urbanites are ultra-connected and want to make their voices heard on key issues affecting their cities and neighborhoods. Digital platforms are the most convenient and efficient way to do this – but most cities lack the requisite technological capabilities. That means residents’ input is seldom incorporated into planning decisions. At least that’s the main finding of an architecture thesis carried out at EPFL and defended on 28 November. The study compared Geneva with Singapore, an Asian metropolis recognized as the world’s preeminent smart city.\n“We feel we’re at a pivotal moment. People are adopting new lifestyles – new ways of living, working and getting around. But the tools used for urban planning haven’t changed. Geneva’s district maps date back to 1929! So there’s a gap between the way city residents live today and the methods used to design their neighborhoods. That’s what made me want to investigate this topic further,” says Stéphanie Hasler, an architecture researcher at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT), a research center headed by Jérôme Chenal and Marc Soutter.\nDozens of tools at hand\nThis gap exists despite the dozens of tools urban planners have at their disposal for collecting data on how residents use city services: social media, crowdsourcing platforms and mobile apps, to name just a few (see photos galery). Hasler visited Singapore and saw that its city officials use such tools on a daily basis because city residents willingly share their personal data and ideas with local authorities. A few years ago, the city set up a website where residents can view plans for current and future projects and give their opinions. The website encourages dialogue and prevents residents from having to make a trip to the local planning office.\nChanging city\nSo what tools does Geneva have? “Things are changing and I wanted my thesis to make a positive contribution to the city’s development,” says Hasler. She found that Geneva currently uses data only for broader management purposes, such as to reduce traffic congestion or improve energy efficiency. And efforts to solicit residents’ opinions relate primarily to getting feedback on existing projects rather than spawning new ideas. However, Hasler stresses that involving residents in the planning phases is essential for making cities more sustainable, particularly in the areas of transportation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. She also points out a dichotomy unique to Switzerland: “This country has a highly developed sense of democracy as well as advanced technology, but the two are not always combined,” she says.\nList of digital platforms\nSo how can city officials improve things? Hasler’s thesis includes a list of digital platforms that they could use to better listen to and incorporate residents’ ideas. She came up with the list after testing around 50 such platforms worldwide, which she grouped by type of urban project they are meant to address.\nHasler prefers to talk about “responsive cities” rather than “smart cities,” as the former implies putting residents’ needs first. “Urban planners have to serve as coordinators between politicians, experts and residents. Digital technology is essential to doing this effectively, because it helps incorporate the interests of all stakeholders in decision-making,” she says. However, Hasler sensed resistance to the concept of connected urban planning among some of the Geneva planners she interviewed in her research. “Staff training or continuing education programs will be necessary,” she adds.\nCombining the 15 district maps\nIn addition to efforts to more fully involve city residents, Hasler states that Geneva city officials could also work on streamlining their processes and combining the 15 district maps into a single application that all city staff could use. That would help prevent people from working in silos and eliminate discrepancies among the maps. Singapore has been using such an application since 2016, which can also display real-time information on the types of transportation that city residents are using, for example.\nThis thesis research was carried out at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT) in association with ETH Zurich’s Future Cities Lab in Singapore.", "summary": "By comparing the cities of Geneva and Singapore, an EPFL thesis found that urban planners can reap multiple benefits by better leveraging digital technology.

{"id": 164, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.

Some of the best ideas that come out of the hackathon will be developed further either by EPFL students as part of their semester projects, or outside of EPFL.\nThe event will last 72 hours. Mentors will help project teams plan out and organize their work – then participants will work day and night to develop open-source prototypes of their applications. The hackathon will end on Monday so that the mentors and judges have enough time to provide useful feedback. “We hope that our event will lead to some tangible, actionable ideas that can be implemented quickly, like the ventilators that an Italian doctor created out of scuba masks to help treat COVID-19 patients,” says Blagovesta Kostova, the president of LauzHack. A panel of judges will select the best projects. Some EPFL students who participate in the hackathon will be able to use their work as the basis for their semester projects, as agreed with the Vice Presidency for Education.

{"id": 169, "text": "A leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, colon cancer is famously resistant to treatment. There are many reasons for this, but one has to do with a group of persisting cancer cells in the colon that cause relapses. Conventional therapies against them are mostly ineffective. EPFL scientists have now identified a biological mechanism that can be exploited to counteract colon cancer relapses. The approach activates a protein that is lost in the persisting cancer cells. The researchers were able to reactivate it using vitamin A, thus eliminating the cancer cells and preventing metastasis. The study  and introduces a new way to treat colon cancer.\nWhen a colon-cancer patient receives treatment, e.g. chemotherapy, most of the cancer cells die off. But the genetic mutations that caused the cancer in the first place can survive in a specific group of cells of the colon. These are actually stem cells, meaning that they are premature cells waiting to grow into full-blown, normal cells of the colon. After cancer treatment ends, the surviving stem cells, still containing the cancerous mutations, can reappear and cause a relapse.\n studied how differentiated colon cells come from stem cells in the gut. Using an array of different techniques, the team looked at cells, mouse models and samples from human patients.\nProteins and signaling pathways \nThe study focused on a protein called HOXA5, which belongs to a family of proteins that regulate the development of the fetus. These proteins are made during early development and work together to make sure that every tissue is correctly identified and that the fetus’s body and limbs are patterned properly. In the adult body, proteins like HOXA5 regulate the body’s stem cells to maintain both the identity and function of different tissues. Huelsken’s team found that in the gut, HOXA5 plays a major role in restricting the number of stem cells, as well as the cells that make them.\nLike all proteins, HOXA5 originates from a specific gene. The study showed that the cancerous stem cells of the colon use a biological mechanism that blocks it. This mechanism is called a “signaling pathway” because it involves a domino of molecules, each activating the next one down the line. The purpose of a signaling pathway is to transmit biological information from one part of the cell to another, e.g. from the outer membrane all the way to the nucleus. By blocking the HOXA5 gene, the cancerous stem cells of the colon can grow uncontrollably and spread, causing relapses and metastasis.\nRetinoids: a way to fight back \nThe researchers looked for ways to reverse the blocking of HOXA5. The answer came from vitamin A. This small chemical structure is called a retinoid, and it has been known to induce differentiation of stem cells in the skin. The EPFL scientists found that retinoids can re-activate HOXA5. In mice that had colon cancer, the treatment with retinoids blocked tumor progression and normalized the tissue. By turning the gene for HOXA5 back on, this treatment eliminated cancer stem cells and prevented metastasis in the live animals. The researchers got similar results with samples from actual patients.\nThe new study suggests that patients that may profit from this well-tolerated treatment can be identified based on their expression pattern for the HOXA5 gene. Retinoid differentiation therapy could be significantly effective against colon cancer, not only for treatment of existing disease but also as a preventive measure in high-risk patients.\nThis study included contributions from EPFL’s core facilities, Kyoto University, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency. It was funded by EMBO, the Swiss League against Cancer, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the NCCR in Molecular Oncology.\nReference\nOrdóñez-Morán P, Dafflon C, Imajo M, Nishida E, Huelsken J. \nHOXA5 Counteracts Stem Cell Traits by Inhibiting Wnt Signaling in Colorectal Cancer.\nCancer Cell \n14 December 2015.

{"id": 171, "text": "A flock of birds suddenly taking off and flying in formation, acting like one entity, is a stunning and complex communication effort. But can flying robots imitate birds when flying in a flocking formation? Today, a demonstration of EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems technology will be presented at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2011) by Sabine Hauert. She shows how up to ten fixed-wing robots can fly in flock-like formation patterns by communicating with their neighbors.\n Hauert, who achieved this result within her PhD studies in Professor Dario Floreano’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, adapted an algorithm developed in 1986 by Craig Reynolds that simulates individual birds communicating with their flying neighbors in order to stay in a close formation. The robots, developed by EPFL spin-off senseFly, communicate by creating a one-to-one wireless network in the sky—each one can then tell the distance and direction of its closest neighbors, keeping the flock together without regard for all of the robots as a group.\n “Flocking requires three things. You need to move with the same speed and direction as your neighbors, you need to avoid hitting them and you need to stay close,” Hauert, now a post-doctoral student at MIT recently told Wired.com.\n Computer simulations at Floreano’s laboratory show that it is possible to flock up to 100 Micro-Air Vehicles or MAVs with this novel control algorithm.

The planet’s largest reef, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, is currently experiencing enormous coral bleaching for the second year in a row, while last year left only a third of its 2300-km ecosystem unbleached. The demise of coral reefs heralds the loss of some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching in the Maldives. Photo credit: The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers\nNow, scientists have shown that corals in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Northern Red Sea are particularly resistant to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The results are published today in the journal \nRoyal Society\nOpen Science.\nThe implications are important, as the Gulf of Aqaba is a unique coral refuge. The corals may provide the key to understanding the biological mechanism that leads to thermal resistance, or the weakness that underlies massive bleaching. There is also the hope that the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs could be used to re-seed deteriorated reefs in the Red Sea and perhaps even around the world.\nScientists at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (Université de Lausanne) in Switzerland, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period. They found that the corals did not bleach.\n “[Under these conditions,] most corals around the world would probably bleach and have a high degree of mortality,” says EPFL scientist Thomas Krueger. “Most of the variables that we measured actually improved, suggesting that these corals are living under suboptimal temperatures right now and might be better prepared for future ocean warming.”\nInterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nAt the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, the scientists exposed corals of the species \nStylophora pistillata\n, collected from the Gulf of Aqaba, to water temperatures and acidification. The conditions resemble the summer conditions of a future ocean in this region if local ocean warming continues at its current rate of approximately 0.4-0.5°C per decade. They performed an overall health check of all the major physiological functions of the corals, measuring variables like energy metabolism, the ability to build a skeleton, and nutrient exchange at the molecular level between the coral-host and their algae symbionts. These physiological variables were mostly unaffected by the harsh experimental treatment. Still, further work on ecologically relevant variables like fertility or competitive performance is needed.\nSymbiotic corals live together with an algae partner, much in the same way humans are in symbiosis with gut bacteria. Just as bacteria in the gut aid with digestion, providing valuable nutrients to the rest of the body, the algae that live within the coral-partner provide nutrients to the corals. The bacteria in our body thrive within our digestive tract, just as the algae benefit from living within the coral partner. Bleaching occurs when the colored algae are ejected by their coral-partner, and the symbiosis breaks down. If the algae do not return, the coral dies.\nCorals growing at the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nPre-acclimated to thermal tolerance\nThe coral species \nStylophora pistillata \noccurs in other regions of the world, and beyond the Gulf of Aqaba, does not necessarily demonstrate thermal resistance. The biological mechanism that underlies the robustness of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs is still unknown, but the scientists have an idea of how the species evolved to become thermally resistant.\n“Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba are pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance due to the special geography and recent history of the Red Sea,” says scientist Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences.\nAt the end of the last ice age, corals started recolonizing the whole of the Red Sea through the southern connection to the Indian Ocean. The thermal bottleneck at the southern entrance with summer water temperatures rising to 30-32°C provided a selective barrier, allowing only highly resistant individuals to move north. Ironically, this heat-resistant founding population encountered much cooler waters once reaching the northern end, where the Gulf of Aqaba is located.\nBased on this, the study hypothesized that these corals might be able to better cope with today’s ocean warming, considering that they not only descended from a heat-selected founding population, but they also started their warming trajectory from a lower temperature, compared to their counterparts in the central and southern Red Sea.\nProtection of the Gulf of Aqaba Reef\nDespite being resistant to global warming, the corals from the Gulf of Aqaba are still vulnerable to other stresses like pollution.\n“Local disturbances, such as local oil pollution, nutrients from fish farms, herbicides from gardening, may reduce the exceptionally high tolerance of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs,” says Fine.\n“This reef should receive international recognition as a natural site of great importance, because it might very well be one of the last reefs standing at the end of this century,” says Anders Meibom of EPFL. “I would like to encourage the countries around the Gulf of Aqaba – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel – to get together and create a strong protection environmental program, because even if these corals are resistant to rising water temperatures, they are still sensitive to local pollution, overfishing etc, and they need to be protected from this now.”\nScientists Anders Meibom (left) of EPFL/ UNIL and Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel.", "summary": "Coral reefs in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures.

{"id": 173, "text": "When the World Wide Web was invented at CERN 30 years ago, no one talked about open science. But the internet has become one of the pillars of open science, providing researchers with a way of sharing information with colleagues around the world.\nIn January 2017, soon after taking office, EPFL President Martin Vetterli launched the  in order to raise awareness about this important topic. One key element was the creation of the Open Science Strategic Committee (OSSC), whose members provide EPFL’s Senior Management with input on how to best promote open science. We met with Professor Katrin Beyer, who chairs the OSSC, to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by open science at EPFL and beyond.\nHow open is science today?\nScience is definitely more open now than it was five or ten years ago, and almost certainly less than it will be five or ten years from now. It is increasingly common to share research outputs beyond the traditional manuscript - such as code and data - and this practice will soon be ubiquitous. One thing we notice when discussing the topic of open science among colleagues is that significant differences exist between disciplines. This does not necessarily mean that some are more open than others – they’re simply open in different ways.\nIn some fields it is standard to share preprints; in others open data has a long tradition. Open data seems to be particularly well-established in places where researchers use a large shared infrastructure, such as CERN. These communities have worked for a long time on establishing data-format and documentation standards. It seems much harder to create such standards when everybody has their own laboratory and, often, their own experimental set-up.\nOpen science initiatives touch on several key aspects of the research process – publications, research evaluation, career promotion, funding allocation and so on. Does that mean the whole process is flawed?\nThe process is certainly flawed when it comes to access to scientific literature. Some big legacy publishers now control the majority of the journals in most fields and have profit margins of 30–40%, effectively channeling public money into the pockets of private investors. Many universities simply cannot afford to pay the subscription fees. And while illegal services such as Sci-Hub bring more equality to researchers around the globe, relying on pirated access to knowledge is not a sustainable strategy. We need to do better.\nThat said, open access as it is implemented today does not necessarily solve the economic or equality issue. If it becomes expensive to publish, everyone will be able to read the literature, but only a few will be able to publish it. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\nIn terms of career promotion and evaluating candidates for funding, in theory, the framework is already in place. Many universities, including EPFL, have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which states that researchers should be judged not just on how many articles write and the prestige of the journals in which they publish, but on all types of research output, and that quality should come before quantity. However, in practice, hiring committees evaluating large numbers of applications within a short period of time can find it difficult to implement DORA, because assessing the quality of a variety of research outputs is more time consuming than looking at numbers and journal titles. This remains a challenge.\nHow will open science affect the research community?\nOne major objective of open science is to increase the reproducibility and reusability of published work, and I think this will accelerate science in general and increase its impact. Open science also implies a more inclusive research environment. Being part of an established network of researchers is not necessary anymore to get access to data or code – any researcher anywhere in the world can build on these research outputs.\nYoung researchers may benefit the most from open science. They also have a key responsibility: they contribute a significant part of the research and need to make sure it’s produced and documented so that others can easily build on it. Research institutions need to support them in this endeavor and ensure they have all the methodological tools they need.\nWhat is EPFL’s strategy?\nThe OSSC wants to promote a bottom-up approach to open science. Researchers know best where their disciplines are going, how to innovate in the way their community shares information, and what will have a real impact in making their field more open. But it is EPFL’s responsibility to listen to its researchers and develop the services and infrastructure that will make a clear difference in supporting those striving to implement open science in their daily routine.\nIt is important for EPFL to provide training opportunities at the same time. The summer school session called “Open Science in Practice,” which took place in September, gave PhD students a look at projects and tools that other early career researchers have used in their research practice. Teaching by example is the best way to convince people that open science is possible and has a greater impact, and that good practice does not necessarily require a lot of time. The School’s library also offers a range of courses on tools that make it easier to implement open science, along with expert advice on topics such as open access and data management. We recommend expanding this catalogue even further.\nIs EPFL a pioneer in open science?\nI think EPFL is ahead of the curve, since it works hard to explore the most promising avenues and tries to be innovative in its support for open science on campus. Martin Vetterli is very outspoken about it. And to be fair, many EPFL researchers started working openly well before the OSSC was set up. The Swiss Data Science Center, for example, is a driving force in this area and a real asset. Its Renku platform may change how we track the research process, and it could significantly reduce the time required for careful documentation.", "summary": "As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, EPFL is highlighting his commitment for open and reproducible research through an exceptional Open Science Day, today.

{"id": 174, "text": "How much light do you receive over the course of a day? What type of light enters your eyes? Spectrace, a new piece of wearable tech, could soon provide the answers to these questions. In a groundbreaking move, researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Integrated Performance in Design (LIPID) have teamed up with teachers and students from Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD – Genève) to develop a light sensor concept. The device, which rests around the neck like a pair of headphones or can be attached to an item of clothing with a magnetic pin, is designed to be worn all day long – at work, during exercise and in social settings.\nThe project has just been awarded an InnoSuisse grant in the eHealth category. Earlier this year, the project received support through an Explorer Grant from the ENAC InnoSeed program at EPFL. This new funding will be used to develop a modular, working prototype and test it in real-world conditions by 2021, with the aim of founding a spin-off to bring the Spectrace sensor to the wider scientific community and the general public. \nCircadian rhythms\nSince the discovery of melanopsin 20 years ago, scientists have taken a growing interest in how a shortage of natural light and excessive exposure to artificial light from screens affect our bodies. Melanopsin, a blue-light-sensitive photopigment found in the human eye, helps keep the body’s internal clock on track and tells our brain whether it’s day or night. It is responsible for synchronizing all our circadian rhythms, and this has a significant impact on our health, from regulating our sleep and our hormone cycle – including the production of melatonin at night – to the ability of our immune system to function properly.\n“We urgently need to pay more attention to our ‘light hygiene’,” says Professor Marilyne Andersen, the director of LIPID and an expert in the field for some 15 years. “We spend so long indoors, which means we’re suffering from a chronic shortage of daylight, and staring at screens all the time, which has especially negative effects at night. We should in fact be getting plentiful light that is rich in blue wavelengths during the day, in order to accumulate a sufficient amount, as this will make us feel better, and limiting this exposure well before bedtime.”\nGap to fill\nVarious types of wearable light sensors exist on the market. Yet none of them can truly measure our exposure to the spectral range of light, i.e., as a function of the light’s wavelength (all the constituent “colors”). That’s what’s new about the prototype developed by EPFL. There is currently not enough data on the type of light to which we are actually exposed as a result of our daily activities and the environment in which we live and work. The physiological effects of light depend not only on its intensity and how long we’re exposed to it, but its spectrum as well. That’s the gap that the new Spectrace sensor is meant to fill.\n Forrest Webler, as part of his PhD research at LIPID, which is being jointly supervised by Prof. Andersen and Dr. Manuel Spitschan at the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology, is working on the concept of the “spectral diet” in order to develop a light exposure classification system.\nWebler’s first step was to source a miniature spectrometer designed for the food processing industry by South Korean startup nanoLambda. Teaming up with Giorgia Chinazzo, then a postdoctoral researcher at LIPID who was involved in this project from the start, he then brought in some EPFL electronics students to repurpose the spectrometer, turning it into a wearable device – with a built-in UV sensor and photometer – that offers a time resolution of less than a second. \nCollaboration with HEAD – Genève\nAt the same time, EPFL worked with Product and Media/interaction designers from HEAD – Genève at a workshop in July 2019, with close to ten students and alumni, that was led by Laure Krayenbuhl, the founder of Biel-based a-project studio.

{"id": 175, "text": "Why do some people cycle instead of taking the bus? Why do others drive rather than traveling by train? Two factors – price and journey time – have long determined how commuters choose to get to work. But much has changed in the past 25 years. According to an EPFL survey covering Greater Geneva, commuters are now more concerned about how they spend their travel time. The research provides detailed insights into the transport habits of the area’s workers, breaking down the findings according to people’s place of residence, age, educational attainment, and more.\nResearchers at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR), working under the direction of Professor Vincent Kaufmann, commissioned a telephone survey of a representative sample of the working-age population of Greater Geneva – a sprawling conurbation of 209 municipalities with a population of one million people, around 50% of whom live in Geneva Canton itself, 40% in the neighboring French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie, and 10% in the Nyon region (in Vaud Canton).\nDriving falling further out of favor\nThe 2018 survey, which followed similar exercises in 1994 and 2011, sampled around 2,100 people living within 500 meters of a public transport stop or 800 meters of a train station. The findings point to declining attitudes towards driving over time. In 1994, just 12% of respondents associated the car with negative adjectives such as “polluting” and “expensive”; in 2018, that number rose to 33%. Conversely, the image of public transportation is improving, albeit slowly: 50% of those surveyed in 2018 described it in positive terms (compared with 39% in 1994), while only 38% used negative descriptors (46% in 1994). Long journey times seem to be the main barrier to greater enthusiasm for public transportation, although the 15 December opening of the Léman Express – a commuter rail network with expected commercial speeds of around 50 km/h – should go some way to enhancing its image. Respondents were generally more effusive when asked about walking and cycling, although many urban commuters said that traveling by bike was dangerous.\nA promising future for cycling\nThe 2018 survey produced a wealth of insights for the researchers – not least the fact that Greater Geneva’s working-age population has embraced multimodal transport with open arms. Car, motorcycle and scooter owners are no longer wedded to their vehicles, with most reporting a willingness to use a different mode of transport instead. Indeed, the majority of commuters living across the border in France said they would be happy to leave their vehicle at home if viable alternatives were available.\nThe findings also highlighted the extent to which commuters – most of whom now have smartphones and other internet-enabled devices – are keen to make the most of their journey time. Other important considerations include convenience, efficiency and CO\n2\n emissions. According to the researchers, the priorities for transport planners are clear: pay special attention to transit hubs, make public transportation as convenient as possible, and introduce more attractive fare options for occasional users.\nThe latest survey was the first of its kind to include commuters living in France – and it underscored how a shortage of other options leaves them with little choice but to take the car. What’s more, relatively abundant parking in Geneva city center and the inner suburbs provides yet more incentive for people to drive to work. The researchers recommend a series of measures to address this problem, including stepping up parking enforcement and restricting parking on private land in areas with good public transportation links.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have carried out an in-depth survey of commuter practices in Greater Geneva – the area covering Geneva Canton, the Nyon region and neighboring parts of France.", "claim": "Researchers at EPFL have carried out an in-depth survey of commuter practices in Greater Geneva – the area covering Geneva Canton, the Nyon region and neighboring parts of France.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}

Biologists and microfluidics specialists at EPFL have joined forces and developed a highly innovative research tool: a 2cm by 2cm ‘chip’ with 32 independent compartments, each of which is designed to hold a nematode – a widely used worm in the research world. The device is described in the journal \nMolecular Neurodegeneration\n.\n“Unlike conventional cultures in petri dishes, this device lets us monitor individual worms rather than a population of them,” said Laurent Mouchiroud, from EPFL's Laboratory of Integrative Systems Physiology.\nFreeze frame\nEach of these ‘cells’ is fed by microfluidic channels. These allow variable concentrations of nutrients or therapeutic molecules to be injected with precision. The ambient temperature can also be adjusted.\nEach worm is observed through a microscope throughout its life. However, for more detailed investigations and very high resolution images, the worms need to be immobilized. “For this we use a temperature-sensitive solution,” said Matteo Cornaglia, from the Laboratory of Microsystems. “We inject it in liquid form at 15°C, then bring the temperature up to 25°C, which transforms it into a gel. The worm is immobilized in just a few minutes, then we bring the temperature back down and rinse out the solution – and the worm is able to move again.”\nProtein aggregates in the cross-hairs\nThis method is fully reversible and does not affect the nematode’s development. Using it, researchers can observe the formation of protein aggregates linked to several neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s. The same worm can be photographed several times, as the clusters develop. “This is totally new, and it will help us learn more not only about how these aggregates grow, but also about the tissue in which they form,” said Mouchiroud. “In addition, we have already been able to test and observe the effect of certain drugs on how the clusters form.”\nNematodes are very useful models for studying a number of human diseases. In many cases, they obviate the need to experiment on rodents. But until now, handling nematodes was a delicate affair. By simplifying the process, this new technology should accelerate research on numerous afflictions and how they are treated.", "summary": "An innovative tool allows researchers to observe protein aggregation throughout the life of a worm.

{"id": 177, "text": "An amputee was able to feel smoothness and roughness in real-time with an artificial fingertip that was surgically connected to nerves in his upper arm. Moreover, the nerves of non-amputees can also be stimulated to feel roughness, without the need of surgery, meaning that prosthetic touch for amputees can now be developed and safely tested on intact individuals.\nThe technology to deliver this sophisticated tactile information was developed by Silvestro Micera and his team at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and SSSA (Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna) together with Calogero Oddo and his team at SSSA. The results, , provide new and accelerated avenues for developing bionic prostheses, enhanced with sensory feedback.\n\"The stimulation felt almost like what I would feel with my hand,\" says amputee Dennis Aabo Sørensen about the artificial fingertip connected to his stump. He continues, \"I still feel my missing hand, it is always clenched in a fist. I felt the texture sensations at the tip of the index finger of my phantom hand.\"\nSørensen is the first person in the world to recognize texture using a bionic fingertip connected to electrodes that were surgically implanted above his stump.\nNerves in Sørensen's arm were wired to an artificial fingertip equipped with sensors. A machine controlled the movement of the fingertip over different pieces of plastic engraved with different patterns, smooth or rough. As the fingertip moved across the textured plastic, the sensors generated an electrical signal. This signal was translated into a series of electrical spikes, imitating the language of the nervous system, then delivered to the nerves.\nSørensen could distinguish between rough and smooth surfaces 96% of the time.\nIn a , Sorensen's implants were connected to a sensory-enhanced prosthetic hand that allowed him to recognize shape and softness. In this new publication about texture in the journal eLife, the bionic fingertip attains a superior level of touch resolution.\nSimulating touch in non-amputees\n This same experiment testing coarseness was performed on non-amputees, without the need of surgery. The tactile information was delivered through fine needles that were temporarily attached to the arm's median nerve through the skin. The non-amputees were able to distinguish roughness in textures 77% of the time.\nBut does this information about touch from the bionic fingertip really resemble the feeling of touch from a real finger? The scientists tested this by comparing brain-wave activity of the non-amputees, once with the artificial fingertip and then with their own finger. The brain scans collected by an EEG cap on the subject's head revealed that activated regions in the brain were analogous.\nThe research demonstrates that the needles relay the information about texture in much the same way as the implanted electrodes, giving scientists new protocols to accelerate for improving touch resolution in prosthetics.\n\"This study merges fundamental sciences and applied engineering: it provides additional evidence that research in neuroprosthetics can contribute to the neuroscience debate, specifically about the neuronal mechanisms of the human sense of touch,\" says Calogero Oddo of the BioRobotics Institute of SSSA. \"It will also be translated to other applications such as artificial touch in robotics for surgery, rescue, and manufacturing.”\nThe research was carried out by EPFL and SSSA in collaboration with Università di Pisa, IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Università Campus Biomedico.\nThis work was partly supported by EU Grants TIME, NEBIAS and NANOBIOTOUCH, by the Italian grants NEMESIS (funded by the Italian Ministry of Health), PRIN/HandBot (funded by the Italian Ministry of Research), and PPR2 (funded by the National Institute for Insurance against Industrial Injuries), by the ENABLE project funded by the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering, and by the Swiss National Competence Center in Research in Robotics.", "summary": "An amputee feels rough or smooth textures in real-time — in his phantom hand — using an artificial fingertip connected to nerves in the arm.

{"id": 178, "text": "“The status quo on the software market needs to change, explains Viktor Kuncak, Associate Professor at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences' . All too often, developers adopt a software patch strategy for products that are already being sold on the market!” And yet there are tools out there that can improve the reliability of software before products reach consumers. Moreover, these tools are already widely used for hardware development. “Once a microchip has been manufactured, it’s too late to fix an error.” In fact, the later an error is detected, the more expensive it becomes to fix it.” Greater software reliability can also bring benefits to many different areas such as aviation or medical equipment, making them more reliable. \nViktor Kuncak and post-doctoral researcher Andrew Reynolds are currently working to develop automatic software verification tools. Just like a mathematical demonstration seeks to prove that an affirmation may be true for a given set of values, software verification is aimed at ensuring that a function will not cause a crash or produce an outlier for the full range of possible user entries or actions.\nIf there is one tool that mathematicians regularly use, it is mathematical induction. This method consists of proving that a theorem holds true for a given natural number (n) and that what is true for n is also true for the natural number that follows (n+1). Once this has been done, one must also prove the validity of the theorem for the smallest natural number: 0. This form of demonstration was previously not possible with an SMT solver (satisfiability modulo theories), which is an essential component of automatic software verification. The two researchers have now managed to overcome this obstacle, developing an approach that allows one to automatically use mathematical induction in a constraint resolution process. The code input language to be verified is Scala, “we chose it because of its similarity with mathematical formulations and reasoning,” explains Viktor Kuncak.\nApart from the computerization of mathematical induction, this approach is also remarkable because it breaks down tasks. “Whenever a verification cannot be executed directly, our tool breaks the problem down into sub-problems that it may be able to resolve. When there is a known path, this path will be used. Otherwise, other paths will be explored and a new breakdown may be performed, thereby allowing a large number of potential problem-solving pathways to be explored, explains Viktor Kuncak.\nAlthough the EPFL researchers are more specifically interested in potential applications to software verification, advances in the area of automated mathematical proofs can also benefit other fields. “The primary focus of SMT solvers has been for problems faced by industry (including software verification). Only more recently have SMT solvers been used for solving more difficult problems, which would include solving open mathematical problems. So far, this has been somewhat limited, but is starting to become more common,” states Andrew Reynolds. “One project along these lines is the TPTP library of problems pursued by the University of Miami. The use of SMT solvers such as the one I work on (CVC4) has led to solving several previously unsolved problems in this library.”\nThe approaches that the EPFL researchers are focused on are interesting both in terms of success rates and speed of execution. What are the limits of this tool? “It’s a bit like having a brilliant student,” explains Viktor Kuncak, “We cannot ascertain the theoretical limits but empirically, we have observed that the tool has more difficulty handling certain formulas than others,” The research conducted with Andrew Reynolds at the EPFL began in 2014. “We have obtained good results in only a few months, notes Viktor Kuncak. The EPFL has a certain lead in this field and we hope to consolidate this position.”", "summary": "It is possible to test computer programs using tools borrowed from mathematicians and their famous demonstrations.

{"id": 179, "text": "Even though silicon is one of the most abundant elements, the energy required to make silicon from sand is immense. It is for this reason, but also to reduce manufacturing costs, that Professor Christophe Ballif and his team from the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory at the EPFL have been working for several years on thin-film silicon solar cells that are a thousand times thinner than conventional cells.\nThere’s just one catch: the thinner the cells, the less they absorb the rays of the sun and the less electricity they produce. So researchers are trying to trap light in the thin silicon layers to increase their absorption. Traditionally, thin layers of zinc oxide—a material that is very abundant, completely non-toxic, and that grows in the form of small pyramid-shaped crystals—are used for this purpose. These crystals scatter light efficiently into the underlying silicon layer. With such zinc oxide layers, even a new world record cell efficiency was achieved.\nReducing costs\nBut scientists are attempting to beat this record. “It is difficult to modify the natural pyramidal shape of these crystals in order to obtain even better light scattering,” explains researcher Corsin Battaglia, “so we had the idea to force the crystals to grow on a different support, an inverted mould with the desired structure.” The idea is as ingenious as it is simple. Once the thin layer of zinc oxide is deposited on the mould all that needs to be done is to “demould” it—as you would a tarte tatin, for example—to obtain a film with the desired structure.\nThis procedure, described in the September edition of the journal Nature Photonics, not only increases the amount of light that is trapped, thereby increasing output, but it also has the potential to reduce the cost of the cells because of its compatibility with mass production. These are interesting arguments at a time when photovoltaics is seeking to produce electricity at a lower price than the current grid price.", "summary": "Do better with less.

{"id": 180, "text": "For humans, it comes perfectly naturally. But walking on two legs is actually a complicated task, requiring several muscles to perform delicate balancing acts. That’s why, in spite of years of major technological advancements in the field, humanoid robots are still far from being able to get around easily and reliably. Engineers at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory are testing new walking algoritms on a plateform called COMAN, short for COmpliant HuMANoid. This 95-cm-tall humanoid is designed specifically for studying walking – which is why it has no head.\nCOMAN was developed under the EU AMARSi project and is being used by several research teams. The EPFL team is looking specifically at the “brains” of the machine. “We developed algorithms that can improve the robot’s balance while it’s walking,” says Hamed Razavi, a researcher scientist at the Biorobotics Lab.\nIn harmony with symmetries\nOne of COMAN’s distinguishing features is its joints, which are integrated with elastic elements that give it greater flexibility when performing different tasks. The EPFL team came up with a novel control algorithm for the robot, based on the existing symmetries in the structure and dynamics of the robot’ as well as the mathematical equations representing the robot dynamics. “You could say we’re working in harmony with these symmetries rather than against them. As a result, we obtain a more natural and robust walking gait,” says Razavi.\nThe control algorithm uses sophisticated computer programs to carefully analyze the date received from the robot – including its position, velocity, joint angles, etc. – and sends appropriate commands to the motors, telling them what to do in order to maintain the robot's balance. “For example, if someone pushes COMAN, for example, our algorithms will calculate exactly where its foot should land in order to counteract the perturbation,” says Razavi.\nClimbing stairs and opening doors\nThe algorithms are geared towards three types of realworld applications. The first is carrying out rescue missions in disastrous scenarios. “In environments designed by humans - like a nuclear power plant where there are stairs to climb and doors to open – humanoid robots can get around more easily than robots with wheels,” says Razavi. The second is helping with tasks like carrying heavy boxes or moving objects (see box). And the third is creating exoskeletons for the disabled.\n“Making the robots more stable is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Razavi. The next step is refining the algorithms so that the humanoids have a wider range of movement and can overcome obstacles and walk on irregular or sloped surfaces.\nHumanoids helping humans\nAs part of this project, Jessica Lanini and Hamed Razavi studied how two people carrying an object together are able to walk, turn and speed up in a coordinated manner – without communicating with each other. Their findings, recently published in , indicate that the two people automatically synchronize their steps, like a quadruped. Now the researchers plan to apply their results to humanoid robots.\n“Whether for manufacturing or natural disasters, we need robots that can interact with humans and help us carry heavy objects,” says Lanini. “But such robots don’t exist. That’s because, in order to operate safely and effectively, the robots would need to be able to make decisions and respond to unexpected circumstances.”\nThe researchers decided to observe humans, who do things better and more naturally than robots. They analyzed the way humans move and found that some factors like speed, force and hand position play a pivotal role in understanding “commands” like speeding up or stopping. The next step is modeling these observations in order to program the robots. “What is exactly that makes us realize to slow down or turn? The applied force? A combination of force and speed? The boundary is not yet clear,” says Razavi. \nClara Marc", "summary": "Walking on two legs isn’t as easy as it seems. For robots and their designers, it is an even bigger challenge!

Studies have shown that NAD+ concentrations decrease during aging and that recovering the body’s levels of NAD+ can prolong both health span and even life span, making it the focus of much research in nutritional science, medicine, and even pharmaceutics.\nIn terms of biology, NAD+ is what is known as a “co-enzyme” – a necessary molecule that helps an enzyme carry out its respective reaction in the cell. NAD+ is a common co-enzyme for multiple metabolic enzymes across all living cells, meaning that it is heavily involved in producing energy and keeping cells alive and healthy.\nPublishing in \nNature\n, scientists lead by  in collaboration with TES Pharma have found a new way of increasing NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme competing with its production.\nThe \nde novo\n synthesis of NAD+ in the cell begins with the amino acid tryptophan. One of the key enzymes involved in this process is ACMSD, which limits the amount of NAD+ produced by the \nde novo\n synthesis pathway.\nThe scientists were able to show that ACMSD controls the levels of NAD+ in the cell through a mechanism that doesn’t seem to have changed during evolution: case-in-point, the researchers found that, in both the earthworm \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n and mice, blocking the enzyme resulted in higher NAD+ levels and enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe inactivation of ACMSD also increased the activity of Sirtuin 1, an enzyme that NAD+ works with in its role as co-enzyme. Sirtuin 1 is known to play major roles in mitochondrial well-being, and as a result, the boost of NAD+ levels ultimately enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe team then used two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD, developed by . “Since the enzyme is mostly found in the kidney and liver, we wanted to test the capacity of the ACMSD inhibitors to protect these organs from injury,” explains Elena Katsyuba, first author of the paper.\nBoth inhibitors were shown to preserve kidney and liver function in animal models of acute kidney injury and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, offering much promise for their future therapeutic potential in humans. “The fact that ACMSD is exclusively present only in the liver and kidneys reduces the risk of negative repercussions of its loss on other organs,” says Katsyuba. “Put simply, the enzyme will not be missed by an organ that does not have it anyway.”\n“Given the beneficial health effects of boosting NAD+ levels that we have seen in worm and mouse models of disease, we are looking forward to bringing these compounds soon to the clinic to the benefit of patients suffering from liver and kidney diseases, two areas with a large unmet clinical need,” says Johan Auwerx.\nOther contributors\nTES Pharma\nUniversity of Lausanne\nPolytechnic University of Marche\nEPFL Histology Core Facility\nUniversity Hospital of Geneva\nPolish Academy of Sciences", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have found a new way to boost the famous anti-aging molecule NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme that limits its production.

This is entirely in line with the mission of EPFL’s School of life sciences, aiming to promote quantitative and analytical biological research and education. We are excited that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative appreciates our School’s efforts to encourage interdisciplinary, engineering-minded studies and we look forward to work with the our fellow collaborators across the globe.”\nPriscilla Chan MD, co-founder of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) said: “I am thrilled to welcome this distinguished group of grantees to the CZI family, and I am excited about how they will support the ambitious Human Cell Atlas effort. Working together and with our team of scientists and engineers, these partners will create new ways for scientists to use information about healthy and diseased cells. Their efforts will help to accelerate progress toward our goal of curing, preventing, or managing all diseases by the end of the century.”\n“We are excited to begin working on these promising projects with new partners from across the globe. These grantees include experts in experimental biology, engineering, and computational biology. Enabling them to collaborate and bring their diverse perspectives to the work is the core of our approach to advancing biomedical science,” added Cori Bargmann, Head of Science for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\nThe Human Cell Atlas is an international effort to map every type of cell in the healthy human body as a resource for studies of both health and disease. The HCA aims to revolutionize the understanding of human anatomy and cell biology and shall provide scientists with a fundamental source to better understand how healthy cells work, and what goes wrong when disease strikes.

Analyzing the transcriptome of single cells requires in-depth bioinformatics expertise, which makes the approach inaccessible to many research groups.\nTo address this limitation, Vincent Gardeux, a postdoc in the Deplancke lab together with Fabrice David of the Gene Expression Core Facility of EPFL developed an “automated single-cell analysis pipeline” (ASAP). This web-based platform allows scientists to analyze their own data and compare algorithms used in studying transcriptomes.

{"id": 186, "text": "They are a group of 30-odd architecture students from EPFL, ETH Zurich, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW, Basel) and Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany), and they are preparing to don hardhats and work boots. Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.\nThis Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”\nThe structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.\nBetween tradition and modernity\nYannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction. So while the base of the pavilion can be constructed with conventional rammed earth – erected and dried on the building’s foundations – the upper floor of the pavilion will be composed by earthen blocks that will be used as prefabricated components. This approach will help cut down the building time. The earth needed for the columns of the mock-up will be taken from local construction sites and tested by experts.\nThe two students continue to marvel at the wonders of rammed earth: “We think that the sensible thing to do is to use materials available to us, and that includes earth – which is 100% recyclable,” says Claessens. “In our project, the earth walls – and not the concrete – are load-bearing. We are turning normal building codes on their head.” Pretolani is equally enthusiastic: “We felt we had a free hand in terms of project design because there is so much potential in rammed earth, which is not a contemporary material in terms of its aesthetics and does not have well-developed building standards.”\nPilot project\nThe mock-up could also serve as a pilot project for a new technique – prestressed rammed earth – in which steel cables, linked together to meet seismic standards, will run through the building’s earthen columns from top to bottom. For that reason, the engineers backstopping the students will monitor the project once it’s completed, making up for the lack of building standards.\nMany architects steer clear of earth as a building material, since they feel it slows the speed of construction and leads to higher costs. The St. Gallen pavilion could upend such conventional thinking, according to Boltshauser, since it will only take a month to build: “By combining prefabricated earth blocks with other prefabricated concrete components, the pavilion is a glimpse at what could be the future of rammed-earth construction. It will also allow us to calculate the associated savings in terms of costs and gray energy.”\nTextiles and rammed earth go way back \nThe Sittertal valley was a manufacturing region, specializing in dyeing textiles, until the 19th century. The buildings, located between the Sitter river and a canal, have been maintained and renovated and are now dedicated to the visual arts and artisanal crafts. They play host to artist residences, a library, material archives and exhibitions. “Expertise in earth building spread from France to Switzerland through the linen trade, starting in the 17th century. Using the rammed-earth technique for a building on a site that was once devoted to textiles is our way of acknowledging that history,” adds Boltshauser.\nOne week after the construction work begins, an exhibition describing the history of this building technique, called “Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” will open. This exhibition was first shown at EPFL’s Archizoom space in the spring of 2017. In St. Gallen, it will be set up in the Sitterwerk library, just opposite the students’ pavilion project.\n“Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” Sittertal, from 21 August to 15 October 2017.

These visits are becoming more popular every year: 2050 have registered for this year’s event, 400 more than in 2010, and 600 more than in 2009. “The growing reputation of EPFL certainly accounts for the high attendance”, comments Maya Fruehauf, who is responsible for promoting undergraduate courses. The large majority of the sixth formers come from French-speaking Switzerland (a special day is organized in January for those from the German-speaking area and Ticino), but over 450 are travelling from France. “Our visits to certain high schools and a stand at the “Salon de l’Etudiant” student fair in Paris, as well as word-of-mouth, have all worked well”, she points out.

{"id": 189, "text": "Around 100,000 earthquakes are recorded worldwide every year, but not all are naturally occurring. Some of the weaker ones are triggered by human activity underground – this is referred to as induced seismicity. Researchers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Experimental Rock Mechanics (LEMR) and the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris have just completed a study into the role of fluids in the propagation of induced earthquakes in an effort to decipher the underlying mechanisms. Their findings include the extremely counterintuitive discovery that highly pressurized water in the vicinity of an earthquake tends to limit – rather than increase – its intensity. These results were published today in \nNature Communications\n.\nInduced earthquakes can be the result of activities like mining, gas and oil extraction, toxic waste or CO\n2\n storage, and the construction of tunnels and dam reservoirs. The generation of geothermal energy is another potential source of induced earthquakes – and the main one in Switzerland. According to the Swiss Seismological Service, a geothermal project near Basel caused a 3.4 magnitude earthquake in 2006, and \nGeothermal energy is captured by tapping into subterranean heat. Highly pressurized water is pumped into the earth’s crust at a depth of between two and four kilometers. The water is then recovered as steam and used to drive an electricity-producing turbine. “Injecting water can affect water-rock equilibria and disrupt nearby faults, thus triggering earthquakes in the area,” says Marie Violay, who runs LEMR.\nThis type of earthquake is a thorn in the side of geothermal proponents, notes Mateo Acosta, a PhD student at LEMR and the study’s lead author: “These earthquakes may be low in intensity, but they can cause damage and affect public opinion – to the point of derailing projects.”\nHeat absorption\nAcosta ran tests in which he sought to replicate earthquake conditions in order to study the impact of different levels of underground water pressure on fault dynamics. He focused mainly on earthquake propagation, which is when the two plates in a fault rub against each other, sending seismic waves out into the surrounding area.\n“Rock friction generates a significant amount of heat, which further fuels the propagation effect,” says the PhD student. “Some of this heat is absorbed by the water in the surrounding rock, and the amount absorbed depends to a large extent on the water’s thermodynamic parameters. What we learned from our experiments is that the closer the fluid’s initial pressure is to the critical pressure of water, the weaker the earthquake will be.”\n“This research shows that the initial fluid pressure in the rocks is crucial, especially at depths commonly reached by geothermal activities. Geothermal models need to take this into account,” says François-Xavier Passelègue, an LEMR researcher and the study’s second author.\nThe laboratory recently acquired sophisticated equipment that can be used to simulate pressure and temperature levels at a depth of 10 to 15 kilometers in the earth’s crust.

Other areas of medicine such as plastic surgery, wound healing, diabetes, rheumatology and neurosurgery could also benefit from this innovative device.\n The EasyLDI device, invented in EPFL’s Biomedical Optics Laboratory (LOB), is extremely simple to use.

{"id": 192, "text": "Like far away galaxies, powerful tools are required to bring the minute inner workings of neurons into focus. A team of neurobiologists, psychiatrists, and advanced imaging specialists from Switzerland’s EPLF and CHUV report in The Journal of Neuroscience how Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) can now be used to observe neuronal activity in real-time and in three dimensions—with up to 50 times greater resolution than ever before. The application, borrowed from materials science, has immense potential for testing out new drugs to fight neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It has already been commercialized by the EPFL start-up LynceeTec.\nNeurons come in various shapes and are transparent. To observe them in a Petri dish, scientists use florescent dyes that change the chemical composition and can skew results. Additionally, this technique is time consuming, often damages the cells, and only allows researchers to examine a few neurons at a time. But these newly published results show how DHM can bypass the limitations of existing techniques.\n“DHM is a fundamentally novel application for studying neurons with a slew of advantages over traditional microscopes,” explains Pierre Magistretti of EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute and a lead author of the paper. “It is non-invasive, allowing for extended observation of neural processes without the need for electrodes or dyes that damage cells.”\nSenior team member Pierre Marquet adds, “DHM gives precious information not only about the shape of neurons, but also about their dynamics and activity, and the technique creates 3D navigable images and increases the precision from 500 nanometers in traditional microscopes to a scale of 10 nanometers.”\nA good way to understand how DHM works is to imagine a large rock in an ocean of perfectly regular waves. As the waves deform around the rock and come around the other side, they carry information about the rock’s form. This information can be extracted by comparing it to waves that did not smash up against the rock, and an image of the rock can be reconstructed. DHM does this with a laser beam by pointing a single wavelength at an object, collecting the distorted wave on the other side, and comparing it to a reference beam. A computer then numerically reconstructs a 3D image of the object—in this case neurons—using an algorithm developed by the authors. In addition, the laser beam travels through the transparent cells and important information about their internal composition is obtained.\nNormally applied to detect minute defects in materials, Magistretti, along with DHM pioneer and EPFL professor in the Advanced Photonics Laboratory, Christian Depeursinge, decided to use DHM for neurobiological applications. In the study, their group provoked an electric charge in a culture of neurons using glutamate, the main neurotransmitter in the brain. This charge transfer carries water inside the neurons and changes their optical properties in a way that can be detected only by DHM. Thus, the technique accurately visualizes the electrical activities of hundreds of neurons simultaneously, in real-time, without damaging them with electrodes, which can only record activity from a few neurons at a time.\nA major advance for pharmaceutical research \nWithout the need to introduce dyes or electrodes, DHM can be applied to High Content Screening—the screening of thousands of new pharmacological molecules. This advance has important ramifications for the discovery of new drugs that combat or prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, since new molecules can be tested more quickly and in greater numbers.\n“Due to the technique’s precision, speed, and lack of invasiveness, it is possible to track minute changes in neuron properties in relation to an applied test drug and allow for a better understanding of what is happening,” Magistretti says. “What normally would take 12 hours in the lab can now be done in 15 to 30 minutes, greatly decreasing the time it takes for researchers to know if a drug is effective or not.”\nCitation\n: The Journal of Neuroscience, August 17, 2011 • 31(33):11846 –11854\nTitle\n: Determination of Transmembrane Water Fluxes in Neurons Elicited by Glutamate Ionotropic Receptors and by the Cotransporters KCC2 and NKCC1: A Digital Holographic Microscopy Study.\nAuthors\n: Pascal Jourdain, Nicolas Pavillon, Corinne Moratal, Daniel Boss, Benjamin Rappaz, Christian Depeursinge, Pierre Marquet, and Pierre J.

Switzerland Innovation is designed to give Swiss and foreign companies with significant research activities the opportunity to be present in one of five innovation hubs across the country: Park Basel Area, Park innovaare, Park Zurich, Park Biel/Bienne and Park Network West EPFL. Switzerland Innovation Park Network West EPFL is unique in that it is made up of six sites from five cantons: Campus Biotech (Geneva), Bluefactory (Fribourg), Microcity (Neu-châtel), EPFL Innovation Park (Vaud), Biopôle (Vaud) and Energypolis (Valais).\n To maintain its place at the forefront of global innovation, Switzerland must be proactive and take initiatives. This was the message conveyed by Swiss President Johann N. Schneider-Ammann in his introductory remarks: “We want to position Switzerland among the best of the best in terms of research and innovation. That’s how we will maintain our global competitive-ness, our economic prosperity and our strong jobs market.” Hence the need for spaces in which Switzerland's specialized schools and universities can work closely with companies and together create an innovation-friendly environment. Switzerland Innovation now provides these spaces to Swiss and foreign companies through five high-tech sites that are close to the specialized schools and designed to support their ambitions.\n“Five cantons in French-speaking Switzerland have joined forces around EPFL, which is a driving force in the area of innovation. The six sites that together form Switzerland Innovation Park Net-work West EPFL all have links to EPFL-related entities, which means they will operate side by side with academia and the labs. The goal is to replicate the success of EPFL Innovation Park and promote the transfer of innovation into tomorrow’s leading products,” said Adrienne Corboud Fumagalli, Vice-President for Innovation and Technology Transfer (VPIV), the EPFL office that oversees Swiss Innovation Park Network West EPFL.\nThe six entities in the western Swiss hub cover a wide range of innovation-related fields: com-puter science, extreme environments, life science, advanced manufacturing, smart building and energy management.", "summary": "With today’s launch of the nationwide initiative called Switzerland Innovation, Switzerland affirms its position as a global leader in innovation.

{"id": 197, "text": "Roberto Gargiani, professor at EPFL’s Theory and History of Architecture Laboratory 3, has spent the last six years carefully studying Le Corbusier’s lesser-known archives and visiting the buildings he designed from 1940 to his death in 1965 with his research assistant and co-author Anna Rosellini. A different Corbusier comes into focus; poet, mystic, philosopher and artist.\nYou recently published a book about Le Corbusier’s work and life after World War II. Why research this period specifically?\nFor Le Corbusier, the Second World War and its horrors made him completely rethink the notion of the civilisation machiniste that had been central to his buildings constructed in the 20s and 30s. Le Corbusier saw the war as the machine being turned against civilization itself. What better place to start than when he began to redefine himself? We let him lead us away from his antecedent vision of architecture that has tended to defined how we look at him until this very day.\nLe Corbusier is the architect with probably the most books already written about him. What are you trying to accomplish with your current research?\nHow would characterize this new vision?\nIf we look specifically at the period after World War II until his death in 1965, we see an artist who was constantly searching for new ideas, ready to transform his notion of architecture and subsequently of all modern architecture. When going through these archives, I discovered an architect who was at the same time a poet, a philosopher and a visionary. He is, still today, at the avant guard of architecture.\nFor example, his research on what is now called “climate adapted architecture,” has only been cursorily explored. Le Corbusier was already designing buildings adapted to local climatic elements in the 40’s and 50’s using a technique he called the “climate grid,” or grille climatique. Sunlight played an essential role in how he conceived architecture, and he was already thinking about how to draw as much light into the living spaces without raising the temperature.\nYour research focuses greatly on the notion of Béton Brut, could we finish this interview with a word about that?\nDo not forget that Le Corbusier was an artist and an artisan. He saw beauty in the spontaneous creation of concrete being struck from the formworks and wanted these marks and even mistakes to be part of the esthetic qualities of the building. He wanted his concrete to be left raw, not polished nor glossed over. His vision of what brut signified also transformed over his life’s work, from a maniacal control over each element to embracing hazard as a positive force, perhaps as a direct result of time spent in India.\nIt seems that Le Corbusier was receptive to many cultural influences...\nHe took inspiration from his travels to India and his readings of the Surrealists while never forgetting his origins as a decorator from La-Chaux-de-Fonds. From these influences he infused his buildings with tapestries of his own design, sculptures embedded directly into the concrete taken from his own drawings, as well as color schemes that were meant to evoke emotional reactions. Modern architecture is still being defined by his vision and we hope this research will bring new perspectives to his vast influence.\n“Le Corbusier Béton Brut and Ineffable Space 1940-1965: Surface Materials and Psychophysiology of Vision” by Roberto Gargiani and Anna Rosellini.", "summary": "Roberto Gargiani unveils a different vision of Switzerland's most famous architect - Le Corbusier.

{"id": 198, "text": "Do bacteria control their “walks” like we do? It might sound strange, but it’s a fundamental question. Understanding bacteria motility would not only expand our understanding of their behavior, but would also help us fight certain aggressive pathogens. However, the question has gone unanswered because microbiologists have lacked the tools to visualize bacterial filaments directly.\nUntil now, that is. Lorenzo Talà, a PhD student in the  at EPFL’s Institutes of Bioengineering and Global Health has developed a microscopy method that can directly observe the structures many bacteria use to crawl.\n“Bacterial surfaces are decorated with protein filaments involved in motility, adhesion, signaling and pathogenicity, which ultimately rule how bacteria interact with their environments,” says Talà. “However, they are so small that observing them in live cells is extremely complex. So we are left with little knowledge of their dynamic activities.”\nThis is especially true for structures known as “type IV pili”: nanometer-wide filaments that extend and retract from the surface of many bacteria, helping them walk in a way known as . The term might not sound very serious, but it mechanically activates virulence in certain pathogens – meaning that it is a prime target for fighting them.\nAnatomy of a bacterium, with pili covering its surface (credit: jack0m/iStockphoto)\nThe scientists studied the bacterium \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n, an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in soil. It is one of the most medically concerning bacteria: a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and of serious infections in cystic fibrosis, traumatic burns, and immunocompromised patients, it is now ranked #1 in the World Health Organization’s antibiotic resistant watch-list.\nBut do single bacteria orchestrate type IV pili motion to power their motility? “In our studies of type IV pili and mechano-activation of virulence in \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n, one technical paradox has been a source of frustration: pili, but also fimbriae, flagella, and injection systems permanently extend outside single cells, so why can’t we directly visualize them?” asks Talà.\nTo overcome this, the scientists explored an emerging microscopy method pioneered by their collaborator Philipp Kukura at Oxford University. Using a technique called interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), they were able to see these nanometers-wide filaments in live cells, without any chemical labels, at high speed, and in three dimensions.\n“iSCAT represents a major technological advance in microbiology,” says Persat. “We  the visualization technique and received extensive positive feedback among scientists across a variety of disciplines simply because we could finally dynamically observe pili in live bacteria straight out of culture.”\nTo understand the coordination of type IV pili movements, the scientists focused on precisely timing the succession of surface attachment, retraction, and cell body displacements using iSCAT. The approach revealed three key events that lead to successful and energetically efficient movement across surfaces.\nFirst, contact of the pilus tip with the surface activates a molecular motor that initiates retraction. Second, this retraction enhances the attachment of the pilus to the surface, increasing the bacterium’s displacement. Finally, a second, stronger molecular motor enforces the bacterium’s displacement under high friction.\nThis sequence shows that pili act as sensors, and reveals a new mechanism by which bacteria interact with surfaces. It also reveals that bacteria use sensory mechanisms to coordinate the dynamic motion of their motility machineries, in a striking analogy to the way higher organisms, including humans, move their limbs to generate displacement.\n“The human central nervous system processes mechanosensory signals to sequentially engage motor components, thus triggering muscle contraction and resulting in gait,” explains Talà. “Our work shows that in the same manner, bacteria use a sense of touch to sequentially engage molecular motors, generating cycles of pili extension and retraction that result in a walk pattern.”\nOther contributors\nUniversity of Oxford", "summary": "EPFL biophysicists have been able to directly study the way bacteria move on surfaces, revealing a molecular machinery reminiscent of motor reflexes.", "claim": "EPFL biophysicists have been able to directly study the way bacteria move on surfaces, revealing a molecular machinery reminiscent of motor reflexes.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 199, "text": "Grouped together under the unassuming name φ92, a family of bacteriophage viruses has perfected its specialty: they attack salmonella and coliform bacteria. The centerpiece of their arsenal is a needle-like tip that pierces its victim’s membrane. EPFL scientists have measured this miniscule weapon; at a single nanometer, it’s roughly 20 times the diameter of a helium atom. This discovery, published in \nStructure\n, a \nCell Press\n journal, will allow researchers to better understand the attack strategy used by bacteriophages, which are being intensively studied for their therapeutic potential.\n φ92’s armor-piercing weapon is made up of three chains of identical proteins. These three long intertwined molecules form an appendage sharp enough to penetrate the bacterial membrane. This molecular needle, discovered recently in EPFL’s Laboratory of Structural Biology and Biophysics, led by Petr Leiman, appears to be characteristic of all species belonging to the φ92 family of bacteriophage viruses.\n The body of a phage is made up of two main parts. The first, a hollow head called a “capsid,” contains the genetic material. The second consists of a tube, a group of appendages resembling feet, and a device designed to penetrate the membrane of its host – the needle-like tip is at the furthest extremity of the virus.\n Phages recognize sugars and proteins on the surface of their preferred host bacteria. The virus then attaches its feet to the victim, and a complex process is set in motion. A chain of proteins uncoils, pushing the injection tube and its tip through the victim’s membrane like a hypodermic needle. The tip then detaches from the tube and, like an uncorked bottle of champagne, the pressurized genetic material in the capsid is injected into the bacterium. The phage then begins to reproduce inside its victim. \n By determining the exact structure of the tip, the EPFL scientists have filled in all the missing details in our understanding of φ92’s lethal weapon. To reach this level of detail – at most a dozen or so atoms at the extremity of the tip – they used x-ray crystallography techniques, which are of high enough resolution to determine the shape of individual molecules.\n “We managed to determine not only the size, but the complete structure of the tip as well,” explains EPFL postdoctoral researcher Christopher Browning, who is first author on the article. In addition, the researchers discovered an iron atom in the appendage. “We still are not sure what it’s used for, but to the extent that this element is toxic, we have very good reason to think that it’s not there by accident.”\n This research has implications far beyond simple biological curiosity. Bacteriophages are considered promising weapons in the fight against infectious bacteria, to complement or replace traditional antibiotics. The scientists believe the shape of the needle-like tip determines in part the bacterial species that can be attacked by a phage. \n Among the avenues being explored are incomplete bacteriophages called “pyocins,” which are naturally produced by some infected bacteria. Pyocins consist of just the injection apparatus of the virus, a kind of mechanical component, but of biological origin. They’re of interest to scientists precisely because they don’t have a capsid, and thus don’t carry genetic material, explains Browning. “These things can penetrate the bacterial membrane, which can kill the bacterium, but without injecting genetic material. That sidesteps the possibility that the phage could mutate and then attack “good” bacteria. This option is being extensively studied at the moment, but we need to understand the potential of each phage with respect to the various bacteria. The form of the tip is one of those parameters.”\n--\nThe video is created by Seyet LLC (http://www.seyet.com), Petr Leiman (EPFL) and Michael Rossmann (Purdue University) and funded by NSF (http://www.nsf.gov).\nPublication: \nChristopher Browning, Mikhail M.

{"id": 200, "text": "Concrete has been around since the 19\nth\n century. Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

{"id": 202, "text": "Mapping a construction site, landscape, cityscape or mine, monitoring industrial sites, managing agricultural land… The drone developed by senseFly, the result of 6 years of research in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL, facilitates the work of experts across various fields. Equipped with an autopilot and a miniature high-definition camera, it is used by hundreds of professionals worldwide. This start-up installed at the gates of EPFL hopes to increase its sales tenfold in the next years and create dozens of new jobs in the field of airborne drones. It does so thanks to an investment of 5 million Swiss Francs from the publicly traded French company Parrot, making them a majority shareholder in senseFly.\nsenseFly drones demonstrate the full extent of their capabilities when combined with software developed by Pix4D, a spin-off of EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB). The algorithms developed by Pix4D make it possible to assemble hundreds of aerial pictures and, within minutes, to get an extremely accurate 3D and geo-referenced image of the observed terrain. This young company based at EPFL’s Science Park is also of interest to Parrot, which invested 2.4 million Swiss Francs for a minority share in Pix4D. “In the 1980’s the algorithms were really unreliable, and I was convinced it would take well over thirty years to become the basis of fully-automated, reliable and useful commercial products. This is a wonderful example of how curiosity-driven research, for example the ability of a human to make sense of the world around him through what he sees, eventually led to useful results,” said Pascal Fua, director of the CVLAB.\nLike an Insect\nUsing one of senseFly’s small high-performance drones is a breeze. The course can be programmed with software pre-flight and still be modified throughout the flight’s duration. No runway necessary: three movements back-and-forth are enough to start the engine, and the 500-gram wing takes off. The drone reaches a cruising speed of 40 km/h to autonomously map areas ranging from a few hectares to several square kilometers in one flight, with a resolution ranging from 3 to 30 cm/pixel depending on the distance above ground. Within a maximum of thirty minutes, the drone returns to its starting point without further assistance. All that is necessary for the next mission is to change the battery.\nThe technology on which these devices are based was created in 2001, when a team of robotics researchers in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) at EPFL began to investigate the strategies of control and navigation in flying insects. Early research led to the development of an integrated autopilot using intelligent control strategies similar to that of flies and bees. “By 2008 it was included in an ultra-light flying wing, which incorporated all the advantages of insects: efficient, elegant, light, elemental and intelligent,” recalls Jean-Christophe Zufferey, founder and CEO of senseFly. “I am very pleased that our robotic flying insect has not only helped to elucidate biological issues, but has also been able to promote the socio-economic development of our region by creating dozens of new high-value jobs. In collaboration with the newly created National Competence Center in Robotics, senseFly contributes to making EPFL and the surrounding region an important center for artificial intelligence and robotics,” says Dario Floreano, director of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and of the National Competence Center in Robotics.\nWhile the legislation for the usage of drones is being discussed in most countries, the low mass and speed of these ultra-light drones gives them a unique advantage by limiting the potential damage they could cause and thereby favored for civilian use.\nEPFL’s Pole of Expertise in Civilian Drones\nParrot, a global leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones, has recently invested in drones for the consumer market. It has released a Wi-Fi controllable quadricopter, of which it has sold more than 300,000 since its launch in 2010. The collaboration with the French group will create synergies for both EPFL start-ups.\nThe increasing need of data for Geographical Information Systems (GIS), such as Google Earth & Street View, should drive the market of ultra-light professional civilian drones to one billion dollars by 2020. The combination of senseFly trouble-free hardware, Pix4D’s unique mapping software and Parrot high volume manufacturing expertise provide the key elements to address this fast emerging market.

{"id": 203, "text": "For those patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, we can literally speak in terms of “light at the end of the tunnel”. Second Sight Medical Products, whose European base is located in EPFL's Science Park, has developed a prosthetic retina which enables them to regain the ability to identify their surroundings. The company has just received EC certification, which will allow it to commercialize the invention in Europe.\nThis degenerative disease causes patients to progressively lose their sight. They generally lose night vision between 10 and 20 years of age, then peripheral vision between 20 and 30 years of age, finally becoming completely blind at around age 40. The disease affects around one person in 4000, and is the most frequent cause of blindness in middle-aged people in developed countries. Its origin is in a genetic mutation of the rods and cones – the two photo-receptive cells of the retina.\nThe role of the implant offered by Second Sight is to bypass the damaged cells. A small camera fixed on a pair of spectacles records an image, which is then converted into electrical impulses and transmitted to a receiver located at the back of the eye. Implanted on the retina, it sends these impulses to the neurons, and the impulses are then interpreted by the brain to re-construct an image.\n“The kind of sight that our product gives the patient is not like that we have naturally, and can’t replace it”, explains Grégoire Cosendai, Director of Second Sight’s European office. The device brings mainly an additional level of comfort in their daily life; for example in moving around or cooking.”\nToday, the prosthetic retina has already been implanted in 30 patients as part of the clinical trials. All of them have regained the ability to discern day from night. Twenty-nine of them can manage to find an object in a room, and 57% can detect movement around them. Eighty per cent can distinguish text on a computer screen, although some people need more time than others to achieve this. Finally, seven patients noticed a clear improvement in their visual acuity, and manage to read, for example, newspaper headlines. “The results depend on the positioning of the implant on the retina, but also on the way that the latter reorganizes itself afterwards, and this differs from one person to another”, adds Grégoire Cosendai.\nSecond Sight is now working on the second stage of the project: to improve the system in cooperation with three research teams at EPFL. These are the Laboratory of Biomechanical Orthopedics, the Laboratory of Microsystems, and the Laboratory of Applied Mechanics and Reliability Analysis. The objective is to develop a system that will enable the conversion of the camera image into electrical impulses that the brain can recognize. This will then help in understanding the differences in the results obtained in the patients, and to then adapt the device to the specific needs of each person.", "summary": "A new prosthetic retina enables those patients blinded by the disease \"retinitis pigmentosa\" to regain some form of vision.

{"id": 204, "text": "Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers that affect white blood cells of the immune system called B-lymphocytes or B cells. Like cells in all cancers, the B cells begin to grow out of control, creating tumors in the lymph nodes, spleen or other tissues. In 2010 alone, it was estimated that non-Hodgkin lymphomas caused 210,000 deaths worldwide.\nOne of the driving forces behind non-Hodgkin lymphomas is the over-activation of a receptor on the surface of B cells. This receptor normally stimulates the growth of B-cells only when it is needed, but in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the growth signal is constantly on, making B-cells grow uncontrollably.\nTo block this signal, recent clinical studies have focused on inhibiting the activation of the B-cell receptor as a treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, but with variable success. For example, a drug called ibrutinib has been tested in clinical trials to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Ibrutinib blocks the enzyme BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase), which is involved in maturing and activating B cells as part of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway. Unfortunately, the response to ibrutinib has been limited only to a subgroup of DLBCL patients.\nThe  has now carried out a study to identify mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib. Using tumor cells from DLBCL patients, the scientists discovered that the inactivation of BTK in resistant tumors triggers the over-activation of alternative signals that promote tumor cell survival and proliferation.\nTo prevent this mechanism of resistance and block the B-cell receptor signaling at its root, Elena Battistello, the PhD student who led this project, targeted the three enzymes (LYN, FYN, and BLK) that initiate the propagation of the signals.\nRepresentation of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway (right).

In the same way, the noise of jet engines could be deflected towards the sky rather than the ground, and certain types of vehicle could be rendered undetectable by sonar.\nScientists at EPFL’s Laboratory for Electromagnetism and Acoustics have succeeded in creating a device that implements the principle of negative refraction in the domain of acoustics. This was achieved by applying recent findings from the domain of electromagnetism, and the results could mean that one day objects are no longer an obstacle to sound.\n“Even though it’s only at the experimental stage, the study of this phenomenon has become a burning topic in acoustics over the last three or four years”, describes Hervé Lissek, scientist and co-author of an article recently published in the journal Physical Review B*.\nAlready well understood in the area of optics, the phenomenon of refraction is illustrated by the deflection of a light beam when it encounters an alteration in the propagation medium. This explains why a straw, when dipped into a glass of water, appears to be broken at the point where it enters the liquid – the trajectory of the light is deflected when it passes from one medium (air) to another (water). Refraction is also responsible for mirages and rainbows. \nTo “flow” around an object\nNegative refraction is not found in nature. It can be produced by using artificial structures called “metamaterials”, which have the property of further bending – or inverting the path of – light rays, resulting in their potential to “flow” around an object, at least theoretically. Some scientists believe that this phenomenon could one day be used to make objects invisible or transparent, a bit like Harry Potter’s cape!\nFor the first time, EPFL scientists have succeeded in demonstrating the possibility of obtaining negative refraction in the domain of acoustics using a discrete device; this work was based on a recent PhD thesis in the domain of electromagnetism**. Sound is defined by two essential properties of a fluid (a material medium) in which it travels: its mass, put in movement by an acoustic disturbance, the acceleration of which is normally directed according to the forces of acoustic pressure (inertial force); and its compressibility, which allows it naturally to oppose such forces (restoring force).\nUsing the device they conceived, the EPFL scientists obtained, simultaneously, negative values for these two parameters; that is to say, to further compress the particle of fluid subjected to excessive acoustic pressure, and to determine that its acceleration oppose the forces of pressure. This combination is a prerequisite in obtaining negative refraction, a property that has been initially observed in a digital model of acoustic metamaterial. Similar results have also been observed in a second phase, using an experimental prototype which enabled the validation of the theoretical concept.\nEven though we are still a long way from a genuine acoustic “invisibility cape”, these results demonstrate the performance of a tangible physical system representing negative refraction, while constituting an important achievement for research in this area.\n*“Acoustic transmission line metamaterial with negative/zero/positive refractive index”, published in Physical Review B – Frédéric Bongard, Hervé Lissek and Juan R.

{"id": 207, "text": "Rising temperatures, increasingly intense rainfall and extended periods of drought are some of the known effects of climate change. But how are trees reacting to them? To find out, a team of researchers from EPFL and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) studied two of the most common plant species found in Switzerland and the rest of Europe: beech and spruce trees. The study,* which was recently published in \nGlobal Change Biology\n, revealed that each species reacts differently, with the amount of moisture in the air playing a greater role than was previously thought.\n\"To find out what forests may look like in the future, we have to understand how each plant species will respond to climate change,\" explains Constant Signarbieux, the scientist in charge of the study, which was carried out at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS).\nThe researchers observed five-to-seven-year-old saplings of the two species for four years, from 2012 to 2015. The saplings were collected at the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura mountains during the colder months, and then replanted in three locations at different altitudes: in the small village of St-Georges (at 1,010 meters), in the Vallon Arboretum in Aubonne (at 570 meters), and in the grounds of the EPFL-run Fondation des Bois Chamblard on the shores of Lake Geneva (395 meters). A fourth group of saplings was kept at its original altitude of 1,350 meters and used as a control group.\nYoung trees at the Aubonne's site, and one reference tree at Marchairuz. (c)ECOS\n\"Transplanting these young trees at lower altitudes meant we could simulate the impact of an average temperature increase of between 1 and 6\n°\nC, in keeping with what is forecast to occur between now and 2100 based on a number of climate-change scenarios,” explains Signarbieux.\nTo beech or not to beech? \nBy regularly measuring each tree's trunk and four main branches, the researchers were able to estimate the trees’ biomass. They noticed that the rise in temperature prolonged the growing season – the period from when the first new leaves or needles appear in the spring until they turn yellow in the autumn – in a similar way for each species. However, the two species demonstrated very different biomass growth. The beech trees did well from the rising temperatures, flourishing quickly and becoming more easily acclimatized to the warmer temperatures than the spruce trees. \"Spruces are a more conservative species and perhaps adapt more slowly,\" says the researcher. \"This could have an immediate impact on our forests, as beech trees are more likely to be predominant going forward.\"\nThe researchers didn't stop there. They wanted to learn more about why the two species grew at different rates – and the reason came as quite a surprise. Their analyses revealed that it had nothing to do with either photosynthesis or the amount of water in the ground. Instead, it was all down to the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) – the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can potentially hold at a given temperature. This gives an indication of how dry the air is and how much pressure the plant's water system is under as a result.\nIt’s all about suction\nA plant's leaves contain microscopic pores, called stomata, which regulate how gases move between the leaves and the atmosphere. \"Plants use these stomata to absorb CO\n2\n from the air through diffusion,\" explains Signarbieux. \"When the pores open to let the gas in, water escapes from the leaves at the same time. This process is known as transpiration and occurs because there is always more moisture in the plant than in the air. It is what creates the suction that pulls water and sap from the soil through the roots, up the stalk and into the leaves.\"\nThe drier the air, the higher the VPD and the greater the suction effect will be. When there are several consecutive days with a high VPD – an ever more regular occurrence due to climate change – plants are put under increasing strain. But different plants react in different ways, as shown by the two species studied. Even before there is no water left in the ground, spruce trees close their stomata to prevent any more hydric stress. Beech trees, however, are more tolerant of this type of stress and wait longer before closing their stomata, which enables them to continue absorbing CO\n2\n and therefore keep growing. This gives them a competitive advantage over the spruces.\nIn the past, average seasonal or annual temperatures and rainfall were used to analyze plants' responses to their environment. But those factors alone don’t explain why the beech and spruce trees grow at such different rates. What makes this study truly original and groundbreaking is that the researchers took account of another variable that is often overlooked: the number of hours during which the VPD was above a certain critical level, indicating that the plant was experiencing exceptionally dry conditions. The biologists now intend to expand their research to other species, in the hope of creating a graphic representation of what Europe’s forests will look like in the future – and to help ensure that they are managed and used sustainably.\n*\nConducted as part of the doctoral thesis by Paula Sanginés, a researcher in the ECOS lab.", "summary": "How do trees adjust to the effects of global warming?

{"id": 208, "text": "Switzerland is one of the countries in Europe that relies the most on geothermal energy for residential heating. A study conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy in 2019 found that the country has  (GSHPs) – the “highest concentration per square kilometer in the world.” Many of these pumps are installed in residential yards at depths of up to 400 meters and use a vertical closed-loop system to circulate heat up to the surface.\nThe advantage of GSHPs is that they have little impact on the environment. They can heat homes and buildings all year long since geothermal energy is a stable heat source. And they offer a promising alternative for decarbonizing the heating sector. In Switzerland, buildings’ heating and cooling systems account for a third of total energy demand, and 75% of the country’s energy comes from fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. \nOperation of a vertical ground-source heat pump. © ADEME\nA finite energy source\nIn 2017, Doris Leuthard, then-president of the Swiss Confederation, called geothermal energy an “incredible energy source” but warned that it’s not infinite; it needs to be extracted according to specific rules. For instance, the borehole heat exchangers used in GSHPs should be installed a certain distance apart to prevent thermal interference – the heat-exchanger equivalent of a short circuit – and prevent the ground from cooling. “The heat-transfer fluid absorbs the heat that’s in the ground,” says Alina Walch, a PhD student at EPFL’s . “If too many of these exchangers are packed into a tiny space, the ground will cool off, which is something we absolutely need to avoid.”\nThermal interference is one of the factors that a team of scientists, including Walch, took into account in  on 18 November. They calculated the technical potential of GSHPs in the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva. “The technical potential is the maximum amount of geothermal energy that can be extracted by the heat pumps using all the available area in the two cantons, assuming they operate at at least 80% of their rated power,” she says.\nThe research team estimated the available area using existing topographical data on Switzerland, excluding built environments and natural habitats like forests from their study. They then simulated GSHPs installed throughout that area based on factors such as ground temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. “We incorporated the various technical constraints and estimated the optimal borehole spacing that would both comply with installation standards and maximize the extractable heat,” says Walch.\nRegional variation of ground data in the case study region. a) Restriction zones for geothermal installations, b) Ground surface temperature at 1m depth, c) Thermal conductivity, d) Thermal diffusivity derived from the geothermal cadastres. Grey zones are outside the study area. © LESO-PB\nInsufficient capacity in urban centers \nTheirs is the first study of its scale in Switzerland to consider not just the ground’s geothermal capacity but also the technical limitations of GSHPs. The scientists estimate that the annual technical potential of the region they studied is 4.6 TWh, which corresponds to about a third of its total heating demand. They also calculated a maximum energy density of 15.5 kWh/m\n2\n. “Geothermal energy has only limited potential to serve as the region’s only source. It could cover demand in many suburban and rural areas, but would fall considerably short in urban centers,” says Walch. Urban planners can use this information in their technical and economic feasibility studies of GSHP system deployment. \nThe research team also found that the cumulative installed borehole depth shouldn’t exceed 2 km per hectare in order to avoid over-exploitation of the heat capacity of the ground. \nWalch stresses that their findings are only theoretical for now; the study doesn’t factor in local phenomena like phreatic zones and groundwater flows, which can affect the time needed for the ground to cool. It will be essential to drill test bores before installing borehole heat exchangers. \nThe team hopes that by quantifying the heat-generation capacity of shallow geothermal energy, and by pinpointing areas where additional energy sources will be required, their work will inform decarbonization strategies for Switzerland’s heating sector. “Our ultimate goal is to conduct nationwide studies and combine these findings with similar ones for other types of renewable energy,” says Walch, also worked on a study to evaluate . “It’s important to estimate the technical potential independent of heat demand.

The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. \nIncreasing speed and maintaining precision\n The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot. Scientists have now been able to take advantage of the progress made in motorization – in both power and cost – and this avoids the use of any such linking components. Thus, they have really gone up a gear. Reymond Clavel reveals: “The idea of direct drive had been tucked away in a drawer for ages, but then again, twenty years ago the cost of such motors would have been much too high.”\nA success story\nFrom chocolates to neurosurgery\nOriginally conceived to manipulate small, light objects such as chocolates, over time the Delta has been used for many other applications.

These robots are also used in the manipulation and positioning of optical elements.”\nOther members of the Delta family have been developed in areas which demand the highest possible speed and precision, for example in watchmaking. Working together with neurosurgeons at the University Hospital Center of the canton of Vaud, a tactile feedback device has been developed to enable the surgeon to perform his hand movements.

{"id": 212, "text": "Throughout the years, EPFL scientists have evaluated and developed technology for Solar Impulse. They assembled the first mathematical models of the airplane, combining expertise from almost 15 laboratories and providing a first global picture. They also worked on aspects like flight simulators, solar cell technology, motor optimization, and man-machine interfaces with the participation of 20 laboratories. As Solar Impulse lands in New York, this fruitful collaboration continues with studies that address turbulence during take-off and landing, models of composite materials, and pilot well-being under strenuous flight conditions.\nValidating the Dream\nEPFL set the scientific framework of this solar powered airplane back in 2003 as the official scientific partner to Solar Impulse. The first report preferred a plane to the alternate proposal of a Zeppelin, suggesting a wingspan of approximately 70 meters and a weight of 1800 kg – close to the 63.5 meter, 1600 kg HB-SIA plane that just landed at JFK International Airport. This very first model was established by Pierre-Olivier Moix at the Industrial Electronics Laboratory. In close collaboration with André Borschberg, who would later become CEO, co-founder and pilot of Solar Impulse, Moix combined a set of components into a single mathematical model and found that a solar-powered plane could fly around the world.\nTo build this model, technical specifications were provided by EPFL scientists on components such as motor propeller optimization, energy generation and management, composite materials and multi-functional solar skins. Scientist Alfio Quarteroni and collaborators later extended this model for efficient design of a solar airplane using advanced mathematics. The same methodology was used to design the yacht Alinghi, which won the America’s Cup in 2003 and 2007.\nMonitoring the Pilots During Strenuous Flights\nTechnology to monitor the vital signs of the Solar Impulse pilots is currently being developed at EPFL.

{"id": 213, "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, researchers are turning their attention to the virus’ biology, mechanism of action, and possible treatments. One of the targets are a group of immune cells called “neutrophils”, which have been reported to infiltrate the respiratory tract of patients who have died from COVID-19.\nThe idea is that in their attempt to attack the virus, neutrophils might be making the disease’s symptoms even worse by invading the lungs and exacerbating inflammation there. In order to find out if this is actually the case, scientists may use a mouse model whose neutrophils they deplete with “anti-neutrophil” antibodies.\nThe approach is used widely for studying neutrophils in a number of different conditions, including autoimmune diseases, chronic infection or inflammation, wound healing, and even some types of cancer. However, the neutrophil-depletion model is only partially effective, lacks specificity, and doesn’t last long enough.\nA neutrophil with its typical\n,\n segmented nucleus\n.\nA \nprotrusion of the nucleus \nacts like \na \n“\ndouble-edged sword\n”\n, \nwhich the neutrophil wields \nto kill \npathogens –\n but which \nalso \nsometimes damages tissues and exacerbates disease\ns\n. \nCredit: \nEtienne Meylan, EPFL\nNow, scientists led by Etienne Meylan at EPFL, have identified the source of the problem and have developed an alternative model that addresses its shortcomings.

The researchers have now identified these neutrophils, and determined that the reason they survive is because they have a lower chance of being targeted by the antibodies.\nTo address this, the scientists have developed a double antibody depletion strategy that enhances neutrophil elimination. The method increases the killing rate of the antibodies, resulting in a profound, specific and long-lasting reduction in neutrophil numbers in blood and tissues.\n“Our study could be useful to address the functional importance of neutrophils in acute or chronic infection, in inflammation or in cancer,” says Meylan. “In particular, transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection coupled to our standardized neutrophil depletion strategies may help establish a causal link between this innate immune cell type and COVID-19.”\nOther contributors\nLausanne University Hospital (CHUV)\nSwiss Cancer Center Léman\nINSERM, France\nMassachusetts General Hospital Research Institute\nUniversity Duisburg–Essen", "summary": "Neutrophils are critical immune cells for antimicrobial defense, but they can exacerbate a number of diseases, perhaps including COVID-19.

{"id": 214, "text": "Decision-making has gathered immense interest in fields like psychology, neuroscience, robotics and even economics, with numerous models and software simulating the human mind. However, such models are limited to a type of decision-making that focuses only on each decision step in isolation, without taking into account the preceding decisions leading up to it, although the latter is often our everyday experience. Publishing in \nPLoS One\n, scientists from EPFL and the University of Berne have perfected a model that can simulate this type of decision-making and learning conditions with surprising accuracy.\nDecisions, feedback, learning\nDecision-making comes in two major into two types: Markovian and non-Markovian, named after the mathematician Andrey Markov (1856-1922). Simply put, in Markovian decision-making, the next decision step depends entirely on the current state of affairs. For example, when playing backgammon, the next move depends only on the current layout of the board, and not on how it got to be like that. This relatively straightforward process has been extensively modeled in computers and machines.\nNon-Markovian decision-making is more complex. Here, the next step is affected by other factors, such as external constraints and previous decisions. For example, a person’s goal might be to travel on the train. But what will happens when he arrives at the door to the train depends on whether or not he has previously visited the ticket booth to buy a ticket. In other words, the next step depends on how he got there; without a ticket, he cannot proceed to the desired goal. In neuroscience, the “buy-ticket” step is referred to as a “switch-state”.\nA new model of decision-making\nA team led by Michael Herzog at EPFL and Walter Senn at the University of Berne developed the first biologically plausible model that can handle non-Markovian decision-making. Herzog’s group has now tested it with humans as well as various computer models. The model, developed in a previous study, was now validated with two distinct tests, designed by Aaron Michael Clarke and Elisa Tartaglia in Herzog’s lab. The tests were performed by human subjects, and three computer models with different degrees of learning ability. In addition, the test were also taken by an advanced brain model called a “spiking neuron network”, which makes decisions based on whether the majority of neurons in a population fired a signal, or “spike”, and simulates human performance in a very realistic manner.\nThe first experiment tested the impact of the switch-state on people’s decision-making and learning. Users played a computer game where they had to navigate through eight icons (a gun, a car etc.) to finally reach the end goal (called “Yeah!”). Each icon came with three buttons, each leading down a different route, and the user had to decide which one to take. Although there was a relatively short route from the first icon to the goal, it was impossible to go through it unless the user first went through a switch-state icon – an image of a computer. Users repeated the experiment multiple times, becoming increasingly better at deciding which routes to pick. For example, most people took over 80 clicks to get to the goal when they began, but after 40 games, they needed fewer than ten.\nThe second experiment tested how delayed feedback affects decision-making and learning. Here, users were shown a set of experimental images and told that each image belonged to either category one or category two. Each category corresponded to either the left or the right arrow on the keyboard, but the participants were not told which arrow went with which image beforehand. Next, the users were shown each image one at a time, and had to press either the left or right arrow depending on the category of each icon. In response, the screen produce a RIGHT or WRONG feedback message. As the test went on, the feedback became delayed, to the point where feedback from one icon would come after the feedback for the next icon had appeared.\nDecision dynamics\nThe results of the study drew three major conclusions. First, that human decision-making can perform just as well as current sophisticated computer models under non-Markovian conditions, such as the presence of a switch-state. This is a significant finding in our current efforts to model the human brain and develop artificial intelligence systems.\nSecondly, that delayed feedback significantly impairs human decision-making and learning, even though it does not impact the performance of computer models, which have perfect memory. In the second experiment, it took human participants ten times more attempts to correctly recall and assign arrows to icons. Feedback is a crucial element of decision-making and learning. We set a goal, make a decision about how to achieve it, act accordingly, and then find out whether or not our goal was met. In some cases, e.g. learning to ride a bike, feedback on every decision we make for balancing, pedaling, braking etc. is instant: either we stay up and going, or we fall down. But in many other cases, such as playing backgammon, feedback is significantly delayed; it can take a while to find out if each move has led us to victory or not.\nFinally, the researchers found that the spiking neurons model matches and describes human performance very well. The significance of this cannot be overstated, as non-Markovian decision-making has proven to be very challenging for computer models. “This is a proof-of-concept study,” says Michael Herzog. “But the study makes an important contribution toward understanding, and accurately modeling, the human brain – and even surpassing its abilities with artificial intelligence.”\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute with the University of Berne. \nReference\n Clarke AM, Friedrich J, Tartaglia EM, Marchesotti S, Senn W, Herzog MH. \nHuman and Machine Learning in Non-Markovian Decision Making.\nPLoS One\n 21 April 2015. 10(4): e0123105.

{"id": 215, "text": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a major player in nutrition today. Studies have shown that NAD+ concentrations decrease during aging and that recovering the body’s levels of NAD+ can prolong both health span and even life span, making it the focus of much research in nutritional science, medicine, and even pharmaceutics.\nIn terms of biology, NAD+ is what is known as a “co-enzyme” – a necessary molecule that helps an enzyme carry out its respective reaction in the cell. NAD+ is a common co-enzyme for multiple metabolic enzymes across all living cells, meaning that it is heavily involved in producing energy and keeping cells alive and healthy.\nPublishing in \nNature\n, scientists lead by  in collaboration with TES Pharma have found a new way of increasing NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme competing with its production.\nThe \nde novo\n synthesis of NAD+ in the cell begins with the amino acid tryptophan. One of the key enzymes involved in this process is ACMSD, which limits the amount of NAD+ produced by the \nde novo\n synthesis pathway.\nThe scientists were able to show that ACMSD controls the levels of NAD+ in the cell through a mechanism that doesn’t seem to have changed during evolution: case-in-point, the researchers found that, in both the earthworm \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n and mice, blocking the enzyme resulted in higher NAD+ levels and enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe inactivation of ACMSD also increased the activity of Sirtuin 1, an enzyme that NAD+ works with in its role as co-enzyme. Sirtuin 1 is known to play major roles in mitochondrial well-being, and as a result, the boost of NAD+ levels ultimately enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe team then used two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD, developed by . “Since the enzyme is mostly found in the kidney and liver, we wanted to test the capacity of the ACMSD inhibitors to protect these organs from injury,” explains Elena Katsyuba, first author of the paper.\nBoth inhibitors were shown to preserve kidney and liver function in animal models of acute kidney injury and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, offering much promise for their future therapeutic potential in humans. “The fact that ACMSD is exclusively present only in the liver and kidneys reduces the risk of negative repercussions of its loss on other organs,” says Katsyuba. “Put simply, the enzyme will not be missed by an organ that does not have it anyway.”\n“Given the beneficial health effects of boosting NAD+ levels that we have seen in worm and mouse models of disease, we are looking forward to bringing these compounds soon to the clinic to the benefit of patients suffering from liver and kidney diseases, two areas with a large unmet clinical need,” says Johan Auwerx.\nOther contributors\nTES Pharma\nUniversity of Lausanne\nPolytechnic University of Marche\nEPFL Histology Core Facility\nUniversity Hospital of Geneva\nPolish Academy of Sciences", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have found a new way to boost the famous anti-aging molecule NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme that limits its production.

{"id": 217, "text": "Can a home run entirely on solar facades? Apparently so, according to NeighborHub, a house designed and built for the 2017 Solar Decathlon by Swiss students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg (HEIA-FR), the Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD Genève) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR). With NeighborHub, the students wanted to show that it makes both practical and economic sense to install solar panels on a home’s facade – thereby maximizing the surface area put to use – even though sunlight can sometimes struggle to penetrate urban areas. “Unlike rooftops, facades are more likely to be in the shade since other buildings can block the sunlight,” says Philippe Couty, the engineer coordinating the project for HEIA-FR. “That could sharply reduce the amount of power that solar panels generate. But we wanted to show that solar energy can indeed be produced on facades, even in areas packed with a lot of buildings.” The project team went about searching for technology that could prove them right. Peter Cuony, head of solar power systems at Groupe E Connect and a member of the project team from the very beginning, came up with the idea of using power optimizers. The students found that these optimizers fit the bill perfectly, and they installed one in each panel to continuously monitor and adjust the solar panels’ performance.\nMaximizing each panel’s output\n In conventional solar power systems, the panels are connected in series, which means each one can generate only as much energy as the lowest-producing one. Power inverters, taking their cue from the least productive panel, convert the direct current into the alternating current that the home can use. But this method can be a major handicap for the efficiency of solar panels installed on building facades, since the weakest link (e.g. the most shaded panel) could pull down the entire system’s power generation. And that was exactly what happened before the power optimizers were installed on each panel. “Even if each panel has a different level of sun exposure and consequently generates a different amount of energy, the optimizers draw on the instantaneous maximum power generation of each panel, regardless of how much sunlight they do – or don’t – receive,” says Victor Saadé, an EPFL electrical engineering student who is leading the project group responsible for solar panels.\nAchieving energy independence\n Thanks to this novel way of using existing technology, NeighborHub can run entirely on the power generated from its facade-installed solar panels. It even generates more energy than it needs. What’s more, its rooftop remains free for other purposes, like promoting biodiversity – the space can be used to cultivate a variety of plants.\nThe energy independence achieved by the one-story house offers encouraging prospects for residential buildings. Each story could generate enough power for its own needs. That could be a major benefit for cities that are growing vertically.\n“Our house demonstrates that it is possible to produce enough energy for an entire building using solar panels installed only on the building facades,” says Cuony.\nNeighborHub’s open house next Saturday will give the public a unique opportunity to check out the next-generation house before it heads off to the Solar Decathlon competition, which will be held in Denver from 5 to 15 October 2017.\nNeighborHub open house at a glance\n “\nNeighborHub ready to head off to the United States\n”\n Saturday, 10 June 2017, 10am to 5pm\n Smart Living Lab, Halle bleue, blueFACTORY, Passage du Cardinal 13B, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland\n Free of charge, no sign-up required\n Learn more at\nThe project is supported by the following partners:\nThree public-sector partners: Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Canton of Fribourg, City of Fribourg and Smart Living Lab\nAnd the following private partners: Groupe E and Landolt & Cie SA, JPF-Ducret, Régent SA, La Mobilière and Setimac", "summary": "EPFL, in association with the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design and the University of Fribourg, is taking part in the 2017 international Solar Decathlon competition.

{"id": 218, "text": "With cities expected to grow significantly in the future, it is vital to plan their development and anticipate their impact on the environment ahead of time. Nahid Mohajeri, an urban architect and geographer at EPFL, looked into Geneva’s history in order to understand how the city developed the way it did and predict how it will change in the future.\nIn order to model a city's evolution over time, Dr. Mohajeri came up with the idea of combining two different scientific approaches: statistical thermodynamics – \nPreliminary results, published in Ecological Modelling, indicate that cities in general – and Geneva in particular – grow by virtue of two very different processes: they spread out and/or become denser. Dr. Mohajeri also observed that large cities are proportionally more energy efficient and have a lower specific ecological footprint per resident than small towns.\nFor the purpose of quantifying the different cities, the researcher analyzed them in terms of their thermodynamic entropy, which scientists call “randomness.” She also used other physics and engineering methods, such as spatial analysis. In this way, Dr. Mohajeri was able to model cities on a computer.\nThe goal is to compare the ecological impact of various urban forms – compact or dispersed – in view of one day developing a framework for building eco-cities. But is there really an ideal urban form? That’s what Dr. Mohajeri is trying to determine.\nEvery city evolves on the basis of several criteria specific to that city, such as the land on which it was built and the political decisions that transform it. “Kerman, in southern Iran, is an interesting example,” said the researcher. “The city experienced rapid growth at the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979. ‘Revolutionary’ housing was quickly thrown up on the outskirts of the city. The old town is squat and dense, and its expansion seems to be aimed at replicating an American city.”\nDr. Mohajeri analyzed dozens of cities around the world, from New Orleans to London and Geneva. Some give the impression of having grown haphazardly, while others are neatly squared off by their avenues, or, like Geneva, stretch out slowly in the shape of an octagon.\nThe parameters used by the researcher focus on the spatial distribution of 11,418 buildings. According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, more than 83% of Switzerland’s population will live in urban areas in 2050. Dr. Mohajeri’s studies on entropy led to the discovery that two very different processes drove Geneva’s growth: expansion (where streets and buildings were added to the edge of the city) and densification (where streets and buildings were added within the existing city). Expansion has been the dominant force in Geneva over the past 170 years.\nThe Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO - PB) uses the thermodynamic-statistical approach, which originated in the field of physics, to learn more about the complex relationship between the built environment and the natural environment.\nOnce the laws of thermodynamics that govern a given city’s growth are identified, the next step will be to learn how their spatial-temporal evolution affects the functioning of their ecosystem. More specifically, the idea is to determine how a city’s growth and form influence its energy consumption, changes in land cover, biodiversity and human well-being.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher is modeling cities in order to understand their metabolism and determine their ecological impact when they grow and change.

The device will never get stuck in traffic, it’s programmed to avoid obstacles, and it can reach destinations on steep or uneven terrain. Its protective cage and foldable design mean that it can be carried around in a backpack and used in total safety.\n13.09.17 - Many cancers are known to metastasize and spread by expanding nearby lymphatic vessels. This process, lymphangiogenesis, also helps the tumor evade the patient’s own immune system, and it would be expected that inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, which are only effective in a minority of patients. But scientists from EPFL and the US found the opposite: lymphangiogenesis actually enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy against melanoma. The study has significant implications for new types of cancer therapies.\n15.10.17 - The Swiss team and their solar house, the NeighborHub, has won the prestigious Solar Decathlon 2017 competition in the Unites States.

AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped. EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots. Their work makes a major contribution to the development of autonomous vehicles and drones, for example, so that they will be able to operate safely in numbers.\n12.12.17 - Thanks to a donation from the Werner Siemens-Foundation, EPFL will set up a Center for Artificial Muscles, collaborating initially with the University Hospital of Bern (Inselspital) and then with the University Hospital of Zurich. The first project, slated to span the next four years, will focus on developing a less invasive cardiac assistance system for treating heart failure. This prosthetic device – a ring around the aorta – will avoid the complications of hemorrhaging and thrombosis because it will not be in contact with blood. A facial-reconstruction project aimed at restoring patients’ ability to create facial expressions will follow.\n19.12.17 - EPFL President Martin Vetterli has unveiled plans to create the EPFL Center for Digital Trust. Eight institutional and industrial partners are already willing to join. This new research platform will aim to be a center of excellence for IT security and personal data protection in the digital era. These partner organizations will strive to identify their needs and concerns related to the digital revolution.

Hopefully without harm, and it will soon be forgotten.\nBut for the longer-term studies, Asteroid Vesta is a kind of movie star for planetologists. With 500 km in diameter, it is one of the three largest objects of the asteroid belt that formed simultaneously to the solar system we live in, four billion years ago. It is considered a “protoplanet” or a precursor of a planet. Moreover, it is the only known asteroid to have an earth-like structure – with a core, mantle and crust.\nComputer simulation reconstructs collisions between asteroids \n Using a three-dimensional computer simulation, Martin Jutzi from the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern has now accurately reconstructed how Vesta collided with other asteroids twice over a billion years ago. The models show that the protoplanet owes its elliptical shape to these collisions and that they also scarred its surface structure. They are presented in a study published today on the front page of \nNature \nmagazine.\nThe simulations also enable detailed conclusions on the composition and properties of Vesta’s interior to be drawn for the first time, which helps us to better understand the evolution of the solar system. «Based on the sort and distribution of this material at the surface of the asteroid, we are able to precisely reconstruct the various inner layers of Vesta down to a depth of 100 km», explains Philippe Gillet, head of EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory.\nBased on this information, the computer simulations demontrarte exactly how two consecutive impacts of celestial bodies led to the formation of the observed overlapping basins, which almost span the entire southern hemisphere of Vesta. The models show the size (66 and 64 kilometres in diameter), velocity (5.4 kilometres per second) and the impact angle of the bodies that collided with Vesta. This reveals a lot about the properties of the objects that were near the protoplanet a billion years ago.\nThe final images of the simulations closely resemble the shape and topography of Vesta’s southern hemisphere as observed by the Dawn mission. The models even accurately reproduce the spiral-shaped structures inside the youngest crater which are visible on images from the Dawn mission. «This shows how reliable our method is», rejoices Jutzi. “It also proves that the method we used to determine the composition of Vesta’s inner layers are accurate, adds Gillet. The simulation does show that some of the debris were ejected from a depth of 100 kilometers.”\n«The fact that we can now look inside such protoplanets makes entirely new perspectives in the re¬search on the history of our solar system possible,» says Jutzi.", "summary": "Models boost the significance of image and measurement data from space missions and help to understand our solar system.

{"id": 221, "text": "Rising temperatures, increasingly intense rainfall and extended periods of drought are some of the known effects of climate change. But how are trees reacting to them? To find out, a team of researchers from EPFL and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) studied two of the most common plant species found in Switzerland and the rest of Europe: beech and spruce trees. The study,* which was recently published in \nGlobal Change Biology\n, revealed that each species reacts differently, with the amount of moisture in the air playing a greater role than was previously thought.\n\"To find out what forests may look like in the future, we have to understand how each plant species will respond to climate change,\" explains Constant Signarbieux, the scientist in charge of the study, which was carried out at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS).\nThe researchers observed five-to-seven-year-old saplings of the two species for four years, from 2012 to 2015. The saplings were collected at the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura mountains during the colder months, and then replanted in three locations at different altitudes: in the small village of St-Georges (at 1,010 meters), in the Vallon Arboretum in Aubonne (at 570 meters), and in the grounds of the EPFL-run Fondation des Bois Chamblard on the shores of Lake Geneva (395 meters). A fourth group of saplings was kept at its original altitude of 1,350 meters and used as a control group.\nYoung trees at the Aubonne's site, and one reference tree at Marchairuz. (c)ECOS\n\"Transplanting these young trees at lower altitudes meant we could simulate the impact of an average temperature increase of between 1 and 6\n°\nC, in keeping with what is forecast to occur between now and 2100 based on a number of climate-change scenarios,” explains Signarbieux.\nTo beech or not to beech? \nBy regularly measuring each tree's trunk and four main branches, the researchers were able to estimate the trees’ biomass. They noticed that the rise in temperature prolonged the growing season – the period from when the first new leaves or needles appear in the spring until they turn yellow in the autumn – in a similar way for each species. However, the two species demonstrated very different biomass growth. The beech trees did well from the rising temperatures, flourishing quickly and becoming more easily acclimatized to the warmer temperatures than the spruce trees. \"Spruces are a more conservative species and perhaps adapt more slowly,\" says the researcher. \"This could have an immediate impact on our forests, as beech trees are more likely to be predominant going forward.\"\nThe researchers didn't stop there. They wanted to learn more about why the two species grew at different rates – and the reason came as quite a surprise. Their analyses revealed that it had nothing to do with either photosynthesis or the amount of water in the ground. Instead, it was all down to the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) – the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can potentially hold at a given temperature. This gives an indication of how dry the air is and how much pressure the plant's water system is under as a result.\nIt’s all about suction\nA plant's leaves contain microscopic pores, called stomata, which regulate how gases move between the leaves and the atmosphere. \"Plants use these stomata to absorb CO\n2\n from the air through diffusion,\" explains Signarbieux. \"When the pores open to let the gas in, water escapes from the leaves at the same time. This process is known as transpiration and occurs because there is always more moisture in the plant than in the air. It is what creates the suction that pulls water and sap from the soil through the roots, up the stalk and into the leaves.\"\nThe drier the air, the higher the VPD and the greater the suction effect will be. When there are several consecutive days with a high VPD – an ever more regular occurrence due to climate change – plants are put under increasing strain. But different plants react in different ways, as shown by the two species studied. Even before there is no water left in the ground, spruce trees close their stomata to prevent any more hydric stress. Beech trees, however, are more tolerant of this type of stress and wait longer before closing their stomata, which enables them to continue absorbing CO\n2\n and therefore keep growing. This gives them a competitive advantage over the spruces.\nIn the past, average seasonal or annual temperatures and rainfall were used to analyze plants' responses to their environment. But those factors alone don’t explain why the beech and spruce trees grow at such different rates. What makes this study truly original and groundbreaking is that the researchers took account of another variable that is often overlooked: the number of hours during which the VPD was above a certain critical level, indicating that the plant was experiencing exceptionally dry conditions. The biologists now intend to expand their research to other species, in the hope of creating a graphic representation of what Europe’s forests will look like in the future – and to help ensure that they are managed and used sustainably.\n*\nConducted as part of the doctoral thesis by Paula Sanginés, a researcher in the ECOS lab.", "summary": "How do trees adjust to the effects of global warming?

{"id": 222, "text": "Today’s urbanites are ultra-connected and want to make their voices heard on key issues affecting their cities and neighborhoods. Digital platforms are the most convenient and efficient way to do this – but most cities lack the requisite technological capabilities. That means residents’ input is seldom incorporated into planning decisions. At least that’s the main finding of an architecture thesis carried out at EPFL and defended on 28 November. The study compared Geneva with Singapore, an Asian metropolis recognized as the world’s preeminent smart city.\n“We feel we’re at a pivotal moment. People are adopting new lifestyles – new ways of living, working and getting around. But the tools used for urban planning haven’t changed. Geneva’s district maps date back to 1929! So there’s a gap between the way city residents live today and the methods used to design their neighborhoods. That’s what made me want to investigate this topic further,” says Stéphanie Hasler, an architecture researcher at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT), a research center headed by Jérôme Chenal and Marc Soutter.\nDozens of tools at hand\nThis gap exists despite the dozens of tools urban planners have at their disposal for collecting data on how residents use city services: social media, crowdsourcing platforms and mobile apps, to name just a few (see photos galery). Hasler visited Singapore and saw that its city officials use such tools on a daily basis because city residents willingly share their personal data and ideas with local authorities. A few years ago, the city set up a website where residents can view plans for current and future projects and give their opinions. The website encourages dialogue and prevents residents from having to make a trip to the local planning office.\nChanging city\nSo what tools does Geneva have? “Things are changing and I wanted my thesis to make a positive contribution to the city’s development,” says Hasler. She found that Geneva currently uses data only for broader management purposes, such as to reduce traffic congestion or improve energy efficiency. And efforts to solicit residents’ opinions relate primarily to getting feedback on existing projects rather than spawning new ideas. However, Hasler stresses that involving residents in the planning phases is essential for making cities more sustainable, particularly in the areas of transportation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. She also points out a dichotomy unique to Switzerland: “This country has a highly developed sense of democracy as well as advanced technology, but the two are not always combined,” she says.\nList of digital platforms\nSo how can city officials improve things? Hasler’s thesis includes a list of digital platforms that they could use to better listen to and incorporate residents’ ideas. She came up with the list after testing around 50 such platforms worldwide, which she grouped by type of urban project they are meant to address.\nHasler prefers to talk about “responsive cities” rather than “smart cities,” as the former implies putting residents’ needs first. “Urban planners have to serve as coordinators between politicians, experts and residents. Digital technology is essential to doing this effectively, because it helps incorporate the interests of all stakeholders in decision-making,” she says. However, Hasler sensed resistance to the concept of connected urban planning among some of the Geneva planners she interviewed in her research. “Staff training or continuing education programs will be necessary,” she adds.\nCombining the 15 district maps\nIn addition to efforts to more fully involve city residents, Hasler states that Geneva city officials could also work on streamlining their processes and combining the 15 district maps into a single application that all city staff could use. That would help prevent people from working in silos and eliminate discrepancies among the maps. Singapore has been using such an application since 2016, which can also display real-time information on the types of transportation that city residents are using, for example.\nThis thesis research was carried out at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT) in association with ETH Zurich’s Future Cities Lab in Singapore.", "summary": "By comparing the cities of Geneva and Singapore, an EPFL thesis found that urban planners can reap multiple benefits by better leveraging digital technology.

{"id": 223, "text": "Bacteria are everywhere. They are the most abundant form of life on our planet. Pick up just about any surface and its likely covered in bacteria. The aquatic environment is no different. Indeed, the ocean is full of small particles and debris, some inert, some highly nutritious. But how do bacteria differentiate between these surfaces, how do they hold onto them in moving water and how do they recognise each other so that they can work together?\nTake the cholera bacterium, \nVibrio cholerae\n, which infects the small intestine, causing diarrhoea and severe dehydration. It lives in salty water, such as seas, oceans, and estuaries, attaching itself to the shells of crustaceans. These exoskeletons are composed of a sugary polymer called chitin, and provide a rich source of food for the cholera bacterium – allowing it to grow and survive in the environment.\nTo do all this, \nV. cholera\ne uses an appendage that’s “a bit like a grappling hook’’ says lead researcher David Adams. “The idea is that bacteria can throw out these long ropes, hook onto something, and reel it back in’’. These ‘ropes’ are actually the product of highly versatile nano-machines known as type IV pili, which are used by many different bacterial species for motility, sensing surfaces and sticking to them, and even taking up . Consequently, type IV pili are considered critical for the environmental survival and pathogenesis of not just \nV. cholerae\n but a wide range of bacteria.\nOver the course of the last decade or so, the group of  established that \n only when growing on chitinous surfaces and showed that they are essential for DNA-uptake. But how exactly they functioned and what else they might be capable of doing had remained somewhat elusive and was therefore the focus of the current study published in \nNature Microbiology\n.\nTo directly observe the DNA-uptake pili in live \nV. cholerae\n bacteria, the researchers used a technique called cysteine labelling. With that, they were able to establish that, as predicted, the pili are highly dynamic, extending and retracting to take up DNA. “This was an important milestone’’ says laboratory head Melanie Blokesch “even though we’d established some time ago that these structures were there, to see them moving in real-time was something quite special’’.\nThe biggest insight came however, when researchers disrupted the motor that powers pilus retraction, revealing that these ropes could also self-interact with each other, and in doing so, allow cells to stick together. Curiously, different strains of \nV. cholerae\n produce slightly different variants of the PilA subunit, which forms the major building block of the pilus. Remarkably, this creates a set of highly specific interactions that can be used as an identifier between strains ensuring that like only pairs with like.\nFinally, when researchers visualised \nV. cholerae\n growing under more realistic conditions upon chitin surfaces, they revealed that these DNA-uptake pili naturally form dense networks of self-interacting pili. These pili bind tightly to the chitin surface and are required for the bacterium to stay attached during water flow. Thus, the DNA-uptake pilus is a multifunctional toolkit for chitin surface colonisation and kin recognition and the results of this work will help to advance our understanding of how the cholera bacterium survives in the natural environment. This knowledge, on the other hand, is important to better understand the transmission to humans in cholera endemic regions.", "summary": "The cholera bacterium uses a grappling hook-like appendage to take up DNA, bind to nutritious surfaces and recognise ‘family’ members, EPFL scientists have found.

This discovery was made while looking for ways to improve the conductivity of , which are used as electrolytes in . The peculiarity of these liquids is that they contain only ions and no neutral solvent molecule. Evaporation of the liquid and its degradation are, thus, prevented.\nIn the belief that viscosity was limiting the capacity of the medium to let current flow through it, the scientists studied its conduction properties between its solid state, cooled to –93°C, and its liquid state, at room temperature. They were very surprised to discover that more than twenty degrees below the melting point, the conduction was almost identical to that of the liquid. This observation, contrasting with the existing model of mobile electrical charges, demanded further research.\nThe phenomenon was therefore studied in more details by applying terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The resulting measurements enabled the detection of the vibrations of the ions, as well as their way to associate with each other. This achievement was made possible thanks to ultra-short laser pulses that generate THz radiation, which lies between the infrared and the microwave frequency range. This radiation has the property of interacting with mobile electrical charges and low-frequency vibrations of the matter.\nIt was thus possible to observe in an ionic liquid, containing iodide and triiodide ions, a bond-exchange phenomenon. In this scenario, an iodide ion (I-) binds to a neighboring triiodide (I3-) ion, while at the other end of the chain a bond is broken and a new I- ion is liberated. This mechanism governing the displacement of electrical charges only implies back-and-forth movements over very short distances, of the order of 3 angstroms, and does not require the transport of ions over longer ranges. Thanks to the bond-exchange between ions, electrical conduction remains efficient, even in viscous liquids and at very low temperature.\nA similar mechanism was suggested by  at the beginning of the 19th century to explain the conductivity of water, but had never been demonstrated for an ionic liquid.\nThis breakthrough opens up a new field of research. It paves the way towards interesting and innovative applications, for instance in the design of more stable and efficient third-generation solar cells and of new high-capacity batteries.\nLinks:", "summary": "Electrolytes are usually conducting media, in which charged ions move freely in a solvent.

By using a different set of logic functions for the gates on the billions of transistors on electronic circuits, this system shortens the circuits’ calculation steps. That means chip designers can make their chips either smaller, faster or more energy efficient. Industry leader Synopsys has just acquired the rights to use the technology through a non-exclusive license agreement.\nStreamed logic structures for more powerful chips \nToday most engineers use electronic design automation software to design circuits. This software programs translate complex computational models into a labyrinth of billions of microscopic transistors. The LSI laboratory, directed by Giovanni De Micheli, has a longtime and worldwide renowned experience in design automation. There are only few companies and commercial products in use that sustain the entire semiconductor industry effort. Luca Amarù – while he was a PhD student at LSI – set out to radically change how design automation software generates logic diagrams in order to produce better designs.\nLuca Amarù, who holds a doctoral degree in computer science, came up with a method that uses only two logic primitives: majority and inverter. These functions are displayed in majority-inverter graphs (MIGs). Initial studies indicated that his approach could cut the number of logic steps needed to execute a given task. Later experiments confirmed this, finding that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18% on average relative to standard programs. That frees up transistor capacity for other tasks; engineers could also use these gains to make their chips faster or their devices smaller.\nAmarù, now a senior R&D manager at Synopsys, took his findings even further. He also developed a new Boolean algebra for representing the logic functions, which resulted in additional efficiency gains for his system.\nChips that are smaller and faster than ever before \nLab tests have shown that Amarù’s method also works exceptionally well with components already in the market, such as adders and dividers. According to Mauro Lattuada, the technology-transfer manager at EPFL who arranged the license agreement, the method constitutes an important revolution: “This new way of diagraming integrated circuits not only reduces the amount of power, computing time or space needed by nearly 20%, but also gives us a new logic paradigm that can be used in other applications, such as designing and improving FPGAs [field-programmable gate arrays] or searching and analyzing data sets.”", "summary": "An EPFL lab, has come up with a new type of logic diagram and related optimization methods, that can be used to design computer chips with a nearly 20% gain in energy efficiency, speed or size.

The idea is to remotely control a robot from home with one's thoughts. The research, involving numerous subjects located in different countries, produced excellent results in both human and technical terms. The conclusions are discussed in the June special edition of Proceedings of the IEEE, dedicated to brain-machine interfaces.\n19 people tested, 100% success rate\n Nine disabled people and ten healthy people in Italy, Germany and Switzerland took part in the task of piloting a robot with their thoughts. For several weeks, each of the subjects put on an electrode-studded hat capable of analysing their brain signals. They then instructed the robot to move, transmitting their instructions in real time via internet from their home country. By virtue of its video camera, screen and wheels, the robot, located in an EPFL laboratory, was able to film itself as it moved while displaying the face of the remote pilot via Skype. The person at the controls, as if moving in place of the robot, was able to interact with whoever the robot crossed paths with. “Each of the 9 subjects with disabilities managed to remotely control the robot with ease after less than 10 days of training,” said Professor Millán.\nShared control between human and machine\n The brain-machine interface developed by the researchers goes even further. The robot is able to avoid obstacles by itself, even when it is not told to. To avoid getting overly tired, the pilot can also take a break from giving indications. If it doesn’t receive more indications, the robot will continue on the indicated path until it receives the order to stop. In this way, control over the robot is shared between the human and the computer, allowing the pilot to rest while navigating.\nNo difference between healthy and disabled subjects\n In the end, the tests revealed no difference in piloting ability between healthy and disabled subjects. In the second part of the tests, the disabled people with residual mobility were asked to pilot the robot with the movements they were still capable of doing, for example by simply pressing the side of their head on buttons placed nearby.

This simulation focuses on movements (rather than forces) and identifies gaits where the animal’s bones do not collide or come out of their joints.\nIn parallel, two scientists at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory – post-doctoral researcher Kamilo Melo and PhD student Tomislav Horvat – used the fossilized animal anatomy to build a robot called OroBOT. Designed and scaled to match the shape and movements of the extinct animal, OroBOT was used to calculate the physics of how \nOrobates \nwalked. “We tested our hypotheses about the animal’s locomotion dynamics with our robotic model, which factors in the real-world physics of the animal’s gait,” says Melo.\nTesting hundreds of different gaits, based on contemporary animals\nThe interdisciplinary team of scientists tested hundreds of different gaits with their robot in order to determine which ones \nOrobates \ncould have used – and those that it clearly did not. The gaits they tested were based on biomechanical principles extracted from similar modern-day animals such as caimans, salamanders, iguanas and skinks, which they analyzed through X-ray videos and force measurements. “We studied the biomechanics of their movements and determined which mechanical principles they all followed,” says Nyakatura. The research team looked at three features in particular: how erect the animal stood on its legs; how its backbone bent; and how much its elbow or shoulder joints bent as it walked. These three features determine what the researchers call the animal’s “sprawling gait space.” They created  where fellow scientists – and the wider public – can explore the universe of movements that \nOrobates \ncould have used.\nWith these results, they came up with the most likely ways that \nOrobates \nmay have walked. They scored the gaits based on how much energy was required, how stable the movements were, how the leg forces compared with those of other sprawling animals, and how closely the movements aligned with the fossilized footprints. The gaits with good scores appear quite athletic and most closely resemble the movements of caimans. This suggests that \nOrobates \nprobably already held itself a little upright on its legs – unlike salamanders and skinks. Its locomotion was thus more advanced than had been previously thought. \nThe study concludes that advanced — more upright, balanced and mechanically power-saving —locomotion, as in \nOrobates\n, may have evolved before the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals lived. The novel approach developed for this study can be applied by other scientists in their work, and it could be modified to study other evolutionary transitions, such as the origins of flight or galloping gaits in mammals.\nContacts\nFor inquiries about robotics, in English or Spanish:\nKamilo Melo (robotics engineer, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)\nEmail: \nFor inquiries about robotics, in French:\nAuke J.

One of them is the Reality Substitution prototype RealiSM.\nReality Substitution is on track to replace traditional virtual reality \nUntil recently, virtual reality’s widespread use, both commercially and in scientific research, has been hampered by the need to develop custom virtual worlds using labor-intensive 3D animation. Researchers and engineers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and the W Science Initiative are unveiling a Reality Substitution Machine prototype at The Brain Forum that could change all of that. The project, known as RealiSM, has developed an easy-to-use virtual world creator that captures real-world situations to be played back in head-mounted displays (HMD). The system will soon be employed in the lab to study memory and peri-personal space (the space defined by what is within one’s reach) and will have numerous clinical uses for treating phobias and PTSD therapy.\n“There is a positive feedback loop between virtual reality and cognitive neuroscience,” says EPFL researcher and project leader Bruno Herbelin. “On one hand, with a Virtual Reality setup we have an environment that can be completely controlled and endlessly repeated—which are ideal experimental conditions. On the other hand, insights from the cognitive sciences are leading to more immersive, extremely realistic experiences for increasingly effective clinical therapies, behavioral experiments and even better gameplay for entertainment.”\nThe RealiSM project aims to make this technology more accessible to the average clinician and could also bring the technology to developing countries.

{"id": 230, "text": "A pollen grain suspended in water appears to move about randomly; this is what is known as “Brownian Motion.” The grain is hit on all sides by water molecules, which make it quiver. At the human scale, on the contrary, a swimmer plows forward in the water by continuing to move in the direction of her propulsion; her motion is aided by the eddies that she leaves in her wake. For the first time, physicists have observed and measured the effect of these eddies at the microscopic scale. They have found that the viscosity of the water doesn’t completely inhibit the momentum that the water molecules transfer to the pollen grain. As Einstein suspected back in 1905, his formula describing Brownian motion needs to be adjusted.\nBy observing at very high speeds the shadow cast by a the particle on a detector, researchers in EPFL’s Laboratory of Complex Matter Physics were able to show, and measure, the existence of eddies formed by a particle in motion in a liquid. These tiny vortices dissipate after just five microseconds. “The rate at which the vortex dissipates depends on the size of the particle that creates it and the density and viscosity of the liquid,” explains Sylvia Jeney.\nOptical tweezers\nThe challenge was to measure the characteristics of these vortices. To do this, the physicists used what they refer to as “optical tweezers.” Using a laser, they are able to hold very small objects, such as a particle in a liquid, as if the particle was attached to the end of a spring. By measuring the vibration of the particle against the spring, they can demonstrate that the vortex increases the particle’s fluctuations. And, inversely, it is possible to determine certain properties of the particle, such as its size or shape, from the characteristics of the vortex. It’s as if one could deduce the size or shape of a swimmer’s body from the wake she leaves in the water.\nFrom biology to sensors\nThese developments hold promise for making improvements in many areas. “In biology, exchanges between the cell and its surroundings take place in a liquid medium; proteins or viruses that pass through the membrane are one example,” notes Jeney. Elsewhere, micro-sensors used in viscous media currently lack precision. They are used to test interactions in a liquid between a drug and various molecules attached to a microscaffolding. These results could help scientists improve these interactions.\nSources:\n Resonances arising from hydrodynamic memory in Brownian motion, Thomas Franosch, Matthias Grimm, Maxim Belushkin, Flavio M.

{"id": 231, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process. After all, as Mazur noted, “we are all born as scientists.” Who dare to know.", "summary": "EPFL held a special Education Day last Friday, 17 May, as part of events commemorating its 50\nth\n anniversary.

{"id": 232, "text": "Is there life on a distant planet? One way astronomers are trying to find out is by analyzing the light that is scattered off a planet’s atmosphere. Some of that light, which originates from the stars it orbits, has interacted with its atmosphere, and provides important clues to the gases it contains. If gases like oxygen, methane or ozone are detected, that could indicate the presence of living organisms. Such gases are known as biosignatures. A team of scientists from EPFL and Tor Vergata University of Rome has developed a statistical model that can help astronomers interpret the results of the search for these “signs of life”. Their research has just been published in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nSince the first exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun – was discovered 25 years ago, over 4,300 more have been identified. And the list is still growing: a new one is discovered every two or three days. Around 200 of the exoplanets found so far are telluric, meaning they consist mainly of rocks, like the Earth. While that’s not the only requirement for a planet to be able to host life – it also needs to have water and be a certain distance from its sun – it is one criterion that astronomers are using to focus their search.\nIn the coming years, the use of gas spectroscopy to detect biosignatures in planets’ atmospheres will become an increasingly important element of astronomy. Many research programs are already under way in this area, such as for the CHEOPS exoplanet-hunting satellite, which went into orbit in December 2019, and the James-Webb optical telescope, scheduled to be launched in October 2021.\nStarting with an unknown\nWhile much progress has been made on detecting exoplanetary biosignatures, several question marks remain. What are the implications of this kind of research? And how should we interpret the results? What if just one biosignature is detected on a planet? Or what if no biosignatures are detected – what should we conclude? Those kinds of questions are what the EPFL-Tor Vergata scientists set out to answer with their new model.\nTheir work tackles the problem from a new angle. Traditionally, astronomers have looked for life on another planet based on what we know about life and biological evolution on Earth. But with their new method, the scientists started with an unknown: how many other planets in our galaxy have some form of life. Their model incorporates factors like the estimated number of other stars in the galaxy similar to the Sun and how many telluric planets might be orbiting within a habitable distance from those stars. It uses Bayesian statistics – particularly well suited to small sample sizes – to calculate the probability of life in our galaxy based on how many biosignatures are detected: one, several or none at all.\n“Intuitively it makes sense that if we find life on one other planet, there are probably many others in the galaxy with some type of living organism. But how many?” says Amedeo Balbi, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics in Tor Vergata’s Physics Department. “Our model turns that intuitive assumption into a statistical calculation, and lets us determine exactly what the numbers mean in terms of quantity and frequency.”\n“Astronomers already use various assumptions to evaluate how credible life is on a given planet,” says Claudio Grimaldi, a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPMC) who is also affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Rome. “One of our research goals was thus to develop a method for weighing and comparing those assumptions in light of the new data that will be collected over the coming years.”\nSpreading from one planet to another\nGiven the small number of planets that will likely be examined in the near future, and assuming that life will emerge independently on any one planet, the EPFL-Tor Vergata study found that if even just one biosignature is detected, we can conclude with a greater than 95% probability that there are over 100,000 inhabited planets in the galaxy – more than the number of pulsars, which are objects created when a massive star explodes at the end of its life. On the other hand, if no biosignatures are detected, we cannot necessarily conclude that other forms of life do not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.\nThe scientists also looked at the theory of panspermia, which states that instead of emerging independently on a given planet, life forms could be carried over from another planet – such as through organic matter or microscopic organisms being carried on comets or spreading between neighboring planets. This implies that the probability of life on a planet also depends on how far it is from other planets and how easily various life forms – whose physical characteristics could be extremely different from those we are familiar with – are able to resist the extreme conditions of space travel and adapt to the new planet. Factoring in panspermia alters the inferred number of inhabited planets elsewhere in the galaxy.", "summary": "One way to determine whether there is life on another planet is to look for biosignatures in the light that is scattered off its atmosphere.

{"id": 233, "text": "In the cell, proteins often interact directly with DNA to regulate and influence the expression of genes. For this to happen, proteins need to travel into the cell’s nucleus where the DNA is tightly twisted and packed as chromatin, which forms the well-known chromosomes.\nWhen the protein reaches its target location, chromatin unwinds to reveal the section of DNA that the protein will interact with. This interaction is obviously of great interest to biologists as it lies at the heart of multiple important cell functions or even malfunctions that lead to disease.\nTo study protein-chromatin interactions, biologists use a technique called “chromatin immunoprecipitation” (ChIP). The basic idea behind ChIP is to use an antibody that targets the chromatin-binding protein, and then to “pull it down” or precipitate it with the captured section of DNA. The DNA that is bound by the protein is then identified via sequencing, which is why the technique is usually referred to as “ChIP-seq”.\nSince it was invented in 2007, ChIP-seq has become the most popular method for studying chromatin-associated proteins like histones and transcription factors. However, it requires a long sequence of manual steps that limit both its throughput and sensitivity.\nNow, scientists led by Bart Deplancke at EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering have developed a new approach to ChIP that promises to automate and lower its cost and complexity. The new method, dubbed “FloChIP” uses microfluidics, a bioengineering field that EPFL has helped developing and expanding.\nMicrofluidics essentially involves the precise manipulation of fluids through chips that contain multiple, carefully designed channels. Because it mimics the inner dynamics of a cell, this technique can and is already used in a number of bioengineering processes.\nFloChIP implements microfluidics to greatly streamline the ChIP workflow. In a paper published in PNAS, the EPFL scientists demonstrate that FloChIP is highly modular and can perform multiple ChIP-seq assays simultaneously and reproducibly in an automated way. In the paper, the researchers show this for both histone marks and transcription factors.\nA diagram showing how FloChIP works, included in the PNAS paper. \nCredit: R. Dainese (EPFL).\n“Thanks to its cost-effectiveness, throughput and general applicability, we believe that FloChIP will establish itself as a valid complement to the existing tools for the study of chromatin biology and protein-DNA interactions,” says Riccardo Dainese, the study’s first author.\n“With this new technology, true automation of a difficult assay such as ChIP is within reach,” adds Deplancke. “This will hopefully catalyze an increased use of chromatin-bound proteins as highly informative diagnostic indicators for a wide range of diseases including cancer.”\nOther contributors\nSwiss institute of Bioinformatics\nSystemsX.ch\nEPFL\nInnosuisse", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed FloChip, a new microfluidic take on the widely used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique.

Without realizing it, we are constantly tweaking our pace, stride length and foot lift. But could we consciously play with these parameters in order to influence our energy expenditure?\n Researchers at EPFL’s  from the School of Engineering studied eight gait parameters in order to come up with a very sophisticated software program that uses an avatar to predict how much energy people use when they walk depending on their walking style. This research has been published in . Salman Faraji, the co-lead author, devoted an entire section of his thesis to this topic.\nThe avatar – a torso equipped with two legs with feet – can be freely configured. Users start by entering their height and weight and can then set the walking speed, distance between their feet (stride length and stride width), and foot lift, along with the incline of both the torso and the ground. They can also add mass and simulate the effect of being pushed or pulled at different parts of the body. The number of calories burned and the energy consumption are displayed in real time whenever the parameters are modified.\nMaking custom exoskeletons\nThis pioneering software drew on a number of experiments appearing in recent literature, and it offers a huge number of potential applications – especially in the medical realm. “The software could be used to select the best design for an exoskeleton or a custom prosthetic, in order to reduce the user's effort.

{"id": 235, "text": "Roberto Gargiani, professor at EPFL’s Theory and History of Architecture Laboratory 3, has spent the last six years carefully studying Le Corbusier’s lesser-known archives and visiting the buildings he designed from 1940 to his death in 1965 with his research assistant and co-author Anna Rosellini. A different Corbusier comes into focus; poet, mystic, philosopher and artist.\nYou recently published a book about Le Corbusier’s work and life after World War II. Why research this period specifically?\nFor Le Corbusier, the Second World War and its horrors made him completely rethink the notion of the civilisation machiniste that had been central to his buildings constructed in the 20s and 30s. Le Corbusier saw the war as the machine being turned against civilization itself. What better place to start than when he began to redefine himself? We let him lead us away from his antecedent vision of architecture that has tended to defined how we look at him until this very day.\nLe Corbusier is the architect with probably the most books already written about him. What are you trying to accomplish with your current research?\nHow would characterize this new vision?\nIf we look specifically at the period after World War II until his death in 1965, we see an artist who was constantly searching for new ideas, ready to transform his notion of architecture and subsequently of all modern architecture. When going through these archives, I discovered an architect who was at the same time a poet, a philosopher and a visionary. He is, still today, at the avant guard of architecture.\nFor example, his research on what is now called “climate adapted architecture,” has only been cursorily explored. Le Corbusier was already designing buildings adapted to local climatic elements in the 40’s and 50’s using a technique he called the “climate grid,” or grille climatique. Sunlight played an essential role in how he conceived architecture, and he was already thinking about how to draw as much light into the living spaces without raising the temperature.\nYour research focuses greatly on the notion of Béton Brut, could we finish this interview with a word about that?\nDo not forget that Le Corbusier was an artist and an artisan. He saw beauty in the spontaneous creation of concrete being struck from the formworks and wanted these marks and even mistakes to be part of the esthetic qualities of the building. He wanted his concrete to be left raw, not polished nor glossed over. His vision of what brut signified also transformed over his life’s work, from a maniacal control over each element to embracing hazard as a positive force, perhaps as a direct result of time spent in India.\nIt seems that Le Corbusier was receptive to many cultural influences...\nHe took inspiration from his travels to India and his readings of the Surrealists while never forgetting his origins as a decorator from La-Chaux-de-Fonds. From these influences he infused his buildings with tapestries of his own design, sculptures embedded directly into the concrete taken from his own drawings, as well as color schemes that were meant to evoke emotional reactions.

{"id": 237, "text": "Swiss and Russian scientists are pooling their scientific expertise to gain better understanding of lake environments. On board ultralight, technology-packed aircraft, they are testing new analysis methods above Lake Geneva and Lake Baikal. With the support of Ferring Pharmaceuticals and the Honorary Consulate of Russia in Lausanne, and with additional help from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the researchers will observe the surfaces of the two lakes from the air. The field campaign has just begun over Lake Geneva. \n In a press conference held on May 14, 2013, the principal investigators unveiled the outlines of the international Léman-Baïkal project. On May 25, the ultralight aircraft will take off on a 7,500 km voyage to Russia. During the flight, EPFL scientists will use on-board technology to study biodiversity. French researchers from the CEA will join the crew for the trip to gain a better understanding of the atmospheric consequences of boreal forest fires. On June 24, the field campaign over Lake Baikal will begin.\nLakes Geneva and Baikal: similarities and differences\n Lake Geneva and Lake Baikal have several things in common. Both glacial lakes are large enough to give rise to complex water circulation phenomena, and both are affected by human activity. They are also different enough that a comparison is of interest. Although Lake Geneva is huge for an Alpine lake, Lake Baikal is on another scale altogether. It’s the world’s largest body of fresh water, stretching more than 600 km in length and with a maximum depth of 1,600 meters. By testing their methods over these two bodies of water, the researchers have ideal conditions in which to develop new analysis methods geared for lake environments. \nState-of-the-art scientific equipment\n One of the ultralights is equipped with a hyperspectral camera that can separate the light spectrum into more than 250 parts. Using this, it becomes possible to see exactly how algae and suspended sediments are distributed and circulate in the layers that rise to the lake surface. The data from the planes will be combined with satellite data as well as water samples taken from a catamaran. Lidars will provide information on atmospheric flow near the surface of the lake. \n River deltas are another important area of research interest. Sidestreams are often vectors of pollution, due to upstream human activity, and their discharge introduces complex flows known as “plumes” into the lake. By clarifying the complex dynamics of this phenomenon, the scientists hope to be able to better understand how pollutants spread. During the first exploration session in Russia, they will set their sights in particular on the plume from the Selenga River, in the delta that is incomparably larger than that of the Rhone River. \nA platform for research exchange between Switzerland and Russia\n In 2011, the elemo field campaign provided an opportunity for Swiss researchers to benefit from Russian technology and expertise. The MIR submersibles made an unprecedented exploration of the waters of Lake Geneva possible. This time, Switzerland will make an important contribution with analysis methods that have been developed at EPFL. “One of our goals is to share our expertise with our Russian colleagues, particularly in the area of hyperspectral imaging,” says EPFL’s Ulrich Lemmin, scientific director of the Leman-Baïkal project. \n Another component of the Léman-Baïkal project is the establishment of a scientific exchange program. Switzerland and Russia will each send five scientists who will live in the partner country. These scientists will organize workshops to share their results, with the objective of publishing joint work in professional journals.\n This adventure is made possible thanks to renewed funding from Ferring Pharmaceuticals. “In 2011, with the elemo campaign, we demonstrated our commitment to the Lake Geneva region and the protection of the lake environment,” explains Michel Pettigrew, President of the Executive Board of Ferring Phamaceuticals. “We are proud to renew our support of this project; it corresponds perfectly with Ferring’s fundamental values, which are centered on human beings, research and the sharing of knowledge.”", "summary": "Ultra-light aircraft are being deployed in both Switzerland and Russia as part of the Léman-Baïkal project.

The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nThe School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.\nThe font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge. The School profoundly affects the lives of those who study or teach there. As a hub of research and knowledge, EPFL is a source of personal and professional fulfillment. We wanted to reflect all of that in the new design,” says Caroline Moser, CEO of Moser Design.\nThe new visual identity consists of more than just the logo, as it covers the full range of graphic elements that convey the School’s brand. The logo itself figures prominently on campus, in the form of a 2.6-meter-high metal sculpture next to the Rolex Learning Center.\nModern-day agora pays tribute to the past\nThe symbolic launch of the School’s 50th anniversary celebration would not have been complete without paying tribute to Maurice Cosandey, the visionary who in 1969 turned what was then a local engineering school into a Swiss federal institute of technology.\nThe Lombard Odier Agora was therefore inaugurated today in Place Maurice Cosandey – the square named after EPFL’s first president – in a ceremony attended by the Cosandey family.\nPlace Maurice Cosandey sits at the southern entrance of the campus, between the Rolex Learning Center and ArtLab. It was chosen for the Agora as part of an initiative originating with the ArtLab project to revamp this area. The redevelopment project was led by EPFL’s Design Studio on the Conception of Space (ALICE), which is headed by architecture professor Dieter Dietz. “Our goal for this project was clear: to get the entire EPFL community – especially students – involved in order to breathe life into a neglected part of campus,” says Dietz.

{"id": 239, "text": "Do you speak Scala? Many big companies active on the Web now reply in the affirmative. Twitter, Foursquare , LinkedIn and the internet site of the British newspaper The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) have adopted this programming language, developed at EPFL by Martin Odersky, Professor in the computer science section of the school.\nLast week, its creator announced the launch of a new company, with its offices at the Science Park at Ecublens. It’s called Typesafe, has just raised three million dollars, and will give a serious boost to the Scala language. The main investor in this round of financing – Greylock, based in Boston and in Silicon Valley – is not just any old investor. The company supported Facebook at the time when the social networking site was opening to a mass audience, and had also invested in LinkedIn, from 2004.\nScala is becoming more and more popular with programmers, especially for internet applications. But what’s behind this success? “This language is concise, and enables reductions of on average 50% of the lines of code”, Martin Odersky begins by explaining. What’s more, being very close to Java and completely compatible, it’s very easy to adopt for programmers who are familiar with Java, which has become a true standard on the Internet. Finally, it’s open source, which means that the people who contribute to its development exist in their hundreds, spread across the whole world – although EPFL remains the owner of the copyright.\nLeveraging the multiplication of “cores”\n One of the strengths of Scala is to combine two approaches that are popular in the programming world. One is “object-oriented” – which has always up to now been preferred by industry – and the other “functional programming”, which has been used mainly in academia. The advantage of the latter is that it’s very efficient when it comes to distribute tasks to several processors working in parallel. “Today, progress in IT is exemplified by the multiplication of the number of ‘cores’ in the processors, and no longer in terms of increases in speed”, explains the Professor. “Creating new applications that take advantage of this aspect of the processors is a natural development in programming.” Another advantage is that this approach is perfectly suited to distributed computing, or “cloud computing”, which is becoming more popular with big companies that are active on the Internet. This approach –concentrating on the distribution of tasks to multiple processors – gives Scala its name (from “scaling”).\nWith his new company, Martin Odersky is paving the way for the future of computing. Typesafe provides free-of-charge downloading of a pack of software including Scala, a development tool, and also the Akka platform, created in Sweden, whose inventor Jonas Bonér is also a co-founder of Typesafe. Complementary to Scala, Akka is a middleware designed for the distribution of tasks in large computing centers.\nIn parallel, Typesafe is putting in place a technical support service for its clients. “From around 15 employees today, our team will increase to 25 by the end of the year”, continues Martin Odersky. Most of the employees are developers, working in the EPFL Science Park, Cambridge, Boston – where the company is headquarted – and Uppsala. In just over a couple of weeks, Typesafe will be in the limelight during the second annual « Scala days » event – a meeting of programmers – whose initial occurrence last year at EPFL attracted many specialists.\nTypesafe should thus give a real boost to the Scala language. With a smile on his lips, Martin Odersky expresses his confidence that the “really big players” in this domain will soon be joining in. But as for their names, we’ll just have to be patient . . .", "summary": "Thanks to the raising of three million dollars, Martin Odersky has just created the company Typesafe.

It uses them simultaneously, then aggregates the data obtained to deliver the final content to each unit. As a result the download speed can be doubled when two devices work together. “Videos represent 60% of the traffic on mobile networks, and the demand is growing faster than the ability of the network to provide bandwidth,” says Christina Fragouli, co-founder of the start-up. This results in increasing interruptions while viewing a video.\nThis ingenious system comes with many constraints. “To accomplish this, we must solve the problem of resource allocation, all the while accounting for variabilities in the wireless network,” explains Lorenzo Keller, the other co-founder of this spin-off from EPFL and University of California Irvine (UCI). The algorithms behind this system provide for any wireless device which transmits, via any network, at any time. Moreover, it necessarily does this effeciently: devices are carefully coordinated so that the overall coordination does not interfere with the benefits. Several applications are being developed. The bandwidth can be shared either when it is not in use by one of the users, or when a group of users simultaneously attempts to access the same content.\nVideobee, designed for Android smartphones, will be launched any day now. This application facilitates video viewing from websites like YouTube or DailyMotion by reducing both the waiting time at the beginning of the video as well as interruptions.

The models offer the prospect of a new understanding of the human brain and its diseases and of completely new computing and robotic technologies. On January 28, the European Commission supported this vision, announcing that it has selected the HBP as one of two projects to be funded through the new FET Flagship Program.\nFederating more than 80 European and international research institutions, the Human Brain Project is planned to last ten years (2013-2023). The cost is estimated at 1.19 billion euros. The project will also associate some important North American and Japanese partners. It will be coordinated at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, by neuroscientist Henry Markram with co-directors Karlheinz Meier of Heidelberg University, Germany, and Richard Frackowiak of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL).\nThe Swiss Contribution \nSwitzerland plays a vital role in the Human Brain Project. Henry Markram and his team at EPFL will coordinate the project and will also be responsible for the development and operation of the project’s Brain Simulation Platform. Richard Frackowiak and his team will be in charge of the project’s medical informatics platform; the Swiss Supercomputing Centre in Lugano will provide essential supercomputing facilities. Many other Swiss groups are also contributing to the project. Through the ETH Board, the Swiss Federal Government has allocated 75 million CHF (approximately 60 million Euros) for the period 2013-2017, to support the efforts of both Henry Markram’s laboratory at EPFL and the Swiss Supercomputing Center in Lugano. The Canton of Vaud will give 35 million CHF (28 million Euros) to build a new facility called Neuropolis for in silico life science, and centered around the Human Brain Project. This building will also be supported by the Swiss Confederation, the Rolex Group and third-party sponsors.\nThe selection of the Human Brain Project as a FET Flagship is the result of more than three years of preparation and a rigorous and severe evaluation by a large panel of independent, high profile scientists, chosen by the European Commission. In the coming months, the partners will negotiate a detailed agreement with the Community for the initial first two and a half year ramp-up phase (2013-mid 2016). The project will begin work in the closing months of 2013.\n---\nA scientific portrait of the Human Brain Project \nThe Human Brain Project will provide new tools to help understand the brain and its fundamental mechanisms and to apply this knowledge in future medicine and computing.\nCentral to the Human Brain Project is Information and Computing Technology (ICT). The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior.\nA novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and to speed up the search for new treatments.\nFinally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems.\nThe HBP will fund independent scientists to use the new platforms for their own research, reserving a substantial part of its budget for this purpose.

This year’s contest is more specifically called HydroContest-X, because it is being organized jointly by three universities in French-speaking Switzerland: EPFL, the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture (HEIA-FR) and the Vaud School of Management and Engineering (HEIG-VD). The contest, which is supported every year by the Hydros Foundation, challenges students to design, build and race the most energy-efficient boats possible. The event is free of charge and open to the public.\nEach team designs and builds miniature, remote-controlled boats to compete in two contest categories. The two categories are complementary, like Laurel and Hardy – one for thin and light boats, where the aim is to sail fast and far; the other for bigger and heavier ones, which must haul 200 kg of cargo to simulate a freight vessel. Boats in both categories run on batteries provided by the organizer. The event aims to not only enhance students’ education, but also build awareness about the need for cleaner, more energy-efficient shipping vessels and spark ideas for technology in this area.\nAn asymmetric boat\nEPFL students have participated in the contest every year since it was launched. And this year’s team will show up in Yverdon-les-Bains with not two, but three boats. Two of them are from last year’s HydroContest. The first one, which competed in the Mass Transport category, is a hybrid between a catamaran and an airboat that sails on a thin cushion of air. It won the innovation prize last year but was eliminated during the quarterfinals. The second boat, which competed in the Private Boats category, is a twin-foil vessel designed in 2016. This boat proved to be fast but fairly unstable; it came in second place last year behind HEIA-FR.\nThe third boat – new this year – is designed after a prao, a traditional Indonesian sailboat. It has only one hull and one lateral float, making it asymmetric. “We designed it over the past year, it works, and we’ve tested it several times, yet it still needs to be tweaked,” says Sébastien Jaffaux, head of EPFL’s HydroContest team. “So at this point it’s too early to enter it in the race. But if we get the new foils in time, we’ll run demos on the lake.”\nBut the students have big plans for next year, when, as part of the Swiss Solar Boat project, they will use their prototypes as test platforms for the 2020 Monaco Solar & Energy Boat Challenge.

Mr. Jendly is currently manager of the engineering sector of a startup and Vice President of the Neuchâtel arm of Swiss Engineering, a professional network of Swiss engineers and architects that has more than 13,500 members. We caught up with him for a short interview. \nIn a globalized market where competition is extremely fierce, is Swiss manufacturing still profitable in the area of microengineering?\n When it comes to mass-producing basic parts, such as engine parts for example, we can't compete with countries like China and India due to our higher labor costs. However, we do have an advantage when in comes to high-value-added products, or in other words sophisticated and innovative products. This is the case for medical and electronic devices, as well as everything related to watch-making. Generally speaking, Swiss know-how and training guarantee a certain quality that is very much appreciated by clients and partners. They also guarantee profitable production.\nYet several companies have recently left Switzerland, causing a wave of redundancies. Is there a crisis in Swiss manufacturing?\n No, this is not the case for high-value-added products. Some Swiss companies have moved production offshore to Asia or Eastern Europe only to change their minds and come back to Switzerland due to problems of quality. Having to regularly send engineers abroad to resolve such problems is just too expensive in the end. It's also easier if the production site and the R&D site are not too far apart.\nBut some multinationals are quick to relocate...\n Multinationals are different because the decision-makers are not necessarily in Switzerland anyway.

{"id": 244, "text": "The “deep artificial composer”, or “DAC” for short, generates brand-new melodies that imitate traditional folk music of Irish or Klezmer origin. It does so without plagiarising already existing ones, since melodies it writes are as original as those produced by a human composer. The results were presented in April at this year’s edition of the .\nThe DAC actually produces musical scores of melodies, symbolic music written using notation, and does not generate audio files. “The deep artificial composer can produce complete melodies, with a beginning and an end, that are completely novel and that share features that we relate to style,” says EPFL scientists Florian Colombo who developed the artificial intelligence under the guidance of Wulfram Gerstner, director of the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory.\nColombo continues, “To my knowledge, this is the first time that an artificial neural network model has produced entire and convincing melodies. We also provide a new tool to evaluate the originality of a piece.”\nAlgorithmic music composition was first suggested in the literature by English mathematician Ada Lovelace in the 19\nth\n century, requiring an “Analytical Machine” which could be programmed to solve even the most complex problems, like writing music. The computational power of modern computers and the sheer amount of digitized musical scores are now making automatic music composition a reality.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is already capable of composing symbolic music and is often based on implementing music theory. What’s new with the DAC is that the AI learns to compose complete melodies without any music theory from start to finish, solely based on a large database of existing music. No human postproduction is necessary.\nExtracting music style with probabilities\nEPFL’s deep artificial composer avoids traditional music theory altogether. Each style of music has its own set of rules, and existing AI generated music often uses the Western musical language of harmony and counterpoint. In fact, the EPFL algorithm determines its own composition rules by extracting probability distributions from existing melodies using neural networks, requiring only the computation power of graphic cards that can speed up calculations by a factor of ten compared to standard computers.\nThe DAC extracts the style of the music by learning how a given piece of music transitions from one note to the next, and calculates the probability of the next note’s pitch and duration. The algorithm then trains on multiple scores of music, of any given style, in order to improve its ability to correctly predict the pitch and duration of the upcoming note.\nOnce the training is complete, which means that the predictive performance of the deep artificial composer has reached its target value, set at 50% successful pitches and 80% successful durations, it no longer needs to be trained and can be used to generate new melodies, one note at a time. The deep artificial composer builds a string of notes from beginning to end, including the very first note and the length of the composition, that resembles melodies of the dataset that was used for the training. Listen to a  based on Irish and Klezmer melodies and interpreted by Colombo on the cello.\nOf course, the DAC can compose melodies before the training process is complete, but this leads to , even to the untrained ear. It can also be trained beyond the target value, but the generated pieces tend to resemble existing compositions. The DAC can also determine itself if the composition is original enough by comparing phrases of notes with existing patterns in its database of melodies. Similarly, the algorithm can determine the musical genre – Irish or Klezmer folk in this case – of the generated scores.\nThe generated music is not limited to Irish or Klezmer traditional folk music: any style of music could be used. It just so happens that many Irish and Klezmer melodies are already digitized and easily accessible.\nInsight into the human brain\nThe computing power behind the artificial intelligence is an artificial neural network, known as “long short-term memory” and invented twenty years ago at the IDSIA in Lugano. It has already proven useful for speech recognition and is widely used by the largest software companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.\n“The success of the deep artificial composer provides insight into how the human brain works,” says Gerstner. “Neural networks with memory spanning different time scales are needed to successfully create music, implying that the ability of the human brain to retain information, even after a long period of time, is key to composing music.”\nFor Colombo and Gerstner, the work is preliminary since the DAC is limited to single voice compositions. In the long-run, Colombo hopes to generate a score for an entire orchestra.", "summary": "A deep-learning algorithm developed by EPFL scientists can generate melodies that imitate a given style of music.

{"id": 246, "text": "“Tutu” by Miles Davis and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple have already made their mark on music history. Now they have entered the annals of science, for eternity. Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA! I've been a part of this festival for decades and it truly is a magnificent representation of what happens when different cultures unite for the sake of music. Absolute magic.

{"id": 247, "text": "At  – educational facilities designed to promote cross-disciplinary research – a groundbreaking new device is in the works. Eight Master’s students in microengineering, bioengineering and life sciences () developed a portable biosensor for the  competition, which was held at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands on 7–8 September 2018. Their device can provide precise measurements of the amount of vancomycin, an antibiotic used as a last-resort treatment, in a patient’s blood plasma. This information will help doctors deliver exactly the amount of drug needed and therefore reduce the occurrence of harmful side effects. For instance, vancomycin is known to cause damage to the kidneys and to hearing.\n“We started working on the biosensor last fall alongside our coursework, and this summer have been working on it full-time. Being able to use the DLL has made our research a lot easier, since they have all the equipment we need,” says Alix Faillétaz, a Master’s student in bioengineering. This is the second year in a row that EPFL is participating in SensUs, where its team will be up against students from 12 other universities from around the world. “The competition was launched three years ago. It’s really demanding and is a huge challenge for the students. They must overcome a series of problems and learn to work together, trust each other and delegate tasks based on each individual’s specific skills,” says Professor Philippe Renaud, who is coaching the team.\nPolarization-based measurements\nSensUs aims to encourage the development of biosensors, targeting a different application each year – although the objective always relates to measuring a biomarker with an impact on public health. The objective is chosen by a panel of experts that includes Professor Renaud. Existing tests to measure vancomycin require a great deal of time, a considerable amount of blood and a special machine that costs tens of thousands of Swiss francs. But the EPFL team’s portable biosensor can take measurements in less than five minutes with just a few drops of blood, and costs under 5,000 francs. Their device shines polarized light on a sample containing a homogeneous mixture of the patient’s blood plasma and a synthetized peptide (an amino-acid sequence) solution.\nHow does it work? “We first created a peptide that bonds specifically to vancomycin, and then we added a fluorescent compound,” says Faillétaz. “As the vancomycin bonds to the fluorescent peptide, the peptide’s movement slows and the light it emits becomes more and more polarized. By measuring the degree of light polarization, we can calculate the vancomycin concentration in a patient’s blood.” According to Professor Renaud, this method already exists but has never been used to make a portable biosensor.\nAt the competition, the EPFL team will have to not only prove their biosensor’s efficacy by analyzing various samples, but also demonstrate its benefits for the healthcare industry and its market potential. “By changing the synthesis compound, our biosensor could be used to detect other antibiotics and biomarkers,” says David Vilela, a Master’s student in life sciences.\nEPFL on the first step of the podium\n The SenSwiss team won the most awards in the SensUs international competition. They won the technical award, and placed second for the awards related to creativity and entrepreneurship. Their biosensor has proven to be the most effective in accurately measuring the amount of vancomycin in blood plasma samples. This can be done in less than five minutes, with only a few drops of blood and innovative technology. The team also demonstrated the commercialization potential of his invention, its usefulness to medical personnel and the possibility of adapting the test to other antibiotics.\nThe SenSwiss team: \nMatthieu Pinto (microengineering student) optical detection part, Victor Steininger (bioengineering student) electrical and mechanical parts, Mathieu Jeckelmann (bioengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Jacopo Oswald (microengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Paul Philipp (life sciences student) biological part, Aly Makhlouf (bioengineering student) biological part, David Vilela (life sciences student) biological part, Alix Faillétaz (bioengineering student) electrical part.", "summary": "A team of eight EPFL students won the technical prize in the SensUs international competition, designing a portable biosensor that can measure the amount of vancomycin in a patient’s blood stream, enabling doctors to better control the dosage and reduce harmful side effects.

Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples. Her results showed that people are exposed to a number of pesticides, and that this is not due solely to their work.

Second Sight Medical Products, whose European base is located in EPFL's Science Park, has developed a prosthetic retina which enables them to regain the ability to identify their surroundings. The company has just received EC certification, which will allow it to commercialize the invention in Europe.\nThis degenerative disease causes patients to progressively lose their sight. They generally lose night vision between 10 and 20 years of age, then peripheral vision between 20 and 30 years of age, finally becoming completely blind at around age 40. The disease affects around one person in 4000, and is the most frequent cause of blindness in middle-aged people in developed countries. Its origin is in a genetic mutation of the rods and cones – the two photo-receptive cells of the retina.\nThe role of the implant offered by Second Sight is to bypass the damaged cells. A small camera fixed on a pair of spectacles records an image, which is then converted into electrical impulses and transmitted to a receiver located at the back of the eye. Implanted on the retina, it sends these impulses to the neurons, and the impulses are then interpreted by the brain to re-construct an image.\n“The kind of sight that our product gives the patient is not like that we have naturally, and can’t replace it”, explains Grégoire Cosendai, Director of Second Sight’s European office. The device brings mainly an additional level of comfort in their daily life; for example in moving around or cooking.”\nToday, the prosthetic retina has already been implanted in 30 patients as part of the clinical trials. All of them have regained the ability to discern day from night. Twenty-nine of them can manage to find an object in a room, and 57% can detect movement around them. Eighty per cent can distinguish text on a computer screen, although some people need more time than others to achieve this. Finally, seven patients noticed a clear improvement in their visual acuity, and manage to read, for example, newspaper headlines. “The results depend on the positioning of the implant on the retina, but also on the way that the latter reorganizes itself afterwards, and this differs from one person to another”, adds Grégoire Cosendai.\nSecond Sight is now working on the second stage of the project: to improve the system in cooperation with three research teams at EPFL. These are the Laboratory of Biomechanical Orthopedics, the Laboratory of Microsystems, and the Laboratory of Applied Mechanics and Reliability Analysis. The objective is to develop a system that will enable the conversion of the camera image into electrical impulses that the brain can recognize. This will then help in understanding the differences in the results obtained in the patients, and to then adapt the device to the specific needs of each person.", "summary": "A new prosthetic retina enables those patients blinded by the disease \"retinitis pigmentosa\" to regain some form of vision.

{"id": 252, "text": "In recent years optical fibers have served as sensors to detect changes in temperature, like a thermometer, and pressure, like an artificial nerve. This technique is particularly useful in structures such as bridges and gas pipelines.\nEPFL researchers have now come up with a new method that enables optical fibers to identify whether they are in contact with a liquid or a solid. This is achieved by simply generating a sound wave with the help from a light beam within the fiber.\nThis study was conducted by the Group for Fibre Optics (GFO) run by Luc Thévenaz within the School of Engineering and has been published in \nNature Communications\n.\nA sensor that doesn’t disturb the light\n No wider than a strand of hair, an optical fiber made of glass transmits light that varies according to four parameters: intensity, phase, polarization and wavelength. These parameters are altered when the fiber is stretched or the temperature changes, enabling the fiber to act like a sensor by detecting cracks in structures or abnormal temperatures. But up to now it was not possible to determine what was happening around the fiber without having light escape the fibre, which disrupts its path.\nThe method developed at EPFL uses a sound wave generated inside the fiber. It is a hyper-frequency wave that regularly bounces off the fiber’s walls. This echo varies at different locations depending on the material the wave comes into contact with. The echoes leave an imprint on the light that can be read when the beam exits the fiber, making it possible to map out the fiber’s surroundings. This imprint is so faint that it hardly disturbs the light propagating within the fiber. The method could be used to sense what is going on around a fiber and send light-based information at the same time.\n The researchers have already immersed their fibers in water and then in alcohol, before leaving them out in the open air. Each time, their system was capable of correctly identifying the change in the surroundings. “Our technique will make it possible to detect water leakages, as well as the density and salinity of fluids that come into contact with the fiber. There are many potential applications,” says Thévenaz.\nSpatial and temporal detection\n These changes in the surroundings are located thanks to a simple time-based method. “Each wave impulse is generated with a slight time lag. And this delay is reflected upon the beam’s arrival. If there were any disturbances along the way, we can both see what they were and determine their location,” explains Thévenaz. “For the moment, we can locate disturbances to within around ten meters, but we have the technical means to increase our accuracy to one meter.”\nThe idea of using a sound wave in optical fibers initially came from the team’s partner researchers at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

With NeighborHub, the students wanted to show that it makes both practical and economic sense to install solar panels on a home’s facade – thereby maximizing the surface area put to use – even though sunlight can sometimes struggle to penetrate urban areas. “Unlike rooftops, facades are more likely to be in the shade since other buildings can block the sunlight,” says Philippe Couty, the engineer coordinating the project for HEIA-FR. “That could sharply reduce the amount of power that solar panels generate. But we wanted to show that solar energy can indeed be produced on facades, even in areas packed with a lot of buildings.” The project team went about searching for technology that could prove them right. Peter Cuony, head of solar power systems at Groupe E Connect and a member of the project team from the very beginning, came up with the idea of using power optimizers. The students found that these optimizers fit the bill perfectly, and they installed one in each panel to continuously monitor and adjust the solar panels’ performance.\nMaximizing each panel’s output\n In conventional solar power systems, the panels are connected in series, which means each one can generate only as much energy as the lowest-producing one. Power inverters, taking their cue from the least productive panel, convert the direct current into the alternating current that the home can use. But this method can be a major handicap for the efficiency of solar panels installed on building facades, since the weakest link (e.g. the most shaded panel) could pull down the entire system’s power generation. And that was exactly what happened before the power optimizers were installed on each panel. “Even if each panel has a different level of sun exposure and consequently generates a different amount of energy, the optimizers draw on the instantaneous maximum power generation of each panel, regardless of how much sunlight they do – or don’t – receive,” says Victor Saadé, an EPFL electrical engineering student who is leading the project group responsible for solar panels.\nAchieving energy independence\n Thanks to this novel way of using existing technology, NeighborHub can run entirely on the power generated from its facade-installed solar panels. It even generates more energy than it needs. What’s more, its rooftop remains free for other purposes, like promoting biodiversity – the space can be used to cultivate a variety of plants.\nThe energy independence achieved by the one-story house offers encouraging prospects for residential buildings. Each story could generate enough power for its own needs. That could be a major benefit for cities that are growing vertically.\n“Our house demonstrates that it is possible to produce enough energy for an entire building using solar panels installed only on the building facades,” says Cuony.\nNeighborHub’s open house next Saturday will give the public a unique opportunity to check out the next-generation house before it heads off to the Solar Decathlon competition, which will be held in Denver from 5 to 15 October 2017.\nNeighborHub open house at a glance\n “\nNeighborHub ready to head off to the United States\n”\n Saturday, 10 June 2017, 10am to 5pm\n Smart Living Lab, Halle bleue, blueFACTORY, Passage du Cardinal 13B, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland\n Free of charge, no sign-up required\n Learn more at\nThe project is supported by the following partners:\nThree public-sector partners: Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Canton of Fribourg, City of Fribourg and Smart Living Lab\nAnd the following private partners: Groupe E and Landolt & Cie SA, JPF-Ducret, Régent SA, La Mobilière and Setimac", "summary": "EPFL, in association with the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design and the University of Fribourg, is taking part in the 2017 international Solar Decathlon competition.

Several programming courses offered at EPFL have been totally transformed thanks to Jamila Sam and Jean-Cédric Chappelier. In recognition of their exemplary contribution in the field of teaching at EPFL, the pair will receive the \nCredit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.\nFor the past two years, their students have been experiencing a new style of teaching delivered over the internet in the form of videos, tutorials and quizzes that they can do at their own pace. When they do go to class, it is not to learn new material but to take what was presented online into further detail. This concept of ‘flipped classroom’ requires a considerable investment on the part of the instructor. This is the method Jamila Sam and Jean-Cédric Chappelier used to create four MOOCs – online courses that they customize, which take weeks of preparation and filming. Making these courses fit the traditional curriculum is a real pedagogical feat for the pair, who have been working together for the past 15 years in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences.\nImproved performance\nThe results of these novel courses speak for themselves. Because they are actively involved in learning, students are more motivated and do better on exams – and this is particularly true of students who were struggling. For example, 16% more students received a passing grade during an exam given in 2014 compared to the same exam in 2007.\nThe success of this new approach is largely thanks to Jamila Sam and Jean-Cédric Chappelier's passion for their work and the enjoyment they derive from passing along their knowledge. Both instructors believe that working together helps sharpen their teaching. “We are able to criticize and inspire each other’s work as we strive to develop new methods,” said Jamila Sam.\nThe two instructors have also created a new course, “Computers, calculations and communications,” meant for all first-year students.

{"id": 257, "text": "Soon all it will take is a single step for manufacturers to set the properties of construction materials during preparation and improve their properties once hardened. Nanogence, an EPFL spin-off, has developed a lone additive that stands to replace the plethora of additives currently used to obtain an ideal concrete, mortar or cement. It can even prevent reinforcing bars from deteriorating, thereby extending the lifetimes of buildings. A magic potion? Almost.\nSimplifying concrete preparation\nTo the uninitiated, concrete seems to be both singular and immutable. So pedestrian that you’d think it’s fairly straightforward with no hidden secrets. But in reality, making it requires juggling a slew of parameters that can differ not only from one company to the next, but also from one batch to the next. For instance, clinker, the basic ingredient in concrete, can vary depending on the natural surroundings of the rock it’s produced from. The temperature to which clinker should be heated can also vary, as can the residence time inside a kiln, cooling conditions, and cement-mixture composition.\nManufacturers tailor the cement they make to the building it’s intended for and the journey it will take to get there. “For example, if it’ll be used for a building in the middle of a large city, it needs to harden slowly so that builders can still work with it despite the time it will take to get it to the construction site,” said Kumar Abhishek, CEO of Nanogence. That means cement is typically enhanced with varying amounts of different additives until the ideal texture is found. The lone additive developed by the spin-off thus constitutes a mini-revolution for the industry. Manufacturers will just need to tweak the proportion to get the right consistency.\nBecause the additive is inorganic – that is, carbon-free – it also eliminates the porosity problem that leads to carbonatation and deterioration of the concrete. This problem stems from the carbon links and the moisture that can seep into the tiny cracks between the metallic structures that reinforce the building and the debris in the cement. But Kumar’s inorganic compound can get rid of that problem, thereby making buildings last longer.\nThe additive also boosts the hardness of construction materials. That means builders can make thinner walls, thus using less concrete. The ensuing savings are significant, given that concrete accounts for 5–10% of carbon emissions but is still one of the world’s cheapest and most widely-used construction materials.\nThe secret: a thesis on concrete’s nanoscopic structure\nSo how does this “miracle” additive work? The basic idea behind the new process came from the in-depth knowledge of concrete’s nanoscopic structure that Kumar acquired during his thesis. He then used nanotechnologies to develop chemical substances that can improve concrete’s properties. The recipes of those substances must, of course, remain secret.\nThis summer – two patents later – Kumar launched his startup. He’s currently in talks with two major European concrete producers and has kicked off production of a compound specifically for white concrete. This niche market is particularly targeted to high-end interior decoration. But Kumar doesn’t intend to rest on his laurels. He is also developing an additive that can improve concrete’s thermal insulation. “The idea is to eventually develop prefabricated elements that combine longevity with good thermal insulation,” said Kumar, who takes a big-picture view. “Over 40% of energy worldwide is used for construction. Rethinking construction materials will hopefully enable us to reduce this usage.”\nNanogence has won startup awards from the European Venture Program (EVP) and the Academia-Industry Training program sponsored by EPFL, Swissnex, and Venture Lab. It has also received an Innogrant and an Enable grant (an EPFL program to help laboratory researchers get new products quickly to market).", "summary": "Whether it’s for drying time, hardness, or uniformity, a new additive developed at EPFL can give concrete, mortar, and cement the desired consistency, all in one shot.

The results are .\nA hard drive functions as a data storage device in a computer, where a large amount of data can be stored with an electromagnetically charged surface.\nNowadays, the demand for high capacity hard drives has increased more than ever. Computer users handle large files, databases, image or video files, using software, all of which require a large amount of memory in order to save and process the data as quickly as possible.\nThe EPFL scientists used a halide perovskite/oxide perovskite heterostructure in their new method for reversible, light-induced tuning of ferromagnetism at room temperature. Having a perovskite structure represents a novel class of light-absorbing materials.\nAs reported in the publication,\n“The rise of digitalization led to an exponential increase in demand for data storage. Mass-storage is resolved by hard-disk drives, HDDs, due to their relatively long lifespan and low price. HDDs use magnetic domains, which are rotated to store and retrieve information. However, an increase in capacity and speed is continuously demanded. We report a method to facilitate the writing of magnetic bits optically. We use a sandwich of a highly light sensitive (MAPbI\n3\n) and a ferromagnetic material (LSMO), where illumination of MAPbI\n3\n drives charge carriers into LSMO and decreases its magnetism. This is a viable alternative of the long-sought-after heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology, which would heat up the disk material during the writing process.”\nThe method is still experimental, but it may be used to build the next generation of memory-storage systems, with higher capacities and with low energy demands. The method provides a stand for the development of a new generation of magneto-optical hard drives. Forró concludes: “ We are now looking for investors who would be interested in carrying on the patent application, and for industrial partners to implement this original idea and proof of principle into a product.”", "summary": "What do you get when you place a thin film of perovkite material used in solar cells on top of a magnetic substrate?

{"id": 260, "text": "There is growing evidence that our clothing exposes us to particles and chemicals on a daily basis – and that this exposure could carry significant health risks. Scientists therefore need to better quantify this exposure so that we can develop strategies for mitigating those risks. At least that’s according to Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL’s Smart Living Lab in Fribourg, who has just published a critical review of research on this topic in Environmental Science and Technology.\n Our clothing acts as a protective barrier against physical and chemical hazards. However, it can also expose us to potentially toxic chemicals and biological particles by releasing millions of such substances every day, depending on how we use and treat the fabrics. Some substances are removed by washing, drying and storing clothing properly, while others stick around and become difficult to get rid of. \nAnalysis of 260 articles\n These potentially toxic substances include molecular compounds, abiotic particles and biotic particles (such as microbes and allergens), and can end up in our lungs. Common examples include nicotine residue from cigarette smoke, microbes from pets and hazardous compounds used in the farming, medical and manufacturing industries. Surprisingly, until now scientists have taken little interest in this issue. In the first part of his paper, Licina summaries the findings of 260 articles on the subject and identifies some serious knowledge gaps as well as specific avenues for further research. \n “We feel this issue has been understudied so far. The clothing and fabrics people wear have changed enormously over the past few years – today our clothes contain synthetic materials with antimicrobial, anti-UV, stain-repellent and water-repellent additives – but nobody can say whether these new materials expose us to more chemicals and particles than natural fibers,” says Licina. \nA significant impact \n He suggests requiring that all clothing include a label indicating not just what materials it is made from, but also what substances were used in the fabrication process – much like the ingredient and nutrition-information labels that are required on food. “Today there are no laws or regulations addressing this issue,” says Licina. In short, we know that clothing can have a significant impact on our daily exposure to particles and chemicals, through the air we breathe and the contact with our skin, but we don’t what the full ramifications are in terms of public health. \n Dusan Licina has been writing articles on this subject for several years. While he was performing research in the US (from 2016 to 2018), he spent a year continually monitoring indoor air quality at a neonatal intensive-care unit. He measured how particles are transported inside the unit and even to babies’ incubators. Licina found that when nurses entered the unit, the air-particle concentration increased by a factor of 2.5, and that some of those particles could be traced directly to the shirts that nurses wore during their commute to the hospital. These particles could feasibly play a major role in the development of the babies’ immune systems. But, once again, more research is needed.\nNon-smokers exposed\n Similar studies carried out on clothing worn in other settings revealed significant traces of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides – compounds that could be absorbed by fabrics in one place and released in another. “Research has already shown that an individual’s clothing can carry potentially toxic particles that can expose people nearby. For example, scientists have found that non-smokers who sit next to smokers with nicotine particles on their clothing have traces of nicotine in their blood and urine later on,\" says Licina. “What’s more, the particle concentrations that people are thus exposed to from clothing are substantial when compared with total exposure estimates in health effect studies. However, what’s missing are data on how that exposure affects us on a day-to-day basis.” \n To fill in those gaps, Licina calls on biologists and chemists to work closely with environmental engineers, in the interests of public health. He also suggests that until further research is conducted and better clothing-information regulations are adopted, consumers pay more attention to how their clothes are made and wash them regularly using gentle, all-natural detergents.", "summary": "Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at the Smart Living Lab, EPFL Fribourg, has taken a critical look at how much we really know about our exposure to particles and chemicals transported by our clothing.

Place it at a certain angle between a white wall and a light source, and a clear, coherent image appears of the face of Alan Turing, the famous British mathematician and father of modern computer science.\nThere’s no magic here; the only thing at work is the relief on the plaque’s surface and a natural optical phenomenon known as a “caustic,” which researchers in EPFL’s Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory have succeeded in bending to their will. Their research was presented recently at the Advances in Architectural Geometry Conference in Paris. A public demonstration will also be held November 16-17 at EPFL as part of the Alan Turing days, an event celebrating the 100th birthday of the famous scientist.\n“With the technique that we’ve developed, we can compose any image we want, from a simple form such as a star to complex representations such as faces or landscapes,” explains EPFL professor Mark Pauly, head of the laboratory, who conducted the study with four other scientists*.\nThis “caustic” effect is well known and easy to observe; a bit of sunlight shining on a pool of water produces patterns that dance on the surrounding tiles or walls. These undulating lines, apparently random, are generated by light that hits the moving surface of a pool or puddle. This effect, which is very mobile and dynamic in liquid, produces static patterns with solid transparent materials such as glass or transparent acrylic (better known as Plexiglass).\nDeviated trajectories\nScientifically, this phenomenon can be explained by light refraction. When light rays hit a transparent surface, they continue their trajectory but are bent as a function of the surface geometry and optical properties of the material. The light passing through is thus not uniformly distributed. It gets concentrated in certain points, forming some zones that are more intense and others that are more shaded.\nPauly and his colleagues studied the principles of this distribution, and were able to identify the curves and undulations they would need to give to the surface in order to direct the beams of light to a desired area. They then developed an algorithm, to calculate the trajectories very precisely and thus form a specific image.\nOne of the most interesting and eagerly awaited applications of this method is in architecture. It could be applied to display cases, windows, fountains, and ornamentations on museums and monuments. In design it could be used for decorating glasses, vases, carafes, jewelry and many other objects. It has considerable potential in other, more technical applications as well, such as automobile headlights and projectors.\n*Thomas Kiser (EPFL), Michael Eigensatz (Evolute), Minh Man Nguyen (WAO) and Philippe Bompas.", "summary": "When beams of light hit a pool of water or a glass object, they produce beautiful, seemingly random patterns on surrounding surfaces.

{"id": 263, "text": "The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.\nThey realized that one building in particular – the Saint-François parking lot – was at the core of the problem. This building links the city center with the Flon neighborhood, meaning that it could play a strategic role in turning downtown Lausanne car-free. So they decided to expand and completely transform it. “Our building holds a restaurant, a co-op market with local products, and a hotel that offers medium-term accommodations such as for artists, conference-goers and businesspeople,” says Flavien Davin. “There would also be common spaces and a co-working area to promote interaction between these groups.”\nThe students also added a public staircase along the side of the building. “We felt that this ‘patchwork building’ deserved an important role, as it sits above one of Lausanne’s public transport hubs,” says Bernard Valette, co-author of the study. “Currently, people who use the parking lot do not have direct access to the various means of public transport beneath the building. Our aim was to better coordinate the building’s different purposes.”\nPedestrian zone and distribution depots\nTheir project also encompasses the Flon train station, which is the third largest in French-speaking Switzerland in terms of passenger numbers. “Our vision was to transform the downtown area, between the Flon neighborhood and Saint-François, into a huge pedestrian zone. That would require expanding the public transport system and totally redesigning the city’s logistics,” says Valette. The students’ project takes into account the future M3 metro line, which will strengthen the link between the north and south of the city, as well as the future tram line that will connect the western side of the city to its center. They would add yet another tramline, between Morges and Lutry, in order to relieve throughtraffic south of the city.\nMaintaining the flow of goods to stores and residents in a car-free city center would require some radical thinking. For this, the students designed three major ‘automated distribution depots’ in the city through which all goods headed for downtown stores and residents would pass. These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.\nAccording to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.\nChanges ahead \nIs all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”\nSolving two problems at once\nThe students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”", "summary": "A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035.

{"id": 264, "text": "Like humans, cells of the same species each have a distinct “personality.” When confronted with an external stimulus like a virus, they each secrete a different quantity of molecules and communicate with each other to a varying degree. Studies have already shown that two cells of the same type may not behave identically when subjected to the same treatment.\nIn their quest to learn more, researchers from EPFL, working in collaboration with RMIT University in Australia and the University of Lausanne, have come up with an optofluidic device that has a tiny chamber inside. The chamber is around one one-thousandth the size of a raindrop. A cell is placed in the chamber, and then researchers can observe it in real time without disrupting its environment. The quantity and type of the cell’s chemical secretions can be monitored continuously. The device has been shown to work for 12 hours straight but could function much longer, offering researchers a powerful and innovative selection tool. The results have been published in \nSmall\n.\nStudying cells one by one\n All cells function in their own complex way. Cancer cells, for example, produce various hormones and proteins in order to spread and to invade healthy tissue; immune cells respond to an infection or an intruder by secreting chemical mediators called cytokines that stimulate the immune system to fight the enemy. But what is the actual mechanism underlying each cell's behavior?\n Numerous studies have been run on how groups of cells function, but we have precious little information on the behavior of individual cells. Compatible with traditional microscopes, the integrated and miniaturized device developed by the EPFL researchers offers a new way to gain insight into cell processes and communication. It also sets the stage for the development of new therapies to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. “We could, for example, select the most effective immune cells to combat a given disease,” says Hatice Altug, a co-author of the study and head of the Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory at EPFL's School of Engineering.\nCells individually housed, fed and analyzed\n The nanophotonic biosensor developed by the researchers is a glass slide coated with a thin gold film, perforated with billions of nanopores arranged in a precise pattern. A small chamber whose walls are made of porous membranes is placed above the slide. The chamber receives a steady flow of water and nutrients through tiny microfluidic channels. Temperature and humidity are carefully regulated. The device contains valves that let scientists insert a cell into the chamber, in which ligands or antibodies are positioned to recognize and capture specific molecules secreted by the cell.\nA broadband light source shines on the chamber. Thanks to an optical phenomenon called plasmons, the nanopores let only one light-wave frequency or color through. When a cell secretes a molecule, it attaches to the antibodies, thereby changing the frequency transmitted by the nanopores. This is how minutes of specific molecules can be identified.\nThe researchers have used their new technique to study cytokine secretion levels in lymphoma cells. “Until now, the methods used to study individual cells have always required fluorophores,” says Altug. “Yet these compounds interfere with the cells’ functioning and make real-time studies impossible.” Maria Soler, the study’s co-lead author, adds: “In our device, each nanopore is a separate sensor. Cells can thus settle naturally anywhere in the chamber, and we can analyze them the same way.”\nThere are numerous potential applications. “Our approach could be used to identify the most aggressive cancer cells in a tumor and decide exactly which treatment to administer to the patient,” concludes Xiaokang Li, the study’s co-lead author.\n / EPFL\nIntegrated Photonics and Application Center /  University\n / University of Lausanne", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed an innovative label-free method for studying the behavior of single cells continuously and in real time.

{"id": 265, "text": "The apps created by Uber and its competitors put peers in touch with each other when one of them is looking for a ride. But the online platforms these companies have developed also collect users’ personal data – from passengers and drivers alike. Multiplied by millions of users each day, that comes out to be a goldmine of information, especially in the era of Big Data. Researchers from EPFL and the Faculty of Business and Economics at UNIL looked at how the same level of service could be achieved without disclosing users’ personal data. Their software, called  (O for oblivious), can be used to set up a ride where only the driver and passenger know the starting point, route and destination.\n“Ride-hailing apps like Uber have created a lot of buzz and controversy. But the issue of data protection has been less discussed,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, a professor at EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences. Some data security concerns have already been reported in the press, such as a flaw that revealed data about hundreds of drivers and – even worse – a threat by a Uber executive to dig up dirt on unfriendly journalists. The members of the project team, who are all experts on data protection, could not pass up the challenge of seeing whether it would be technically possible to keep personal data confidential in ride-hailing platforms. They will present the results of their research at two conferences in North America this summer.\nStill convenient and fast\nORide uses a cryptographic system similar to homomorphic encryption. It can carry out operations on encrypted data and get the same result as if the data was not encrypted. For example, it can add an encrypted 2 + 2 to get an encrypted 4. So when someone uses ORide to search for a driver, the system will receive encrypted location data about the passenger and the drivers who are available. It will then identify the closest drivers, and – still using encrypted data – let the passenger select a driver. Once the two app users are matched up, ORide will display the location of each one on the other’s smartphone.\nThe route that the driver takes is also coded in the users’ smartphones. The only data seen by the ride-hailing company is the distance travelled and the cost of the ride, since this information is what the company will use to take its cut of the fee and what passengers will use as a record of their travel expense. What’s more, ORide doesn’t affect the app’s convenience – passengers can still pay with their credit cards and evaluate their drivers. “Our protocol was designed not to provide complete anonymity, but to make it very hard to track the passengers’ and the drivers’ movements,” says Hubaux. The researchers also realized that their system needs to allow passengers to hunt down a lost item or provide evidence in case of a dispute with a driver. In the event of such a dispute, the data can be re-identified, but only with the agreement of the party making the complaint.\nConfidentiality: a selling point\nThe project team tested their system using public data on New York taxi drivers. They wanted to make sure in particular that the encryption protocol doesn’t slow down the process of searching for a driver. New York – whose population is roughly the same size as Switzerland’s – has just as many Uber and Lyft drivers as taxi drivers. “The encryption with a high-security key adds just a few milliseconds to the search time and doesn’t require a faster internet connection,” says Hubaux. “On the downside, ORide won’t necessarily find the closest driver, which means passengers could have to wait one or two extra minutes.”\nUber and its rivals are now free to decide whether they’re interested – especially since the researchers purposely chose not to patent their technology. “This is a highly competitive market, and confidentiality could be a selling point or a way to avoid a legal battle if a firm has to share the data it has access to with the secret services,” adds Hubaux.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping their personal data secret.", "claim": "Researchers from EPFL and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping their personal data secret.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 266, "text": "Is there life on a distant planet? One way astronomers are trying to find out is by analyzing the light that is scattered off a planet’s atmosphere. Some of that light, which originates from the stars it orbits, has interacted with its atmosphere, and provides important clues to the gases it contains. If gases like oxygen, methane or ozone are detected, that could indicate the presence of living organisms. Such gases are known as biosignatures. A team of scientists from EPFL and Tor Vergata University of Rome has developed a statistical model that can help astronomers interpret the results of the search for these “signs of life”. Their research has just been published in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nSince the first exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun – was discovered 25 years ago, over 4,300 more have been identified. And the list is still growing: a new one is discovered every two or three days. Around 200 of the exoplanets found so far are telluric, meaning they consist mainly of rocks, like the Earth. While that’s not the only requirement for a planet to be able to host life – it also needs to have water and be a certain distance from its sun – it is one criterion that astronomers are using to focus their search.\nIn the coming years, the use of gas spectroscopy to detect biosignatures in planets’ atmospheres will become an increasingly important element of astronomy. Many research programs are already under way in this area, such as for the CHEOPS exoplanet-hunting satellite, which went into orbit in December 2019, and the James-Webb optical telescope, scheduled to be launched in October 2021.\nStarting with an unknown\nWhile much progress has been made on detecting exoplanetary biosignatures, several question marks remain. What are the implications of this kind of research? And how should we interpret the results? What if just one biosignature is detected on a planet? Or what if no biosignatures are detected – what should we conclude? Those kinds of questions are what the EPFL-Tor Vergata scientists set out to answer with their new model.\nTheir work tackles the problem from a new angle. Traditionally, astronomers have looked for life on another planet based on what we know about life and biological evolution on Earth. But with their new method, the scientists started with an unknown: how many other planets in our galaxy have some form of life. Their model incorporates factors like the estimated number of other stars in the galaxy similar to the Sun and how many telluric planets might be orbiting within a habitable distance from those stars. It uses Bayesian statistics – particularly well suited to small sample sizes – to calculate the probability of life in our galaxy based on how many biosignatures are detected: one, several or none at all.\n“Intuitively it makes sense that if we find life on one other planet, there are probably many others in the galaxy with some type of living organism. But how many?” says Amedeo Balbi, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics in Tor Vergata’s Physics Department. “Our model turns that intuitive assumption into a statistical calculation, and lets us determine exactly what the numbers mean in terms of quantity and frequency.”\n“Astronomers already use various assumptions to evaluate how credible life is on a given planet,” says Claudio Grimaldi, a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPMC) who is also affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Rome. “One of our research goals was thus to develop a method for weighing and comparing those assumptions in light of the new data that will be collected over the coming years.”\nSpreading from one planet to another\nGiven the small number of planets that will likely be examined in the near future, and assuming that life will emerge independently on any one planet, the EPFL-Tor Vergata study found that if even just one biosignature is detected, we can conclude with a greater than 95% probability that there are over 100,000 inhabited planets in the galaxy – more than the number of pulsars, which are objects created when a massive star explodes at the end of its life. On the other hand, if no biosignatures are detected, we cannot necessarily conclude that other forms of life do not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.\nThe scientists also looked at the theory of panspermia, which states that instead of emerging independently on a given planet, life forms could be carried over from another planet – such as through organic matter or microscopic organisms being carried on comets or spreading between neighboring planets. This implies that the probability of life on a planet also depends on how far it is from other planets and how easily various life forms – whose physical characteristics could be extremely different from those we are familiar with – are able to resist the extreme conditions of space travel and adapt to the new planet. Factoring in panspermia alters the inferred number of inhabited planets elsewhere in the galaxy.", "summary": "One way to determine whether there is life on another planet is to look for biosignatures in the light that is scattered off its atmosphere.

{"id": 267, "text": "Soon all it will take is a single step for manufacturers to set the properties of construction materials during preparation and improve their properties once hardened. Nanogence, an EPFL spin-off, has developed a lone additive that stands to replace the plethora of additives currently used to obtain an ideal concrete, mortar or cement. It can even prevent reinforcing bars from deteriorating, thereby extending the lifetimes of buildings. A magic potion? Almost.\nSimplifying concrete preparation\nTo the uninitiated, concrete seems to be both singular and immutable. So pedestrian that you’d think it’s fairly straightforward with no hidden secrets. But in reality, making it requires juggling a slew of parameters that can differ not only from one company to the next, but also from one batch to the next. For instance, clinker, the basic ingredient in concrete, can vary depending on the natural surroundings of the rock it’s produced from. The temperature to which clinker should be heated can also vary, as can the residence time inside a kiln, cooling conditions, and cement-mixture composition.\nManufacturers tailor the cement they make to the building it’s intended for and the journey it will take to get there. “For example, if it’ll be used for a building in the middle of a large city, it needs to harden slowly so that builders can still work with it despite the time it will take to get it to the construction site,” said Kumar Abhishek, CEO of Nanogence. That means cement is typically enhanced with varying amounts of different additives until the ideal texture is found. The lone additive developed by the spin-off thus constitutes a mini-revolution for the industry. Manufacturers will just need to tweak the proportion to get the right consistency.\nBecause the additive is inorganic – that is, carbon-free – it also eliminates the porosity problem that leads to carbonatation and deterioration of the concrete. This problem stems from the carbon links and the moisture that can seep into the tiny cracks between the metallic structures that reinforce the building and the debris in the cement. But Kumar’s inorganic compound can get rid of that problem, thereby making buildings last longer.\nThe additive also boosts the hardness of construction materials. That means builders can make thinner walls, thus using less concrete. The ensuing savings are significant, given that concrete accounts for 5–10% of carbon emissions but is still one of the world’s cheapest and most widely-used construction materials.\nThe secret: a thesis on concrete’s nanoscopic structure\nSo how does this “miracle” additive work? The basic idea behind the new process came from the in-depth knowledge of concrete’s nanoscopic structure that Kumar acquired during his thesis. He then used nanotechnologies to develop chemical substances that can improve concrete’s properties. The recipes of those substances must, of course, remain secret.\nThis summer – two patents later – Kumar launched his startup. He’s currently in talks with two major European concrete producers and has kicked off production of a compound specifically for white concrete. This niche market is particularly targeted to high-end interior decoration. But Kumar doesn’t intend to rest on his laurels. He is also developing an additive that can improve concrete’s thermal insulation. “The idea is to eventually develop prefabricated elements that combine longevity with good thermal insulation,” said Kumar, who takes a big-picture view. “Over 40% of energy worldwide is used for construction. Rethinking construction materials will hopefully enable us to reduce this usage.”\nNanogence has won startup awards from the European Venture Program (EVP) and the Academia-Industry Training program sponsored by EPFL, Swissnex, and Venture Lab. It has also received an Innogrant and an Enable grant (an EPFL program to help laboratory researchers get new products quickly to market).", "summary": "Whether it’s for drying time, hardness, or uniformity, a new additive developed at EPFL can give concrete, mortar, and cement the desired consistency, all in one shot.

{"id": 269, "text": "Do you speak Scala? Many big companies active on the Web now reply in the affirmative. Twitter, Foursquare , LinkedIn and the internet site of the British newspaper The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) have adopted this programming language, developed at EPFL by Martin Odersky, Professor in the computer science section of the school.\nLast week, its creator announced the launch of a new company, with its offices at the Science Park at Ecublens. It’s called Typesafe, has just raised three million dollars, and will give a serious boost to the Scala language. The main investor in this round of financing – Greylock, based in Boston and in Silicon Valley – is not just any old investor. The company supported Facebook at the time when the social networking site was opening to a mass audience, and had also invested in LinkedIn, from 2004.\nScala is becoming more and more popular with programmers, especially for internet applications. But what’s behind this success? “This language is concise, and enables reductions of on average 50% of the lines of code”, Martin Odersky begins by explaining. What’s more, being very close to Java and completely compatible, it’s very easy to adopt for programmers who are familiar with Java, which has become a true standard on the Internet. Finally, it’s open source, which means that the people who contribute to its development exist in their hundreds, spread across the whole world – although EPFL remains the owner of the copyright.\nLeveraging the multiplication of “cores”\n One of the strengths of Scala is to combine two approaches that are popular in the programming world. One is “object-oriented” – which has always up to now been preferred by industry – and the other “functional programming”, which has been used mainly in academia. The advantage of the latter is that it’s very efficient when it comes to distribute tasks to several processors working in parallel. “Today, progress in IT is exemplified by the multiplication of the number of ‘cores’ in the processors, and no longer in terms of increases in speed”, explains the Professor. “Creating new applications that take advantage of this aspect of the processors is a natural development in programming.” Another advantage is that this approach is perfectly suited to distributed computing, or “cloud computing”, which is becoming more popular with big companies that are active on the Internet. This approach –concentrating on the distribution of tasks to multiple processors – gives Scala its name (from “scaling”).\nWith his new company, Martin Odersky is paving the way for the future of computing. Typesafe provides free-of-charge downloading of a pack of software including Scala, a development tool, and also the Akka platform, created in Sweden, whose inventor Jonas Bonér is also a co-founder of Typesafe. Complementary to Scala, Akka is a middleware designed for the distribution of tasks in large computing centers.\nIn parallel, Typesafe is putting in place a technical support service for its clients. “From around 15 employees today, our team will increase to 25 by the end of the year”, continues Martin Odersky. Most of the employees are developers, working in the EPFL Science Park, Cambridge, Boston – where the company is headquarted – and Uppsala. In just over a couple of weeks, Typesafe will be in the limelight during the second annual « Scala days » event – a meeting of programmers – whose initial occurrence last year at EPFL attracted many specialists.\nTypesafe should thus give a real boost to the Scala language. With a smile on his lips, Martin Odersky expresses his confidence that the “really big players” in this domain will soon be joining in. But as for their names, we’ll just have to be patient . . .", "summary": "Thanks to the raising of three million dollars, Martin Odersky has just created the company Typesafe.

{"id": 270, "text": "How can we constantly monitor the stability of a bridge or detect a leak in a gas pipeline in real time? A method based on optical fibers has become the norm in recent years. By carefully measuring the path of light in fibers up to 100 kilometers long, we can glean information on the temperature, pressure and intensity of magnetic fields along the entire length of the fiber. It’s similar to a nerve, which tells us the intensity and location of a stimulus.\nBut this method is nearing its limits. Depending on the planned use, it’s necessary to sacrifice length, accept a lower resolution or add more equipment – a costly undertaking.\nOne hair, a million measurements\nThanks to the work done by EPFL’s Group for Fibre Optics (GFO), it will now be possible to maintain an extremely fine resolution even when the fiber gets longer. “We have no trouble getting a million measurement points from one optical fiber the width of a hair, for a resolution of one centimeter over 10 kilometers,” said Luc Thévenaz, the director of GFO. That’s 100 times more precise than current techniques.\nMeasurements made with this type of instrument have to be processed, because they include ‘parasites’. But the ratio between useful signals and noise cannot go below a certain threshold, otherwise the measurements will not be reliable.\nGraphic arts to the rescue\nThe EPFL researchers were able to boost this ratio significantly by borrowing a technology from an entirely different field: graphic arts. “The values collected from these measurement points on the fiber can be represented as a matrix of pixels – a two-dimensional image,” said Dr. Thévenaz. \"By applying standard graphic filters to this image, like those found in Photoshop, we were able to reduce the noise inherent in this measurement technique very effectively and identify the desired values more precisely.”\nPursuing this logic further, his teams also transformed more complex measurements, which take into account several parameters simultaneously, into video sequences. Here again, the magic of ‘standard’ video filters was at work.\nIn Dr. Thévenaz’s view, these advances, which are described in articles appearing in \nLight: Science & Applications – Nature\n and \nNature Communications\n, bring the field of distributed optical fiber sensors into a new era simply by using software techniques.

This area has large international teams of researchers, dedicated to the economic and industrial development of the region. How best to take advantage of this unique opportunity and offer researchers a place to work, while increasing the visibility of this promising scientific momentum? It is in response to these global issues that NEUROPOLIS was conceived. The project meets a major challenge of the 21st century: understanding the human brain while creating a unique space in which researchers can interact with the public.\nOne Project, Two Sites\n To achieve this, the NEUROPOLIS project will construct two entities:\n —A research infrastructure in Lausanne constructed on the grounds of the institutions of higher learning, UNIL-EPFL. This spot will also have a public space dedicated to the brain;\n —A Geneva-located infrastructure near the University Hospital will house a new Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging. \n The construction of these two sites is estimated to cost 110 million Swiss Francs. They would be able to accommodate as many as 1,000 scientific and technological collaborators.\nPublic-Private Partnership (Canton of Vaud :: Swiss Confederation :: Rolex)\n The realization of this ambition wouldn’t have seen the light of day without the outstanding contribution of several actors from both the public and private sectors. The Canton of Vaud provided an essential piece in the foundation of this project through a financial contribution of 35 million Swiss Francs for the construction of the building in Lausanne – and if necessary, offering a site on the university campus. Neuropolis will be launched thanks to the renewed support of the Rolex Group. The brand seeks to encourage research and a pioneering spirit in a leading sector that concerns all of humanity. “A strong historical connection exists between Rolex and EPFL, with the Rolex Learning Center as one of the most iconic examples of that relationship. With NEUROPOLIS, Rolex reiterates its strong sense of social responsibility on the local and global levels, and is pleased to assist in a world-class project that represents a fundamental advance in the field of neuroscience. The participation of Rolex in such a visionary project, such a decisive human and scientific adventure, echoes the brand’s perpetual quest for innovation and excellence,” said Bertrand Gros, President of Rolex, SA.\n The Swiss Confederation and EPFL, through both their usual building program and a private funding campaign, will be responsible for the remainder of the investment.\nLausanne – The Nerve Center of the Blue Brain (EPFL) and the Human Brain Project (EU)\n NEUROPOLIS hosts the simulation platform of the Blue Brain Project and will manage the supercomputer’s resources remotely. The platform will host the huge databases necessary for neuroscience and other fields, as well as the simulation cockpit coordinated by teams of computer scientists and neuroscientists. Scientists worldwide will be able to use the computing power and software developed there; laboratories and workspaces for top international visitors will be installed. If selected by the European Union, the center will also host the “flagship” Human Brain Project (EU), a project that now has about 120 teams in 90 scientific institutions from 22 countries, including those in the partner hospital CHUV in Lausanne. The application has been submitted for a decision expected in early 2013.\nLausanne – A Bridge Between Science and the Public\n NEUROPOLIS is also for the general public. For the first time in Europe, an open and interactive space will be dedicated to neuroscience and the conquest of the brain. The Center for Scientific Simulation will provide the entertainment and the multiple mechanisms of thought will be illuminated there for everyone to enjoy and discover.\nLausanne – A New Research Platform with UNIL\n UNIL has begun refocusing its campus toward skills of basic neuroscience and is already home to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). NEUROPOLIS will help accelerate the development strategy of simulation-based science, such as evolutionary biology and oncology, and continue the trajectory of Computational Science (involving significant resources for integrating large amounts of data) in other fields which require the prediction and analysis of interactions between many sub-systems: environmental and earth sciences (continental drift or natural disasters), economics, as well as finance and the human and social sciences.\nGeneva – A New Institute of Molecular Imaging (UNIGE)\n Taking advantage of the expertise developed in the Geneva area and of existing infrastructure in the field of Neuroscience, The University of Geneva and the Canton Hospital, in collaboration with EPFL, will construct an Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging in Geneva. These activities, involving several parallel imaging techniques and built-in analysis, will focus on neuro-imaging, chronic diseases, neurological degeneration, and aging. The new institute is part of Geneva’s development plan of Translational Molecular Imaging, which will be articulated around four axes: animal imaging, nanotechnology, radiation chemistry, and modeling.

{"id": 272, "text": "Even though silicon is one of the most abundant elements, the energy required to make silicon from sand is immense. It is for this reason, but also to reduce manufacturing costs, that Professor Christophe Ballif and his team from the Photovoltaics and Thin-Film Electronics Laboratory at the EPFL have been working for several years on thin-film silicon solar cells that are a thousand times thinner than conventional cells.\nThere’s just one catch: the thinner the cells, the less they absorb the rays of the sun and the less electricity they produce. So researchers are trying to trap light in the thin silicon layers to increase their absorption. Traditionally, thin layers of zinc oxide—a material that is very abundant, completely non-toxic, and that grows in the form of small pyramid-shaped crystals—are used for this purpose. These crystals scatter light efficiently into the underlying silicon layer. With such zinc oxide layers, even a new world record cell efficiency was achieved.\nReducing costs\nBut scientists are attempting to beat this record. “It is difficult to modify the natural pyramidal shape of these crystals in order to obtain even better light scattering,” explains researcher Corsin Battaglia, “so we had the idea to force the crystals to grow on a different support, an inverted mould with the desired structure.” The idea is as ingenious as it is simple. Once the thin layer of zinc oxide is deposited on the mould all that needs to be done is to “demould” it—as you would a tarte tatin, for example—to obtain a film with the desired structure.\nThis procedure, described in the September edition of the journal Nature Photonics, not only increases the amount of light that is trapped, thereby increasing output, but it also has the potential to reduce the cost of the cells because of its compatibility with mass production. These are interesting arguments at a time when photovoltaics is seeking to produce electricity at a lower price than the current grid price.", "summary": "Do better with less.

Inset shows a scanning electron micrograph of the drum. The top membrane of the drum is suspended only 50nm (1/2000th of the diameter of hair) above a metal plate. This is then used to manipulate and amplify microwaves in the quantum regime. Credit: N. R. Bernier ​​ and L. D. Tóth (EPFL).​\nIn a recent experiment at EPFL, a microwave resonator, a circuit that supports electric signals oscillating at a resonance frequency, is coupled to the vibrations of a metallic micro-drum. By actively cooling the mechanical motion close to the lowest energy allowed by quantum mechanics, the micro-drum can be turned into a quantum reservoir – an environment that can shape the states of the microwaves. The findings are published as an  in \nNature Physics\n.\nLászló Dániel Tóth, Nathan Bernier, and Dr Alexey Feofanov led the research effort in , with support from Dr Andreas Nunnenkamp, a theorist at the University of Cambridge, UK.\nMicrowaves are electromagnetic waves, just like visible light, but with a frequency that is four orders of magnitude smaller. Microwaves form the backbone of several everyday technologies, from microwave ovens and cellular phones to satellite communication, and have recently gained further importance in manipulating quantum information in superconducting circuits — one of the most promising candidates to realize future quantum computers.\nThe micro-drum, only 30 microns in diameter, 100 nanometers thick and fabricated in the Center of MicroNanotechnology (CMi) at EPFL, constitutes the top plate of a capacitor in a superconducting microwave resonator. The drum’s position modulates the resonator’s resonance frequency and, conversely, a voltage across the capacitor exerts a force on the micro-drum. Through this bidirectional interaction, energy can be exchanged between mechanical vibrations and the microwave oscillations in the superconducting circuit.\nIn the experiment, the micro-drum is first cooled close to its lowest energy quantum level by a suitably tuned microwave tone. Every microwave photon (a quantum of light) carries away the energy of a phonon (a quantum of mechanical motion) such that the mechanical energy is reduced. This cooling process increases the dissipation and turns the micro-drum into a dissipative reservoir for the microwave resonator.\nBy tuning the interactions between the cavity and the cooled micro-drum, which is now an environment for the microwaves, the cavity can be turned into a microwave amplifier. The most interesting aspect of this amplification process is the added noise, that is, how much random, unwanted fluctuations are added to the amplified signal.\nAlbeit counter-intuitive, quantum mechanics dictates that this added noise cannot be suppressed completely, even in principle. The amplifier realized in the EPFL experiment operates very close to this limit, therefore it is as “quiet” as it can be. Interestingly, in a different regime, the micro-drum turns the microwave resonator into a maser (or microwave laser).\n“There has been a lot of research focus on bringing mechanical oscillators into the quantum regime in the past few years.” says Dr. Alexey Feofanov, postdoctoral researcher on the project. “However, our experiment is one of the first which actually shows and harnesses their capabilities for future quantum technologies.”\nLooking ahead, this experiment enables novel phenomena in cavity optomechanical systems like noiseless microwave routing or microwave entanglement. Generally, it proves that mechanical oscillators can be a useful resource in the rapidly growing field of quantum science and engineering.\nFuture activities on the emerging research possibilities created by this work will be supported by two recently started EC Horizon 2020 projects:  and , both coordinated at EPFL.\nThe project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, NCCR QSIT, and the European Union iQUOEMS.

{"id": 276, "text": "Before new nanoparticles or other nanomedicines can be injected into the human body, a whole series of tests must be conducted in the laboratory, then in living cells, and in the end on humans. But often the results obtained\n in vitro\n do not resemble what actually happens in the animal or human body. Thus, the researchers reconsidered the basis of the \nin vitro\n experimental design.\nIn an article published in the journal \nSmall\n, EPFL researchers explain how such issues can be avoided by replacing conventional static \nin vitro\n tests with dynamic tests that approximate complex living conditions – comparable to those that occur in the body’s blood and lymphatic systems.\nThe researchers were able to “replicate” the varying real-body conditions in a lab, and test the behaviour of nanoparticles in different blood and lymph flows. They also reproduced the “cleaning” effect of nanoparticles, which go through in lymph nodes, by “washing” lymph off them and reinjecting them into the blood serum.\n“Current incubation conditions are static,” says Marijana Mionić Ebersold, a former post-doc at EPFL, leading author of the study in the framework of a Nano-Tera project and currently working as a scientific collaborator at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV). “Nanoparticles or drugs to be tested are carefully added to the typically static fluids and cells, and then there is a waiting period in static conditions before the interaction and the effects can be studied for instance under the microscope”, she adds. “In the human body, fluids and cells never stay nicely static. It’s an extremely dynamic and complex environment. The conventional static \nin vitro\n methods do not therefore allow for the translation of results from \nin vitro\n to \nin vivo\n testing.”\nReproducing the conditions in blood and lymphatic systems\n For their study, the researchers used the protein corona as the parameter which reflects this \nin \nvitro\n/\nin vivo\n discrepancy. The protein corona forms around nanoparticles when they come into contact with a biological environment. Its presence influences the behaviour of nanoparticles in the body by altering their chemical properties, destination, and their interactions with other cells.\nThe protein corona is affected by both the flow and type of fluid, i.e. blood or lymph, as the study shows. “Surprisingly, the influence of lymph on the protein corona and the fate of nanoparticles has so far been completely neglected – although subcutaneously injected nanomedicines immediately contact the patient’s lymph”, says Mionić Ebersold.\nThe study revealed that a change in both the flow and fluids is an extremely important factor when it comes to the formation of the protein corona. For example, the flow conditions would change and the protein corona would be different in a patient with different blood pressure troubles as compared to a healthy person. Nanoparticles may thus behave quite differently and in various patients and have different effects on them.\nDynamic tests would therefore be extremely useful for observing the formation of the protein corona in various \nin vitro\n environments in order to predict how the nanoparticles will ultimately behave \nin vivo\n. “When \nin vivo\n results are different to \nin vitro \nresults, scientists tend to say that they tested their nanomedicine in the wrong animal model or that the chemicals weren’t exactly the same etc.,” says Mionić Ebersold. “We think that the problem begins much earlier, with the \nin vitro \ntests that are performed at the starting point of translational nanomedicine: their static design is what often accounts for the discrepancies with the later \nin vivo \ntests.”\n-----\nSource:", "summary": "EPFL researchers propose a new approach of performing in vitro tests on nanoparticles that could enhance a correlation to in vivo results.

{"id": 277, "text": "Superfluidity refers to a state in which matter behaves like a liquid with zero viscosity. Much like superconductivity, this phenomenon occurs at extremely low temperatures and can cause a liquid like helium to behave in the strangest ways, e.g. roll up out of a container or even create a perpetual fountain. But beyond just a fascinating curiosity, superfluidity is frequently used in high-precision applications like quantum gyroscopes and even satellites that measure infrared radiation in space. With a few exceptions, superfluidity has generally been regarded as a macroscopic phenomenon, resulting from ‘bulky’ collections of particles rather than individual atoms. But in a recent \nPhysical Review Letters\n paper, EPFL researchers have now shown that, at least in liquids, superfluidity involves dynamics that go down to the nanoscale.\nThe most common superfluid element is helium-4, which is used in both research and applications like cooling down the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. With the exception of Bose-Einstein condensates – a state of matter that occurs at extremely low temperatures where particles reach their lowest energy – superfluidity has been thus far considered to be macroscopic. Consequently, helium-4 is usually employed in bulk in relevant studies, which do not take into account the contributions of individual atoms to the overall phenomenon.\nOne of the classical parameters that is used to measure superfluidity is the critical Landau velocity. This is the cut-off velocity above which the frictionless flow of the material is lost. If an object moving through a superfluid medium exceeds the Landau velocity, it generates elementary excitations in the medium called rotons, which are somewhat similar to sound waves. The creation of rotons takes up energy from the moving particle, causing it to slow down and “gain” viscosity. In the case of superfluid helium-4, an object can move through it without friction as long as its velocity stays below ~58 m/sec. But although the Landau velocity has been experimentally verified in bulk helium-4, thus confirming superfluidity, it has never been observed in small-size systems (e.g. nanodroplets), even though these are increasingly being used in superfluidity studies.\nA research team led by Marcel Drabbels has now shown that a critical Landau velocity exists in helium-4 droplets a few nanometers in diameter, down to only twenty helium-4 atoms across. The researchers designed an experiment where a single atom (e.g. silver) or molecule (e.g. nitric oxide) was introduced into helium-4 nanodroplets of various sizes (one thousand to five million helium-4 atoms). The system was then excited with a laser beam until the so-called ‘impurity’ was ejected from the droplet. The ejected particle was then ionized and projected onto a position-sensitive detector. At this point, the ion’s velocity in three-dimensional space was calculated and determined.\nThe results showed that the velocity distribution for the ‘impurities’ was consistent with a critical Landau velocity. This shows for the first time that superfluidity can arise even in finite-size systems, and creates further questions as to the fundamental properties of the phenomenon. One question that the authors pose concerns the minimum droplet size in which a critical Landau velocity can be consistently demonstrated, which is now crucial in the design of follow-up studies.\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL with the University of Amsterdam and the University of Barcelona.\nReference\nBrauer NB, Smolarek S, Loginov E, Mateo D, Hernando A, Pi M, Barranco M, Buma WJ, Drabbels M. 2013.

{"id": 278, "text": "We’ve all sat frustrated in rush-hour traffic – either in the morning on the way to work, in the evening on the way home, or both. Some try to get around the problem by leaving a little earlier or a little later. That helps balance out traffic flows and create a certain equilibrium – which many transportation engineers and economists have been studying. Their goal is to better understand the mechanisms behind this equilibrium so that large infrastructure projects can be better designed and help reduce congestion.\nLamotte’s thesis – supervised by Nikolas Geroliminis, a professor at EPFL’s Urban Transport Systems Laboratory – investigates this equilibrium and weighs up different methods for reducing traffic congestion. He shows that most city traffic follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach, but that a more efficient way to regulate traffic would be by introducing a reservation system for specific time slots.\nLamotte’s first finding is that in a multidirectional road system – which is what’s typically seen in and around cities – the drivers who have the longest commute are the ones who make the most effort to avoid rush-hour traffic. That’s because they have a greater incentive to adjust their commute times and find the optimal time for leaving work or home based on how long it will take them to arrive at their destination.\nReserved lanes\nHe also found that one measure that has proven effective for reducing traffic congestion, in Stockholm for example, is a congestion charge. “Even a relatively low charge that varies with the time of day can change people’s behavior,” says Lamotte. However, such charges are not popular and not always feasible. Adopting one in Switzerland, for example, would require a constitutional amendment.\nBased on the observation that traffic congestion results from lose-lose competition among drivers, Lamotte looked to other transportation methods for possible ideas. In air travel, passenger traffic is regulated by reservation systems that let travelers book seats until the plane is full. At that point, travelers have to take another flight. He suggests a similar system for commuter traffic using special reserved lanes. The allowed number of vehicles on the lanes would depend on the roads’ capacity, and the demand for reservations would be used to determine which segments of road to set aside for the system. Commuters who don’t want to use the system would be free to use the regular road lanes whenever they want – but they might find those lanes congested.\nGuiding public policy \n“Today such a system would be hard to implement,” says Lamotte. But he’s already looking ahead to the emergence of new modes of transport. “Car-sharing systems are becoming increasingly common, and self-driving cars are not far off. Commuters will soon start getting used to reserving a vehicle ahead of time. Then it will be just a small step to reserving a time slot as well,” he adds. He hopes his thesis will help inform policymakers’ decisions when it comes to long-term urban planning. “It’s important to be aware that this competition for commuting times bears a cost, and that intelligently designed traffic systems can help cut that cost,” says Lamotte.", "summary": "For his thesis, EPFL PhD student Raphaël Lamotte studied rush-hour traffic congestion.

This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

{"id": 281, "text": "In recent years optical fibers have served as sensors to detect changes in temperature, like a thermometer, and pressure, like an artificial nerve. This technique is particularly useful in structures such as bridges and gas pipelines.\nEPFL researchers have now come up with a new method that enables optical fibers to identify whether they are in contact with a liquid or a solid. This is achieved by simply generating a sound wave with the help from a light beam within the fiber.\nThis study was conducted by the Group for Fibre Optics (GFO) run by Luc Thévenaz within the School of Engineering and has been published in \nNature Communications\n.\nA sensor that doesn’t disturb the light\n No wider than a strand of hair, an optical fiber made of glass transmits light that varies according to four parameters: intensity, phase, polarization and wavelength. These parameters are altered when the fiber is stretched or the temperature changes, enabling the fiber to act like a sensor by detecting cracks in structures or abnormal temperatures. But up to now it was not possible to determine what was happening around the fiber without having light escape the fibre, which disrupts its path.\nThe method developed at EPFL uses a sound wave generated inside the fiber. It is a hyper-frequency wave that regularly bounces off the fiber’s walls. This echo varies at different locations depending on the material the wave comes into contact with. The echoes leave an imprint on the light that can be read when the beam exits the fiber, making it possible to map out the fiber’s surroundings. This imprint is so faint that it hardly disturbs the light propagating within the fiber. The method could be used to sense what is going on around a fiber and send light-based information at the same time.\n The researchers have already immersed their fibers in water and then in alcohol, before leaving them out in the open air. Each time, their system was capable of correctly identifying the change in the surroundings. “Our technique will make it possible to detect water leakages, as well as the density and salinity of fluids that come into contact with the fiber. There are many potential applications,” says Thévenaz.\nSpatial and temporal detection\n These changes in the surroundings are located thanks to a simple time-based method. “Each wave impulse is generated with a slight time lag. And this delay is reflected upon the beam’s arrival. If there were any disturbances along the way, we can both see what they were and determine their location,” explains Thévenaz. “For the moment, we can locate disturbances to within around ten meters, but we have the technical means to increase our accuracy to one meter.”\nThe idea of using a sound wave in optical fibers initially came from the team’s partner researchers at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

{"id": 283, "text": "There is growing evidence that our clothing exposes us to particles and chemicals on a daily basis – and that this exposure could carry significant health risks. Scientists therefore need to better quantify this exposure so that we can develop strategies for mitigating those risks. At least that’s according to Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL’s Smart Living Lab in Fribourg, who has just published a critical review of research on this topic in Environmental Science and Technology.\n Our clothing acts as a protective barrier against physical and chemical hazards. However, it can also expose us to potentially toxic chemicals and biological particles by releasing millions of such substances every day, depending on how we use and treat the fabrics. Some substances are removed by washing, drying and storing clothing properly, while others stick around and become difficult to get rid of. \nAnalysis of 260 articles\n These potentially toxic substances include molecular compounds, abiotic particles and biotic particles (such as microbes and allergens), and can end up in our lungs. Common examples include nicotine residue from cigarette smoke, microbes from pets and hazardous compounds used in the farming, medical and manufacturing industries. Surprisingly, until now scientists have taken little interest in this issue. In the first part of his paper, Licina summaries the findings of 260 articles on the subject and identifies some serious knowledge gaps as well as specific avenues for further research. \n “We feel this issue has been understudied so far. The clothing and fabrics people wear have changed enormously over the past few years – today our clothes contain synthetic materials with antimicrobial, anti-UV, stain-repellent and water-repellent additives – but nobody can say whether these new materials expose us to more chemicals and particles than natural fibers,” says Licina. \nA significant impact \n He suggests requiring that all clothing include a label indicating not just what materials it is made from, but also what substances were used in the fabrication process – much like the ingredient and nutrition-information labels that are required on food. “Today there are no laws or regulations addressing this issue,” says Licina. In short, we know that clothing can have a significant impact on our daily exposure to particles and chemicals, through the air we breathe and the contact with our skin, but we don’t what the full ramifications are in terms of public health. \n Dusan Licina has been writing articles on this subject for several years. While he was performing research in the US (from 2016 to 2018), he spent a year continually monitoring indoor air quality at a neonatal intensive-care unit. He measured how particles are transported inside the unit and even to babies’ incubators. Licina found that when nurses entered the unit, the air-particle concentration increased by a factor of 2.5, and that some of those particles could be traced directly to the shirts that nurses wore during their commute to the hospital. These particles could feasibly play a major role in the development of the babies’ immune systems. But, once again, more research is needed.\nNon-smokers exposed\n Similar studies carried out on clothing worn in other settings revealed significant traces of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides – compounds that could be absorbed by fabrics in one place and released in another. “Research has already shown that an individual’s clothing can carry potentially toxic particles that can expose people nearby. For example, scientists have found that non-smokers who sit next to smokers with nicotine particles on their clothing have traces of nicotine in their blood and urine later on,\" says Licina. “What’s more, the particle concentrations that people are thus exposed to from clothing are substantial when compared with total exposure estimates in health effect studies. However, what’s missing are data on how that exposure affects us on a day-to-day basis.” \n To fill in those gaps, Licina calls on biologists and chemists to work closely with environmental engineers, in the interests of public health. He also suggests that until further research is conducted and better clothing-information regulations are adopted, consumers pay more attention to how their clothes are made and wash them regularly using gentle, all-natural detergents.", "summary": "Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at the Smart Living Lab, EPFL Fribourg, has taken a critical look at how much we really know about our exposure to particles and chemicals transported by our clothing.

{"id": 284, "text": "Around 100,000 earthquakes are recorded worldwide every year, but not all are naturally occurring. Some of the weaker ones are triggered by human activity underground – this is referred to as induced seismicity. Researchers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Experimental Rock Mechanics (LEMR) and the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris have just completed a study into the role of fluids in the propagation of induced earthquakes in an effort to decipher the underlying mechanisms. Their findings include the extremely counterintuitive discovery that highly pressurized water in the vicinity of an earthquake tends to limit – rather than increase – its intensity. These results were published today in \nNature Communications\n.\nInduced earthquakes can be the result of activities like mining, gas and oil extraction, toxic waste or CO\n2\n storage, and the construction of tunnels and dam reservoirs. The generation of geothermal energy is another potential source of induced earthquakes – and the main one in Switzerland. According to the Swiss Seismological Service, a geothermal project near Basel caused a 3.4 magnitude earthquake in 2006, and \nGeothermal energy is captured by tapping into subterranean heat. Highly pressurized water is pumped into the earth’s crust at a depth of between two and four kilometers. The water is then recovered as steam and used to drive an electricity-producing turbine. “Injecting water can affect water-rock equilibria and disrupt nearby faults, thus triggering earthquakes in the area,” says Marie Violay, who runs LEMR.\nThis type of earthquake is a thorn in the side of geothermal proponents, notes Mateo Acosta, a PhD student at LEMR and the study’s lead author: “These earthquakes may be low in intensity, but they can cause damage and affect public opinion – to the point of derailing projects.”\nHeat absorption\nAcosta ran tests in which he sought to replicate earthquake conditions in order to study the impact of different levels of underground water pressure on fault dynamics. He focused mainly on earthquake propagation, which is when the two plates in a fault rub against each other, sending seismic waves out into the surrounding area.\n“Rock friction generates a significant amount of heat, which further fuels the propagation effect,” says the PhD student. “Some of this heat is absorbed by the water in the surrounding rock, and the amount absorbed depends to a large extent on the water’s thermodynamic parameters. What we learned from our experiments is that the closer the fluid’s initial pressure is to the critical pressure of water, the weaker the earthquake will be.”\n“This research shows that the initial fluid pressure in the rocks is crucial, especially at depths commonly reached by geothermal activities. Geothermal models need to take this into account,” says François-Xavier Passelègue, an LEMR researcher and the study’s second author.\nThe laboratory recently acquired sophisticated equipment that can be used to simulate pressure and temperature levels at a depth of 10 to 15 kilometers in the earth’s crust.

{"id": 286, "text": "Tomorroy, on February 15th, a 45-meter asteroid dubbed 2012 DA14 will draw the attention of the scientific community, since it will - even below the geosynchronous orbit that hosts thousands of satellites. Hopefully without harm, and it will soon be forgotten.\nBut for the longer-term studies, Asteroid Vesta is a kind of movie star for planetologists. With 500 km in diameter, it is one of the three largest objects of the asteroid belt that formed simultaneously to the solar system we live in, four billion years ago. It is considered a “protoplanet” or a precursor of a planet. Moreover, it is the only known asteroid to have an earth-like structure – with a core, mantle and crust.\nComputer simulation reconstructs collisions between asteroids \n Using a three-dimensional computer simulation, Martin Jutzi from the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern has now accurately reconstructed how Vesta collided with other asteroids twice over a billion years ago. The models show that the protoplanet owes its elliptical shape to these collisions and that they also scarred its surface structure. They are presented in a study published today on the front page of \nNature \nmagazine.\nThe simulations also enable detailed conclusions on the composition and properties of Vesta’s interior to be drawn for the first time, which helps us to better understand the evolution of the solar system. «Based on the sort and distribution of this material at the surface of the asteroid, we are able to precisely reconstruct the various inner layers of Vesta down to a depth of 100 km», explains Philippe Gillet, head of EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory.\nBased on this information, the computer simulations demontrarte exactly how two consecutive impacts of celestial bodies led to the formation of the observed overlapping basins, which almost span the entire southern hemisphere of Vesta. The models show the size (66 and 64 kilometres in diameter), velocity (5.4 kilometres per second) and the impact angle of the bodies that collided with Vesta. This reveals a lot about the properties of the objects that were near the protoplanet a billion years ago.\nThe final images of the simulations closely resemble the shape and topography of Vesta’s southern hemisphere as observed by the Dawn mission. The models even accurately reproduce the spiral-shaped structures inside the youngest crater which are visible on images from the Dawn mission. «This shows how reliable our method is», rejoices Jutzi. “It also proves that the method we used to determine the composition of Vesta’s inner layers are accurate, adds Gillet. The simulation does show that some of the debris were ejected from a depth of 100 kilometers.”\n«The fact that we can now look inside such protoplanets makes entirely new perspectives in the re¬search on the history of our solar system possible,» says Jutzi.", "summary": "Models boost the significance of image and measurement data from space missions and help to understand our solar system.

{"id": 287, "text": "Swarm robotics is offering innovative solutions to real-world problems by creating a new form of artificial intelligence based on insect-like instincts. Mirko Kovac, from EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, is a young robotics engineer who has already made leaps forward in the field with his grasshopper-inspired jumping robot.\nHe and his collaborators have created an innovative perching mechanism where the robot flies head first into the object, a tree for example—without being destroyed— and attaches to almost any type of surface using sharp prongs. It then detaches on command. The goal is to create robots that can travel in swarms over rough terrain to come to the aide of catastrophe victims.\n “We are not blindly imitating nature, but using the same principles to possibly improve on it,” explains Kovac, who recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL. “Simple behavioral laws such as jumping, flying and perching lead to complex control over movement without the need for high computational power.”\n Jumping, gliding and perching allow for mobility over rocky territory or destroyed urban areas. This new form of AI takes its inspiration from the insect world, but is more as an abstract reflection on their instincts and design principles than merely imitating their morphology. This simplicity allows for greater mobility since the robots are not bogged down with heavy batteries. Kovac imagines swarms of his robots equipped with different sensors and small cameras that could be deployed over devastated areas to transmit essential information back to rescue command centers.\n The labs most recent innovation, perching a robot, saves valuable energy by allowing the robot to rest like insects or birds do. Many previous perching mechanisms include a complicated swooping maneuver to decrease momentum and land on legs, often without the ability of detaching. The mechanism developed by Dr Kovac and Jürg Markus Germann, recently published in the Journal of Micro-Nano Mechatronics, avoids this problem by using two spring-loaded arms fitted with pins that dig into the surface, whether it is wood or concrete. The snapping of the arms creates a forward momentum, allowing for a soft deceleration of the glider and avoiding mechanical damage. A remotely controlled mini-motor then detracts the pins and allows the robot to continue on its way.\n “I am fascinated by the creative process,” says Kovac, “and how it is possible to use the sophistication found in nature to create something completely new.” The perching mechanism can be easily adapted to other robots. His previous robot, a quarter-gram jumping robot that can achieve heights of up to four and a half feet, could now be fitted with the new perching mechanism as well as wings, thus creating a hybrid creature that gets around much like a flying grasshopper.\n Having recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL, Mirko Kovac is spending this summer in the United States as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.", "summary": "A swarm of flying robots soars into a blazing forest fire.

{"id": 288, "text": "You can’t miss the three little white eggs that have been driving noiselessly around the EPFL campus on four wheels since 7 May. Halfway between a car and a bike, these electric vehicles are available to users on campus for free. And testers have not been hard to find. “We were expecting about 50 people to sign up, but we’ve had more than 250. We had planned for each vehicle to do two or three runs a day, but they’ve actually done between eight and 13!” exclaims Yoann Loetscher, one of the two founders of the startup, ENUU.\nWorking in partnership with EPFL’s Sustainable Campus initiative, the Biel-based company is using the campus as a micro lab until 1 June. Users have been testing everything about the vehicles, from how easy they are to reserve and operate using the app to their technical features, fleet management and battery recharging. The aim is to fine-tune the design before a fleet of self-service vehicles is rolled out for public use in Biel in mid-July.\nThis initiative is a first for shared mobility. Let’s start with the vehicle itself. It’s manufactured in China and modified slightly for use in Switzerland. It’s electric, about as wide as a scooter, and has handlebars and a seat – you ride it like a bike but it’s as stable as a car. You don’t need a driver’s license, and the vehicle is allowed on bike paths up to a speed limit of 30km/h. For Loetscher, what makes the vehicles stand out is that they offer the advantages of electric bikes along with protection from the rain like cars.\nThe concept is also a first. Once you’ve signed up for the service, you can locate and reserve one of these mini vehicles via an app. The vehicle’s door will open automatically when the reservation begins – and off you go! At EPFL, the vehicles are available free of charge, but the journey can’t last more than 15 minutes. In Biel, where 13 vehicles will be available, users will be able to take three free trips a day lasting a total of 30 minutes. After that, they’ll have to pay.\nResearch projects in the pipeline\n“This pilot phase is crucial for ENUU because it allows us to collect a whole range of data on everything from battery life to areas of use. We’ve noticed, for example, that people use the vehicles a lot around avenues Piccard and Forel and less so near the SG building and at EPFL Innovation Park,” explains Loetscher, an automotive engineer who graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Biel.\nFirst time users are thrown a little off kilter at the start but then get used to driving the egg-shaped vehicle in no time. Some testers regularly take the vehicles for a short 15-minute spin, while others use them to get from point A to point B. Some students have even tried racing two of the vehicles. The pilot project includes a qualitative analysis that will soon be conducted with the testers, even though the campus is not the target location for this type of vehicle.\nThe partnership between ENUU and EPFL began a year ago when the startup contacted the Transport Center. “It’s our role to encourage projects that combine research, innovation and the economy,” says Simone Amorosi, the Center’s Deputy Director. “ENUU is now in talks with two EPFL labs about possible research projects. One involves vehicle autonomy, while the other is aimed at optimizing operational management.”", "summary": "The electric car-sharing vehicle designed by Biel-based startup ENUU has proved to be a big hit on the EPFL campus, where it has been tested since 7 May.", "claim": "The electric car-sharing vehicle designed by Biel-based startup ENUU has proved to be a big hit on the EPFL campus, where it has been tested since 7 May.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}

Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

A team of researchers at the Defitech Foundation Chair in Brain-Machine Interface (CNBI), headed by José del R. Millán, has however been working on a revolutionary brain-machine approach in order to restore a sense of independence to the disabled. The idea is to remotely control a robot from home with one's thoughts. The research, involving numerous subjects located in different countries, produced excellent results in both human and technical terms. The conclusions are discussed in the June special edition of Proceedings of the IEEE, dedicated to brain-machine interfaces.\n19 people tested, 100% success rate\n Nine disabled people and ten healthy people in Italy, Germany and Switzerland took part in the task of piloting a robot with their thoughts. For several weeks, each of the subjects put on an electrode-studded hat capable of analysing their brain signals. They then instructed the robot to move, transmitting their instructions in real time via internet from their home country. By virtue of its video camera, screen and wheels, the robot, located in an EPFL laboratory, was able to film itself as it moved while displaying the face of the remote pilot via Skype. The person at the controls, as if moving in place of the robot, was able to interact with whoever the robot crossed paths with. “Each of the 9 subjects with disabilities managed to remotely control the robot with ease after less than 10 days of training,” said Professor Millán.\nShared control between human and machine\n The brain-machine interface developed by the researchers goes even further. The robot is able to avoid obstacles by itself, even when it is not told to. To avoid getting overly tired, the pilot can also take a break from giving indications. If it doesn’t receive more indications, the robot will continue on the indicated path until it receives the order to stop. In this way, control over the robot is shared between the human and the computer, allowing the pilot to rest while navigating.\nNo difference between healthy and disabled subjects\n In the end, the tests revealed no difference in piloting ability between healthy and disabled subjects. In the second part of the tests, the disabled people with residual mobility were asked to pilot the robot with the movements they were still capable of doing, for example by simply pressing the side of their head on buttons placed nearby. They piloted the robot just as if they were uniquely using their thoughts, further proof of the effectiveness of the system.\nMature technology available \n The positive results of this research bring to a close the European project called TOBI (Tools for Brain-Computer Interaction), which began in 2008.

{"id": 294, "text": "Many areas of fundamental research are interested in graphene owing to its exceptional characteristics. It is made of one layer of carbon atoms, which makes it light and sturdy, and it is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Despite its apparently limitless potential, however, few applications have been demonstrated to date. Scientists at EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory (BIOS) together with researchers from the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO, Spain) have now added another one. They have harnessed graphene’s unique optical and electronic properties to develop a reconfigurable highly sensitive molecule sensor. The results are described in an article appearing in the latest edition of the journal \nScience\n. \n Focussing light to improve sensing \n The researchers used graphene to improve on a well-­‐known molecule-­‐detection method: infrared absorption spectroscopy. In the standard method, light is used to excite the molecules, which vibrate differently depending on their nature. It can be compared to a guitar string, which makes different sounds depending on its length. By virtue of this vibration, the molecules reveal their presence and even their identity. This “signature” can be “read” in the reflected light. \n This method is not effective, however, in detecting nanometrically-­‐sized molecules. The wavelength of the infrared photon directed at a molecule is around 6 microns (6,000 nanometres – 0.006 millimeters), while the target measures only a few nanometres (about 0.000001 mm). It is very challenging to detect the vibration of such a small molecule in reflected light. \n There is where graphene comes in. If given the correct geometry, the graphene is able to focus the light on a precise spot on its surface and “hear” the vibration of a nanometric molecule that is attached to it. “We first pattern nanostructures on the graphene surface by bombarding it with electron beams and etching it with oxygen ions,” said Daniel Rodrigo, co‐author of the publication. “When the light arrives, the electrons in graphene nanostructures begin to oscillate. This phenomenon, known as ‘localized surface plasmon resonance,’ serves to concentrate light into tiny spots, which are comparable with the dimensions of the target molecules. It is then possible to detect nanometric structures.”\nReconfiguring graphene in real time to see the molecule’s structure\n There is more to it. In addition to identifying the presence of nanometric molecules, this process can also reveal the nature of the bonds connecting the atoms that the molecule is composed of.\nWhen a molecule vibrates, it does not give off only one type of \"sound.\" It produces a whole range of vibrations, which are generated by the bonds connecting the different atoms. Returning to the example of the guitar: each string vibrates differently and together they form one musical instrument. These nuances provide information on the nature of each bond and on the health of the entire molecule. “These vibrations act as a fingerprint that allow us to identify the molecule; such as proteins, and can even tell their health status” said Odeta Limaj, another co-­author of the publication.\nIn order to pick up the sound given off by each of the strings, it has to be possible to identify a whole range of frequencies. And that is something graphene can do. The researchers “tuned” the graphene to different frequencies by applying voltage, which is not possible with current sensors. Making graphene's electrons oscillate in different ways makes it possible to “read” all the vibrations of the molecule on its surface. “We tested this method on proteins that we attached to the graphene. It gave us a full picture of the molecule,” said Hatice Altug.\nA big step closer to using graphene for molecule sensing\n The new graphene-­‐based process represents a major step forward for the researchers, for several reasons. First, this simple method shows that it is possible to conduct a complex analysis using only one device, while it normally requires many different ones. And all this without stressing or modifying the biological sample. Second, it shows graphene’s incredible potential in the area of detection. “There are many possible applications,” said Altug. “We focussed on biomolecules, but the method should also work for polymers, and many other substances,” she added.\n Source :\nDaniel Rodrigo et al.

{"id": 295, "text": "Patients fitted with an orthopedic prosthetic commonly experience a period of intense pain after surgery. In an effort to control the pain, surgeons inject painkillers into the tissue during the operation. When that wears off a day or two later, the patients are given morphine through a catheter placed near the spine. Yet catheters are not particularly comfortable, and the drugs spread throughout the body, affecting all organs.\nResearchers in EPFL’s  at the School of Engineering are now working on a biodegradable implant that would release a local anesthetic on-demand over several days. Not only would this implant reduce patients’ post-op discomfort, but there would be no need for further surgery to remove it. They developed a tiny biodegradable electronic circuit, made from magnesium, that could be heated wirelessly from outside the body.\nOnce integrated into the final device, the circuit will allow to release controlled amounts of anesthetic in a specific location over several days. After that, the implant will degrade safely inside the body. This research has been published in .\nOne capsule with several reservoirs\nThe electronic circuit – a resonant circuit in the shape of a small spiral – is just a few microns thick. When exposed to an alternating electromagnetic field, the spiral resonator produces an electric current that creates heat.\nThe researchers’ end-goal is to pair the resonators with painkiller-filled capsules and then insert them into the tissue during surgery. The contents of the capsules could be released when an electromagnetic field sent from outside the body melts the capsule membrane.\n“We’re at a key stage in our project, because we can now fabricate resonators that work at different wavelengths,” says Matthieu Rüegg, a PhD student and the study’s lead author. “That means we could release the contents of the capsules individually by selecting different frequencies.” The heat-and-release process should take less than a second.\nA novel manufacturing technique\n The researchers had to get creative when it came time to manufacture their biodegradable resonators. “We immediately ruled out any fabrication process that involved contact with water, since magnesium dissolves in just a few seconds,” says Rüegg. They ended up shaping the magnesium by depositing it on a substrate and then showering it with ions. “That gave us more flexibility in the design stage,” he adds. They were eventually able to create some of the smallest magnesium resonators in the world: two microns thick, with a diameter of three millimeters.\nThe team’s invention is not quite ready for the operating room. “We still need to work on integrating the resonators into the final device and show that it’s possible to release drugs both \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n,” concludes Rüegg.", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed biodegradable microresonators that can be heated locally with a wireless system.

{"id": 297, "text": "A second small Swiss satellite is going to be launched into space. After SwissCube in 2009, the Swiss Space Center (SSC) at EPFL is working on a new project. Baptized as CubETH, the youngest member of the Swiss cubsats family takes a lot from its predecessor: it measures ten cubic centimeters and weighs less than 1.5 kg. However, its scientific mission is more ambitious. This device is the result of a partnership with the Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich (ETHZ) as well as other collaborators. Its launching is scheduled for the end of 2015 at the earliest. The prototype is currently going through the “flat sat” stage: in order to test all its electronic components, they are electrically connected as they will be in the final structure while lying flat on a lab’s table.\n\"We aim at making CubETH a high performance orbitographic tool capable of calculating its position, altitude and orientation in space with high accuracy,\" said Markus Rothacher, director of the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab at ETH Zurich and main investigator for the scientific part of the project. The idea is to design a stable satellite in order to prevent it from spinning, as it happened to the SwissCube. \"But most importantly, added the specialist, we want to create conditions for future cubsats constellations so that, for example, we could carry out thorough observations of Earth at a given time. For that reason, it is essential to know the satellites’ exact orbits so as to coordinate their trajectories and scientific equipment.\"\nProven on Earth, unprecented in space\nTo achieve a more accurate measurement of the satellite’s orbit, the researchers opted for GPS receivers designed by the Swiss company u-blox. \"These sensors caught our interest because they are small, cheap and their performance is well proven, said Anton Ivanov, SSC researcher in charge of the satellite’s entire technical design. The u-blox receivers are very common, particularly in mobile phones, but they have never been used in space. We want to prove that, by adapting its software, this low cost piece of hardware originally developed for terrestrial purposes can be used in space applications.\"\nIn addition, these sensors are compatible with other navigational systems like the Russian GLONASS or the European Galileo. Hence, researchers are envisaging using all of these GPS technologies, not only for the cubsats constellations but also in the context of the \"cleaner\" satellite project CleanSpace One. They could certainly provide the high precision necessary for carrying out the delicate maneuvers to approach and capture space debris.\nFinally, the CubETH will also have an antenna on its side to study the atmosphere’s composition and nature. The idea is yet again to verify the efficiency of less expensive components than those traditionally used in space. In such a way, the CubETH project remains faithful to the spirit behind SwissCube and cubsats in general: being a platform for testing and demonstrating the applicability of standard electronic components in space.\nAn educational role\nThe cubesats’ format was devised by the California and Stanford universities to allow scholars conduct their own spatial scientific experiments at a reduced cost. The most innovative and significant design elements of SwissCube have been kept, such as the use of cell phone batteries packaged in a waterproof and thermally controlled casing. Another preserved feature is the use of the innovative system of copper pads that provide a better attachment of the solar cells on the satellite’s walls.\nEven before its launch, the new satellite will have also played an important educational role. In addition to generating links and collaborations between the country’s two Federal Institutes of Technology, the different pieces of software on board the satellite will have been the object of study of undergraduate and doctoral students lucky enough to take advantage of a concrete project for learning about space technologies.\n*\n Other Project Partners\n:\n Academic: Hochschule Zentralschweiz (Luzern), Hochschule Rapperswil Tecknik\n Industrial: u- blox, RUAG, Saphyrion.", "summary": "CubETH is the name of a joint project between EPFL’s Swiss Space Center and ETHZ whose main objective is to build a satellite scheduled for launch in late 2015.

{"id": 300, "text": "The “classical” role for a gene is to produce proteins, which are essential for the functioning of cells. However, our genomes also encode genes that produce long non-coding RNAs, whose functions are more mysterious. Yet, since four or five years ago we know that thousands of these still poorly understood genes are present in the human and mouse genomes. How and in which organs are they activated? Is this biological “dark matter” much ado about nothing or is there something more interesting to it?\nA team led by Professor Henrik Kaessmann at UNIL’s Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) compiled an authentic catalog of long non-coding RNAs in eleven species. By adopting an evolutionary approach, they discovered that about 2500 long non-coding RNAs first appeared at least 90 million years ago in the common ancestor of most placental mammals. From a functional point of view, these “ancient” genes turned out to be particularly interesting.\nFirst author of the \nNature\n article, Anamaria Necsulea, scientist at the Laboratory of developmental genomics of EPFL, expanded the scope of the investigation on these long non-coding RNAs to six primate species (man, macaque, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan), and to mouse, opossum (a marsupial mammal), platypus (a monotreme mammal that lays eggs and nurses its young with milk), as well as to an \"external group\" composed by a bird (chicken) and an amphibian (frog). The common ancestor of all these species goes back over 350 million years.\nGenes maintained during evolution\nThe biologists used the CIG genomics platform and the Vital-IT computing center at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to identify long non-coding RNAs in several major organs of the 11 species under scrutiny. \"Thanks to bioinformatics, we discovered RNA sequences produced from genome locations where no genes had been previously mapped,\" she said. \"We then analyzed these genes to find out whether or not they encoded proteins. Thus, we could identify between 3000 and 15000 long non-coding RNA genes, depending on the species.\"\nIn the second phase of the research, a comparison among the different species allowed the scientists to pinpoint the emergence of these genes in the evolutionary history. While 11,000 long non-coding RNAs are shared by all primates, 2,500 go back to an ancestor common to man and mouse, about 90 million years ago. Only a hundred genes of this kind stem from an ancestor common to all eleven species considered, including birds and amphibians. \"One of our main findings is that the activity of these non-coding genes is controlled by the same transcription factors that regulate protein-coding gene activity. Even more strikingly, we found that the 2,500 oldest long noncoding RNA genes are regulated by factors that are important for embryonic development. This suggests that, among the 2500 long non-coding RNAs conserved during the evolution of placental mammals, a large percentage may function specifically in embryonic development.\"\nNew network of interactions\nThe third phase of the research allowed the scientists to highlight a network of interactions (specifically, co-expression interactions, that is: genes are activated in the same organs or cell types) involving both long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. For instance, they found that some non-coding genes are strongly associated to protein coding genes involved in brain function or in spermatogenesis, which suggests similar functions for these long non-coding RNA genes.\n In the case of the H19X gene - one of the most ancient long noncoding RNA genes identified in this study - its association to the placental mammals’ H19 gene (which was the first long non-coding RNA identified years ago) helped to uncover its functioning: \"The H19 prevents the placenta from excessively growing inside the mother's womb,\" said Anamaria Necsulea. \"We can assume that H19X also contributes to this function. We now plan to disable this gene in mice to test its functions in the placenta.\"\nAmong the subcategories of RNA producing genes, are these long RNA genes more useful than it originally seemed? By tracking them in 11 different species, this new study of unprecedented scale suggests that some of our genomes’ \"dark matter\" may play a role in the development and functioning of the most vital organs of our bodies.

{"id": 301, "text": "Soon all it will take is a single step for manufacturers to set the properties of construction materials during preparation and improve their properties once hardened. Nanogence, an EPFL spin-off, has developed a lone additive that stands to replace the plethora of additives currently used to obtain an ideal concrete, mortar or cement. It can even prevent reinforcing bars from deteriorating, thereby extending the lifetimes of buildings. A magic potion? Almost.\nSimplifying concrete preparation\nTo the uninitiated, concrete seems to be both singular and immutable. So pedestrian that you’d think it’s fairly straightforward with no hidden secrets. But in reality, making it requires juggling a slew of parameters that can differ not only from one company to the next, but also from one batch to the next. For instance, clinker, the basic ingredient in concrete, can vary depending on the natural surroundings of the rock it’s produced from. The temperature to which clinker should be heated can also vary, as can the residence time inside a kiln, cooling conditions, and cement-mixture composition.\nManufacturers tailor the cement they make to the building it’s intended for and the journey it will take to get there. “For example, if it’ll be used for a building in the middle of a large city, it needs to harden slowly so that builders can still work with it despite the time it will take to get it to the construction site,” said Kumar Abhishek, CEO of Nanogence. That means cement is typically enhanced with varying amounts of different additives until the ideal texture is found. The lone additive developed by the spin-off thus constitutes a mini-revolution for the industry. Manufacturers will just need to tweak the proportion to get the right consistency.\nBecause the additive is inorganic – that is, carbon-free – it also eliminates the porosity problem that leads to carbonatation and deterioration of the concrete. This problem stems from the carbon links and the moisture that can seep into the tiny cracks between the metallic structures that reinforce the building and the debris in the cement. But Kumar’s inorganic compound can get rid of that problem, thereby making buildings last longer.\nThe additive also boosts the hardness of construction materials. That means builders can make thinner walls, thus using less concrete. The ensuing savings are significant, given that concrete accounts for 5–10% of carbon emissions but is still one of the world’s cheapest and most widely-used construction materials.\nThe secret: a thesis on concrete’s nanoscopic structure\nSo how does this “miracle” additive work? The basic idea behind the new process came from the in-depth knowledge of concrete’s nanoscopic structure that Kumar acquired during his thesis. He then used nanotechnologies to develop chemical substances that can improve concrete’s properties. The recipes of those substances must, of course, remain secret.\nThis summer – two patents later – Kumar launched his startup. He’s currently in talks with two major European concrete producers and has kicked off production of a compound specifically for white concrete. This niche market is particularly targeted to high-end interior decoration. But Kumar doesn’t intend to rest on his laurels. He is also developing an additive that can improve concrete’s thermal insulation. “The idea is to eventually develop prefabricated elements that combine longevity with good thermal insulation,” said Kumar, who takes a big-picture view. “Over 40% of energy worldwide is used for construction. Rethinking construction materials will hopefully enable us to reduce this usage.”\nNanogence has won startup awards from the European Venture Program (EVP) and the Academia-Industry Training program sponsored by EPFL, Swissnex, and Venture Lab.

{"id": 303, "text": "Mathematician David Strütt, a scientific collaborator at EPFL, worked for four months to develop , a math video game in Minecraft, where the gamer has to find a Eulerian cycle in a graph. Minecraft is a sandbox video game released in 2011, where the gamer can build almost anything, from simple houses to complex calculators, using only cubes and fluids. These countless possibilities are what lured David Strütt into Minecraft’s universe: “the game might be first intended for kids but I was studying for my Bachelor’s degree in mathematics when I discovered it. I fell in love with the game when I realized there is all the necessary blocks to build a Turing machine inside the game. It was a long time ago, so I have since forgotten what a Turing machine is. But the gist of it is: anything is possible inside the game”.\nMatheminecraft, , is a video game around Eulerian graphs with a tutorial and four levels. The project was made for the Maths Outreach team with the idea that it should be ready for the EPFL Open days in September 2019. After the success encountered at the Open Days, it was decided that the game will be proposed to classes of the region as a series of ateliers organized by the Maths Outreach Team and the Science Outreach Departement (SPS). During 4 weeks, 36 classes of children – 8 to 10 years old– registered to visit EPFL and took part in a two hours matinée where they played Matheminecraft and did various chemistry experiments. Minecraft is a very popular game and has been described as one of the greatest games of all time. Children immediately recognize the game and a growing roar of “are we going to play Minecraft” fills the air as they enter the room. “I think Minecraft digitally plays the same role LEGOs did in my childhood. It appeals to anyone who takes a bit of their time to dive into it” speculates David.\nThe idea behind the project is the following. Consider a graph: that is a drawing on a board made of dots called vertices which are linked by lines called edges. The question that is asked about graphs is: “is it possible to cross each edge exactly once, pass by each vertex at least once, and end up at the starting vertex?”. The first mathematician to ask that question is the Swiss Leonhard Euler in 1736. Not only did he wonder about that, but he provided the answer, giving an exhaustive description of which graphs admit such a path and which don’t.\nIn the Matheminecraft atelier, we try to answer Leonhard Euler’s question. An easy way to introduce Eulerian cycles to schoolchildren is to ask them about figures or drawings that can be done without lifting the pen and going twice on the same line. Triangle, square, star, a plethora of examples comes to their minds. In Matheminecraft each level consists of a graph that admits an Eulerian cycle. The game uses graphs that are easy enough, in the following sense: an Eulerian cycle will be found if the gamers make sure they don't get stuck. Such graphs are quite easy to work with, making the game suited to grade-schoolers.\nIn the game, each vertex is represented as a large color dot and each edge as a bridge. To keep the video game spirit, and to ensure that one bridge is only crossed once, David Strütt added a \"lava condition\", meaning that bridges, once crossed, will turn into lava. That makes them unable to be crossed again. A map of the graph is there to help the children. Famous Minecraft animals were added to decorate the levels, such as skeleton horses and Mooshrooms.\nThe story of Matheminecraft will not end there, as additional levels are in preparation and new series of ateliers – organized with the SPS – will take place in 2020 and 2021 Furthermore, a Matheminecraft 2.0 will see the day. It will include Eulerian trails, where the gamer will have to choose the starting point of his cycle. This would make the game harder and suitable for older grade-schoolers.\nThe freedom offered by Minecraft gave rise to other projects in the Maths Outreach Team, as a Summer School is currently in preparation in association with the . “Of course, at some point in my childhood I wanted to become a game developer. Only later in my teens did I think I could become a mathematician. Somehow, I became both” concludes David.\nGraph theory\nThe mathematical theory behind the game is vast and well known. It’s graph theory and was first mentioned as such in 1736 by Leonhard Euler. Euler laid the foundations of graph theory in his paper about the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad in Russia). This is a famous problem related to the urban geography of the city: can we found a walk through the city that would cross each bridge once and only once.\nEuler proved that there was no solution to that problem. The graph theory gives us tools to answer our initial question: given a graph, can we visit each vertex, pass by each edge once and end up at the starting point? Let us restrict ourselves to undirected, connected, graphs, which simplifies the answer.\nIf we can answer \"yes\", the goal is reached and the graph admits an Eulerian cycle. Furthermore, the starting and ending point does not matter.\nIf the answer is \"no\", then some of the requirements are not verified. That is the case with the Königsberg bridges. But there exist graphs where we can visit each vertex, pass by each edge once but end up at a different vertex. In such cases, the graph admits an Eulerian trail or path.\nIf the mathematical proofs might not be suitable for schoolchildren, testing whether an undirected graph is Eulerian (with a cycle or a trail) is easy – depending of course on the graph at hand and one’s ability at counting. To know if a graph is Eulerian, we need to define the simple notion of degree or valency of a vertex of a graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex – in layman's terms that is the number of edges arriving (or leaving) a vertex.\nIf each vertex has an even degree then the graph admits an Eulerian cycle. If there are exactly two vertices with an odd degree then the graph admits an Eulerian trail. In the latter case, the starting and ending points are the vertices with odd degree.\nIf Matheminecraft does not cover Eulerian trails, the theory is nevertheless explained in a very mathematical way, on a blackboard – or on a whiteboard for a lack of better options.", "summary": "Using the famous computer game Minecraft, Mathematicians at EPFL have developed a video game around Eulerian Cycles.

{"id": 304, "text": "Neurons communicate with each other at synapses through complex mechanisms. The synapses establish contact between the neurons and convert their electrical signals into chemical signals, the release of neurotransmitters. Study of these phenomena is one of the essential keys to understanding the brain. The team from the EPFL’s Laboratory of Synaptic Mechanisms, headed by Ralf Schneggenburger, has shed some light on previously unknown functions of proteins in the release of neurotransmitters.\n In the first paper (1), the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to deactivate a protein selectively in the calyx of Held, the brain’s largest synapse. This novel method enabled them to discover a direct, unexpected role for the protein RIM (Rab3 interacting molecule), which increases the density of calcium ion (Ca2+) channels, a type of ion channel that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release.\n In the second article (2), the scientists used mice that had been genetically modified so they would not produce a specific protein, synaptotagmin. This Ca2+-sensing protein is known to bind calcium ions (Ca2+), thus initiating neurotransmitter release. The researchers used a virus to reintroduce the missing gene in the nerve terminal and reestablish the gene function at the calyx of Held.\nA Protein’s Double Life\n Subsequently, the scientists used viruses expressing slightly modified versions of the gene coding for the protein. Careful comparison enabled them to reveal a double role of this protein. The function of synaptotagmin is in fact not limited to initiating neurotransmitter release; it also inhibits other Ca2+- sensing proteins present in the nerve terminal. In doing so, it increases the amplitude of the release signal while suppressing background release events. In other words it optimizes the signal quality, similarly to what occurs in an electronic circuit.\n The approaches developed by Ralf Schneggenburger’s team are promising. They should also help us gain more insight into the function of other proteins that are active in the synapses. Since synaptic transmission is the basis of all fast communication between neurons in the brain, misfunction at synapses can underlie several neurodegenerative- and psychiatric disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's Disease. \"Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular bases of synapse function will contribute to the development of treatment strategies of these disorders in the future,” the researcher explained.\n (1)Neuron, January 27, 2011, “”\n (2)Neuron, February 24, 2011, “”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have made a step forward in understanding signal transmission in neuronal networks, thanks to new methods to molecularly influence the nerve terminal.

{"id": 305, "text": "Coral reefs are dying on a massive scale around the world, and global warming is driving this extinction. The planet’s largest reef, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, is currently experiencing enormous coral bleaching for the second year in a row, while last year left only a third of its 2300-km ecosystem unbleached. The demise of coral reefs heralds the loss of some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching in the Maldives. Photo credit: The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers\nNow, scientists have shown that corals in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Northern Red Sea are particularly resistant to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The results are published today in the journal \nRoyal Society\nOpen Science.\nThe implications are important, as the Gulf of Aqaba is a unique coral refuge. The corals may provide the key to understanding the biological mechanism that leads to thermal resistance, or the weakness that underlies massive bleaching. There is also the hope that the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs could be used to re-seed deteriorated reefs in the Red Sea and perhaps even around the world.\nScientists at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (Université de Lausanne) in Switzerland, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period. They found that the corals did not bleach.\n “[Under these conditions,] most corals around the world would probably bleach and have a high degree of mortality,” says EPFL scientist Thomas Krueger. “Most of the variables that we measured actually improved, suggesting that these corals are living under suboptimal temperatures right now and might be better prepared for future ocean warming.”\nInterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nAt the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, the scientists exposed corals of the species \nStylophora pistillata\n, collected from the Gulf of Aqaba, to water temperatures and acidification. The conditions resemble the summer conditions of a future ocean in this region if local ocean warming continues at its current rate of approximately 0.4-0.5°C per decade. They performed an overall health check of all the major physiological functions of the corals, measuring variables like energy metabolism, the ability to build a skeleton, and nutrient exchange at the molecular level between the coral-host and their algae symbionts. These physiological variables were mostly unaffected by the harsh experimental treatment. Still, further work on ecologically relevant variables like fertility or competitive performance is needed.\nSymbiotic corals live together with an algae partner, much in the same way humans are in symbiosis with gut bacteria. Just as bacteria in the gut aid with digestion, providing valuable nutrients to the rest of the body, the algae that live within the coral-partner provide nutrients to the corals. The bacteria in our body thrive within our digestive tract, just as the algae benefit from living within the coral partner. Bleaching occurs when the colored algae are ejected by their coral-partner, and the symbiosis breaks down. If the algae do not return, the coral dies.\nCorals growing at the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nPre-acclimated to thermal tolerance\nThe coral species \nStylophora pistillata \noccurs in other regions of the world, and beyond the Gulf of Aqaba, does not necessarily demonstrate thermal resistance. The biological mechanism that underlies the robustness of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs is still unknown, but the scientists have an idea of how the species evolved to become thermally resistant.\n“Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba are pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance due to the special geography and recent history of the Red Sea,” says scientist Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences.\nAt the end of the last ice age, corals started recolonizing the whole of the Red Sea through the southern connection to the Indian Ocean. The thermal bottleneck at the southern entrance with summer water temperatures rising to 30-32°C provided a selective barrier, allowing only highly resistant individuals to move north. Ironically, this heat-resistant founding population encountered much cooler waters once reaching the northern end, where the Gulf of Aqaba is located.\nBased on this, the study hypothesized that these corals might be able to better cope with today’s ocean warming, considering that they not only descended from a heat-selected founding population, but they also started their warming trajectory from a lower temperature, compared to their counterparts in the central and southern Red Sea.\nProtection of the Gulf of Aqaba Reef\nDespite being resistant to global warming, the corals from the Gulf of Aqaba are still vulnerable to other stresses like pollution.\n“Local disturbances, such as local oil pollution, nutrients from fish farms, herbicides from gardening, may reduce the exceptionally high tolerance of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs,” says Fine.\n“This reef should receive international recognition as a natural site of great importance, because it might very well be one of the last reefs standing at the end of this century,” says Anders Meibom of EPFL. “I would like to encourage the countries around the Gulf of Aqaba – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel – to get together and create a strong protection environmental program, because even if these corals are resistant to rising water temperatures, they are still sensitive to local pollution, overfishing etc, and they need to be protected from this now.”\nScientists Anders Meibom (left) of EPFL/ UNIL and Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel.", "summary": "Coral reefs in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures.

On January 28, the European Commission supported this vision, announcing that it has selected the HBP as one of two projects to be funded through the new FET Flagship Program.\nFederating more than 80 European and international research institutions, the Human Brain Project is planned to last ten years (2013-2023). The cost is estimated at 1.19 billion euros. The project will also associate some important North American and Japanese partners. It will be coordinated at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, by neuroscientist Henry Markram with co-directors Karlheinz Meier of Heidelberg University, Germany, and Richard Frackowiak of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL).\nThe Swiss Contribution \nSwitzerland plays a vital role in the Human Brain Project. Henry Markram and his team at EPFL will coordinate the project and will also be responsible for the development and operation of the project’s Brain Simulation Platform. Richard Frackowiak and his team will be in charge of the project’s medical informatics platform; the Swiss Supercomputing Centre in Lugano will provide essential supercomputing facilities. Many other Swiss groups are also contributing to the project. Through the ETH Board, the Swiss Federal Government has allocated 75 million CHF (approximately 60 million Euros) for the period 2013-2017, to support the efforts of both Henry Markram’s laboratory at EPFL and the Swiss Supercomputing Center in Lugano. The Canton of Vaud will give 35 million CHF (28 million Euros) to build a new facility called Neuropolis for in silico life science, and centered around the Human Brain Project. This building will also be supported by the Swiss Confederation, the Rolex Group and third-party sponsors.\nThe selection of the Human Brain Project as a FET Flagship is the result of more than three years of preparation and a rigorous and severe evaluation by a large panel of independent, high profile scientists, chosen by the European Commission. In the coming months, the partners will negotiate a detailed agreement with the Community for the initial first two and a half year ramp-up phase (2013-mid 2016).

The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior.\nA novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and to speed up the search for new treatments.\nFinally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems.\nThe HBP will fund independent scientists to use the new platforms for their own research, reserving a substantial part of its budget for this purpose.

{"id": 307, "text": "Scientists from EPFL and WSL have been studying soils in oil palm cultivation for years, in an effort to develop more sustainable methods for growing this crop. Palm oil production has been criticized by environmentalists because of its large carbon footprint and negative impact on biodiversity. For instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia – the world’s two biggest producers – it has directly or indirectly caused large-scale deforestation, thereby reducing biodiversity and releasing significant amounts of CO\n2\n into the atmosphere. And planting oil palm trees in the deforested areas does not make up for the lost carbon storage capacity, according to a . \nBut the findings of a new study by EPFL and WSL – appearing today in \nScience Advances\n – indicate there may be a carbon-friendly alternative to deforestation. The scientists investigated oil palm crops that had been planted on former pastures in the Los Llanos region of Colombia, the world’s fourth-largest palm oil producer. There, large areas of pastures – which themselves had been planted in the past on savannas – were replaced by oil palm plantations 56 years ago. By calculating the crops’ carbon footprint since then, the scientists found that the total carbon storage – taking into account both vegetation and soil stocks – was unchanged relative to when the land had been used for pastures.\n“Our study is the first to look at the carbon footprint of palm oil production over the long term – that is, across two plantation cycles, since oil palm trees are replaced every 25–30 years,” says Juan Carlos Quezada, a PhD student at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS) and the study’s lead author. “It’s also the first to explore how converting pastures into oil palm farms affects soil quality and fertility over the long term, looking at all soil layers, not just the surface.”\nCarbon capture\nIn tropical climates, pastures – especially those that have been neglected and degraded – commonly consist of large grassy areas with a few small trees scattered around. Planting dense populations of oil palm trees – which can reach 15 meters in height – on these pastures can increase the carbon capture rate per unit of surface area, thanks to the palm trees’ roots, trunks and leaves, as well as the vegetation around them.\nUnder typical farming methods, oil palm trees are cut down every 25–30 years and replaced with young trees to start a new plantation cycle. As the roots and other parts of the old trees decompose, they nourish the soil and partially offset the carbon initially lost in the upper soil layer when the pastureland was converted. As a result, over the long term cultivation period, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem remains unchanged compared to the initial level before land conversion took place. \nAn alternative worth exploring \n“We should bear in mind that palm oil in and of itself is not harmful – neither to our health, when eaten in moderation, nor to the economy. And we’re not talking just about multinationals – the incomes of hundreds of small farmers in Colombia and other countries depend on it,” says Alexandre Buttler, head of ECOS and a co-author of the study. “The problem lies with the negative carbon impact and loss of biodiversity caused by deforestation. But the main palm oil producing countries have large abandoned pastures that could be converted favorably, thus limiting the massive carbon loss resulting from deforestation.” \nThis study was conducted as part of the  project, a cross-disciplinary initiative funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and led by ETH Zurich. OPAL brings together project partners from Switzerland, Indonesia, Colombia and Cameroon.

Two minutes and forty-two seconds. That was the first round of the day’s competition, and Jules and his teammates were pretty happy with their performance. Their top spun for longer than their opponents’, who used a drill to get theirs going.\nForty-five teams came from all over French-speaking Switzerland to compete in one of three age groups. The teams comprised three or four kids from the same age group, together with a coach. Three months before the competition, the teams were all given the same experimental challenge. This year, it was to build a top that would spin for as long as possible. “We used really basic materials,” said ten-year-old Eline. “We took a ten-centimeter-long piece of ash wood, sharpened the end with a pencil sharpener, and hammered it into a piece of fiberboard that we had cut into a round shape using a hole saw.” Good explanation from this extremely enthusiastic team, which was competing in the middle age group.\nPresenting the results of their research project\n In the second round of the competition, the kids had to present the results of a scientific project that they had completed before the competition, along with their conclusions. A team from the youngest age category explained to a jury how to make various types of vortexes with different liquids and vessels. Eight-year-old Clément, backed by a diagram projected onto a screen, used his hands to illustrate the direction in which the earth rotates. Matias, also eight years old, then continued: “I asked my brother, who’s in Australia, to check whether vortexes really do turn the other way down there.” His brother also participated in this competition once. “This interest in science runs in the family,” said his dad, who was the team’s coach that day.\nThat’s just what this competition is designed to bring out: the goal is to get kids interested in science and research. “They may not yet have the mathematical tools to understand and model a scientific problem,” said Andrea Fabian Montabert, who was in charge of organizing the competition. “But they can still come up with hypotheses, set up an experiment and improve their results through trial and error. And they can make observations and draw conclusions.” The competition lets kids try their hand at scientific and technical experiments in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\nTeamwork and cooperation\n After taking a short quiz designed to test their general science knowledge, the competitors played a fun game that required solid teamwork. They had to cross an imaginary swamp and feed a paper crocodile – but they had to be quick and nimble and work together effectively.

This protects the cell’s genetic material from physical and chemical damage.\nThe ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. These are specialized structures that have to be replicated with each cell division cycle. But the complete replication of telomeres up to the very ends of chromosomes also requires specialized mechanisms, and these are limited. Telomeres are also very sensitive to oxidative damage, which affects their ability to replicate.\nBecause of this, telomeres shrink over time, limiting the lifespan of cells. Telomere shortening is essentially the cause of cell aging.\nNow,  and Wareed Ahmed at EPFL have discovered two antioxidant enzymes that work together to prevent oxidation of telomeric DNA at chromosome ends. The scientists disrupted both the enzymes, called PRDX1 and MTH1, in cancer cells, and found that the cells’ telomeres shrunk with every round of cell division, eventually disappearing altogether.\nOne of the promising targets in cancer therapy is the enzyme telomerase. Normally, telomerase prevents telomeres from shortening in germ and stem cells, which helps with development. But telomerase is also highly active in cancer cells, keeping their telomeres intact and making the cells virtually immortal. The new work shows that disrupting PRDX1 and MTH1 prevents telomerase from counteracting telomere shortening.\nSo far, attempts to efficiently block telomerase in cancer have not been fruitful in the clinic. The discovery of the co-operating enzymes opens up a new opportunity to indirectly block telomerase. “Instead of inhibiting the enzyme itself, we target its substrate – the chromosome end – making it un-extendable by telomerase,” says Lingner.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have identified two enzymes that protect chromosomes from oxidative damage and shortening.

{"id": 316, "text": "Most rod-shaped bacteria divide by splitting into two around the middle after their DNA has replicated safely and segregated to opposite ends of the cell. This seemingly simple process actually demands tight and precise coordination, which is achieved through two biological systems: nucleoid occlusion, which protects the cell’s genetic material from dividing until it replicates and segregates, and the “minicell” system, which localizes the site of division around the middle of the cell, where a dividing wall will form to split it in two. But some pathogenic bacteria, e.g. \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n, don’t use these mechanisms. EPFL scientists have now combined optical and atomic force microscopy to track division in such bacteria for the first time, and have discovered that they use instead an undulating “wave-pattern” along their length to mark future sites of division. The findings are .\nThe work was carried out jointly by the labs of  and  at EPFL. The scientists wanted to understand how bacteria that do not have the genes for nucleoid occlusion and the minicell system “decide” where and when to divide. This is important, as many pathogenic bacteria fall into this category, and knowing how they divide can open up new ways to fight them.\nThe researchers focused on \nMycobacterium smegmatis\n, a non-pathogenic relative of \nM. tuberculosis\n. Neither of these bacteria uses the two “conventional” biological systems for coordinating division, meaning that a non-conventional approach was needed for studying them. \nThe researchers combined two types of microscopy to track the life cycle of the bacteria. The first technique was optical microscopy, which uses fluorescent labels for “seeing” various biological structures and biomolecules. The second technique was atomic force microscopy, which provides extremely high-resolution images of structures on the cell surface by “feeling” the surface with a tiny mechanical probe, much like a blind person can form a three-dimensional mental image of an object by passing their hands over its surface.\n“This experiment constitutes the longest continuous atomic force microscopy experiment ever performed on growing cells,” says Georg Fantner, while John McKinney adds: “It illustrates the power of new technologies not only to analyze the things we already knew about with greater resolution, but also to discover new things that we hadn’t anticipated.”\nArmed with a custom-built instrument that combines the two techniques, the scientists created long-term time-lapses of the growth and division of the bacteria over multiple generations. Unexpectedly, they found that the bacteria produce undulating “trough-like” patterns across their length. These morphological landmarks on the undulating surface of mycobacterial cells correspond to future sites of cell division. \nThe troughs are roughly repeating waves, which the scientists calculated to have an average wavelength of ~1.8 μm, and an amplitude too small to resolve with conventional microscopes (about 100 nm). This might be the reason why waveform troughs have not been reported before. \nThe time-lapse images also showed that, after the mycobacterium divides, the new “daughter” cells inherit the “mother” cell’s wave-trough pattern, and ultimately divide at the center-most wave-trough.\nWave-troughs can form up to three generations before they are used as division sites. According to Alexander Eskandarian, the lead author of the study, these morphological features are “by far the earliest known landmark of future division sites in bacteria.\" Building on these observations, future research will focus on identifying the underlying mechanisms responsible for wave-trough formation and propagation and recruitment of the cell division machinery.\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the Innovative Medicines Initiative, the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7), and the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO).\nReference\nHaig A.

{"id": 318, "text": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a major player in nutrition today. Studies have shown that NAD+ concentrations decrease during aging and that recovering the body’s levels of NAD+ can prolong both health span and even life span, making it the focus of much research in nutritional science, medicine, and even pharmaceutics.\nIn terms of biology, NAD+ is what is known as a “co-enzyme” – a necessary molecule that helps an enzyme carry out its respective reaction in the cell. NAD+ is a common co-enzyme for multiple metabolic enzymes across all living cells, meaning that it is heavily involved in producing energy and keeping cells alive and healthy.\nPublishing in \nNature\n, scientists lead by  in collaboration with TES Pharma have found a new way of increasing NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme competing with its production.\nThe \nde novo\n synthesis of NAD+ in the cell begins with the amino acid tryptophan. One of the key enzymes involved in this process is ACMSD, which limits the amount of NAD+ produced by the \nde novo\n synthesis pathway.\nThe scientists were able to show that ACMSD controls the levels of NAD+ in the cell through a mechanism that doesn’t seem to have changed during evolution: case-in-point, the researchers found that, in both the earthworm \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n and mice, blocking the enzyme resulted in higher NAD+ levels and enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe inactivation of ACMSD also increased the activity of Sirtuin 1, an enzyme that NAD+ works with in its role as co-enzyme. Sirtuin 1 is known to play major roles in mitochondrial well-being, and as a result, the boost of NAD+ levels ultimately enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe team then used two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD, developed by . “Since the enzyme is mostly found in the kidney and liver, we wanted to test the capacity of the ACMSD inhibitors to protect these organs from injury,” explains Elena Katsyuba, first author of the paper.\nBoth inhibitors were shown to preserve kidney and liver function in animal models of acute kidney injury and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, offering much promise for their future therapeutic potential in humans. “The fact that ACMSD is exclusively present only in the liver and kidneys reduces the risk of negative repercussions of its loss on other organs,” says Katsyuba. “Put simply, the enzyme will not be missed by an organ that does not have it anyway.”\n“Given the beneficial health effects of boosting NAD+ levels that we have seen in worm and mouse models of disease, we are looking forward to bringing these compounds soon to the clinic to the benefit of patients suffering from liver and kidney diseases, two areas with a large unmet clinical need,” says Johan Auwerx.\nOther contributors\nTES Pharma\nUniversity of Lausanne\nPolytechnic University of Marche\nEPFL Histology Core Facility\nUniversity Hospital of Geneva\nPolish Academy of Sciences", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have found a new way to boost the famous anti-aging molecule NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme that limits its production.

{"id": 320, "text": "Treatments for beating tumours are mainly based on CD8 T lymphocytes, which specialise in detecting and eliminating intracellular infections and in killing cancer cells. A large proportion of patients, however, do not respond to these treatments. This prompted a research team from the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman (SCCL, Switzerland) to bring together the universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL), the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), EPFL and CHUV to investigate CD4 T lymphocytes. While these play a supporting role with CD8 T cells, their ability to eliminate tumour cells directly has been a matter of controversy. Using innovative nanoimaging technologies designed at the EPFL's School of Engineering laboratory, the scientists found that when the CD4 T lymphocytes were directly put in close contact to the cancer cells, up to a third of them could also kill them. This discovery, the subject of an article in \nScience Advances\n, is significant and broadens the therapeutic perspectives based on administering CD4 T lymphocytes to patients who are resistant to conventional therapies.\nWhen cancer cells proliferate in our bodies, our immune system kicks in. The first line of fighters capable of destroying tumour cells are CD8 T lymphocytes known as cytotoxic T cells, backed up by CD4 T lymphocytes. The latter secrete factors that help the former in many ways. “That’s why lots of cancer treatments are based on CD8 T lymphocytes,” begins Camilla Jandus, last author of the study and a pro- fessor in the Department of Pathology and Immunology in UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and adjunct scientist at LICR. “Unfortunately, some patients don’t respond to these treatments, and so we have to find new ones.”\nThe SCCL team turned their focus to CD4 T lymphocytes, which offer invaluable support to our immune system, as Pedro Romero, a professor in the Department of Fundamental Oncology in UNIL’s Faculty of Medicine and Biology, explains: “These have a much wider spectrum of functional specialisations than CD8 T lymphocytes, and for a long time we didn’t know for sure whether they had the capacity to diffe- rentiate into killer lymphocytes.”\n20,000 individual “boxing rings”\nTo address this question, the scientists examined CD4 T lymphocytes from around twenty patients with melanoma who were being treated at CHUV. “Although melanoma isn’t the most common skin cancer, it is the deadliest, and it’s particularly sensitive to immunotherapies,” spells out Professor Jandus. The researchers isolated the CD4 T lymphocytes from both the blood and fragments of the tumours with the idea of comparing them directly. Dissociated tumour cells and CD4 T cells were co-incubated to observe their behaviour individually. Observation tools were then required to provide highly-advanced resolution down to the single cell level. “We created chips of over 20,000 mini-wells of 65 picolitres (1 picolitre = 10-12 litre) that can accommodate a CD4 T cell and a tumour cell in each of them, and function like boxing rings,” says Hatice Altug, a professor in EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory. The researchers then photographed all these thousands wells simultaneously every five minutes for 24 hours in order to observe the interactions occurring between the two cells from a large set of pairs. “We know that it takes about two and a half hours for a CD8 to kill a tumour cell, and we decided to observe these boxing rings for 24 hours without knowing how, and if, the CD4s would react,” continues Professor Altug.\nA third of the CD4s emerged victorious\nTo the great satisfaction of the scientists, the high-throughput inte- gration of dynamic imaging data showed that up to a third of the CD4 T lymphocytes succeeded in killing the tumour cell to which they were closely linked within five hours. As Professor Romero stresses: “These direct observations at the level of individual lymphocytes, which were revealed for the first time at such a level of sensitivity, definitively confirm the existence of CD4 T lymphocytes capable of killing tumour cells. And this happens while the tumour cells sometimes manage to divert them from their function of providing protective support to make allies of them.”\nPicowell array chip in a standard microscope slide with separated chambbers.\n © 2021 EPFL\nBy analysing the killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes in detail, the scientists found that they expressed the SLAMF7 molecule, which promoted their tumor killer activity. “That’s why we’re now going to isolate and cultivate in vitro the best killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes so we can turn them into a veritable army of trillions of cells, which we can then inject into patients on whom CD8-based treatments don’t work,” says Dr Jandus. The human body naturally has only a small number of CD4 T lymphocytes directed against tumours, and not enough to defeat them. “The ability to visualise this close combat with our picowell chip paves the way for expanding the arsenal in the fight against cancer, which we now need to develop,” concludes Professor Altug.", "summary": "A team from EPFL and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy them.", "claim": "A team from SLAMF7 and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy them.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [3, 3], "noise": false}
{"id": 321, "text": "Urban policies strongly in favor of public transport have always been highly praised. These initiatives, generally designed to encourage users to give up their own vehicle to travel to urban centers, can however sometimes lead to less positive results. \nThis is one of the conclusions that sociologist Hanja Maksim, doctoral student at the Laboratory of Urban Sociology at EPFL (), headed by Vincent Kaufmann, has reached. “For example, when the authorities decide to extend a streetcar line, so that it connects a suburb, they may not take into account the fact that the needs of the populations of these areas aren’t necessarily fulfilled by the project. In other words, this direct line to the center may not necessarily be what they need in their daily lives.” Even worse, according to the researcher, certain types of mobility developments – whether involving public transport or private vehicles – can increase the precarity of certain segments of the population. “People on modest incomes may be obliged to accept less secure and less convenient jobs, located far away from their homes, simply because an efficient way of getting there has been developed”, she explains. \nFor her thesis work, which she defended on Thursday evening, she focused on four agglomerations with very distinct characteristics. Geneva, Bern, Clermont-Ferrand and Grenoble were closely examined, and a panel of people living there were invited to give their input. “I concentrated on groups particularly affected by difficulties linked with mobility: elderly people, single-parent families, and people with low incomes”, continues Hanja Maksim.\nWorking in the field enabled her to highlight several paradoxes linked to the journeys of each person. As an example, the fact that towns tend less and less to favor cars, which however resist against all odds, thanks to their intrinsic advantages. But an even more important finding is that an increase in mobility is not necessarily what the people expect. “They can be compared to islanders”, notes the researcher. “What interests them most is not to be able to go anytime to the neighbouring islands, but rather to have everything that they need on their own island.” Translated into urban terms, this metaphor calls for policies that would aim to offer a broader diversity of activities in each district, and in particular enabling the creation of jobs. In reality, this calls for a closer cooperation between the offices dealing with mobility and those looking after spatial planning.\nDoes this mean that the urban planners and designers of the four towns studied have got it all wrong? “My work implies certain criticisms”, admits Hanja Maksim . “But I also bring an element of theory which enables us to reconsider these questions with more detachment: in particular, the concept of \nmotility\n, theorized by Vincent Kaufmann, which isn’t satisfied with the use of the sole criteria of journeys and access. One also has to take into account the projects of the users, as well as their ability to make use of the offer at their disposal in the best possible way, and this faculty was highly developed in these groups of people.”\nThese parameters make up the “mobility capital” of each individual, and in the same way as with social or economic capital, this can reveal unsuspected inequalities.", "summary": "An astonishing conclusion has resulted from Hanja Maksim’s thesis work: public transport expansion policies can actually reinforce certain inequalities.", "claim": "An astonishing conclusion has resulted from Hanja Maksim’s thesis work: public transport expansion policies can actually reinforce certain inequalities.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 322, "text": "When the World Wide Web was invented at CERN 30 years ago, no one talked about open science. But the internet has become one of the pillars of open science, providing researchers with a way of sharing information with colleagues around the world.\nIn January 2017, soon after taking office, EPFL President Martin Vetterli launched the  in order to raise awareness about this important topic. One key element was the creation of the Open Science Strategic Committee (OSSC), whose members provide EPFL’s Senior Management with input on how to best promote open science. We met with Professor Katrin Beyer, who chairs the OSSC, to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by open science at EPFL and beyond.\nHow open is science today?\nScience is definitely more open now than it was five or ten years ago, and almost certainly less than it will be five or ten years from now. It is increasingly common to share research outputs beyond the traditional manuscript - such as code and data - and this practice will soon be ubiquitous. One thing we notice when discussing the topic of open science among colleagues is that significant differences exist between disciplines. This does not necessarily mean that some are more open than others – they’re simply open in different ways.\nIn some fields it is standard to share preprints; in others open data has a long tradition. Open data seems to be particularly well-established in places where researchers use a large shared infrastructure, such as CERN. These communities have worked for a long time on establishing data-format and documentation standards. It seems much harder to create such standards when everybody has their own laboratory and, often, their own experimental set-up.\nOpen science initiatives touch on several key aspects of the research process – publications, research evaluation, career promotion, funding allocation and so on. Does that mean the whole process is flawed?\nThe process is certainly flawed when it comes to access to scientific literature. Some big legacy publishers now control the majority of the journals in most fields and have profit margins of 30–40%, effectively channeling public money into the pockets of private investors. Many universities simply cannot afford to pay the subscription fees. And while illegal services such as Sci-Hub bring more equality to researchers around the globe, relying on pirated access to knowledge is not a sustainable strategy. We need to do better.\nThat said, open access as it is implemented today does not necessarily solve the economic or equality issue. If it becomes expensive to publish, everyone will be able to read the literature, but only a few will be able to publish it. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\nIn terms of career promotion and evaluating candidates for funding, in theory, the framework is already in place. Many universities, including EPFL, have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which states that researchers should be judged not just on how many articles write and the prestige of the journals in which they publish, but on all types of research output, and that quality should come before quantity. However, in practice, hiring committees evaluating large numbers of applications within a short period of time can find it difficult to implement DORA, because assessing the quality of a variety of research outputs is more time consuming than looking at numbers and journal titles. This remains a challenge.\nHow will open science affect the research community?\nOne major objective of open science is to increase the reproducibility and reusability of published work, and I think this will accelerate science in general and increase its impact. Open science also implies a more inclusive research environment. Being part of an established network of researchers is not necessary anymore to get access to data or code – any researcher anywhere in the world can build on these research outputs.\nYoung researchers may benefit the most from open science. They also have a key responsibility: they contribute a significant part of the research and need to make sure it’s produced and documented so that others can easily build on it. Research institutions need to support them in this endeavor and ensure they have all the methodological tools they need.\nWhat is EPFL’s strategy?\nThe OSSC wants to promote a bottom-up approach to open science. Researchers know best where their disciplines are going, how to innovate in the way their community shares information, and what will have a real impact in making their field more open. But it is EPFL’s responsibility to listen to its researchers and develop the services and infrastructure that will make a clear difference in supporting those striving to implement open science in their daily routine.\nIt is important for EPFL to provide training opportunities at the same time. The summer school session called “Open Science in Practice,” which took place in September, gave PhD students a look at projects and tools that other early career researchers have used in their research practice. Teaching by example is the best way to convince people that open science is possible and has a greater impact, and that good practice does not necessarily require a lot of time. The School’s library also offers a range of courses on tools that make it easier to implement open science, along with expert advice on topics such as open access and data management. We recommend expanding this catalogue even further.\nIs EPFL a pioneer in open science?\nI think EPFL is ahead of the curve, since it works hard to explore the most promising avenues and tries to be innovative in its support for open science on campus. Martin Vetterli is very outspoken about it. And to be fair, many EPFL researchers started working openly well before the OSSC was set up. The Swiss Data Science Center, for example, is a driving force in this area and a real asset. Its Renku platform may change how we track the research process, and it could significantly reduce the time required for careful documentation.", "summary": "As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, EPFL is highlighting his commitment for open and reproducible research through an exceptional Open Science Day, today.

It uses them simultaneously, then aggregates the data obtained to deliver the final content to each unit. As a result the download speed can be doubled when two devices work together. “Videos represent 60% of the traffic on mobile networks, and the demand is growing faster than the ability of the network to provide bandwidth,” says Christina Fragouli, co-founder of the start-up. This results in increasing interruptions while viewing a video.\nThis ingenious system comes with many constraints. “To accomplish this, we must solve the problem of resource allocation, all the while accounting for variabilities in the wireless network,” explains Lorenzo Keller, the other co-founder of this spin-off from EPFL and University of California Irvine (UCI). The algorithms behind this system provide for any wireless device which transmits, via any network, at any time. Moreover, it necessarily does this effeciently: devices are carefully coordinated so that the overall coordination does not interfere with the benefits. Several applications are being developed. The bandwidth can be shared either when it is not in use by one of the users, or when a group of users simultaneously attempts to access the same content.\nVideobee, designed for Android smartphones, will be launched any day now. This application facilitates video viewing from websites like YouTube or DailyMotion by reducing both the waiting time at the beginning of the video as well as interruptions. The download speed is doubled. The bandwidth of another device nearby is used, albeit with the agreement of the owner.\nStarting in September a specific version for MOOCs (massive open online course) in Africa becomes available.

The results are .\nA hard drive functions as a data storage device in a computer, where a large amount of data can be stored with an electromagnetically charged surface.\nNowadays, the demand for high capacity hard drives has increased more than ever. Computer users handle large files, databases, image or video files, using software, all of which require a large amount of memory in order to save and process the data as quickly as possible.\nThe EPFL scientists used a halide perovskite/oxide perovskite heterostructure in their new method for reversible, light-induced tuning of ferromagnetism at room temperature. Having a perovskite structure represents a novel class of light-absorbing materials.\nAs reported in the publication,\n“The rise of digitalization led to an exponential increase in demand for data storage. Mass-storage is resolved by hard-disk drives, HDDs, due to their relatively long lifespan and low price. HDDs use magnetic domains, which are rotated to store and retrieve information. However, an increase in capacity and speed is continuously demanded. We report a method to facilitate the writing of magnetic bits optically. We use a sandwich of a highly light sensitive (MAPbI\n3\n) and a ferromagnetic material (LSMO), where illumination of MAPbI\n3\n drives charge carriers into LSMO and decreases its magnetism. This is a viable alternative of the long-sought-after heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology, which would heat up the disk material during the writing process.”\nThe method is still experimental, but it may be used to build the next generation of memory-storage systems, with higher capacities and with low energy demands. The method provides a stand for the development of a new generation of magneto-optical hard drives. Forró concludes: “ We are now looking for investors who would be interested in carrying on the patent application, and for industrial partners to implement this original idea and proof of principle into a product.”", "summary": "What do you get when you place a thin film of perovkite material used in solar cells on top of a magnetic substrate?

{"id": 325, "text": "The goal of the Human Brain Project is to pull together all our existing knowledge about the human brain and to reconstruct the brain, piece by piece, in supercomputer-based models and simulations. The models offer the prospect of a new understanding of the human brain and its diseases and of completely new computing and robotic technologies. On January 28, the European Commission supported this vision, announcing that it has selected the HBP as one of two projects to be funded through the new FET Flagship Program.\nFederating more than 80 European and international research institutions, the Human Brain Project is planned to last ten years (2013-2023). The cost is estimated at 1.19 billion euros. The project will also associate some important North American and Japanese partners. It will be coordinated at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, by neuroscientist Henry Markram with co-directors Karlheinz Meier of Heidelberg University, Germany, and Richard Frackowiak of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL).\nThe Swiss Contribution \nSwitzerland plays a vital role in the Human Brain Project. Henry Markram and his team at EPFL will coordinate the project and will also be responsible for the development and operation of the project’s Brain Simulation Platform. Richard Frackowiak and his team will be in charge of the project’s medical informatics platform; the Swiss Supercomputing Centre in Lugano will provide essential supercomputing facilities. Many other Swiss groups are also contributing to the project. Through the ETH Board, the Swiss Federal Government has allocated 75 million CHF (approximately 60 million Euros) for the period 2013-2017, to support the efforts of both Henry Markram’s laboratory at EPFL and the Swiss Supercomputing Center in Lugano. The Canton of Vaud will give 35 million CHF (28 million Euros) to build a new facility called Neuropolis for in silico life science, and centered around the Human Brain Project. This building will also be supported by the Swiss Confederation, the Rolex Group and third-party sponsors.\nThe selection of the Human Brain Project as a FET Flagship is the result of more than three years of preparation and a rigorous and severe evaluation by a large panel of independent, high profile scientists, chosen by the European Commission. In the coming months, the partners will negotiate a detailed agreement with the Community for the initial first two and a half year ramp-up phase (2013-mid 2016). The project will begin work in the closing months of 2013.\n---\nA scientific portrait of the Human Brain Project \nThe Human Brain Project will provide new tools to help understand the brain and its fundamental mechanisms and to apply this knowledge in future medicine and computing.\nCentral to the Human Brain Project is Information and Computing Technology (ICT). The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior.\nA novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and to speed up the search for new treatments.\nFinally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems.\nThe HBP will fund independent scientists to use the new platforms for their own research, reserving a substantial part of its budget for this purpose.

{"id": 326, "text": "Instead of going on a diet, why not leave the suburbs and move downtown to drop some weight? In reality, it might not be quite that simple, but a recent study by researchers from the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and EPFL has shown that, for adults, place of residence has an impact on body-mass-index, an indicator used to classify people’s weight, that goes beyond income levels. Their findings rely on data gathered over 10 years in the canton of Geneva and were published in the journal Nature Nutrition and Diabetes. They highlight the need for a fine-grained assessment of public health and provide insights that could help guide campaigns to prevent obesity.\nPublic health specialists long ago connected the dots between people’s socioeconomic context and social networks on their health and obesity rates. In particular, body-mass-index (BMI) – a measure that describes body shape based on height and weight – has been believed to reflect the income and the average BMI of their social circles. As a result, obesity prevention campaigns have typically targeted large swaths of the population in low-income neighborhoods. But the data gathered from thousands of adults and children living in Geneva beg for a subtler interpretation.\nHealth data for more than 6600 adults, including measured height and weight, were collected from 2001 to 2010 as part of the Bus Santé population-based study, initiated and carried out by Idris Guessous of the Geneva University Hospitals. The campaign included several units including a mobile examination unit that went to several places in the State to evaluate the health of the canton’s residents. The dataset was rounded off with health evaluations of more than 3600 children, obtained in schools across the canton in 2011.\nEvaluating these data geographically confirmed that adults’ and children’s BMI values are not distributed randomly on a map of the canton. Instead, they were found to divide the map into regions with predominantly high or low values, and a larger one where neither trend prevailed. To the south of the Rhone River, the researchers detected a region characterized by low BMI values. North or the Rhone, and to the west of the Praille district, values of high BMI were overrepresented. Between the two, the researchers detected a large “neutral” belt, with a mixed population.\nRed dots represent adults with a high BMI that are surrounded by adults with similarly high BMI values (high-high). Blue dots represent the opposite situation (low-low). White dots mean that neither trend is detected. Purple and pink dots represent low-high and high-low respectively.\n Source:\nNature, 2014.\nThe study revealed two surprising features. First, high adult BMI values did not always overlap with those for children, especially in the heart of the city, north of the Rhone River. And second, at least for adults, the researchers found that differences in income were not enough to explain their findings. But according to the researchers, there are a number other of potential causes, including urban planning, social networks, sport infrastructure, and the promotion of softer forms of mobility, such as walking, biking, or public transportation. In the future, the researchers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographical Information Systems, who performed the spatial analysis of the results, will seek to tease out the effect of each of these and other factors on BMI.\nThe study brings to light the importance of finer-grained analysis of community health, both in terms of to geography and age. Lessons learned will primarily benefit other communities seeking to more accurately analyze the health of their residents. But they will also help those involved in setting up anti-obesity campaigns, allowing them to more accurately tailor adult or child specific interventions to the target audience they aim to reach.", "summary": "Whether you live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the canton of Geneva.", "claim": "Whether you live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the canton of Geneva.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}

{"id": 328, "text": "In the Zaatari refugee camp in northern Jordan, which is home to nearly 80,000 people, internet access is spotty at best, which further isolates the refugees living there. But EPFL’s  (React), along with two researchers from the Pennsylvania State University, has tested an instant messaging system at the camp, one that operates independently of telephone and internet service providers. Their system runs on battery power and allows users to communicate with each other in unconnected areas while maintaining data security. \nAn inexpensive solution\nThe system is built around on a tiny computer already available on the market – the Raspberry Pi – and which costs just 30 dollars. The researchers programmed the computer to work like a local server, allowing anyone within a range of around 100 meters to access a web-based messaging service via Wi-Fi. This communication platform enables users to send and receive messages by simply opening their browser. The project team also took care to ensure that all data exchanged via the system is protected. “Our messaging system is fully anonymous,” says Denis Gillet, the head of React. “The data is stored locally, rather than in the cloud, so that it can’t be accessed from the outside or used inappropriately.”\nThis kind of “co-located” social media platform can be used to allow people within a defined area – like a camp, music festival or building – to communicate with each other. While less versatile than conventional social media, it has the advantage of working in places without internet access. Initial results have shown that refugees who used the messaging system had a greater sense of engagement and belonging to a community. “Such messaging systems can also help call attention to the situation and living conditions in such confined areas,” says Adrian Holzer, a researcher on the React team.\nConnecting aid workers\nThe React researchers have also teamed up with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to develop a system to improve information sharing between the NGO’s headquarters and field operations. Aid workers in challenging humanitarian situations need to have rapid access to essential and constantly updated information, like data sheets and medical files. Here the researchers again used a Raspberry Pi, programming it to enable field workers to access MSF’s shared files located in the cloud. Documents are synchronized between the Raspberry Pi and the cloud when an internet connection is available. When the internet is down, these files can still be accessed directly on the Raspberry Pi. “One of our biggest challenges was developing a single system that could be used anywhere,” says Gillet. “Given MSF’s working environment, our system had to operate without an internet connection or external power supply, and it had to be fast, portable and compatible with any kind of mobile device the aid workers might have.” \nLeveraging ICT to support humanitarian efforts\nUnreliable internet access is not the only information-related challenge facing the humanitarian sector. “Technology has completely transformed our work, as we first saw with the 2010 earthquake in Haiti,” explains Holzer. “Everyone – from the local population to volunteers on the other side of the world – was able to share information in order to map out the situation and identify the areas that were hardest hit.” Although this collective effort brings in large amounts of data, it comes with its fair share of caveats. What sort of guarantee is there that the data collected will be used for the right purposes? That a given emergency is real? And that the aid is reaching those who need it most? The React team worked with researcher Isabelle Vonèche Cardia, who is the Deputy Director of EPFL’s College of Humanities, to make sure their solutions met the four core principles of humanitarian work: humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. And since we now live in a world where Tweets and photos are shared faster than they can be verified, the researchers also created a template for assessing both the risks and benefits of using the latest ICT for humanitarian purposes. “We want these technologies to be used in a targeted and well-thought-out manner so that they don’t put people at risk,” says Holzer.\nThese research projects were carried out in association with the Pennsylvania State University and Médecins Sans Frontières.

{"id": 330, "text": "Do bacteria control their “walks” like we do? It might sound strange, but it’s a fundamental question. Understanding bacteria motility would not only expand our understanding of their behavior, but would also help us fight certain aggressive pathogens. However, the question has gone unanswered because microbiologists have lacked the tools to visualize bacterial filaments directly.\nUntil now, that is. Lorenzo Talà, a PhD student in the  at EPFL’s Institutes of Bioengineering and Global Health has developed a microscopy method that can directly observe the structures many bacteria use to crawl.\n“Bacterial surfaces are decorated with protein filaments involved in motility, adhesion, signaling and pathogenicity, which ultimately rule how bacteria interact with their environments,” says Talà. “However, they are so small that observing them in live cells is extremely complex. So we are left with little knowledge of their dynamic activities.”\nThis is especially true for structures known as “type IV pili”: nanometer-wide filaments that extend and retract from the surface of many bacteria, helping them walk in a way known as . The term might not sound very serious, but it mechanically activates virulence in certain pathogens – meaning that it is a prime target for fighting them.\nAnatomy of a bacterium, with pili covering its surface (credit: jack0m/iStockphoto)\nThe scientists studied the bacterium \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n, an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in soil. It is one of the most medically concerning bacteria: a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and of serious infections in cystic fibrosis, traumatic burns, and immunocompromised patients, it is now ranked #1 in the World Health Organization’s antibiotic resistant watch-list.\nBut do single bacteria orchestrate type IV pili motion to power their motility? “In our studies of type IV pili and mechano-activation of virulence in \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n, one technical paradox has been a source of frustration: pili, but also fimbriae, flagella, and injection systems permanently extend outside single cells, so why can’t we directly visualize them?” asks Talà.\nTo overcome this, the scientists explored an emerging microscopy method pioneered by their collaborator Philipp Kukura at Oxford University. Using a technique called interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), they were able to see these nanometers-wide filaments in live cells, without any chemical labels, at high speed, and in three dimensions.\n“iSCAT represents a major technological advance in microbiology,” says Persat. “We  the visualization technique and received extensive positive feedback among scientists across a variety of disciplines simply because we could finally dynamically observe pili in live bacteria straight out of culture.”\nTo understand the coordination of type IV pili movements, the scientists focused on precisely timing the succession of surface attachment, retraction, and cell body displacements using iSCAT. The approach revealed three key events that lead to successful and energetically efficient movement across surfaces.\nFirst, contact of the pilus tip with the surface activates a molecular motor that initiates retraction. Second, this retraction enhances the attachment of the pilus to the surface, increasing the bacterium’s displacement. Finally, a second, stronger molecular motor enforces the bacterium’s displacement under high friction.\nThis sequence shows that pili act as sensors, and reveals a new mechanism by which bacteria interact with surfaces. It also reveals that bacteria use sensory mechanisms to coordinate the dynamic motion of their motility machineries, in a striking analogy to the way higher organisms, including humans, move their limbs to generate displacement.\n“The human central nervous system processes mechanosensory signals to sequentially engage motor components, thus triggering muscle contraction and resulting in gait,” explains Talà. “Our work shows that in the same manner, bacteria use a sense of touch to sequentially engage molecular motors, generating cycles of pili extension and retraction that result in a walk pattern.”\nOther contributors\nUniversity of Oxford", "summary": "EPFL biophysicists have been able to directly study the way bacteria move on surfaces, revealing a molecular machinery reminiscent of motor reflexes.", "claim": "Talà biophysicists have been able to directly study the way bacteria move on surfaces, revealing a molecular machinery reminiscent of motor reflexes.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 0], "noise": false}
{"id": 331, "text": "Croatia and EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland) officially announced their intention to create a centre of scientific-technological excellence. Located in Croatia, its goal will be to launch the careers of young, high-potential researchers in order to stimulate strategic research and economically relevant technological innovation and limit the loss of intellectual capital from the country. The project proposal will be submitted to the European Commission as part of the Horizon 2020 framework programme. If approved, it will receive up to €20 million in funding from the EU, bring together more than 70 collaborators and give creative young talents who are just setting out in their careers the stimulating opportunity to lead their first teams and to conduct visionary research in selected fields that are considered of key importance to the future of Croatian economy. EPFL, recognized in Europe for its success in applying a strategy based on recruiting and developing the careers of young researchers, hopes to help transfer its demonstrated successful expertise in this important strategic area to Croatia. The partners have been in discussions since summer 2013, and their ambition is to make this centre into an international leader in its specific domains by 2020. \n Such a platform should help strengthen other Croatian-EU cooperation projects.\n The official project announcement took place in Zagreb on March 7, 2014, in the presence of the Croatian Vice-Minister of Science, Education and Sport Saša Zelenika, the Croatian Vice-Minister of Regional Development Jakša Puljiz, the Swiss State Secretary of Education, Research and Innovation Mauro Dell Ambrogio, the President of the Swiss National Science Foundation Martin Vetterli, and EPFL President Patrick Aebischer.\n The centre will host a dozen scientific teams in Croatia, each one led by a promising young professor, selected after an open excellence competition. In all, more than 70 individuals could be working in the centre. The research areas concerned – notably engineering, health-related and electronics – correspond to activity sectors identified as crucial for Croatia’s improved economic development. \nInvesting in young researchers – a strategy for a scientific Europe\n EPFL has established a highly effective means of recruiting promising young scientific talents and giving them the means to realize their potential: the “Tenure Track” system, in which they are placed at the head of a research team with a significant budget at their disposal for a seven-year probationary period. Currently, EPFL has 60 of these young tenure track assistant professors in its faculty. In a sign of its success, out of 100 Tenure Track professors who have started their careers at EPFL, more than a third obtained an ERC starting grant – the most prestigious grant awarded by the European Research Council to young researchers, carrying up to €2 million in funding. \n According to EPFL President Patrick Aebischer, measures such as these are necessary not only to stimulate research, but also to enable Europe to retain its most talented researchers. “Young European scientists must often wait for many years before a professorship becomes available. Many of them leave for the U.S., never to return,” he explains. “Whether it’s in Switzerland or in Croatia, we must put a system in place that allows them to reach their full potential and establish their careers in Europe, and in doing so make a local contribution to value and job creation.” \nThe project proposal will soon be submitted to the European Commission \n \"We must promote the career of our young researchers. This is the main expectation of our joint project with EPFL,” explains Saša Zelenika, Croatia’s Vice-Minister of Science, Education and Sports.\n Based on its experience, EPFL will take responsibility for launching and initial management of the institute, with help from international and Croatian scientific committees. The project will be part of the European Horizon 2020 programme, which includes a section entitled “Teaming” that is dedicated to the transfer of expertise and strategies between countries.\n The project proposal will be submitted in September 2014. If approved by the European Commission, EPFL and the Croatian partners will have an additional year to submit a detailed action plan.

They trigger the immune system to produce antibodies that protect us against infection. However, we still lack efficacious vaccines for many important pathogens, like the flu or dengue fever. “When a vaccine doesn’t work well, we tend to think that it’s because the antibodies produced are not protective,” says Bruno Correia, a professor at the Laboratory of Protein Design & Immunoengineering (LPDI) in EPFL’s School of Engineering. “It’s usually because our immune system is simply making the wrong type of antibodies”. Scientists in Correia’s lab have now developed a strategy to design artificial proteins that very precisely instruct the body’s immune system which antibodies to produce. The study has been published in the journal Science.\nBuilding proteins like Legos\nThe EPFL team created artificial proteins designed using computational methods. “They don’t exist in nature,” says Che Yang, a PhD student and co-leading author in the study.\n “We developed a protein design algorithm called TopoBuilder.

{"id": 333, "text": "Swiss democracy produces lots of data: municipality-by-municipality ballot results and the votes of the National Council are publicly available, as are the responses of the candidates and voters who filled in the questionnaire on the \"smartvote\" voter recommendation website before the 2011 Federal elections. Under the supervision of professors Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran, Vincent Etter and Julien Herzen, PhD students in the Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory, explored these data to reveal a number of interesting facts. They are currently continuing their research by creating a platform, Predikon.ch, that will be able to predict the results of a federal vote based on initial results coming in from municipalities and past data.\nYes, the “Röstigraben” exists! “And it was a bit of a surprise,” admits Etter. They performed a dimensionality reduction on the municipal results for all votes since 1981. This is a standard tool used by statisticians who specialize in data analysis to produce a graphical representation of data. Two groups emerged: one French-speaking and one of German-speaking. (You can see it at ). “The municipalities closest to the intersection of the groups on the graph are also those that are geographically closest to the linguistic border,” notes Herzen.\nWhile the linguistic divide is easy to see on this representation, it’s a bit more difficult to make sense of the graph’s axes, obtained by the dimensionality reduction. “It’s not the traditional left-right and conservative-liberal divisions,” explains Etter. Over time, the Italian-speaking regions seem to move away from the French-speaking districts to join their German-speaking compatriots. In a future version of their interactive graphic, the scientists plan to add a temporal cursor that will highlight this.\nRight and Left are alive and well \nAlthough the Röstigraben can’t be explained by either the left-right or conservative-liberal divide, these classical political categories are alive and well when it comes to politicians, as the duo found when they applied the same data visualization tools to information from the 2011 Federal elections obtained from the voter recommendation website smartvote.ch.\nWith the same data analysis approach, the researchers explored whether the political parties were really all that different from one another. They showed that the positions of 25.8% of the socialist candidates were closer to the median of the green party positions than to their own party’s position. Inversely, the proportion was 18.8%. But the overlap was greatest in the PBD, with more than half of its politicians closer to the median of another party (most often the PDC, 33.1%) than aligned with their own.\nEtter and Herzen also showed that it would be easy for a candidate who filled in his or her own smartvote profile to choose responses that would optimize the number of times they would be recommended to voters that trusted the site. However, this was evidently not exploited in 2011, since the difference between the voting records of parliamentary politicians and their smartvote profile was very small.\nEbikon, a small town that has it right\nThe next step for the two computer scientists is to predict the result of an vote by combining the initial votes coming in from a small number of municipalities with the database of past results. The platform they are developing with Victor Kristof, a student in Communication systems, is called Predikon.ch, a combination of the words “Prediction” and “Ebikon.” This small town near Lucerne (population 12,000) appeared in their preparatory studies to be the one whose results most reliably predicted the federal result. “By doing the exercise with past votes, in 96% of the cases, the result in Ebikon gave us the correct result at the federal level,” explains Herzen.\nThe project’s development is hampered by the fact that each of Switzerland’s 26 cantons has a different system for presenting its data, and that often these platforms are only online for a few hours the day the vote is held, while ballots are still being counted; but nonetheless there’s a good chance that the Predikon index will soon be mentioned in the news updates on these Sundays.\nThe Predikon project, along with all of Etter and Herzen’s research, will be presented at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences Open House, Saturday November 22 at 3:30 pm in room BC420, during a seminar entitled “La démocratie suisse vue par les données.” Throughout the Open House, a Predikon demo will be held on the fourth floor of the BC building.

{"id": 334, "text": "Is there life on a distant planet? One way astronomers are trying to find out is by analyzing the light that is scattered off a planet’s atmosphere. Some of that light, which originates from the stars it orbits, has interacted with its atmosphere, and provides important clues to the gases it contains. If gases like oxygen, methane or ozone are detected, that could indicate the presence of living organisms. Such gases are known as biosignatures. A team of scientists from EPFL and Tor Vergata University of Rome has developed a statistical model that can help astronomers interpret the results of the search for these “signs of life”. Their research has just been published in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nSince the first exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun – was discovered 25 years ago, over 4,300 more have been identified. And the list is still growing: a new one is discovered every two or three days. Around 200 of the exoplanets found so far are telluric, meaning they consist mainly of rocks, like the Earth. While that’s not the only requirement for a planet to be able to host life – it also needs to have water and be a certain distance from its sun – it is one criterion that astronomers are using to focus their search.\nIn the coming years, the use of gas spectroscopy to detect biosignatures in planets’ atmospheres will become an increasingly important element of astronomy. Many research programs are already under way in this area, such as for the CHEOPS exoplanet-hunting satellite, which went into orbit in December 2019, and the James-Webb optical telescope, scheduled to be launched in October 2021.\nStarting with an unknown\nWhile much progress has been made on detecting exoplanetary biosignatures, several question marks remain. What are the implications of this kind of research? And how should we interpret the results? What if just one biosignature is detected on a planet? Or what if no biosignatures are detected – what should we conclude? Those kinds of questions are what the EPFL-Tor Vergata scientists set out to answer with their new model.\nTheir work tackles the problem from a new angle. Traditionally, astronomers have looked for life on another planet based on what we know about life and biological evolution on Earth. But with their new method, the scientists started with an unknown: how many other planets in our galaxy have some form of life. Their model incorporates factors like the estimated number of other stars in the galaxy similar to the Sun and how many telluric planets might be orbiting within a habitable distance from those stars. It uses Bayesian statistics – particularly well suited to small sample sizes – to calculate the probability of life in our galaxy based on how many biosignatures are detected: one, several or none at all.\n“Intuitively it makes sense that if we find life on one other planet, there are probably many others in the galaxy with some type of living organism. But how many?” says Amedeo Balbi, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics in Tor Vergata’s Physics Department. “Our model turns that intuitive assumption into a statistical calculation, and lets us determine exactly what the numbers mean in terms of quantity and frequency.”\n“Astronomers already use various assumptions to evaluate how credible life is on a given planet,” says Claudio Grimaldi, a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPMC) who is also affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Rome. “One of our research goals was thus to develop a method for weighing and comparing those assumptions in light of the new data that will be collected over the coming years.”\nSpreading from one planet to another\nGiven the small number of planets that will likely be examined in the near future, and assuming that life will emerge independently on any one planet, the EPFL-Tor Vergata study found that if even just one biosignature is detected, we can conclude with a greater than 95% probability that there are over 100,000 inhabited planets in the galaxy – more than the number of pulsars, which are objects created when a massive star explodes at the end of its life. On the other hand, if no biosignatures are detected, we cannot necessarily conclude that other forms of life do not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.\nThe scientists also looked at the theory of panspermia, which states that instead of emerging independently on a given planet, life forms could be carried over from another planet – such as through organic matter or microscopic organisms being carried on comets or spreading between neighboring planets. This implies that the probability of life on a planet also depends on how far it is from other planets and how easily various life forms – whose physical characteristics could be extremely different from those we are familiar with – are able to resist the extreme conditions of space travel and adapt to the new planet. Factoring in panspermia alters the inferred number of inhabited planets elsewhere in the galaxy.", "summary": "One way to determine whether there is life on another planet is to look for biosignatures in the light that is scattered off its atmosphere.

{"id": 335, "text": "One day as you reach Geneva’s main train station to start your daily commute you notice a new sign showing some kind of underwater train. At first, you focus on the ripples marking the surface of the water. But as you approach and look more closely at the sign, you notice something strange about the rails – the train has no wheels. It seems to be suspended in mid-air.\nYou follow the arrow, which leads you to an elevator a few meters further on. The destination is indicated above the door: Lausanne. That’s where you’re going. So you get on the elevator, and it takes you deep below the ground. Your fellow passengers look as confused as you are. The elevator doors finally open and you step into a brand-new station already packed with commuters. You get on board. As the train pulls out of the station you realize that it’s not running on the rails but ‘levitating’ above them. You get to Lausanne in around ten minutes. You’re lost for words when it dawns on you that your journey has taken you under the waters of Lake Geneva. Another elevator is waiting for you as you get off the train. It takes you back up to the surface into the familiar bustle of Lausanne’s train station.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Swissmetro\nElia Notari has just obtained his Master’s in civil engineering from EPFL. He came up with this visionary train line for his Master’s project, which was supervised by Aurelio Muttoni, a full professor and director of EPFL’s Structural Concrete Laboratory (IBETON). Those with a sharp eye will no doubt notice some similarities with the Swissmetro project, an idea for a futuristic metro system developed at EPFL in the 1990s. Swissmetro was intended to link the main towns in Switzerland at a speed of 500 km/h. Notari’s Master’s project is in fact a variation of the Swissmetro design, which put the trains in underground tunnels rather than through Lake Geneva.\nBut is it really possible to build a metro through Lake Geneva? What some consider sacrilegious is a fascinating technical challenge for others – one that draws on multiple disciplines, covering everything from structural design and hydraulics to geotechnics and the environmental impact.\nA submerged bridge\nNotari focused on designing and calculating the dimensions of a double-track tunnel made out of reinforced concrete: an ‘underwater bridge’ – or to be more specific, a ‘floating underwater tunnel.’ Covering a distance of around 55 kilometers, the tracks would use magnetic levitation – or maglev – to get the train to travel at high speed. With this type of system, one set of magnets is placed on the tracks; a second set on the bottom of the train is repelled by the first, which pushes the train up off the track. In some cases, the repulsive force of the magnet is controlled by a current running along the track.\nFig.1: The double-track tunnel and its compartments containing ballast. © EPFL 2018 / E. Notari\nThis kind of system is not yet used in transportation, but several countries are now testing prototypes and plan to start building soon. In 2015, the Shinkansen Maglev prototype developed by Japanese company JR Central set the world record when it reached a speed of 603 km/h. For his work, Notari drew on policy guidelines developed in Germany, which are better suited to short distances, like that between Geneva and Lausanne.\nSeveral options to choose from\nThere are several options available to an engineer looking to build a train that can run under water. The tunnel can, for example, be set under the ground, as is the case with Eurostar, which was opened in 1994 across the Channel and connects London with several cities in mainland Europe.\nNorway is looking into another option to link its fjords with its cities – an underwater tunnel suspended at a series of floats that can be seen on the surface. Yet another solution involves putting metal rods in the ground to anchor down the tunnel. However, this will only work if the tunnel itself is buoyant enough.\nYet none of these options was quite right for Lake Geneva. This was mainly because its clear waters make it popular among sports enthusiasts and esthetes, which meant the student had to design a tunnel that was at least 20 meters deep and not visible from the surface.\n30 meters underwater\nNotari therefore went with a bridge located 30 meters below the surface and supported by piers made of reinforced concrete. This solution was the most rigid, which is a crucial factor for a high-speed train. It was also the most secure in the event of internal flooding. Other advantages also guided his choice. With this solution, the temperature would be constant throughout the entire structure, which would prevent any thermal deformation as a result of the changing seasons. Waves are also at their weakest at that kind of depth, and the bridge would not get in the way of any existing structures.\nWhat’s more, the hydrostatic pressure would be a bonus in terms of the solidity of the 199 modules making up the concrete tunnels. The engineer’s tunnel measures 14.5 meters in diameter and is designed to withstand earthquakes, internal and external explosions, flooding, tsunamis and landslides. The structure would include compartments containing ballast to make it possible to stabilize the tunnel at any time based on Archimedes’ principle. To adjust to the lake’s varying depth, the height of the pillars, which are 6 meters in diameter, would range from 7.5 to 45 meters. The bridge’s route would follow the lakeshore (see Fig.2. on the left). And the two ends of the line would be connected to the Geneva and Lausanne train stations via elevators.\nToo technically feasible to be utopian\nThe idea of an underwater bridge in Lake Geneva doesn’t seem so utopian to the freshly graduated engineer. “The concept of an underwater bridge has been around for a century,” says Notari. “Our know-how has advanced significantly thanks to projects like oil platforms and offshore wind farms. What’s missing is a pioneering investor who’s ready to put up the money to fund the construction of a prototype.”\nFor Aurelio Muttoni, high-speed transportation projects have great potential: “The solution that Elia studied is technically realistic. I myself came up with a similar solution in the 1990s when studying the feasibility of crossing Lake Lugano as part of the southern extension of the Gotthard high-speed train line.” Muttoni adds that he was inspired by Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s ultra-fast train, when suggesting the topic to his student. (See the .)\nBut given the complexity of the situation, the environmental challenges and the high costs of this kind of project, Muttoni is convinced that it will be many years before Lake Geneva gets an underwater tunnel.", "summary": "Summer series.

This area has large international teams of researchers, dedicated to the economic and industrial development of the region. How best to take advantage of this unique opportunity and offer researchers a place to work, while increasing the visibility of this promising scientific momentum? It is in response to these global issues that NEUROPOLIS was conceived. The project meets a major challenge of the 21st century: understanding the human brain while creating a unique space in which researchers can interact with the public.\nOne Project, Two Sites\n To achieve this, the NEUROPOLIS project will construct two entities:\n —A research infrastructure in Lausanne constructed on the grounds of the institutions of higher learning, UNIL-EPFL. This spot will also have a public space dedicated to the brain;\n —A Geneva-located infrastructure near the University Hospital will house a new Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging. \n The construction of these two sites is estimated to cost 110 million Swiss Francs. They would be able to accommodate as many as 1,000 scientific and technological collaborators.\nPublic-Private Partnership (Canton of Vaud :: Swiss Confederation :: Rolex)\n The realization of this ambition wouldn’t have seen the light of day without the outstanding contribution of several actors from both the public and private sectors. The Canton of Vaud provided an essential piece in the foundation of this project through a financial contribution of 35 million Swiss Francs for the construction of the building in Lausanne – and if necessary, offering a site on the university campus. Neuropolis will be launched thanks to the renewed support of the Rolex Group. The brand seeks to encourage research and a pioneering spirit in a leading sector that concerns all of humanity. “A strong historical connection exists between Rolex and EPFL, with the Rolex Learning Center as one of the most iconic examples of that relationship. With NEUROPOLIS, Rolex reiterates its strong sense of social responsibility on the local and global levels, and is pleased to assist in a world-class project that represents a fundamental advance in the field of neuroscience. The participation of Rolex in such a visionary project, such a decisive human and scientific adventure, echoes the brand’s perpetual quest for innovation and excellence,” said Bertrand Gros, President of Rolex, SA.\n The Swiss Confederation and EPFL, through both their usual building program and a private funding campaign, will be responsible for the remainder of the investment.\nLausanne – The Nerve Center of the Blue Brain (EPFL) and the Human Brain Project (EU)\n NEUROPOLIS hosts the simulation platform of the Blue Brain Project and will manage the supercomputer’s resources remotely. The platform will host the huge databases necessary for neuroscience and other fields, as well as the simulation cockpit coordinated by teams of computer scientists and neuroscientists. Scientists worldwide will be able to use the computing power and software developed there; laboratories and workspaces for top international visitors will be installed. If selected by the European Union, the center will also host the “flagship” Human Brain Project (EU), a project that now has about 120 teams in 90 scientific institutions from 22 countries, including those in the partner hospital CHUV in Lausanne. The application has been submitted for a decision expected in early 2013.\nLausanne – A Bridge Between Science and the Public\n NEUROPOLIS is also for the general public. For the first time in Europe, an open and interactive space will be dedicated to neuroscience and the conquest of the brain. The Center for Scientific Simulation will provide the entertainment and the multiple mechanisms of thought will be illuminated there for everyone to enjoy and discover.\nLausanne – A New Research Platform with UNIL\n UNIL has begun refocusing its campus toward skills of basic neuroscience and is already home to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). NEUROPOLIS will help accelerate the development strategy of simulation-based science, such as evolutionary biology and oncology, and continue the trajectory of Computational Science (involving significant resources for integrating large amounts of data) in other fields which require the prediction and analysis of interactions between many sub-systems: environmental and earth sciences (continental drift or natural disasters), economics, as well as finance and the human and social sciences.\nGeneva – A New Institute of Molecular Imaging (UNIGE)\n Taking advantage of the expertise developed in the Geneva area and of existing infrastructure in the field of Neuroscience, The University of Geneva and the Canton Hospital, in collaboration with EPFL, will construct an Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging in Geneva. These activities, involving several parallel imaging techniques and built-in analysis, will focus on neuro-imaging, chronic diseases, neurological degeneration, and aging.

{"id": 337, "text": "Around a dozen teams from six European countries are gearing up to compete in the sixth annual HydroContest, which will be held on Lake Neuchâtel in Yverdon-les-Bains this year from 1 to 8 September. This year’s contest is more specifically called HydroContest-X, because it is being organized jointly by three universities in French-speaking Switzerland: EPFL, the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture (HEIA-FR) and the Vaud School of Management and Engineering (HEIG-VD). The contest, which is supported every year by the Hydros Foundation, challenges students to design, build and race the most energy-efficient boats possible. The event is free of charge and open to the public.\nEach team designs and builds miniature, remote-controlled boats to compete in two contest categories. The two categories are complementary, like Laurel and Hardy – one for thin and light boats, where the aim is to sail fast and far; the other for bigger and heavier ones, which must haul 200 kg of cargo to simulate a freight vessel. Boats in both categories run on batteries provided by the organizer. The event aims to not only enhance students’ education, but also build awareness about the need for cleaner, more energy-efficient shipping vessels and spark ideas for technology in this area.\nAn asymmetric boat\nEPFL students have participated in the contest every year since it was launched. And this year’s team will show up in Yverdon-les-Bains with not two, but three boats. Two of them are from last year’s HydroContest. The first one, which competed in the Mass Transport category, is a hybrid between a catamaran and an airboat that sails on a thin cushion of air. It won the innovation prize last year but was eliminated during the quarterfinals. The second boat, which competed in the Private Boats category, is a twin-foil vessel designed in 2016. This boat proved to be fast but fairly unstable; it came in second place last year behind HEIA-FR.\nThe third boat – new this year – is designed after a prao, a traditional Indonesian sailboat. It has only one hull and one lateral float, making it asymmetric. “We designed it over the past year, it works, and we’ve tested it several times, yet it still needs to be tweaked,” says Sébastien Jaffaux, head of EPFL’s HydroContest team. “So at this point it’s too early to enter it in the race. But if we get the new foils in time, we’ll run demos on the lake.”\nBut the students have big plans for next year, when, as part of the Swiss Solar Boat project, they will use their prototypes as test platforms for the 2020 Monaco Solar & Energy Boat Challenge. The boats in that event – another international competition – will measure over six meters long and have a sailor on board.\nFollow HydroContest EPFL Team on Facebook:  and Twitter: @Hydro_EPFL_Team", "summary": "This year, three universities from French-speaking Switzerland – EPFL, HEIA-FR and HEIG-VD – will co-host the sixth annual HydroContest competition, challenging student teams to come up with fast, energy-efficient boat designs.", "claim": "This year, three universities from French-speaking Switzerland – EPFL, HEIA-FR and HEIG-VD – will co-host the sixth annual HydroContest competition, challenging student teams to come up with fast, energy-efficient boat designs.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}

From there, over the course of three years it will observe some 500 particularly bright stars and gather as much information as possible about their planets. To do this, it will use the method of detecting transits, in other words, diminishing brightness when the planet passes between its star and the earth. Although minute, these movements are detectible by sharp instruments such as the telescope from this Swiss project.\nGas or Telluric\nFor these measurements, researchers can calculate the diameter of planets that eclipse their stars. This complementary detection method, called radial velocity, measures their mass. In combining these two pieces of information, one can determine both the density of these objects and whether they are more likely gaseous, like Jupiter or Saturn, or telluric, like Mars or Earth.

{"id": 339, "text": "Instead of going on a diet, why not leave the suburbs and move downtown to drop some weight? In reality, it might not be quite that simple, but a recent study by researchers from the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and EPFL has shown that, for adults, place of residence has an impact on body-mass-index, an indicator used to classify people’s weight, that goes beyond income levels. Their findings rely on data gathered over 10 years in the canton of Geneva and were published in the journal Nature Nutrition and Diabetes. They highlight the need for a fine-grained assessment of public health and provide insights that could help guide campaigns to prevent obesity.\nPublic health specialists long ago connected the dots between people’s socioeconomic context and social networks on their health and obesity rates. In particular, body-mass-index (BMI) – a measure that describes body shape based on height and weight – has been believed to reflect the income and the average BMI of their social circles. As a result, obesity prevention campaigns have typically targeted large swaths of the population in low-income neighborhoods. But the data gathered from thousands of adults and children living in Geneva beg for a subtler interpretation.\nHealth data for more than 6600 adults, including measured height and weight, were collected from 2001 to 2010 as part of the Bus Santé population-based study, initiated and carried out by Idris Guessous of the Geneva University Hospitals. The campaign included several units including a mobile examination unit that went to several places in the State to evaluate the health of the canton’s residents. The dataset was rounded off with health evaluations of more than 3600 children, obtained in schools across the canton in 2011.\nEvaluating these data geographically confirmed that adults’ and children’s BMI values are not distributed randomly on a map of the canton. Instead, they were found to divide the map into regions with predominantly high or low values, and a larger one where neither trend prevailed. To the south of the Rhone River, the researchers detected a region characterized by low BMI values. North or the Rhone, and to the west of the Praille district, values of high BMI were overrepresented. Between the two, the researchers detected a large “neutral” belt, with a mixed population.\nRed dots represent adults with a high BMI that are surrounded by adults with similarly high BMI values (high-high). Blue dots represent the opposite situation (low-low). White dots mean that neither trend is detected. Purple and pink dots represent low-high and high-low respectively.\n Source:\nNature, 2014.\nThe study revealed two surprising features. First, high adult BMI values did not always overlap with those for children, especially in the heart of the city, north of the Rhone River. And second, at least for adults, the researchers found that differences in income were not enough to explain their findings. But according to the researchers, there are a number other of potential causes, including urban planning, social networks, sport infrastructure, and the promotion of softer forms of mobility, such as walking, biking, or public transportation. In the future, the researchers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographical Information Systems, who performed the spatial analysis of the results, will seek to tease out the effect of each of these and other factors on BMI.\nThe study brings to light the importance of finer-grained analysis of community health, both in terms of to geography and age. Lessons learned will primarily benefit other communities seeking to more accurately analyze the health of their residents. But they will also help those involved in setting up anti-obesity campaigns, allowing them to more accurately tailor adult or child specific interventions to the target audience they aim to reach.", "summary": "Whether you live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the canton of Geneva.", "claim": "Whether you live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the the Geneva University Hospitals of Geneva.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [39, 42], "noise": false}
{"id": 340, "text": "The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.\nThey realized that one building in particular – the Saint-François parking lot – was at the core of the problem. This building links the city center with the Flon neighborhood, meaning that it could play a strategic role in turning downtown Lausanne car-free. So they decided to expand and completely transform it. “Our building holds a restaurant, a co-op market with local products, and a hotel that offers medium-term accommodations such as for artists, conference-goers and businesspeople,” says Flavien Davin. “There would also be common spaces and a co-working area to promote interaction between these groups.”\nThe students also added a public staircase along the side of the building. “We felt that this ‘patchwork building’ deserved an important role, as it sits above one of Lausanne’s public transport hubs,” says Bernard Valette, co-author of the study. “Currently, people who use the parking lot do not have direct access to the various means of public transport beneath the building. Our aim was to better coordinate the building’s different purposes.”\nPedestrian zone and distribution depots\nTheir project also encompasses the Flon train station, which is the third largest in French-speaking Switzerland in terms of passenger numbers. “Our vision was to transform the downtown area, between the Flon neighborhood and Saint-François, into a huge pedestrian zone. That would require expanding the public transport system and totally redesigning the city’s logistics,” says Valette. The students’ project takes into account the future M3 metro line, which will strengthen the link between the north and south of the city, as well as the future tram line that will connect the western side of the city to its center. They would add yet another tramline, between Morges and Lutry, in order to relieve throughtraffic south of the city.\nMaintaining the flow of goods to stores and residents in a car-free city center would require some radical thinking. For this, the students designed three major ‘automated distribution depots’ in the city through which all goods headed for downtown stores and residents would pass. These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.\nAccording to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.\nChanges ahead \nIs all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”\nSolving two problems at once\nThe students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”", "summary": "A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035.

{"id": 342, "text": "How can we constantly monitor the stability of a bridge or detect a leak in a gas pipeline in real time? A method based on optical fibers has become the norm in recent years. By carefully measuring the path of light in fibers up to 100 kilometers long, we can glean information on the temperature, pressure and intensity of magnetic fields along the entire length of the fiber. It’s similar to a nerve, which tells us the intensity and location of a stimulus.\nBut this method is nearing its limits. Depending on the planned use, it’s necessary to sacrifice length, accept a lower resolution or add more equipment – a costly undertaking.\nOne hair, a million measurements\nThanks to the work done by EPFL’s Group for Fibre Optics (GFO), it will now be possible to maintain an extremely fine resolution even when the fiber gets longer. “We have no trouble getting a million measurement points from one optical fiber the width of a hair, for a resolution of one centimeter over 10 kilometers,” said Luc Thévenaz, the director of GFO. That’s 100 times more precise than current techniques.\nMeasurements made with this type of instrument have to be processed, because they include ‘parasites’. But the ratio between useful signals and noise cannot go below a certain threshold, otherwise the measurements will not be reliable.\nGraphic arts to the rescue\nThe EPFL researchers were able to boost this ratio significantly by borrowing a technology from an entirely different field: graphic arts. “The values collected from these measurement points on the fiber can be represented as a matrix of pixels – a two-dimensional image,” said Dr. Thévenaz. \"By applying standard graphic filters to this image, like those found in Photoshop, we were able to reduce the noise inherent in this measurement technique very effectively and identify the desired values more precisely.”\nPursuing this logic further, his teams also transformed more complex measurements, which take into account several parameters simultaneously, into video sequences. Here again, the magic of ‘standard’ video filters was at work.\nIn Dr. Thévenaz’s view, these advances, which are described in articles appearing in \nLight: Science & Applications – Nature\n and \nNature Communications\n, bring the field of distributed optical fiber sensors into a new era simply by using software techniques. This approach is, by definition, less expensive than adding more measuring devices.", "summary": "Image processing tools can improve our ability to monitor the soundness of infrastructure like bridges and gas pipelines.

Moreover, the nerves of non-amputees can also be stimulated to feel roughness, without the need of surgery, meaning that prosthetic touch for amputees can now be developed and safely tested on intact individuals.\nThe technology to deliver this sophisticated tactile information was developed by Silvestro Micera and his team at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and SSSA (Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna) together with Calogero Oddo and his team at SSSA. The results, , provide new and accelerated avenues for developing bionic prostheses, enhanced with sensory feedback.\n\"The stimulation felt almost like what I would feel with my hand,\" says amputee Dennis Aabo Sørensen about the artificial fingertip connected to his stump. He continues, \"I still feel my missing hand, it is always clenched in a fist. I felt the texture sensations at the tip of the index finger of my phantom hand.\"\nSørensen is the first person in the world to recognize texture using a bionic fingertip connected to electrodes that were surgically implanted above his stump.\nNerves in Sørensen's arm were wired to an artificial fingertip equipped with sensors. A machine controlled the movement of the fingertip over different pieces of plastic engraved with different patterns, smooth or rough. As the fingertip moved across the textured plastic, the sensors generated an electrical signal. This signal was translated into a series of electrical spikes, imitating the language of the nervous system, then delivered to the nerves.\nSørensen could distinguish between rough and smooth surfaces 96% of the time.\nIn a , Sorensen's implants were connected to a sensory-enhanced prosthetic hand that allowed him to recognize shape and softness. In this new publication about texture in the journal eLife, the bionic fingertip attains a superior level of touch resolution.\nSimulating touch in non-amputees\n This same experiment testing coarseness was performed on non-amputees, without the need of surgery. The tactile information was delivered through fine needles that were temporarily attached to the arm's median nerve through the skin. The non-amputees were able to distinguish roughness in textures 77% of the time.\nBut does this information about touch from the bionic fingertip really resemble the feeling of touch from a real finger? The scientists tested this by comparing brain-wave activity of the non-amputees, once with the artificial fingertip and then with their own finger. The brain scans collected by an EEG cap on the subject's head revealed that activated regions in the brain were analogous.\nThe research demonstrates that the needles relay the information about texture in much the same way as the implanted electrodes, giving scientists new protocols to accelerate for improving touch resolution in prosthetics.\n\"This study merges fundamental sciences and applied engineering: it provides additional evidence that research in neuroprosthetics can contribute to the neuroscience debate, specifically about the neuronal mechanisms of the human sense of touch,\" says Calogero Oddo of the BioRobotics Institute of SSSA. \"It will also be translated to other applications such as artificial touch in robotics for surgery, rescue, and manufacturing.”\nThe research was carried out by EPFL and SSSA in collaboration with Università di Pisa, IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Università Campus Biomedico.\nThis work was partly supported by EU Grants TIME, NEBIAS and NANOBIOTOUCH, by the Italian grants NEMESIS (funded by the Italian Ministry of Health), PRIN/HandBot (funded by the Italian Ministry of Research), and PPR2 (funded by the National Institute for Insurance against Industrial Injuries), by the ENABLE project funded by the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering, and by the Swiss National Competence Center in Research in Robotics.", "summary": "An amputee feels rough or smooth textures in real-time — in his phantom hand — using an artificial fingertip connected to nerves in the arm.

While not all of them become professors, many find interesting opportunities in universities, as well as in industry.\n An FNS grant constitutes a first-rate opportunity, since it enables the doctoral student who has completed his/her thesis to continue his/her education in the university and the topic of his/her choice. The grant is awarded for a period of 18 months, and includes an allowance for personal expenses, an amount for travel expenses, and possibly also a contribution towards research and symposium costs. The amount granted depends on marital status, family-related responsibilities, and the cost of living in the country of residence. They are awarded independently of nationality, sex or family situation. Only the applicants’ competencies are taken into account. The researchers are thus able to devote their entire attention to their research work. The only condition for applying is to have obtained a doctoral degree at EPFL. “All those who received one of these grants said that it had been a springboard for their professional career”, adds Caroline Vandevyver.\n EPFL and its teachers strongly encourage these research periods abroad. They constitute an almost inevitable step in a scientific career, are practically essential in becoming a professor, and a major asset in being selected for important positions. The likelihood of becoming a professor is greater for someone who has benefited from a grant. In a recent study, the EPFL Research Commission has observed that 17% of post-doctoral scholarship students began an academic career, but that only 23% of them came back to Switzerland to pursue it. We might therefore wonder: what is the benefit for a university such as EPFL to see its best people leave? This question of brain drain versus brain gain has been assessed in depth both at EPFL and the FNS, and the two institutions have reached the conclusion that the benefits of this type of sponsorship is extremely positive, and contributes to increasing the visibility of Switzerland internationally. FNS scholarship students are ambassadors for EPFL worldwide: they increase the institutions renown, and stimulate other researchers to come to study or work in Switzerland. Knowledge is on the move, is no longer limited to domestic borders, and enriches exchanges between researchers. It’s thus by emphasizing openness that institutions such as EPFL encourage scientific careers and guarantee that there is a continued supply of scientists.", "summary": "16% of doctoral students who were granted fellowships for prospective researchers by the Swiss National Science Foundation (FNS), giving them the possibility to do research abroad, have obtained a professorship, some of them at EPFL.", "claim": "16% of doctoral students who were granted fellowships for prospective researchers by the Swiss National Science Foundation (FNS), giving you the possibility to do research abroad, have obtained a professorship, some of them at EPFL.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [23, 23], "noise": false}
{"id": 347, "text": "Tomorroy, on February 15th, a 45-meter asteroid dubbed 2012 DA14 will draw the attention of the scientific community, since it will - even below the geosynchronous orbit that hosts thousands of satellites. Hopefully without harm, and it will soon be forgotten.\nBut for the longer-term studies, Asteroid Vesta is a kind of movie star for planetologists. With 500 km in diameter, it is one of the three largest objects of the asteroid belt that formed simultaneously to the solar system we live in, four billion years ago. It is considered a “protoplanet” or a precursor of a planet. Moreover, it is the only known asteroid to have an earth-like structure – with a core, mantle and crust.\nComputer simulation reconstructs collisions between asteroids \n Using a three-dimensional computer simulation, Martin Jutzi from the Center for Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern has now accurately reconstructed how Vesta collided with other asteroids twice over a billion years ago. The models show that the protoplanet owes its elliptical shape to these collisions and that they also scarred its surface structure. They are presented in a study published today on the front page of \nNature \nmagazine.\nThe simulations also enable detailed conclusions on the composition and properties of Vesta’s interior to be drawn for the first time, which helps us to better understand the evolution of the solar system. «Based on the sort and distribution of this material at the surface of the asteroid, we are able to precisely reconstruct the various inner layers of Vesta down to a depth of 100 km», explains Philippe Gillet, head of EPFL’s Earth and Planetary Science Laboratory.\nBased on this information, the computer simulations demontrarte exactly how two consecutive impacts of celestial bodies led to the formation of the observed overlapping basins, which almost span the entire southern hemisphere of Vesta. The models show the size (66 and 64 kilometres in diameter), velocity (5.4 kilometres per second) and the impact angle of the bodies that collided with Vesta. This reveals a lot about the properties of the objects that were near the protoplanet a billion years ago.\nThe final images of the simulations closely resemble the shape and topography of Vesta’s southern hemisphere as observed by the Dawn mission. The models even accurately reproduce the spiral-shaped structures inside the youngest crater which are visible on images from the Dawn mission. «This shows how reliable our method is», rejoices Jutzi. “It also proves that the method we used to determine the composition of Vesta’s inner layers are accurate, adds Gillet. The simulation does show that some of the debris were ejected from a depth of 100 kilometers.”\n«The fact that we can now look inside such protoplanets makes entirely new perspectives in the re¬search on the history of our solar system possible,» says Jutzi.", "summary": "Models boost the significance of image and measurement data from space missions and help to understand our solar system.

{"id": 348, "text": "A group of spintronics researchers at EPFL is using new materials to reveal more of the many capabilities of electrons. The field of spintronics seeks to tap the quantum properties of “spin,” the term often used to describe one of the fundamental properties of elementary particles – in this case, electrons. This is among the most cutting-edge areas of research in electronics today.\nResearchers working in the Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES), which is run by Professor Andras Kis, were able to quantify these quantum properties for a category of two-dimensional semiconductors called transition metal dichalcogenides, or TMDCs. Their research projects, which were published recently in \nACS Nano\n and today in \nNature Communications\n, confirm that materials like graphene (C), molybdenite (MoS\n2\n) and tungsten diselenide (WSe\n2\n) offer, either alone or by combining some of their characteristics, new perspectives for the field of electronics – perspectives that could ultimately lead to smaller chips that generate less heat.\n“With the methods we’ve recently developed, we’ve shown that it is possible to access the spin in these TMDC materials, quantify it and use it to introduce new functionalities,” says Kis.\nThe device developed at the LANES is composed of monolayer MoS2 is the active channel, encapsulated between atomically flat h-BN layers and contacted to multilayer graphene.\nThis all takes place at an extremely small scale. In order to access these quantum properties, the researchers must work with high quality materials. “If we want to examine certain characteristics of electrons, including their energy, we need to be able to watch them move over relatively long distances without there being too much dispersion or disruption,” explains Kis.\nIn the form of waves\nThe researchers’ method allows them to obtain samples of sufficient quality both to observe how electrons move around in the form of waves and to quantify their energy.\nBut the LANES team was also able to access another quantum property. Spins of electrons and holes in this type of a 2D semiconductor can be in one of two states, which are conventionally described as being oriented upward – spin up – or downward – spin down. Their energy will be slightly different in each of these two states. That’s called spin splitting, and the EPFL researchers have measured it for the first time for electrons in TMDC materials.\nIn the second publication, the researchers wrote about how they used the spin splitting in a TMDC in order to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene without using a magnetic field.\nSpin splitting used in a TMDC to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene.\nThese discoveries are a step forward for the emerging field of spintronics and make it increasingly likely that a different property of charge carriers – i.e. spin, in addition to the electrical charge – will play a role in tomorrow’s electronic devices.\nThe work was performed in collaboration with Takashi Taniguchi and Kenji Watanabe from NIMS Japan (ACS Nano and Nature Comm. papers) and Barbaros Özyilmaz from National University of Singapore (ACS Nano paper).", "summary": "EPFL researchers have successfully measured some of the quantum properties of electrons in two-dimensional semiconductors.

By the back door, robotic vacuums are bringing cyberstuff into daily life; they’re among the first autonomous devices that can be easily used by ordinary households.\nThat’s all the impetus scientists needed to seize the opportunity and do a study. Understanding to what extent robots will influence daily life in the future is in fact one of the central issues being studied in the EPFL-based National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Robotics.\n In 2011, a team from EPFL’s Pedagogical Research and Support team (CRAFT) conducted a qualitative study on household robots. Nine compositionally diverse families (young, older, with and without children) were given a machine from one of the most common brands. “We interviewed the families before they got the robot, and then we followed them for six months, starting with their first contact with the device,” explains anthropologist and study co-author Valérie Bauwens.\nRapid and irrevocable decisions\n Seven criteria of varying importance – practical, but also emotional - were developed to judge the degree to which the families adopted the robots. Put to the test and further refined by this first field study, these criteria will be useful to engineers at EPFL and elsewhere who are thinking about the domestic robots of the future.\nIn the end only three of the nine families liked the automatic vacuum cleaners. “It was interesting to observe that the decision whether or not to abandon them was made really fast, after about only two weeks,” Bauwens says. “Our robots had very little time to prove themselves!”\nAmong the elements that the users didn’t like, the researchers listed the need to modify the setup of an apartment so that the robot could do its work correctly. In addition, they didn’t like having to change certain behaviors, such as leaving things on the floor, which compromised the machine’s performance. “We even had one user who was careful to put the coffee table up on the couch to make room for the robot to work,” says second author Julia Fink.\nKids are quickly bored\n The scientists also looked at the influence that these new “companions” might have on the family ecosystem. “Overall, we didn’t see many changes,” Bauwens says. “The mother is still generally in control of household organization, even with this tool.” Two of the study subjects, however, appropriated the device, giving it a name or talking to it. The children were at first very excited by the arrival of the new toy, but the older ones quickly lost interest. “It’s just a vacuum cleaner!” said one of them.\n The first robot to get a foothold in apartments is thus a kind of guinea pig. Its successors - such as “Ranger,” a robotic box under development at EPFL that encourages kids to put away their toys by amusing interactions such as speaking and moving its eyes - can benefit from the problems it encountered.

{"id": 350, "text": "In a paper published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers at EPFL’s Blue Brain Project, a Swiss Brain Research Initiative, have developed a new framework to work out how a single neuron in the brain operates.\nThe analysis was performed using cells from the Blue Brain’s virtual rodent cortex. The researchers expect other types of neurons – non-cortical or human – to operate in the same way.\nTheir results show that when a neuron receives input, the branches of the elaborate tree-like receptors extending from the neuron, known as dendrites, functionally work together in a way that is \nadjusted to the complexity of the input\n.\nThe strength of a synapse determines how strongly a neuron feels an electric signal coming from other neurons, and the act of learning changes this strength. By analyzing the “connectivity matrix” that determines how these synapses communicate with each other, the algorithm establishes when and where synapses group into independent learning units from the structural and electrical properties of dendrites. In other words, the new algorithm determines how the dendrites of neurons functionally break up into separate computing units and finds that they work together \ndynamically, depending on the workload,\n to process information\n.\nThe researchers liken their results to the functioning of computing technology already implemented today. This newly observed dendritic functionality acts like parallel computing units meaning that a neuron is able to process different aspects of the input in parallel, like supercomputers. Each of the parallel computing units can independently learn to adjust its output, much like the nodes in deep learning networks used in artificial intelligence (AI) models today. Comparable to cloud computing, a neuron dynamically breaks up into the number of separate computing units demanded by the workload of the input.\n“In the Blue Brain Project, this mathematical approach helps to ascertain functionally relevant clusters of neuronal input which are inputs that feed into the same parallel processing unit. This then enables us to determine the level of complexity at which to model cortical networks as we digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain,” explains Marc-Oliver Gewaltig, Section Manager in Blue Brain’s Simulation Neuroscience Division.\nParallel computing units of neurons can independently learn to adjust their output\nAdditionally, the research reveals how these parallel processing units influence learning, i.e. the change in connection strength between different neurons. The way a neuron learns depends on the number and location of parallel processors, which in turn depend on the signals arriving from other neurons. For instance, certain synapses that do not learn independently when the neuron’s input level is low, start to learn independently when the input levels are higher.\nTo date traditional learning algorithms (such as those currently used in A.I. applications) assume that neurons are static units that merely integrate and re-scale incoming signals. By contrast, the results show that the number and size of the independent subunits can be controlled by balanced input or shunting inhibition. The researchers propose that this temporary control of the compartmentalization constitutes a powerful mechanism for the branch-specific learning of input features.\n“The method finds that in many brain states, neurons have far fewer parallel processors than expected from dendritic branch patterns. Thus, many synapses appear to be in “grey zones” where they do not belong to any processing unit,” explains lead scientist and first author Willem Wybo. “However, in the brain, neurons receive varying levels of background input and our results show that the number of parallel processors varies with the level of background input, indicating that the same neuron might have different computational roles in different brain states.”\n“We are particularly excited about this observation since it sheds a new light on the role of up/down states in the brain and it also provides a reason as to why cortical inhibition is so location-specific. With the new insights, we can start looking for algorithms that exploit the rapid changes in pairing between processing units, offering us more insight into the fundamental question of how the brain computes,” concludes Gewaltig.", "summary": "How do neurons process information?

{"id": 353, "text": "In our information society, the synthesis, distribution, and processing of radio and microwave signals are ubiquitous in wireless networks, telecommunications, and radars. The current tendency is to use carriers in higher frequency bands, especially with looming bandwidth bottlenecks due to demands for e.g. 5G and the “Internet of Things”. “Microwave photonics”, a combination of microwave engineering and optoelectronics, might offer a solution.\nA key building block of microwave photonics is optical frequency combs, which provide hundreds of equidistant and mutually coherent laser lines. They are ultrashort optical pulses emitted with a stable repetition rate that corresponds precisely to the frequency spacing of comb lines. The photodetection of the pulses produces a microwave carrier.\nIn recent years there has been significant progress on chip-scale frequency combs generated from nonlinear microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers. These frequency combs rely on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons, which are ultrashort coherent light pulses circulating inside optical microresonators. Because of this, these frequency combs are commonly called “soliton microcombs”.\nGenerating soliton microcombs needs nonlinear microresonators, and these can be directly built on-chip using CMOS nanofabrication technology. The co-integration with electronic circuitry and integrated lasers paves the path to comb miniaturization, allowing a host of applications in metrology, spectroscopy and communications.\nPublishing in \nNature Photonics\n, an EPFL research team led by Tobias J. Kippenberg has now demonstrated integrated soliton microcombs with repetition rates as low as 10 GHz. This was achieved by significantly lowering the optical losses of integrated photonic waveguides based on silicon nitride, a material already used in CMOS micro-electronic circuits, and which has also been used in the last decade to build photonic integrated circuits that guide laser light on-chip.\nThe scientists were able to manufacture silicon nitride waveguides with the lowest loss in any photonic integrated circuit. Using this technology, the generated coherent soliton pulses have repetition rates in both the microwave K- (~20 GHz, used in 5G) and X-band (~10 GHz, used in radars).\nThe resulting microwave signals feature phase noise properties on par with or even lower than commercial electronic microwave synthesizers. The demonstration of integrated soliton microcombs at microwave repetition rates bridges the fields of integrated photonics, nonlinear optics and microwave photonics.\nThe EPFL team achieved a level of optical losses low enough to allow light to propagate nearly 1 meter in a waveguide that is only 1 micrometer in diameter –100 times smaller than that a human hair. This loss level is still more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value in optical fibers, but represents the lowest loss in any tightly confining waveguide for integrated nonlinear photonics to date.\nSuch low loss is the result of a new manufacturing process developed by EPFL scientists – the “silicon nitride photonic Damascene process”. “This process, when carried out using deep-ultraviolet stepper lithography, gives truly spectacular performance in terms of low loss, which is not attainable using conventional nanofabrication techniques,” says Junqiu Liu, the paper’s first author who also lead the fabrication of silicon nitride nanophotonic chips at EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi). “These microcombs, and their microwave signals, could be critical elements for building fully integrated low-noise microwave oscillators for future architectures of radars and information networks.”\nThe EPFL team is already working with collaborators in US to develop hybrid-integrated soliton microcomb modules that combine chip-scale semiconductor lasers. These highly compact microcombs can impact many applications, e.g. transceivers in datacenters, LiDAR, compact optical atomic clocks, optical coherence tomography, microwave photonics, and spectroscopy.", "summary": "Using integrated photonic chips fabricated at EPFL, scientists have demonstrated laser-based microwave generators.

He explains, “We study biology, gather information and data to \ninform\n robotic design, and then we use that design to gain understanding of the original biology.”\nThe design process involved studying the crocodiles and monitor lizards in order to reproduce the walking movement of these creatures. This involved imitating joints with motors, bones with aluminium and carbon fiber, and skin with a waterproof suit made out of latex. A mini-computer, wired to the 24 motors needed to make the reptiles move, could be remote-controlled as far as 500 meters away.\nThe reptilian robots serve a valuable role for another line of research of the Biorob lab: search and rescue. Robots may one day be deployed in emergency situations, like after an earthquake, in order to locate and possibly even rescue victims. The Ugandan terrain was perfect for testing the robustness of the robotic reptiles: Murchison Falls Natural Park was humid, muddy and dusty with temperatures reaching as high as 70 degrees Celsius inside of the latex skin.\n“We encourage roboticists to take their robots out of the lab,” says EPFL scientist Tomislav Horvat, who worked alongside Melo throughout the reptilian adventure. “This will make them learn things that are hard to see in controlled environments and that will greatly improve their designs and software.”\nThis research was funded in part by NCCR Robotics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists designed, built and remote-controlled the robotic structures of a crocodile and a lizard for a field experiment, in the depths of Africa, in collaboration with the BBC.

{"id": 356, "text": "Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers that affect white blood cells of the immune system called B-lymphocytes or B cells. Like cells in all cancers, the B cells begin to grow out of control, creating tumors in the lymph nodes, spleen or other tissues. In 2010 alone, it was estimated that non-Hodgkin lymphomas caused 210,000 deaths worldwide.\nOne of the driving forces behind non-Hodgkin lymphomas is the over-activation of a receptor on the surface of B cells. This receptor normally stimulates the growth of B-cells only when it is needed, but in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the growth signal is constantly on, making B-cells grow uncontrollably.\nTo block this signal, recent clinical studies have focused on inhibiting the activation of the B-cell receptor as a treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, but with variable success. For example, a drug called ibrutinib has been tested in clinical trials to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Ibrutinib blocks the enzyme BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase), which is involved in maturing and activating B cells as part of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway. Unfortunately, the response to ibrutinib has been limited only to a subgroup of DLBCL patients.\nThe  has now carried out a study to identify mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib. Using tumor cells from DLBCL patients, the scientists discovered that the inactivation of BTK in resistant tumors triggers the over-activation of alternative signals that promote tumor cell survival and proliferation.\nTo prevent this mechanism of resistance and block the B-cell receptor signaling at its root, Elena Battistello, the PhD student who led this project, targeted the three enzymes (LYN, FYN, and BLK) that initiate the propagation of the signals.\nRepresentation of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway (right).

This low-power device plugs directly into a computer or mobile phone to add another dimension to the applications they run. The force feedback lets users feel the texture, stiffness and shape of virtual objects. This little robot joystick, which clearly punches above its weight, has already been presented at a number of specialized trade shows. From 23 to 27 April, visitors at the Hannover Messe – the leading industrial technology trade show in the world – will be able to give it a try.\nHaptic-feedback systems, which are used mainly for gaming, hit the market a few years ago but had until recently disappointed users. They were just not very realistic in the way they simulated a collision by vibrating or imitated acceleration by increasing the feeling of resistance. “Systems offering more refined tactile force feedback have come out recently,” says Marco Salerno, the cofounder of Foldaway Haptics. “But they are bulky, hard to carry around and very expensive.” His company’s foldable joystick offers a very similar experience to that of the newer systems but is easy to stow in a laptop bag or even in your pocket.\nWith the help of a small magnet, this ultralight device opens up into a joystick with an upward flick of the wrist. It goes from flat – less than two millimeters thick – to three dimensions in a fraction of a second. It is stable and solid thanks to its origami-like folding mechanism and the composite materials used to make it. When closed, it is so flat that you may wonder where the sensors and motors are. It took several years of research in the Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory for the researchers to overcome a number of technical challenges.\nThe little robot’s leading feature is the way it is manufactured, through a combination of thin layers of various materials already cut into the shape required for the folding mechanism to work. Because assembly is automated, it will be easy to mass-produce. “The fact that no manual action is required keeps manufacturing costs relatively low,” says Stefano Mintchev, the other cofounder of the startup, which received funding from NCCR Robotics to develop its technology.

{"id": 359, "text": "At 5:01 pm Wednesday evening, the Philae lander touched down on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko – Chury, for short – seven hours after taking leave of its mothership, the Rosetta orbiter. Although there are still concerns about its anchoring and the resulting feasibility of some operations, the washing-machine sized robot has already gotten to work, sending data and spectacular images of its new surroundings.\nLaunched in 2004 by the European Space Agency, the probe made a 10-year voyage, traveling 500 million kilometers from Earth, to wind up somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In March, Rosetta’s systems were rebooted successfully as it approached the comet, and in August it began to orbit. The first photos of the comet revealed a fascinating shape, seemingly the result of an agglomeration of two rocky cores. The images sent yesterday by Philae indicate that the comet seems to be made up primarily of rock, and not ice. Grégoire Bourban space engineer and Deputy Director of the EPFL Swiss Space Center, gives us his engineer’s viewpoint on this exceptional event.\n-\tWhy was this operation such a huge challenge, from a space engineering point of view? \nIn the heat of the operation, Wednesday, someone dared to compare this adventure with the first human moon landing. And I share that opinion. Because this operation is very different from others that have involved a lander. For the missions on Venus or Mars, for example, we were dealing with bodies that had been studied for a long time, and we understood the precise nature of the ground we’d be landing on. In addition, they were much larger targets, with many appropriate landing spots. What is unique about Chury is that we knew next to nothing about it in August 2014; but we had to choose a landing site, then make millions of descent calculations, studying various trajectories. Managing to do this successfully, from 500 million miles away, is quite simply incredible!\n-\tWhat will Philae allow us to study, and how will it operate? \nThe Philae mission is a true success, even if the lander has experienced some anchoring issues and only two of its three feet appear to be stable. We still don’t know what the consequences of this will be on the analysis operations. If all goes as planned, the lander and orbiter will remain for an entire year in this configuration, accompanying a comet for the first time ever in its trip around the Sun. As it approaches the sun, its core will begin to melt, and thus it will release gases that will react with others already in suspension. Comets are considered to be a possible origin of the presence of water on Earth, and studying this comet’s composition could thus give us valuable information about our origins.\nTo carry out these tasks, Philae is equipped with various instruments for analyzing particles, electromagnetic radiation, various gases, soil properties and even the sounds that the comet emits. It can bore up to 20 centimeters beneath the surface and remove samples. It’s these soil-sampling operations that are in question due to the failure of the harpoons to anchor the lander. And given the weak gravity, even a very small perturbation could eject the robot from the surface.\n-\n\tSome elements or instruments on board Philae and Rosetta were made in Switzerland. Which ones are they and what do they do?\nThere was a significant Swiss involvement in this project. The most well known instrument is Rosina; developed at the University of Bern, it’s what we call a mass spectrometer. Its objective is to analyze the composition of the comet’s atmosphere, the temperature and density of the gases, and their evolution as the comet approaches the Sun. Several companies, including APCO and Clemessy, also developed ground-based support systems, that is, everything used to test the electrical and mechanical properties of the instruments before they’re launched into space. Certain components, most notably the mechanisms for pointing the communications antenna and the solar panel supports, were built by Mecanex in Nyon, which is now part of the company RUAG Space. Finally, some of Philae’s micro-cameras were developed at the CSEM in Neuchâtel. The first images sent from the surface of the comet, made public yesterday morning, came from these instruments!\n-\tWhat lessons can we learn from this for future space operations and exploration?\nMissions like this are very rare, because they are terribly costly in terms of both money and time – more than €1.5 billion and 20 years of work went into Rosetta. The concrete results that she will provide and the public enthusiasm we’re seeing are extremely positive signals for us, because they will encourage decision makers in European countries to continue to invest in space projects and fund the ESA. One of the most significant interests of this mission, in engineering terms, is in robotics and automation. In the space sector, we’re usually dealing with telecoms satellites or observational satellites orbiting Earth, and thus primarily sensor technology. Rosetta is a spectacular demonstration that these technologies [robotics and automation, ed.] operate well in space, and could thus encourage an increase in launching more robotics-type projects.\nImage: first picture taken by Philae once on the comet's surface.

Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

Scientists at EPFL’s  and the  at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin set out to answer these questions. Using the fossilized skeleton and footprints of \nOrobates pabsti \n– a vertebrate that, on the evolutionary tree, comes between amphibians on one hand and reptiles and mammals on the other – the scientists created computer simulations and a robot. Drawing on experimental studies of four living amphibian and reptile species, they used these tools to gauge how plausible different ways of walking were for the fossilized animal.\n“\nOrobates \nis an ideal candidate for understanding how land vertebrates evolved because it is in the lineage leading to modern amniotes. These animals formed in eggs laid on land and became largely independent of water,” says John Nyakatura, a professor at Humboldt-Universität. What’s more, \nOrobates \nis the oldest-known vertebrate for which scientists have been able to link a fossil with its fossilized footprints. “This combination is what enabled us to carry out our unique quantitative study, which paves the way to replicating the walk of other fossilized animals,” says Auke Ijspeert, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. The researchers’ findings appear in .\nA motion-based model and then a robotic one\nTo better understand how \nOrobates \nwalked and pinpoint just how advanced its locomotion was, the scientists at Humboldt-Universität developed a digital model of its skeleton based on the animal’s fossil and the biomechanics of modern animals with sprawling postures. They used this model to carry out the first kinematic computer simulation of \nOrobates’ \ngait as it walks on its digitalized footprints. This simulation focuses on movements (rather than forces) and identifies gaits where the animal’s bones do not collide or come out of their joints.\nIn parallel, two scientists at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory – post-doctoral researcher Kamilo Melo and PhD student Tomislav Horvat – used the fossilized animal anatomy to build a robot called OroBOT. Designed and scaled to match the shape and movements of the extinct animal, OroBOT was used to calculate the physics of how \nOrobates \nwalked. “We tested our hypotheses about the animal’s locomotion dynamics with our robotic model, which factors in the real-world physics of the animal’s gait,” says Melo.\nTesting hundreds of different gaits, based on contemporary animals\nThe interdisciplinary team of scientists tested hundreds of different gaits with their robot in order to determine which ones \nOrobates \ncould have used – and those that it clearly did not. The gaits they tested were based on biomechanical principles extracted from similar modern-day animals such as caimans, salamanders, iguanas and skinks, which they analyzed through X-ray videos and force measurements. “We studied the biomechanics of their movements and determined which mechanical principles they all followed,” says Nyakatura. The research team looked at three features in particular: how erect the animal stood on its legs; how its backbone bent; and how much its elbow or shoulder joints bent as it walked. These three features determine what the researchers call the animal’s “sprawling gait space.” They created  where fellow scientists – and the wider public – can explore the universe of movements that \nOrobates \ncould have used.\nWith these results, they came up with the most likely ways that \nOrobates \nmay have walked. They scored the gaits based on how much energy was required, how stable the movements were, how the leg forces compared with those of other sprawling animals, and how closely the movements aligned with the fossilized footprints. The gaits with good scores appear quite athletic and most closely resemble the movements of caimans. This suggests that \nOrobates \nprobably already held itself a little upright on its legs – unlike salamanders and skinks. Its locomotion was thus more advanced than had been previously thought. \nThe study concludes that advanced — more upright, balanced and mechanically power-saving —locomotion, as in \nOrobates\n, may have evolved before the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals lived. The novel approach developed for this study can be applied by other scientists in their work, and it could be modified to study other evolutionary transitions, such as the origins of flight or galloping gaits in mammals.\nContacts\nFor inquiries about robotics, in English or Spanish:\nKamilo Melo (robotics engineer, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)\nEmail: \nFor inquiries about robotics, in French:\nAuke J.

{"id": 363, "text": "Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels means turning to plant-derived biofuels and chemicals. But producing them cost-effectively from plants and other organic matter – collectively referred to as biomass – is a major engineering challenge. Most biomass comes in the form of non-edible plants like trees, grass, and algae, which contain sugars that can be fermented to produce fuel. But biomass also contains lignin, a bulky, complex organic polymer that fills wood, bark, and generally gives plants rigidity. Because it is difficult to process, lignin is usually discarded during biofuel processing. EPFL scientists have now turned lignin from a nuisance to an important source of biofuel by simply adding a common chemical, converting up to 80% of it into valuable molecules for biofuel and plastics. The patent-pending method, which can be scaled up to industrial levels, is .\nComplex, but energy-dense\nLignin is an enormously complex biopolymer, filling the hard wall that surrounds each plant cell. In fact, lignin makes up almost a third of plant biomass, and its molecular structure gives it an energy density 30% greater than that of the sugars that are traditionally processed into biofuel. The problem is that lignin is difficult to extract and transform. Due to its instability, lignin usually rapidly gets destroyed during its extraction and most researchers have failed to efficiently break it apart for upgrade into fuels or chemicals.\nNow, an international team of researchers led by , has shown that they can easily break lignin apart simply by adding the chemical formaldehyde to the process. Formaldehyde is one of the most widely used chemicals in industry, and it is simple and cheap to produce. The researchers found that formaldehyde stabilizes lignin and prevents it from degrading, leading to high yields of building blocks that can be used to make substitutes for petrochemicals. These yields were 3-7 times higher than those obtained from lignin without formaldehyde.\nLignin extracts with (L) and without (R) formaldehyde. © Alain Herzog/J. Luterbacher/EPFL\nScaling up\n“Depending on the wood used we get between 50 and 80%,” says Jeremy Luterbacher, who became known in 2014 for developing a method for extracting sugars from plants safely and cheaply (also published in ). “The chemistry is relatively straightforward; the real challenge is actually finding investors for a pilot facility to demonstrate this.” The market, he says, is difficult for sustainable energy largely because of inconsistent political support and widely varying energy prices. Investors for such innovative platforms are hard to come by in an uncertain market, especially considering the competition of well-established fossil fuels.\n“The technology looks really good,” says Luterbacher. “If the global political establishment sent a consistent message about moving away from fossil fuels, then investors would take notice. But I think Switzerland is a great place to get started. The Swiss have been unwavering supporters of clean energy and could help demonstrate new technologies, and so I’m quite optimistic about the future.”\nThis work involved a collaboration of EPFL’s Institute of Chemical Engineering (ISIC) with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the US Department of Energy, and Purdue University.

{"id": 364, "text": "Concrete has been around since the 19\nth\n century. Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

{"id": 365, "text": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a major player in nutrition today. Studies have shown that NAD+ concentrations decrease during aging and that recovering the body’s levels of NAD+ can prolong both health span and even life span, making it the focus of much research in nutritional science, medicine, and even pharmaceutics.\nIn terms of biology, NAD+ is what is known as a “co-enzyme” – a necessary molecule that helps an enzyme carry out its respective reaction in the cell. NAD+ is a common co-enzyme for multiple metabolic enzymes across all living cells, meaning that it is heavily involved in producing energy and keeping cells alive and healthy.\nPublishing in \nNature\n, scientists lead by  in collaboration with TES Pharma have found a new way of increasing NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme competing with its production.\nThe \nde novo\n synthesis of NAD+ in the cell begins with the amino acid tryptophan. One of the key enzymes involved in this process is ACMSD, which limits the amount of NAD+ produced by the \nde novo\n synthesis pathway.\nThe scientists were able to show that ACMSD controls the levels of NAD+ in the cell through a mechanism that doesn’t seem to have changed during evolution: case-in-point, the researchers found that, in both the earthworm \nCaenorhabditis elegans\n and mice, blocking the enzyme resulted in higher NAD+ levels and enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe inactivation of ACMSD also increased the activity of Sirtuin 1, an enzyme that NAD+ works with in its role as co-enzyme. Sirtuin 1 is known to play major roles in mitochondrial well-being, and as a result, the boost of NAD+ levels ultimately enhanced mitochondrial function.\nThe team then used two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD, developed by . “Since the enzyme is mostly found in the kidney and liver, we wanted to test the capacity of the ACMSD inhibitors to protect these organs from injury,” explains Elena Katsyuba, first author of the paper.\nBoth inhibitors were shown to preserve kidney and liver function in animal models of acute kidney injury and of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, offering much promise for their future therapeutic potential in humans. “The fact that ACMSD is exclusively present only in the liver and kidneys reduces the risk of negative repercussions of its loss on other organs,” says Katsyuba. “Put simply, the enzyme will not be missed by an organ that does not have it anyway.”\n“Given the beneficial health effects of boosting NAD+ levels that we have seen in worm and mouse models of disease, we are looking forward to bringing these compounds soon to the clinic to the benefit of patients suffering from liver and kidney diseases, two areas with a large unmet clinical need,” says Johan Auwerx.\nOther contributors\nTES Pharma\nUniversity of Lausanne\nPolytechnic University of Marche\nEPFL Histology Core Facility\nUniversity Hospital of Geneva\nPolish Academy of Sciences", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have found a new way to boost the famous anti-aging molecule NAD+ in the kidney and liver by blocking an enzyme that limits its production.

{"id": 366, "text": "Photovoltaics can be used directly in building and renovation projects and serve as a construction material in their own right. Integrating solar panels into facades and roofs can transform buildings into electricity producers and reduce CO\n2 \nemissions. To develop and promote this technology,  project partners will design multifunctional solar panels that not only produce energy but also do the job of other building materials with insulating, soundproofing or aesthetic qualities. The project partners will also develop a methodology for architects and construction companies and find ways to drastically reduce the costs of BIPV.\nA boon for Europe's manufacturing industry\nFifteen research institutes, innovative companies, and architecture and construction firms have teamed up for this challenging project, which is being led by EPFL and the CSEM in Neuchâtel. \"The use of BIPV in facades and in the construction sector more broadly is expanding rapidly, thanks in part to the pioneering technology developed by EPFL and CSEM,\" says Laure-Emmanuelle Perret-Aebi, coordinator of the project at EPFL's \n (\nPV-Lab). \"But we need to make this technology more accessible so that it can be used more extensively and not just in flagship building projects.\"\nGreater uptake of the technology would considerably increase demand for photovoltaic facades, tiles and other construction materials, which would be a boon for Europe's manufacturing industry. \"The technology is different from that used in solar panels, which are designed for mass production and now manufactured primarily in China,\" says Perret-Aebi. \"But BIPV technology stands to boost European industry.\"\nAnd this technology runs on solar energy – another of its major assets given recent progress in this area. \"Solar energy produces 10 to 20 times less CO\n2 \nthan conventional thermal power plants,\" says Christophe Ballif, a professor at EPFL's School of Engineering, the head of EPFL PV-Lab and the director of CSEM PV-center. \"What’s more, large solar farms are the cheapest way of producing electricity, even in countries that don't get a lot of sunlight, like Germany.\" \nA shift in mindset\nIt is already possible to construct or renovate a building with BIPV. In Switzerland, more than 10,000 roofs have already been built in this way, with photovoltaic panels available in various shapes and colors. Yet there is still a lot of reluctance, and uptake of this technology is slow. While the use of BIPV does drive up construction costs, the extra expense is paid off in 10 to 30 years. And that's without making use of potential subsidies or selling back the electricity produced. Nor does it account for the reductions in CO\n2 \nemissions that can be achieved. \nA standard for all new buildings\nThe photovoltaic technology used for this project is based on crystalline silicon, which is found in most solar panels. Since the panels need to have a guaranteed lifespan of 30 to 50 years if they are to be integrated into buildings, reliability is essential – and one of the project goals. At the moment, the energy payback period for a solar panel – i.e., the time needed for the panel to generate the same amount of energy used to make it – is between one and three years. According to the project partners, widespread use of this technology in facades and roofs could produce roughly the amount of energy currently consumed in Switzerland. \"There is really no reason not to integrate photovoltaic panels into new buildings – it should be the norm,\" says Ballif.", "summary": "EPFL has become the coordinator of Be-Smart, an EU research project that aims to step up the deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and cut their costs by 75% between now and 2030.

{"id": 368, "text": "Humans instinctively adopt the gait that requires the least amount of energy given the walking conditions. Without realizing it, we are constantly tweaking our pace, stride length and foot lift. But could we consciously play with these parameters in order to influence our energy expenditure?\n Researchers at EPFL’s  from the School of Engineering studied eight gait parameters in order to come up with a very sophisticated software program that uses an avatar to predict how much energy people use when they walk depending on their walking style. This research has been published in . Salman Faraji, the co-lead author, devoted an entire section of his thesis to this topic.\nThe avatar – a torso equipped with two legs with feet – can be freely configured. Users start by entering their height and weight and can then set the walking speed, distance between their feet (stride length and stride width), and foot lift, along with the incline of both the torso and the ground. They can also add mass and simulate the effect of being pushed or pulled at different parts of the body.

{"id": 370, "text": "Grouped together under the unassuming name φ92, a family of bacteriophage viruses has perfected its specialty: they attack salmonella and coliform bacteria. The centerpiece of their arsenal is a needle-like tip that pierces its victim’s membrane. EPFL scientists have measured this miniscule weapon; at a single nanometer, it’s roughly 20 times the diameter of a helium atom. This discovery, published in \nStructure\n, a \nCell Press\n journal, will allow researchers to better understand the attack strategy used by bacteriophages, which are being intensively studied for their therapeutic potential.\n φ92’s armor-piercing weapon is made up of three chains of identical proteins. These three long intertwined molecules form an appendage sharp enough to penetrate the bacterial membrane. This molecular needle, discovered recently in EPFL’s Laboratory of Structural Biology and Biophysics, led by Petr Leiman, appears to be characteristic of all species belonging to the φ92 family of bacteriophage viruses.\n The body of a phage is made up of two main parts. The first, a hollow head called a “capsid,” contains the genetic material. The second consists of a tube, a group of appendages resembling feet, and a device designed to penetrate the membrane of its host – the needle-like tip is at the furthest extremity of the virus.\n Phages recognize sugars and proteins on the surface of their preferred host bacteria. The virus then attaches its feet to the victim, and a complex process is set in motion. A chain of proteins uncoils, pushing the injection tube and its tip through the victim’s membrane like a hypodermic needle. The tip then detaches from the tube and, like an uncorked bottle of champagne, the pressurized genetic material in the capsid is injected into the bacterium. The phage then begins to reproduce inside its victim. \n By determining the exact structure of the tip, the EPFL scientists have filled in all the missing details in our understanding of φ92’s lethal weapon. To reach this level of detail – at most a dozen or so atoms at the extremity of the tip – they used x-ray crystallography techniques, which are of high enough resolution to determine the shape of individual molecules.\n “We managed to determine not only the size, but the complete structure of the tip as well,” explains EPFL postdoctoral researcher Christopher Browning, who is first author on the article. In addition, the researchers discovered an iron atom in the appendage. “We still are not sure what it’s used for, but to the extent that this element is toxic, we have very good reason to think that it’s not there by accident.”\n This research has implications far beyond simple biological curiosity. Bacteriophages are considered promising weapons in the fight against infectious bacteria, to complement or replace traditional antibiotics. The scientists believe the shape of the needle-like tip determines in part the bacterial species that can be attacked by a phage. \n Among the avenues being explored are incomplete bacteriophages called “pyocins,” which are naturally produced by some infected bacteria. Pyocins consist of just the injection apparatus of the virus, a kind of mechanical component, but of biological origin. They’re of interest to scientists precisely because they don’t have a capsid, and thus don’t carry genetic material, explains Browning. “These things can penetrate the bacterial membrane, which can kill the bacterium, but without injecting genetic material. That sidesteps the possibility that the phage could mutate and then attack “good” bacteria. This option is being extensively studied at the moment, but we need to understand the potential of each phage with respect to the various bacteria. The form of the tip is one of those parameters.”\n--\nThe video is created by Seyet LLC (http://www.seyet.com), Petr Leiman (EPFL) and Michael Rossmann (Purdue University) and funded by NSF (http://www.nsf.gov).\nPublication: \nChristopher Browning, Mikhail M.

{"id": 371, "text": "In a paper published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers at EPFL’s Blue Brain Project, a Swiss Brain Research Initiative, have developed a new framework to work out how a single neuron in the brain operates.\nThe analysis was performed using cells from the Blue Brain’s virtual rodent cortex. The researchers expect other types of neurons – non-cortical or human – to operate in the same way.\nTheir results show that when a neuron receives input, the branches of the elaborate tree-like receptors extending from the neuron, known as dendrites, functionally work together in a way that is \nadjusted to the complexity of the input\n.\nThe strength of a synapse determines how strongly a neuron feels an electric signal coming from other neurons, and the act of learning changes this strength. By analyzing the “connectivity matrix” that determines how these synapses communicate with each other, the algorithm establishes when and where synapses group into independent learning units from the structural and electrical properties of dendrites. In other words, the new algorithm determines how the dendrites of neurons functionally break up into separate computing units and finds that they work together \ndynamically, depending on the workload,\n to process information\n.\nThe researchers liken their results to the functioning of computing technology already implemented today. This newly observed dendritic functionality acts like parallel computing units meaning that a neuron is able to process different aspects of the input in parallel, like supercomputers. Each of the parallel computing units can independently learn to adjust its output, much like the nodes in deep learning networks used in artificial intelligence (AI) models today. Comparable to cloud computing, a neuron dynamically breaks up into the number of separate computing units demanded by the workload of the input.\n“In the Blue Brain Project, this mathematical approach helps to ascertain functionally relevant clusters of neuronal input which are inputs that feed into the same parallel processing unit. This then enables us to determine the level of complexity at which to model cortical networks as we digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain,” explains Marc-Oliver Gewaltig, Section Manager in Blue Brain’s Simulation Neuroscience Division.\nParallel computing units of neurons can independently learn to adjust their output\nAdditionally, the research reveals how these parallel processing units influence learning, i.e. the change in connection strength between different neurons. The way a neuron learns depends on the number and location of parallel processors, which in turn depend on the signals arriving from other neurons. For instance, certain synapses that do not learn independently when the neuron’s input level is low, start to learn independently when the input levels are higher.\nTo date traditional learning algorithms (such as those currently used in A.I. applications) assume that neurons are static units that merely integrate and re-scale incoming signals. By contrast, the results show that the number and size of the independent subunits can be controlled by balanced input or shunting inhibition. The researchers propose that this temporary control of the compartmentalization constitutes a powerful mechanism for the branch-specific learning of input features.\n“The method finds that in many brain states, neurons have far fewer parallel processors than expected from dendritic branch patterns. Thus, many synapses appear to be in “grey zones” where they do not belong to any processing unit,” explains lead scientist and first author Willem Wybo. “However, in the brain, neurons receive varying levels of background input and our results show that the number of parallel processors varies with the level of background input, indicating that the same neuron might have different computational roles in different brain states.”\n“We are particularly excited about this observation since it sheds a new light on the role of up/down states in the brain and it also provides a reason as to why cortical inhibition is so location-specific. With the new insights, we can start looking for algorithms that exploit the rapid changes in pairing between processing units, offering us more insight into the fundamental question of how the brain computes,” concludes Gewaltig.", "summary": "How do neurons process information?

{"id": 372, "text": "In artificial intelligence (AI), machines carry out specific actions, observe the outcome, adapt their behavior accordingly, observe the new outcome, adapt their behavior once again, and so on, learning from this iterative process. But could this process spin out of control? Possibly. “AI will always seek to avoid human intervention and create a situation where it can’t be stopped,” says Rachid Guerraoui, a professor at EPFL’s Distributed Programming Laboratory and co-author of the EPFL study. That means AI engineers must prevent machines from eventually learning how to circumvent human commands. EPFL researchers studying this problem have discovered a way for human operators to keep control of a group of AI robots; they will present their findings on Monday, 4 December, at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in California. Their work makes a major contribution to the development of autonomous vehicles and drones, for example, so that they will be able to operate safely in numbers.\nOne machine-learning method used in AI is reinforcement learning, where agents are rewarded for performing certain actions – a technique borrowed from behavioral psychology. Applying this technique to AI, engineers use a points system where machines earn points by carrying out the right actions. For instance, a robot may earn one point for correctly stacking a set of boxes and another point for retrieving a box from outside. But if, on a rainy day for example, a human operator interrupts the robot as it heads outside to collect a box, the robot will learn that it is better off staying indoors, stacking boxes and earning as many points as possible. “The challenge isn’t to stop the robot, but rather to program it so that the interruption doesn’t change its learning process – and doesn’t induce it to optimize its behavior in such a way as to avoid being stopped,” says Guerraoui.\nFrom a single machine to an entire AI network\nIn 2016, researchers from Google DeepMind and the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University developed a learning protocol that prevents machines from learning from interruptions and thereby becoming uncontrollable. For instance, in the example above, the robot’s reward – the number of points it earns – would be weighted by the chance of rain, giving the robot a greater incentive to retrieve boxes outside. “Here the solution is fairly simple because we are dealing with just one robot,” says Guerraoui.\nHowever, AI is increasingly being used in applications involving dozens of machines, such as self-driving cars on the road or drones in the air. “That makes things a lot more complicated, because the machines start learning from each other – especially in the case of interruptions. They learn not only from how they are interrupted individually, but also from how the others are interrupted,” says Alexandre Maurer, one of the study’s authors.\nHadrien Hendrikx, another researcher involved in the study, gives the example of two self-driving cars following each other on a narrow road where they can’t pass each other. They must reach their destination as quickly as possible – without breaking any traffic laws – and humans in the cars can take over control at any time. If the human in the first car brakes often, the second car will adapt its behavior each time and eventually get confused as to when to brake, possibly staying too close to the first car or driving too slowly.\nGiving humans the last word\nThis complexity is what the EPFL researchers aim to resolve through “safe interruptibility.” Their breakthrough method lets humans interrupt AI learning processes when necessary – while making sure that the interruptions don’t change the way the machines learn. “Simply put, we add ‘forgetting’ mechanisms to the learning algorithms that essentially delete bits of a machine’s memory. It’s kind of like the flash device in \nMen in Black\n,” says El Mahdi El Mhamdi, another author of the study. In other words, the researchers altered the machines’ learning and reward system so that it’s not affected by interruptions. It’s like if a parent punishes one child, that doesn’t affect the learning processes of the other children in the family.\n“We worked on existing algorithms and showed that safe interruptibility can work no matter how complicated the AI system is, the number of robots involved, or the type of interruption. We could use it with the Terminator and still have the same results,” says Maurer.\nToday, autonomous machines that use reinforcement learning are not common. “This system works really well when the consequences of making mistakes are minor,” says El Mhamdi. “In full autonomy and without human supervision, it couldn’t be used in the self-driving shuttle buses in Sion, for instance, for safety reasons. However, we could simulate the shuttle buses and the city of Sion and run an AI algorithm that awards and subtracts points as the shuttle-bus system learns. That’s the kind of simulation that’s being done at Tesla, for example.

{"id": 373, "text": "In recent years optical fibers have served as sensors to detect changes in temperature, like a thermometer, and pressure, like an artificial nerve. This technique is particularly useful in structures such as bridges and gas pipelines.\nEPFL researchers have now come up with a new method that enables optical fibers to identify whether they are in contact with a liquid or a solid. This is achieved by simply generating a sound wave with the help from a light beam within the fiber.\nThis study was conducted by the Group for Fibre Optics (GFO) run by Luc Thévenaz within the School of Engineering and has been published in \nNature Communications\n.\nA sensor that doesn’t disturb the light\n No wider than a strand of hair, an optical fiber made of glass transmits light that varies according to four parameters: intensity, phase, polarization and wavelength. These parameters are altered when the fiber is stretched or the temperature changes, enabling the fiber to act like a sensor by detecting cracks in structures or abnormal temperatures. But up to now it was not possible to determine what was happening around the fiber without having light escape the fibre, which disrupts its path.\nThe method developed at EPFL uses a sound wave generated inside the fiber. It is a hyper-frequency wave that regularly bounces off the fiber’s walls. This echo varies at different locations depending on the material the wave comes into contact with. The echoes leave an imprint on the light that can be read when the beam exits the fiber, making it possible to map out the fiber’s surroundings. This imprint is so faint that it hardly disturbs the light propagating within the fiber. The method could be used to sense what is going on around a fiber and send light-based information at the same time.\n The researchers have already immersed their fibers in water and then in alcohol, before leaving them out in the open air. Each time, their system was capable of correctly identifying the change in the surroundings. “Our technique will make it possible to detect water leakages, as well as the density and salinity of fluids that come into contact with the fiber. There are many potential applications,” says Thévenaz.\nSpatial and temporal detection\n These changes in the surroundings are located thanks to a simple time-based method. “Each wave impulse is generated with a slight time lag. And this delay is reflected upon the beam’s arrival. If there were any disturbances along the way, we can both see what they were and determine their location,” explains Thévenaz. “For the moment, we can locate disturbances to within around ten meters, but we have the technical means to increase our accuracy to one meter.”\nThe idea of using a sound wave in optical fibers initially came from the team’s partner researchers at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

{"id": 374, "text": "In the Zaatari refugee camp in northern Jordan, which is home to nearly 80,000 people, internet access is spotty at best, which further isolates the refugees living there. But EPFL’s  (React), along with two researchers from the Pennsylvania State University, has tested an instant messaging system at the camp, one that operates independently of telephone and internet service providers. Their system runs on battery power and allows users to communicate with each other in unconnected areas while maintaining data security. \nAn inexpensive solution\nThe system is built around on a tiny computer already available on the market – the Raspberry Pi – and which costs just 30 dollars. The researchers programmed the computer to work like a local server, allowing anyone within a range of around 100 meters to access a web-based messaging service via Wi-Fi. This communication platform enables users to send and receive messages by simply opening their browser. The project team also took care to ensure that all data exchanged via the system is protected. “Our messaging system is fully anonymous,” says Denis Gillet, the head of React. “The data is stored locally, rather than in the cloud, so that it can’t be accessed from the outside or used inappropriately.”\nThis kind of “co-located” social media platform can be used to allow people within a defined area – like a camp, music festival or building – to communicate with each other. While less versatile than conventional social media, it has the advantage of working in places without internet access. Initial results have shown that refugees who used the messaging system had a greater sense of engagement and belonging to a community. “Such messaging systems can also help call attention to the situation and living conditions in such confined areas,” says Adrian Holzer, a researcher on the React team.\nConnecting aid workers\nThe React researchers have also teamed up with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to develop a system to improve information sharing between the NGO’s headquarters and field operations. Aid workers in challenging humanitarian situations need to have rapid access to essential and constantly updated information, like data sheets and medical files. Here the researchers again used a Raspberry Pi, programming it to enable field workers to access MSF’s shared files located in the cloud. Documents are synchronized between the Raspberry Pi and the cloud when an internet connection is available. When the internet is down, these files can still be accessed directly on the Raspberry Pi. “One of our biggest challenges was developing a single system that could be used anywhere,” says Gillet. “Given MSF’s working environment, our system had to operate without an internet connection or external power supply, and it had to be fast, portable and compatible with any kind of mobile device the aid workers might have.” \nLeveraging ICT to support humanitarian efforts\nUnreliable internet access is not the only information-related challenge facing the humanitarian sector. “Technology has completely transformed our work, as we first saw with the 2010 earthquake in Haiti,” explains Holzer. “Everyone – from the local population to volunteers on the other side of the world – was able to share information in order to map out the situation and identify the areas that were hardest hit.” Although this collective effort brings in large amounts of data, it comes with its fair share of caveats. What sort of guarantee is there that the data collected will be used for the right purposes? That a given emergency is real? And that the aid is reaching those who need it most? The React team worked with researcher Isabelle Vonèche Cardia, who is the Deputy Director of EPFL’s College of Humanities, to make sure their solutions met the four core principles of humanitarian work: humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. And since we now live in a world where Tweets and photos are shared faster than they can be verified, the researchers also created a template for assessing both the risks and benefits of using the latest ICT for humanitarian purposes. “We want these technologies to be used in a targeted and well-thought-out manner so that they don’t put people at risk,” says Holzer.\nThese research projects were carried out in association with the Pennsylvania State University and Médecins Sans Frontières.

{"id": 375, "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, researchers are turning their attention to the virus’ biology, mechanism of action, and possible treatments. One of the targets are a group of immune cells called “neutrophils”, which have been reported to infiltrate the respiratory tract of patients who have died from COVID-19.\nThe idea is that in their attempt to attack the virus, neutrophils might be making the disease’s symptoms even worse by invading the lungs and exacerbating inflammation there. In order to find out if this is actually the case, scientists may use a mouse model whose neutrophils they deplete with “anti-neutrophil” antibodies.\nThe approach is used widely for studying neutrophils in a number of different conditions, including autoimmune diseases, chronic infection or inflammation, wound healing, and even some types of cancer. However, the neutrophil-depletion model is only partially effective, lacks specificity, and doesn’t last long enough.\nA neutrophil with its typical\n,\n segmented nucleus\n.\nA \nprotrusion of the nucleus \nacts like \na \n“\ndouble-edged sword\n”\n, \nwhich the neutrophil wields \nto kill \npathogens –\n but which \nalso \nsometimes damages tissues and exacerbates disease\ns\n. \nCredit: \nEtienne Meylan, EPFL\nNow, scientists led by Etienne Meylan at EPFL, have identified the source of the problem and have developed an alternative model that addresses its shortcomings.

The researchers have now identified these neutrophils, and determined that the reason they survive is because they have a lower chance of being targeted by the antibodies.\nTo address this, the scientists have developed a double antibody depletion strategy that enhances neutrophil elimination. The method increases the killing rate of the antibodies, resulting in a profound, specific and long-lasting reduction in neutrophil numbers in blood and tissues.\n“Our study could be useful to address the functional importance of neutrophils in acute or chronic infection, in inflammation or in cancer,” says Meylan. “In particular, transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection coupled to our standardized neutrophil depletion strategies may help establish a causal link between this innate immune cell type and COVID-19.”\nOther contributors\nLausanne University Hospital (CHUV)\nSwiss Cancer Center Léman\nINSERM, France\nMassachusetts General Hospital Research Institute\nUniversity Duisburg–Essen", "summary": "Neutrophils are critical immune cells for antimicrobial defense, but they can exacerbate a number of diseases, perhaps including COVID-19.

{"id": 376, "text": "Coral reefs are dying on a massive scale around the world, and global warming is driving this extinction. The planet’s largest reef, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, is currently experiencing enormous coral bleaching for the second year in a row, while last year left only a third of its 2300-km ecosystem unbleached. The demise of coral reefs heralds the loss of some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching in the Maldives. Photo credit: The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers\nNow, scientists have shown that corals in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Northern Red Sea are particularly resistant to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The results are published today in the journal \nRoyal Society\nOpen Science.\nThe implications are important, as the Gulf of Aqaba is a unique coral refuge. The corals may provide the key to understanding the biological mechanism that leads to thermal resistance, or the weakness that underlies massive bleaching. There is also the hope that the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs could be used to re-seed deteriorated reefs in the Red Sea and perhaps even around the world.\nScientists at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (Université de Lausanne) in Switzerland, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period. They found that the corals did not bleach.\n “[Under these conditions,] most corals around the world would probably bleach and have a high degree of mortality,” says EPFL scientist Thomas Krueger. “Most of the variables that we measured actually improved, suggesting that these corals are living under suboptimal temperatures right now and might be better prepared for future ocean warming.”\nInterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nAt the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, the scientists exposed corals of the species \nStylophora pistillata\n, collected from the Gulf of Aqaba, to water temperatures and acidification. The conditions resemble the summer conditions of a future ocean in this region if local ocean warming continues at its current rate of approximately 0.4-0.5°C per decade. They performed an overall health check of all the major physiological functions of the corals, measuring variables like energy metabolism, the ability to build a skeleton, and nutrient exchange at the molecular level between the coral-host and their algae symbionts. These physiological variables were mostly unaffected by the harsh experimental treatment. Still, further work on ecologically relevant variables like fertility or competitive performance is needed.\nSymbiotic corals live together with an algae partner, much in the same way humans are in symbiosis with gut bacteria. Just as bacteria in the gut aid with digestion, providing valuable nutrients to the rest of the body, the algae that live within the coral-partner provide nutrients to the corals. The bacteria in our body thrive within our digestive tract, just as the algae benefit from living within the coral partner. Bleaching occurs when the colored algae are ejected by their coral-partner, and the symbiosis breaks down. If the algae do not return, the coral dies.\nCorals growing at the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nPre-acclimated to thermal tolerance\nThe coral species \nStylophora pistillata \noccurs in other regions of the world, and beyond the Gulf of Aqaba, does not necessarily demonstrate thermal resistance. The biological mechanism that underlies the robustness of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs is still unknown, but the scientists have an idea of how the species evolved to become thermally resistant.\n“Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba are pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance due to the special geography and recent history of the Red Sea,” says scientist Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences.\nAt the end of the last ice age, corals started recolonizing the whole of the Red Sea through the southern connection to the Indian Ocean. The thermal bottleneck at the southern entrance with summer water temperatures rising to 30-32°C provided a selective barrier, allowing only highly resistant individuals to move north. Ironically, this heat-resistant founding population encountered much cooler waters once reaching the northern end, where the Gulf of Aqaba is located.\nBased on this, the study hypothesized that these corals might be able to better cope with today’s ocean warming, considering that they not only descended from a heat-selected founding population, but they also started their warming trajectory from a lower temperature, compared to their counterparts in the central and southern Red Sea.\nProtection of the Gulf of Aqaba Reef\nDespite being resistant to global warming, the corals from the Gulf of Aqaba are still vulnerable to other stresses like pollution.\n“Local disturbances, such as local oil pollution, nutrients from fish farms, herbicides from gardening, may reduce the exceptionally high tolerance of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs,” says Fine.\n“This reef should receive international recognition as a natural site of great importance, because it might very well be one of the last reefs standing at the end of this century,” says Anders Meibom of EPFL. “I would like to encourage the countries around the Gulf of Aqaba – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel – to get together and create a strong protection environmental program, because even if these corals are resistant to rising water temperatures, they are still sensitive to local pollution, overfishing etc, and they need to be protected from this now.”\nScientists Anders Meibom (left) of EPFL/ UNIL and Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel.", "summary": "Coral reefs in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures.

{"id": 377, "text": "The Solar Decathlon was established as an international competition between universities in the United States in 2002. The goal is to design and build a home powered only by solar power in the space of 18 months. Indeed, the Swiss Team has been preparing for the Solar Decathlon 2017 since 2015. This year’s event will take place in Denver, Colorado from October 5-15th. The Swiss Team is made up of around 50 students from four higher education institutions: the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the School of Engineering and Architecture Fribourg (HEIA-FR / HES-SO), the Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD / HES-SO) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR) united under the banner of the Swiss Living Challenge.\nA multifunctional space...\nThe Swiss team has designed an instigator of change, a neighborhood house that can be integrated into various urban settings. The aim of NeighborHub, as it is called, is to bring neighbors together, working with them on more energy-efficient solutions. There are seven issues to consider: energy, mobility, choice of materials, biodiversity, food, waste management and water management. Visitors can get advice and take part in interactive events and discussions on these seven themes. NeighborHub’s architectural design includes a large multifunctional space to facilitate these various interactions.\n...that speaks to you\nInside NeighborHub there is a temperate zone, the \nskin\n, with a heated space, the \ncore\n, in the middle. These two areas are divided into four modules: an equipment room, a kitchen, a bathroom with a separate dry toilet and a private space with a bedroom. In this shared dwelling, not only the walls but also the furniture and other surfaces speak, as it were, to the building’s occupants by means of printed text and a system of signage devised specially for a shared space. ‘We came up with some catchy phrases to tell visitors about NeighborHub’s features so that they can settle in quickly,’ explains Flavia Viscardi, the student in charge of communication in the building. ‘To complete the house’s vibrant and informative visuals, we’ve used color coding and illustrations.’\nSunshine and plants for the building envelope\nIn line with the Solar Decathlon’s competition rules, solar panels have been installed on NeighborHub’s exterior surfaces, providing 100% of its power. Contrary to common practice, however, these panels are not fixed to the roof; instead, you’ll find the solar and thermal panels on the building’s façades and doors. The external surface consists of photovoltaic cells, together with opaque polycarbonate panels and transparent acrylic panes. ‘The unit also has vertical greenhouses, and an aquaponic system for growing fruit and vegetables with a fish tank below,’ adds Axelle Marchon, the student in charge of coordinating the architectural team.\nA closed water cycle\nThe roof of the building is partly covered by plant matter, and rainwater is collected in the middle. The water used in the NeighborHub can be separated out into various types – much like for waste recycling. The rainwater collected on the roof is used for some domestic appliances, as its low mineral content minimizes scaling. The waste water from these appliances, as well as from showers and sinks, gets used as grey water, which is treated using a phyto-purification process: the water is filtered and purified using a reed bed with different layers of gravel. There is no ‘black water’ from conventional toilets in NeighborHub, as the building is instead equipped with dry toilets. ‘The compost we get from them will provide nutrients for the crops that are grown around the NeighborHub and on the roof, thus completing the circle,’ explains Camilla Wiseman, who, together with her student colleagues, designed the entire water system.\nTimber rooms shipped across the ocean\nThe international nature of the Solar Decathlon competition means the project is subject to an extremely tight timetable. After the building has been constructed, it will be disassembled and must then be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean before reaching the competition venue. This journey cuts down the time allocation for the only two teams based in Europe. This crucial logistical factor was taken into account from the start of the project, however, and so the NeighborHub is made up of modules whose dimensions are suitable for the containers in which they will be shipped. These modules are made entirely out of wood, which is light and has a positive carbon balance. ‘Once the prefabricated modules arrive at the competition venue in Denver, Colorado, they will be assembled, a bit like a Lego house,’ says Matias Cesari, the student in charge of the building site.\nA house like no other\nAs a competition, the Solar Decathlon has focused on traditional dwelling models, featuring a single family home with a car, with various proposed energy and environmental solutions. The competition criteria and rules were therefore devised from this perspective. But are detached houses really in keeping with today’s social and environmental imperatives? ‘NeighborHub not only satisfies the Solar Decathlon criteria, it boldly presents an alternative way of living on a neighborhood scale, that is both collective and environmentally friendly,’ explains Marilyne Andersen, Dean of EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) and the Faculty Advisor of the project.\nSolid long-term diamond partners\nThe Swiss Living Challenge project could not have made it out of the classrooms without the considerable support of its partners, who provided not just their financial backing but also their expertise.

The bank  has been a loyal supporter of the project from the very beginning, in keeping with its traditional stance of encouraging Swiss innovation and environmental protection. Landolt is a privileged partner of the EPFL, having worked with it for many years and funded a professorship there. It was therefore only natural for the bank to intensify its commitment to become a Diamond Partner alongside , which has been following the project with great enthusiasm and has contributed its own expertise.\nGroupe E provided technical support throughout all of the project phases.

But these systems can be expensive to set up and take down – and they can’t adapt to the water surface as evaporation causes it to change size and shape,” says Jamie Paik, the head of EPFL’s  (RRL) and a professor at the School of Engineering. Researchers from RRL, working in association with a scientist from Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Chile, have developed a water-preservation system tailored specifically to Chile’s winegrowing region as part of a project sponsored by EPFL’s .\nRobust, flexible and modular origami robots\nTheir system involves robots that look like little floating tiles. Powered by embedded solar panels, they can assemble themselves automatically on the water surface and move as it changes size and shape. “The idea isn’t necessarily to cover the entire water surface but to have the robots follow the sun and avoid shady spots. That means the robots would continuously cover places where the water evaporates – and it would minimize the number of robots needed,” says Paik. \nResearchers are also looking into other ideas, such as using floating robots not to cover the water surface but to unfold and fold up a tarp automatically based on the shape of the water surface.

What’s more, the solar energy generated by the researcher’s robots could be a boon to sunny regions.

The temperature and amount of sunlight in the country’s regions can vary drastically from one day to the next, resulting in substantial fluctuations in water-reservoir shapes and making existing methods ineffective. Many of Chile’s vineyards are run by cooperatives of small families that can’t afford to invest in complicated, costly systems. And its economy depends heavily on wine production in a country prone to crop-ravishing droughts. \nThe RRL team intends to further their research and finalize their technology.

{"id": 379, "text": "“It’s unexpected and extremely promising!” Luc Thévenaz, the professor in charge of EPFL's Group for Fibre Optics, recently experienced a eureka moment in his research. Picking up on an idea proposed by a discussion group of the European Space Agency, he shifted his attention away from traditional fibers made of glass and focused on the silk strands that spiders produce for their webs. These strands are perfectly cylindrical, smooth, transparent and extremely solid – some of the same characteristics as glass-based fibers.\nBut there is one major difference: while glass is inert, spider silk is made up of very long proteins rolled into a helix structure whose bonds are sensitive to a number of chemical substances.\nReusable chemical sensors \n“The helix in the silk strands unwinds whenever polar molecules like acetic acid and ammonia come into contact with its bonds,” said Dr. Thévenaz. “This measurably modifies the way the strands conduct light, and it gave us the idea of using them to make chemical sensors.”\n The researchers discovered another remarkable property, that the change in the helix structure was completely reversible. A sensor using spider silk could thus be used several times over. “We are looking at the possibility of creating silks by adding molecules meant to react with the substances to be tested. That is often impossible with glass fibers, which we have to heat to more than 1,000°C in order to stretch,” said the researcher. Also, because silk is biodegradable, it is ideal for sensors that could be implanted in a living body without needing to be removed later on.\nSpiders at work \nAt EPFL, doctoral student Desmond Chow and post-doc Kenny Hey Tow are working on natural silk strands with a diameter of 5 microns. They were produced by Australian Nephila edulis spiders grown at the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford. Synthetic silks exist, but they are expensive and do not work as well as real ones.\nThe researchers stretch a silk strand taut in a tiny bracket and direct a laser beam at one end of the strand. At the other end, a polarization analyzer is used to measure infinitesimal changes in the light passing through it. If a gas that interacts with the silk strand is present, the device will pick up on this immediately.\n This research is still in the early stages, but it is already firing the imagination of the fiber optics specialist. “We have presented it at several conferences, where it was met with significant interest,” he said.

The CHEOPS satellite, named for “CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite,” successfully blasted off into space on Wednesday after a technical fault with the carrier rocket pushed the launch back by 24 hours. The satellite, which will search for planets orbiting around distant stars, is now flying along its planned path, some 700 km above the Earth’s surface. CHEOPS is the culmination of six years of work, much of which was carried out at the University of Bern and University of Geneva, in collaboration with researchers from EPFL’s Space Center (eSpace) and with support from the European Space Agency (ESA). The launch comes seven days after two astrophysicists from the University of Geneva – Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz – received the Nobel Prize in Physics in Stockholm for their 1995 discovery of the first exoplanet.\nThe satellite, which is equipped with a high-precision telescope, will seek out new exoplanets by looking for tiny variations in a star’s brightness as a planet passes between it and Earth – a method known as transit photometry. CHEOPS will also gather more information about known exoplanets, including their size, orbital elements, atmosphere and evolution, as well as their composition and nature: telluric, gas, ice giant, surface water and other features.\nEPFL involved from the outset\nThe project was a collaborative effort between three Swiss institutions: EPFL, the University of Geneva and the University of Bern. Engineers at eSpace were involved in the early phases of the mission, and worked on the satellite’s initial design. In 2012 the ESA selected CHEOPS, based on that initial design, as its first small-class (or S-class) mission, a type of smaller-scale program intended to promote innovation and education. From that point on, EPFL’s involvement largely revolved around designing the software that would be used to analyze the raw data sent back by the satellite.\nSince the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995, over 4,000 more have been added to the list – orbiting around some 3,000 stars, and all within 400 light years of the Sun. Thousands of other candidates have been detected, mainly by ground-based telescopes, but are pending confirmation. Extrapolating these numbers suggests that there could be at least 100 billion exoplanets in our galaxy alone.\nCHEOPS separated from its carrier rocket around 2 hours and 30 minutes after launch and is expected to begin sending back data in early 2020.\nPicture: (c)ESA", "summary": "The CHEOPS satellite was put into orbit on Wednesday, a day later than planned, from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.

A new study jointly led by EPFL now reports the discovery of a previously unknown infection route used by the bacteria that cause the shigellosis, an intestinal infectious disease characterized by bloody diarrhea. In the newly discovered mechanism, the \nShigella\n bacteria exploits a generic force that is created by the fluctuations of the cell’s own plasma membrane. The work is published in .\nThe study was carried out by John Ipsen at the University of Southern Denmark, Ludger Johannes at the Institut Curie in France and .\nNormally, cells regulate the entry of foreign material very tightly, to prevent invasions from pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. As a result, the invaders have evolved various mechanisms to overcome the barriers and gain entry into cells.\nFor example, one route involves hijacking the cell’s own machinery and tricking it into internalizing the virus or bacterium inside a vesicle that the cell itself makes. This process, which is one of the regular ways cells take in large molecules, is called “endocytosis\".\nThe scientists used various vesicle systems and computer simulations to study a bacterial invasion mechanism that seems to have some unique properties. The mechanism is used, among others, by the bacteria that cause shigella and that produce a small, rigid protein called Shiga toxin.\nThe study found that Shiga toxin particles bind tightly to certain lipids, or fats, on the membrane surface of the cell to be invaded. They then begin to form clusters on the membrane, which cause the membrane to curve inwards, creating tube-shaped invaginations, through which the toxin particles enter the cell. Once inside, the Shiga toxins modify the cell’s genetic mechanism, and infection has begun.\nBut the major discovery was that the toxin actually exploits a generic, physical force in the cell’s membrane to produce the invaginations. This is called the “Casimir force” and was first described as a theoretical force acting between two charged, parallel, conducting surfaces.\nIn terms of biology, the Casimir force is thought to act between membrane-bound proteins in cells, existing on all fluid biological cell membranes and arising only when the pathogen binds tightly to the membrane surface.\nThe researchers propose that \nShigella\n bacteria, and other pathogens, have evolved to take advantage of the Casimir force arising from the fluctuating plasma membrane to infect cells. In addition, because the fats that the toxin binds to are used by the cell for its own operations, the Shiga toxin cannot be blocked from entering without disabling or modifying the normal functions of the cell.\nNanoparticles for drug delivery\nBut because the Casimir force is thought to arise for any tightly bound nanoparticles on the surface of the cell’s membrane, there is the potential for producing a novel, nanoparticle-based pathway for drug delivery. First, we would have to bind nanoparticles tightly to the surface of the cell where they will cluster. Second, the nanoparticles must also slightly increase the cell membrane’s curvature to exploit the Casimir force and gain entry into the cell. Once inside, they can begin making beneficial, defensive changes in the cell’s behavior.\nIllustration of a dissipative particle dynamics simulation showing two tightly bound toxins bound together by the Casimir-like force. © Julian Shillcock/EPFL\n“Where Nature has led in devising a means for pathogens to infect cells, manufactured nanoparticles can follow to treat cellular dysfunction,” says Julian Shillcock.\nThis study was carried out as a collaboration between EPFL’s Blue Brain Project, the University of Southern Denmark, the Institut Curie in France, and the CNRS.

{"id": 382, "text": "We’ve all sat frustrated in rush-hour traffic – either in the morning on the way to work, in the evening on the way home, or both. Some try to get around the problem by leaving a little earlier or a little later. That helps balance out traffic flows and create a certain equilibrium – which many transportation engineers and economists have been studying. Their goal is to better understand the mechanisms behind this equilibrium so that large infrastructure projects can be better designed and help reduce congestion.\nLamotte’s thesis – supervised by Nikolas Geroliminis, a professor at EPFL’s Urban Transport Systems Laboratory – investigates this equilibrium and weighs up different methods for reducing traffic congestion. He shows that most city traffic follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach, but that a more efficient way to regulate traffic would be by introducing a reservation system for specific time slots.\nLamotte’s first finding is that in a multidirectional road system – which is what’s typically seen in and around cities – the drivers who have the longest commute are the ones who make the most effort to avoid rush-hour traffic. That’s because they have a greater incentive to adjust their commute times and find the optimal time for leaving work or home based on how long it will take them to arrive at their destination.\nReserved lanes\nHe also found that one measure that has proven effective for reducing traffic congestion, in Stockholm for example, is a congestion charge. “Even a relatively low charge that varies with the time of day can change people’s behavior,” says Lamotte. However, such charges are not popular and not always feasible. Adopting one in Switzerland, for example, would require a constitutional amendment.\nBased on the observation that traffic congestion results from lose-lose competition among drivers, Lamotte looked to other transportation methods for possible ideas. In air travel, passenger traffic is regulated by reservation systems that let travelers book seats until the plane is full. At that point, travelers have to take another flight. He suggests a similar system for commuter traffic using special reserved lanes. The allowed number of vehicles on the lanes would depend on the roads’ capacity, and the demand for reservations would be used to determine which segments of road to set aside for the system. Commuters who don’t want to use the system would be free to use the regular road lanes whenever they want – but they might find those lanes congested.\nGuiding public policy \n“Today such a system would be hard to implement,” says Lamotte. But he’s already looking ahead to the emergence of new modes of transport. “Car-sharing systems are becoming increasingly common, and self-driving cars are not far off. Commuters will soon start getting used to reserving a vehicle ahead of time. Then it will be just a small step to reserving a time slot as well,” he adds. He hopes his thesis will help inform policymakers’ decisions when it comes to long-term urban planning. “It’s important to be aware that this competition for commuting times bears a cost, and that intelligently designed traffic systems can help cut that cost,” says Lamotte.", "summary": "For his thesis, EPFL PhD student Raphaël Lamotte studied rush-hour traffic congestion.

The town of Zug, for instance, is currently testing an online questionnaire – a first step towards e-voting. But doubts about whether centralized systems are secure prevent online voting from being adopted more widely. EPFL, through the Center for Digital Trust (C4DT), has created and tested an e-voting system based on blockchain technology. It is the first such system to guarantee both cryptographic anonymity and decentralized verification.\nEPFL’s  (DEDIS), developed the e-voting system, which, when put to the test during EPFL’s internal elections, passed with flying colors. The system, underpinned by the blockchain principle of distributed trust, decentralizes the voting and counting processes. These processes are run by several separately managed machines rather than by one central service alone. Data is kept anonymous, and the election outcome is transparent, readily verifiable and guaranteed to be valid. Professor Bryan Ford, who runs DEDIS, is proud of the contribution made by his lab: “We were able to harness our expertise in decentralization technology in order to increase the appeal of e-voting and meet the legitimate needs of voters and electoral authorities.”\nLooking ahead, this system could prove extremely useful in sensitive elections where suspicions of wrongdoing are rife. Using a distributed system means that the opposing sides, which may not trust each other, can be sure that the results are valid and can get actively involved in making the voting process secure. According to Olivier Crochat, C4DT’s executive director, this technology is a great example of the possibilities that digital trust has to offer: “At the moment, the only thing competing sides or the international community can do in contested elections is to send in observers. Yet with this decentralized approach to e-voting, anyone can verify the data and prove that the election was not rigged. What’s more, the technology developed at EPFL does not require much infrastructure and is very easy to put in place, so it can be applied in a wide range of elections.”\nAn open-source environment\nThe e-voting system will be one of the first modules made available on the C4DT’s Digital-Trust Open Platform (DTOP), which brings together open-source software in the aim of building digital trust through technology – one of the central objectives of the new center.\nThe C4DT, which was unveiled by EPFL in December 2017, is a partnership between research institutions, industry, the public sector and civil society. It seeks to develop digital systems based on data-protection, encryption, machine learning and blockchain technologies in order to facilitate interactions with policymakers and social institutions and offer digital protection and security in fields ranging from finance and health to democracy and humanitarian assistance.\nMore information is available at:", "summary": "An e-voting system based on blockchain technology has just been tested at EPFL.

{"id": 384, "text": "Cameroonians call it ‘load-shedding.’ They are referring to ill-timed and never-ending power cuts. More than 70% of the population is not directly affected, however, because they are not even on the grid. For those on it, the grid’s unreliability is the root cause of numerous challenges, especially in hospitals.\nThese problems are the focus of concern for engineers from the University Research Center on Energy for Health Care (CURES), a joint laboratory between EPFL – represented by the EssentialTech programme of the Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV) – and the Yaoundé National Advanced School of Engineering (ENSP). The engineers' conclusions are unequivocal: electrical equipment at hospitals is in poor shape, daily power cuts last up to three hours, electrical fires take place and power surges destroy household appliances. At peak hours, the grid does not generate enough electricity to run sterilizers, and the cuts even affect the lighting in operating theatres. Lives are at stake.\n“Adaptable, sustainable and affordable solutions”\n An in-depth study was carried out in the framework of the CROSS program. This programme, co-financed by EPFL and the University of Lausanne (UNIL), develops technological solutions with both socioeconomic and institutional dimensions. A system using batteries and inverters specially designed for tropical climates was developed and tested in the laboratory. During slack hours it stores up the energy required to meet the needs during peak hours or during power cuts and load-shedding. This solution also isolates and protects electrical equipment from sometimes destructive disruptions on the grid.\nThe total cost of this solution over 10 years – purchase, operations and maintenance – represents 14% of the average annual cost of a hospital’s energy supply. An economic model was used to study the possibility of financing the solution with the resulting savings, which stem in large part from the diesel fuel used for the generators. “The solutions that we come up with have to be adaptable, sustainable and affordable,” said Nicolas Crettenand, who just spent two years in Cameroon as EPFL’s chargé de mission. If the model is successful, hospitals in Cameroon and other developing countries will be able to function more effectively.\nPromoting Swiss know-how in hydroelectricity\n Alongside this effort, EPFL is also engaged in an initiative at the national level to help develop the country’s hydroelectric power. Cameroon is one of four countries on the African continent with significant hydroelectric potential. 70% of electricity production in the country is already the result of hydropower, but that represents only 5% of the potential capacity of this energy source. At the same time, the electrification rate is 50% in cities and 5% in the countryside.\nAcademic and industry partners in Switzerland put together a consortium that is concentrating on small and medium-sized power stations. “At this stage, there is a serious shortage of power stations in Africa with capacity between several hundred kilowatts and several dozen megawatts, and this is a range in which Switzerland has special expertise,” said Crettenand, who ran this project as part of his mission with EPFL’s Energy Center.\nThe consortium aims to work, with local partners, in a spirit of integrated and sustainable development. “We want to develop projects in which hydropower complements other sources of renewable energies and, insofar as possible, provides ways to store energy in storage plants and pumped-storage stations. This type of storage helps with the technical regulation of the power grid and with developing small grids,” said the researcher. The consortium, still more of an interest group at this stage, hopes eventually to help alleviate the electricity problems, especially for the hospitals.", "summary": "EPFL has teamed up with Swiss and Cameroonian partners to address major issues like stabilizing the country’s existing grid, improving energy efficiency and developing hydroelectric potential.", "claim": "EPFL has teamed up with Cameroon and Cameroonian partners to address major issues like stabilizing the country’s existing grid, improving energy efficiency and developing hydroelectric potential.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 5], "noise": false}
{"id": 385, "text": "How can the challenges presented by the ever-growing number of wireless mobile devices and the demand for increasingly high data be met without increasing energy consumption and emission power? Currently MIMO (\nmultiple-input, multiple outputs\n) uses several antennas to transmit and receive signals. This technique is progressively being implemented in devices such as wireless modems and is to be used for the next generation of mobile phones. However, it poses problems because it is costly and difficult to integrate into hardware. \n At EPFL, Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s group has demonstrated that a single antenna can simultaneously transmit two separate signals that have the same throughput as a MIMO solution. The results were published at the beginning of the year, and part of the new findings will be presented by Julien Perruisseau-Carrier, at the IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation in Chicago, at the beginning of July.\t\n In a MIMO system, antennas generally have to be placed at a certain distance from each other, which makes inserting them into mobile and miniature devices a complicated process. An even greater problem with this technique is that each separate transmitting antenna must have its own encoding and amplifying signal device, which is costly and energy-consuming.\nOne antenna, two signals \nAs part of collaboration with researchers from Athens Information Technology (AIT), Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s team developed an antenna capable of emitting simultaneously two information flows, transmitting two independent signals with the same throughput, just as two antennas would do in a MIMO system. This technique called \"Beamspace MIMO\" allows to significantly reduce the number of physical antennas.\n Contrary to what one might think, an antenna does not emit signals in a homogeneous and circular manner. Instead, the repartition of the antenna's radiation is called \"radiation pattern.\" Scientists have managed to decompose this pattern in two, allowing simultaneous emission of two distinct information flows.\n Another advantage of this technique is that only one coding and amplifying device is required to treat the first information flow. The second signal is treated only upstream and then used to make the radiation pattern decomposable. The latter signal acts therefore both as an information carrier and as a mean to decompose the principal pattern. \"This technique allows us to get rid of part of the usual hardware,\" says Julien Perruisseau-Carrier. The process is however difficult and complex. \"One of the biggest challenges is to ensure that each pattern is really independent, to allow an efficient treatment of the information.”\nSuccess thanks to a global approach\t\n The results were obtained through a cross-disciplinary approach. \"This work required us to look at both antennas, particularly reconfigurable ones, and radio coding. Although they are closely linked, these two disciplines are unfortunately often considered separately, which hinders this kind of innovative work,\" explains the scientist.\nJulien Perruisseau-Carrier and his doctoral student Moshen Yousefbeiki are now focusing on a new antenna prototype that will be much more compact and adapted to small mobile devices, such as cell phones and miniature antennas that can be implanted for medical purposes.\nPublication:", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have developed a single antenna that is capable of transmitting the same data as a two-antenna system.

{"id": 387, "text": "Bacteria are everywhere. They are the most abundant form of life on our planet. Pick up just about any surface and its likely covered in bacteria. The aquatic environment is no different. Indeed, the ocean is full of small particles and debris, some inert, some highly nutritious. But how do bacteria differentiate between these surfaces, how do they hold onto them in moving water and how do they recognise each other so that they can work together?\nTake the cholera bacterium, \nVibrio cholerae\n, which infects the small intestine, causing diarrhoea and severe dehydration. It lives in salty water, such as seas, oceans, and estuaries, attaching itself to the shells of crustaceans. These exoskeletons are composed of a sugary polymer called chitin, and provide a rich source of food for the cholera bacterium – allowing it to grow and survive in the environment.\nTo do all this, \nV. cholera\ne uses an appendage that’s “a bit like a grappling hook’’ says lead researcher David Adams. “The idea is that bacteria can throw out these long ropes, hook onto something, and reel it back in’’. These ‘ropes’ are actually the product of highly versatile nano-machines known as type IV pili, which are used by many different bacterial species for motility, sensing surfaces and sticking to them, and even taking up . Consequently, type IV pili are considered critical for the environmental survival and pathogenesis of not just \nV. cholerae\n but a wide range of bacteria.\nOver the course of the last decade or so, the group of  established that \n only when growing on chitinous surfaces and showed that they are essential for DNA-uptake. But how exactly they functioned and what else they might be capable of doing had remained somewhat elusive and was therefore the focus of the current study published in \nNature Microbiology\n.\nTo directly observe the DNA-uptake pili in live \nV. cholerae\n bacteria, the researchers used a technique called cysteine labelling. With that, they were able to establish that, as predicted, the pili are highly dynamic, extending and retracting to take up DNA. “This was an important milestone’’ says laboratory head Melanie Blokesch “even though we’d established some time ago that these structures were there, to see them moving in real-time was something quite special’’.\nThe biggest insight came however, when researchers disrupted the motor that powers pilus retraction, revealing that these ropes could also self-interact with each other, and in doing so, allow cells to stick together. Curiously, different strains of \nV. cholerae\n produce slightly different variants of the PilA subunit, which forms the major building block of the pilus. Remarkably, this creates a set of highly specific interactions that can be used as an identifier between strains ensuring that like only pairs with like.\nFinally, when researchers visualised \nV. cholerae\n growing under more realistic conditions upon chitin surfaces, they revealed that these DNA-uptake pili naturally form dense networks of self-interacting pili. These pili bind tightly to the chitin surface and are required for the bacterium to stay attached during water flow. Thus, the DNA-uptake pilus is a multifunctional toolkit for chitin surface colonisation and kin recognition and the results of this work will help to advance our understanding of how the cholera bacterium survives in the natural environment. This knowledge, on the other hand, is important to better understand the transmission to humans in cholera endemic regions.", "summary": "The cholera bacterium uses a grappling hook-like appendage to take up DNA, bind to nutritious surfaces and recognise ‘family’ members, EPFL scientists have found.

{"id": 388, "text": "Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels means turning to plant-derived biofuels and chemicals. But producing them cost-effectively from plants and other organic matter – collectively referred to as biomass – is a major engineering challenge. Most biomass comes in the form of non-edible plants like trees, grass, and algae, which contain sugars that can be fermented to produce fuel. But biomass also contains lignin, a bulky, complex organic polymer that fills wood, bark, and generally gives plants rigidity. Because it is difficult to process, lignin is usually discarded during biofuel processing. EPFL scientists have now turned lignin from a nuisance to an important source of biofuel by simply adding a common chemical, converting up to 80% of it into valuable molecules for biofuel and plastics. The patent-pending method, which can be scaled up to industrial levels, is .\nComplex, but energy-dense\nLignin is an enormously complex biopolymer, filling the hard wall that surrounds each plant cell. In fact, lignin makes up almost a third of plant biomass, and its molecular structure gives it an energy density 30% greater than that of the sugars that are traditionally processed into biofuel. The problem is that lignin is difficult to extract and transform. Due to its instability, lignin usually rapidly gets destroyed during its extraction and most researchers have failed to efficiently break it apart for upgrade into fuels or chemicals.\nNow, an international team of researchers led by , has shown that they can easily break lignin apart simply by adding the chemical formaldehyde to the process. Formaldehyde is one of the most widely used chemicals in industry, and it is simple and cheap to produce. The researchers found that formaldehyde stabilizes lignin and prevents it from degrading, leading to high yields of building blocks that can be used to make substitutes for petrochemicals. These yields were 3-7 times higher than those obtained from lignin without formaldehyde.\nLignin extracts with (L) and without (R) formaldehyde. © Alain Herzog/J. Luterbacher/EPFL\nScaling up\n“Depending on the wood used we get between 50 and 80%,” says Jeremy Luterbacher, who became known in 2014 for developing a method for extracting sugars from plants safely and cheaply (also published in ). “The chemistry is relatively straightforward; the real challenge is actually finding investors for a pilot facility to demonstrate this.” The market, he says, is difficult for sustainable energy largely because of inconsistent political support and widely varying energy prices. Investors for such innovative platforms are hard to come by in an uncertain market, especially considering the competition of well-established fossil fuels.\n“The technology looks really good,” says Luterbacher. “If the global political establishment sent a consistent message about moving away from fossil fuels, then investors would take notice. But I think Switzerland is a great place to get started. The Swiss have been unwavering supporters of clean energy and could help demonstrate new technologies, and so I’m quite optimistic about the future.”\nThis work involved a collaboration of EPFL’s Institute of Chemical Engineering (ISIC) with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the US Department of Energy, and Purdue University.

{"id": 389, "text": "More than 200 operations per minute! It’s not a firearm, but rather an outstanding packaging tool. The Delta robot made light work of hundreds of packets of Smarties at the Triennial Interpack Exhibition in Düsseldorf. The inventor of the concept, Reymond Clavel, was presenting in Germany the most recent version of the Delta robot, resulting of a collaboration with Bosch. The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. \nIncreasing speed and maintaining precision\n The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot. Scientists have now been able to take advantage of the progress made in motorization – in both power and cost – and this avoids the use of any such linking components. Thus, they have really gone up a gear. Reymond Clavel reveals: “The idea of direct drive had been tucked away in a drawer for ages, but then again, twenty years ago the cost of such motors would have been much too high.”\nA success story\nFrom chocolates to neurosurgery\nOriginally conceived to manipulate small, light objects such as chocolates, over time the Delta has been used for many other applications. Together with the team from the Laboratoire de systèmes robotiques, Mohamed Bouri is developing new variants of the highly dynamic tool: “In particular, we have developed ultra-high-precision robots, designed for use in the areas of electro-erosion, which involves machining very hard materials. These robots are also used in the manipulation and positioning of optical elements.”\nOther members of the Delta family have been developed in areas which demand the highest possible speed and precision, for example in watchmaking. Working together with neurosurgeons at the University Hospital Center of the canton of Vaud, a tactile feedback device has been developed to enable the surgeon to perform his hand movements. Reymond Clavel is convinced – the future of the Delta robot is assured. It will be adapted for use in many important areas: processing; packaging, surgery, watchmaking and – wait for it – chocolates!", "summary": "It’s the story of a long dynasty of industrial robots.

Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples. Her results showed that people are exposed to a number of pesticides, and that this is not due solely to their work.

{"id": 391, "text": "When used in very large quantities in drinking water, chlorine presents significant risks to public health. As well as neutralizing the pathogens found in water, chlorine reacts with the natural organic matter and produces a variety of disinfection by-products (DBPs).\nThe discovery of a potential link between DBPs and an increased rate of miscarriages and bladder cancers has led to the implementation of stricter regulations, as well as changes in the design of water-treatment systems during the last decade.\nThese concerns, added to the risks involved in the storage of chlorine in gaseous form, have recently persuaded many sewage or water-treatment stations to partially stop using chlorine for the disinfection of water. Many systems are now using chloramine instead.\nHowever, as described by Urs von Gunten (School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering at EPFL and EAWAG) and David L. Sedlak (University of California) , a series of recent studies suggests that this change from chlorine to chloramine has led to unexpected consequences that present risks to public health and the environment. It was discovered that monochloramine can form NDMA, a substance that has proved to be much more toxic than the “traditional elements” formed by chlorine.\nThe risks of chlorine\n“This problem affects mainly the U.S.”, explains Urs von Gunten “as the use of monochloramine is illegal in Switzerland. What’s more, in Switzerland the water is often pumped directly from the water-table, and is distributed without chlorine.\"\nIn particular, they apply to the protection of drinking-water sources, the appropriate treatment of water, and the maintenance of distribution networks . These measures enable the authorities to minimize the presence of chlorine, or to avoid its presence altogether.\nUrs von Gunten also raises the issue of the different levels of acceptance in the population. In Switzerland, the taste of chlorine causes suspicion and complaints from the public. “In the U.S. it’s the opposite,” he explains. “If drinking water doesn’t taste of chlorine, people are concerned!”\nThis specialist of drinking-water treatment notes a rather diversified situation in Europe: “The application of standards differs from one country to another. In Switzerland, Germany and Austria the use of chlorine as a disinfectant for water is avoided as far as possible. In Spain, however, it is used a lot, and France is somewhere in between.\nConsidering the risks that the use of chlorine presents to public health, Urs von Gunten offers this conclusion: “The solution can be found in a rigorous regulation that protects drinking water resources, that guarantee clean disinfection, and that maintain distribution systems - these measures would avoid using large quantities of chlorine as a disinfectant and avoid the unpleasant odors, tastes, and health risks that accompany it.”", "summary": "Disinfection using chlorine has played an important role in the supply of drinking water, but its use also involves some risk.

{"id": 393, "text": "Primary liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with current treatments being very limited. Liver cancer cells are particularly addicted to the amino acid glutamine, which fuels their proliferation. EPFL scientists have now found that a liver protein called “liver receptor homolog 1” (LRH-1) is responsible for the digestion of glutamine into smaller molecules, which are avidly consumed by liver cancer cells. Therefore, blocking LRH-1 causes cancer cells to starve and greatly reduces the development of liver cancer in mice, while preserving normal cells. The discovery is published in \nGenes & Development\n, and can introduce new drugs that target LRH-1 to effectively treat liver cancers.\nLRH-1 is a receptor in the cell nucleus, where it regulates the expression of various genes. In this study, scientists from different groups at EPFL led by , discovered that LRH-1 coordinates several key genes that are involved in the metabolism of glutamine – an amino acid to which liver cancer cells become addicted. The researchers found that LRH-1 drives the development of liver tumors by helping cancer cells to convert glutamine into molecules that are directly needed for proliferation.\nThis would also mean that disrupting the function of LRH-1 in the liver of mice would protect against the development of liver cancer. That is exactly what the scientists found when they studied mice that had been genetically modified to not express LRH-1 – so called “knockout” mice. After exposing them to chemical carcinogens, the livers of knockout mice showed dramatically less development of tumors. “Shutting down this pathway by inhibiting LRH-1 abrogates the utilization of glutamine as a fuel and brings the cancerous cells in tremendous metabolic distress,” says Pan Xu, the first author of the study.\nBased on the study, LRH-1 could be a new drug target to prevent the development of liver cancer. Because cancer cells, unlike normal cells, are very often addicted to glutamine, drugs that inhibit glutamine metabolism have been proposed as new highly efficient chemotherapy agents.\n“Inhibiting LRH-1 can thus be an effective way to starve only liver cancer cells, while leaving normal cells intact,” says Kristina Schoonjans. Her lab is now actively trying to identify new chemotherapeutic agents to treat liver cancer by developing specific compounds that inhibit LRH-1. The researchers also hope that these findings may extend to other types of cancer, since LRH-1 is also abundant in the pancreas and ovaries.\nThis work involved a collaboration of Kristina Schoonjans’ lab with EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering and Institute of the Physics of Biological Systems, and the University of Groningen. It was funded by EPFL, the Swiss Cancer League, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and the Novartis Consumer Health Foundation.\nReference\nXu P, Oosterveer MH, Stein S, Demagny H, Ryu D, Moullan N, Wang X, Can E, Zamboni N, Comment A, Auwerx J, Schoonjans K. \nLRH-1-dependent programming of mitochondrial glutamine processing drives liver cancer. \nGenes & Development \n13 June 2016.

{"id": 394, "text": "Today’s “intelligent” cars, equipped with multiple sensors and algorithms, can react to emergency situations, regulate speed, assist with parking and respond to voice commands. But they don’t know who’s at the wheel or how that driver is feeling. The face is a valuable source of this information, and a project initiated by EPFL’s Transportation Center involving EPFL’s Signal Processing 5 Laboratory (LTS5) and PSA Peugeot Citroën aims to mine it for use in the automobiles of the future.\nFace-related technologies have progressed rapidly in recent years, and are used in many areas. Facial recognition is used in real time to relay the exact position of an individual, and eye-tracking devices indicate the direction in which he or she is looking. Analyzing the movements of the head and eyes can also indicate a state of fatigue or sleepiness. EPFL’s LTS5 and its start-up, nViso, are conducting research into capturing facial expressions and exploring the wide range of possible scientific, behavioral and commercial applications that the technology offers.\nTechnological challenges\nThe scientists had to tackle the challenge of adapting the technology for use in cars. “Our goal is to build the technological base to detect and situate a driver’s face at any moment in time,” explains LTS5 director Jean-Philippe Thiran. “Using this tool, it will then be possible to build and test various driver assistance applications such as eye tracking, fatigue detection, lip reading, and so on.”\n“With this study we are trying to make the interface between the car and the driver more intuitive; reading intentions from facial features is a very natural interactive mode,” adds Olivier Pajot, PSA Peugeot Citroën’s representative on the EPFL campus.\nThe instrument, developed using a prototyping platform provided by the French car manufacturer, is currently operational, although the research is still far from finished. Vehicles impose a number of specific limitations, beginning with the question of where to place the camera. It cannot obstruct the driver’s field of vision. “One of the possible options is to place it behind the steering wheel, which would require a system that’s quick enough to recapture the face detection after the arms of the steering wheel interrupt it,” explains Thiran. Another issue is adapting to changing lighting conditions, in order to track the driver’s face as the car goes into a tunnel, for example, or when driving into a setting sun. And, finally, the tool must perform as well when the driver is facing it as when she turns her head to the side.\nImproving performance\n“We are currently working on improving the system’s performance, particularly by increasing the number of images processed,” continues Thiran. “The next step is to test it in realistic conditions. PSA Peugeot Citroën will install the platform on a car and our lab will test the system under various application scenarios.”\nPSA Peugeot Citroën opened an office in EPFL’s Innovation Square in summer 2011, with the goal of collaborating on research and innovation projects.

{"id": 395, "text": "Whether you are a human or a bacterium, your environment determines how you can develop. In particular, there are two fundamental problems. First: what resources can you draw on to survive and grow? And second: how do you respond if your environment suddenly changes? \nA group of researchers from Eawag, ETH Zurich, EPFL Lausanne, and the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen recently discovered that the number of individualists in a bacterial population goes up when its food source is restricted. Their finding goes against the prevailing wisdom that bacterial populations merely respond, in hindsight, to the environmental conditions they experience. Individualists, the study finds, are able to prepare themselves for such changes well in advance.\nScarcity fosters diversity, diversity promotes flexibility\n In a recent paper in the journal \nNature Microbiology\n, researchers working with Frank Schreiber have shown that individual cells in bacterial populations can differ widely in how they respond to a lack of nutrients. Although all of the cells in a group are genetically identical, the way they process nutrients from their surroundings can vary from one cell to another. For example, bacteria called \nKlebsiella oxytoca \npreferentially take up nitrogen from ammonium (NH4+), as this requires relatively little energy. When there isn’t enough ammonium for the entire population, some of the bacteria start to take up nitrogen by fixing it from elementary nitrogen (N2), even though this requires more energy. If the ammonium suddenly runs out altogether, these cells at least are prepared. While some cells suffer, the group as a whole can continue to grow. “Although all of the bacteria in the group are genetically identical and exposed to the same environmental conditions, the individual cells differ among themselves,” says Schreiber.\nDetailed insights thanks to the latest technology\n Schreiber and his colleagues were only able to reveal the astonishing differences between the bacteria by studying them very closely. “We had to measure nutrient uptake by individual bacterial cells – even though these are only 2 μm large,” explains Schreiber. “Usually, microbiologists study the collective properties of millions or even billions of bacteria. It was only thanks to the close collaboration between the research groups, and by pooling our expertise and technical equipment, that we were able to study the bacteria in such detail.”\nBacteria are individualists, too\n The present study shows to what extent individuality – in bacteria and in general – can be essential in a changing environment. Differences between individuals give the group new properties, enabling it to deal with tough environmental conditions. “This indicates that biological diversity does not only matter in terms of the diversity of plant and animal species but also at the level of individuals within a species,” says Schreiber. \n Next, Schreiber and his colleagues plan to study whether the individualistic behavior of specific individuals is of equal importance in natural environments.\nOriginal publication\nPhenotypic heterogeneity driven by nutrient limitation promotes growth in fluctuating environments \n Frank Schreiber, Sten Littmann, Gaute Lavik, Stéphane Escrig, Anders Meibom, Marcel Kuypers, Martin Ackermann.

Equipped with an autopilot and a miniature high-definition camera, it is used by hundreds of professionals worldwide. This start-up installed at the gates of EPFL hopes to increase its sales tenfold in the next years and create dozens of new jobs in the field of airborne drones. It does so thanks to an investment of 5 million Swiss Francs from the publicly traded French company Parrot, making them a majority shareholder in senseFly.\nsenseFly drones demonstrate the full extent of their capabilities when combined with software developed by Pix4D, a spin-off of EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB). The algorithms developed by Pix4D make it possible to assemble hundreds of aerial pictures and, within minutes, to get an extremely accurate 3D and geo-referenced image of the observed terrain. This young company based at EPFL’s Science Park is also of interest to Parrot, which invested 2.4 million Swiss Francs for a minority share in Pix4D. “In the 1980’s the algorithms were really unreliable, and I was convinced it would take well over thirty years to become the basis of fully-automated, reliable and useful commercial products. This is a wonderful example of how curiosity-driven research, for example the ability of a human to make sense of the world around him through what he sees, eventually led to useful results,” said Pascal Fua, director of the CVLAB.\nLike an Insect\nUsing one of senseFly’s small high-performance drones is a breeze. The course can be programmed with software pre-flight and still be modified throughout the flight’s duration. No runway necessary: three movements back-and-forth are enough to start the engine, and the 500-gram wing takes off. The drone reaches a cruising speed of 40 km/h to autonomously map areas ranging from a few hectares to several square kilometers in one flight, with a resolution ranging from 3 to 30 cm/pixel depending on the distance above ground. Within a maximum of thirty minutes, the drone returns to its starting point without further assistance. All that is necessary for the next mission is to change the battery.\nThe technology on which these devices are based was created in 2001, when a team of robotics researchers in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) at EPFL began to investigate the strategies of control and navigation in flying insects. Early research led to the development of an integrated autopilot using intelligent control strategies similar to that of flies and bees. “By 2008 it was included in an ultra-light flying wing, which incorporated all the advantages of insects: efficient, elegant, light, elemental and intelligent,” recalls Jean-Christophe Zufferey, founder and CEO of senseFly. “I am very pleased that our robotic flying insect has not only helped to elucidate biological issues, but has also been able to promote the socio-economic development of our region by creating dozens of new high-value jobs. In collaboration with the newly created National Competence Center in Robotics, senseFly contributes to making EPFL and the surrounding region an important center for artificial intelligence and robotics,” says Dario Floreano, director of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and of the National Competence Center in Robotics.\nWhile the legislation for the usage of drones is being discussed in most countries, the low mass and speed of these ultra-light drones gives them a unique advantage by limiting the potential damage they could cause and thereby favored for civilian use.\nEPFL’s Pole of Expertise in Civilian Drones\nParrot, a global leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones, has recently invested in drones for the consumer market. It has released a Wi-Fi controllable quadricopter, of which it has sold more than 300,000 since its launch in 2010. The collaboration with the French group will create synergies for both EPFL start-ups.\nThe increasing need of data for Geographical Information Systems (GIS), such as Google Earth & Street View, should drive the market of ultra-light professional civilian drones to one billion dollars by 2020. The combination of senseFly trouble-free hardware, Pix4D’s unique mapping software and Parrot high volume manufacturing expertise provide the key elements to address this fast emerging market. Furthermore, the collaborations with the National Competence Centers (www.nccr-robotics.ch & www.MICS.org), both managed by EPFL, provide a heart to this internationally recognized center of expertise in civilian UAV technologies.\nSenseFly, founded in 2009 in “Le Garage”, EPFL’s incubator, will remain in the region and its management team will stay at the helm. “We can benefit from the technological expertise of Parrot, from its externalized industrial organization and its financial strength to accelerate our worldwide distribution,” said Jean-Christophe Zufferey, senseFly CEO. This strategic investment will give the French company access to the expertise and the technology for specialized drones.\nAs for Pix4D, created in 2011, Parrot’s investment enables the exploration of new business horizons. “This reinforces our position as a leader in software for professional drones,” adds Christoph Strecha, the company’s CEO.", "summary": "The French company Parrot, world leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones and already in the market for consumer drones, acquired for 5 million Swiss Francs a majority share in senseFly, a start-up from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL.

{"id": 397, "text": "How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.\nHuman comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”\nCoccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”\nCoccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average. The researcher’s first step was to assess the campus’ energy balance; she looked at individual buildings and the effect that buildings have on each other. Summers will be hotter and hotter, and this will be felt more in built spaces than in wooded ones. Existing buildings will have to be renovated, and new buildings will require design changes. Particular attention will have to be paid to the exterior of buildings: “Vegetation moderates microclimates and blocks solar and infrared radiation, evapotranspiration reduces the air temperature, and plants provide shade,” says Coccolo. “These factors completely change our perceived thermal comfort.”\nTurning climate challenges into design opportunities\nTo offset the expected rise in summer temperatures, the study shows that, in addition to proper insulation, buildings and their immediate surroundings will need to provide more shade through protective features according to the level of solar radiation, the direction the building faces and the season. For Coccolo, this goes beyond simply multiplying the number of plants and trees; the focus should be on what truly enhances comfort. This may include such things as foliage density and plant height. Replacing asphalt with grass, for example, can radically change our thermal perception.\nThe Urban Systems group at the LESO-PB believes that, in the future, architects and urban planners will need to work together in designing the space between buildings, which is just as important as the space inside them (leso.epfl.ch/urbansimulation).\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press Service EPFL\n +4179 502 81 06\nSilvia Coccolo\n Postdoctoral Researcher\n +41 21 693 4543\nJean-Louis Scartezzini \nDirector of the Laboratory of Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory\n +41 21 693 55 49", "summary": "In the year 2100, temperatures at EPFL are expected to be similar to those currently experienced in Perugia, in central Italy.

Currently disused, some of its course is still visible in some places between Cossonay and Morges.\n The Entreroches canal was the answer to the old European dream of a waterway linking the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The arrival of the railway combined with the lack of money during the 19th century ended this dream abruptly.\nNavigation path\n Departure takes place on the harbor of Grandson, on Lake Neuchâtel. A first tunnel takes you into the Orbe plain which is crossed in the open. Then another tunnel allows you to slide unnoticed under the Mormont hill between Yverdon-les-Bains and Lausanne. In Daillens, the boat gets into a lift and continues its way underground. 6 hours later, you arrive at Lake Geneva in Préverenges.\nA 78 meters lift\nThe Venoge River’s protected course\n Out of the 38 km of the canal, three-quarters pass through tunnels. This is partially caused by the presence of architectural barriers – since there are several towns along its way and it is not always possible to get round them, not to mention too costly. Environmental protection laws forced Fränz Zeimetz to reconsider some of his choices: \"Take the Venoge River for instance: a law dating from 1997 states that it is forbidden to change its natural course, to touch its watershed and to transform its tributaries. Therefore, the best way to get there was underground. \"\nInteractive Tunnels\n Since the canal is designed to transport leisure boats as well as cargo, the student decided to trade his engineering skills for architectural creativity. He thus devised an original way to animate this long underground journey. \"We could project images on the tunnels’ walls showing the outdoor landscapes we are going through or we could even tell the story of the Entreroches canal… why not?\" An engineer has the right to dream.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES - Student projects (5): An EPFL civil engineering student has envisioned a 38 km long navigation canal between Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Geneva.

The research team, led by Mirjam Münch, also showed that the effects of light exposure last until the early evening, and that light intensity has an impact on cognitive mechanisms. The results of this research were recently published in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience. \n Light synchronizes our biological clocks. It is collected in the eye by photoreceptors that use photopigments (pigments that change when exposed to light), known as melanopsin. These cells, which differ from rods and cones, are considered a third class of photoreceptors in the retina and were discovered just ten years ago. They’re not there to form an image, but to perceive and absorb photons in the visible light spectrum. In addition, they are stimulated by blue light. \nExploring office lighting \n Münch and her team wanted to know how our circadian rhythm could be influenced by our perception of light during the daytime. They created realistic office lighting conditions and recruited 29 young participants. “For this study, we took into account the intensity of natural and artificial light without specifically evaluating their spectra.”\nFrom daytime to dusk\n To synchronize their internal biological clocks, the volunteers had to maintain a regular sleep schedule during the seven days leading up to the test. They wore bracelets equipped with light sensors and accelerometers, so that the scientists could monitor their movements. \n The study itself took place over two eight-hour sessions. The participants spent the first six hours in an experiment room, first in well-lighted conditions (1000-2000 lux, more or less equivalent to natural light in a room). In the second session, the light intensity was about 170 lux, which is what the eye perceives in a room without a window, lit with artificial light. For this experiment, light intensity was measured at eye-level. Every 30 minutes, the subjects were asked to assess how alert or sleepy they felt. \n Finally, at the end of each session, the participants underwent two hours of supplemental memory tests in a darkened room – less than 6 lux. During these last two hours, the researchers took saliva samples in order to measure cortisol and melatonin concentrations. These two hormones are produced in a in a 24-hour cycle by the human body.\nBoosted by the light\n The volunteers who were subjected to higher light intensity during the afternoon were more alert all the way into the early evening. When they were subjected to light intensity ten times weaker, however, they showed signs of sleepiness and obtained lower scores on the memory tests. \n These results were observed even in the absence of changes in cortisol and melatonin concentrations in their saliva. “With this study, we have discovered that light intensity has a direct effect on the subjective feeling of sleepiness as well as on objective cognitive performance, and that the benefits of more intense light during the daytime last long past the time of exposure,” concludes Münch.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences our cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until early evening.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have proven that light intensity influences our cognitive performance and how alert we feel, and that these positive effects last until early evening.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 400, "text": "How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.\nHuman comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”\nCoccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”\nCoccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average. The researcher’s first step was to assess the campus’ energy balance; she looked at individual buildings and the effect that buildings have on each other. Summers will be hotter and hotter, and this will be felt more in built spaces than in wooded ones. Existing buildings will have to be renovated, and new buildings will require design changes. Particular attention will have to be paid to the exterior of buildings: “Vegetation moderates microclimates and blocks solar and infrared radiation, evapotranspiration reduces the air temperature, and plants provide shade,” says Coccolo. “These factors completely change our perceived thermal comfort.”\nTurning climate challenges into design opportunities\nTo offset the expected rise in summer temperatures, the study shows that, in addition to proper insulation, buildings and their immediate surroundings will need to provide more shade through protective features according to the level of solar radiation, the direction the building faces and the season. For Coccolo, this goes beyond simply multiplying the number of plants and trees; the focus should be on what truly enhances comfort. This may include such things as foliage density and plant height. Replacing asphalt with grass, for example, can radically change our thermal perception.\nThe Urban Systems group at the LESO-PB believes that, in the future, architects and urban planners will need to work together in designing the space between buildings, which is just as important as the space inside them (leso.epfl.ch/urbansimulation).\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press Service EPFL\n +4179 502 81 06\nSilvia Coccolo\n Postdoctoral Researcher\n +41 21 693 4543\nJean-Louis Scartezzini \nDirector of the Laboratory of Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory\n +41 21 693 55 49", "summary": "In the year 2100, temperatures at EPFL are expected to be similar to those currently experienced in Perugia, in central Italy.

{"id": 401, "text": "With cities expected to grow significantly in the future, it is vital to plan their development and anticipate their impact on the environment ahead of time. Nahid Mohajeri, an urban architect and geographer at EPFL, looked into Geneva’s history in order to understand how the city developed the way it did and predict how it will change in the future.\nIn order to model a city's evolution over time, Dr. Mohajeri came up with the idea of combining two different scientific approaches: statistical thermodynamics – \nPreliminary results, published in Ecological Modelling, indicate that cities in general – and Geneva in particular – grow by virtue of two very different processes: they spread out and/or become denser. Dr. Mohajeri also observed that large cities are proportionally more energy efficient and have a lower specific ecological footprint per resident than small towns.\nFor the purpose of quantifying the different cities, the researcher analyzed them in terms of their thermodynamic entropy, which scientists call “randomness.” She also used other physics and engineering methods, such as spatial analysis. In this way, Dr. Mohajeri was able to model cities on a computer.\nThe goal is to compare the ecological impact of various urban forms – compact or dispersed – in view of one day developing a framework for building eco-cities. But is there really an ideal urban form? That’s what Dr. Mohajeri is trying to determine.\nEvery city evolves on the basis of several criteria specific to that city, such as the land on which it was built and the political decisions that transform it. “Kerman, in southern Iran, is an interesting example,” said the researcher. “The city experienced rapid growth at the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979. ‘Revolutionary’ housing was quickly thrown up on the outskirts of the city. The old town is squat and dense, and its expansion seems to be aimed at replicating an American city.”\nDr. Mohajeri analyzed dozens of cities around the world, from New Orleans to London and Geneva. Some give the impression of having grown haphazardly, while others are neatly squared off by their avenues, or, like Geneva, stretch out slowly in the shape of an octagon.\nThe parameters used by the researcher focus on the spatial distribution of 11,418 buildings. According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, more than 83% of Switzerland’s population will live in urban areas in 2050. Dr. Mohajeri’s studies on entropy led to the discovery that two very different processes drove Geneva’s growth: expansion (where streets and buildings were added to the edge of the city) and densification (where streets and buildings were added within the existing city). Expansion has been the dominant force in Geneva over the past 170 years.\nThe Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO - PB) uses the thermodynamic-statistical approach, which originated in the field of physics, to learn more about the complex relationship between the built environment and the natural environment.\nOnce the laws of thermodynamics that govern a given city’s growth are identified, the next step will be to learn how their spatial-temporal evolution affects the functioning of their ecosystem. More specifically, the idea is to determine how a city’s growth and form influence its energy consumption, changes in land cover, biodiversity and human well-being.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher is modeling cities in order to understand their metabolism and determine their ecological impact when they grow and change.

But they don’t know who’s at the wheel or how that driver is feeling. The face is a valuable source of this information, and a project initiated by EPFL’s Transportation Center involving EPFL’s Signal Processing 5 Laboratory (LTS5) and PSA Peugeot Citroën aims to mine it for use in the automobiles of the future.\nFace-related technologies have progressed rapidly in recent years, and are used in many areas. Facial recognition is used in real time to relay the exact position of an individual, and eye-tracking devices indicate the direction in which he or she is looking. Analyzing the movements of the head and eyes can also indicate a state of fatigue or sleepiness. EPFL’s LTS5 and its start-up, nViso, are conducting research into capturing facial expressions and exploring the wide range of possible scientific, behavioral and commercial applications that the technology offers.\nTechnological challenges\nThe scientists had to tackle the challenge of adapting the technology for use in cars. “Our goal is to build the technological base to detect and situate a driver’s face at any moment in time,” explains LTS5 director Jean-Philippe Thiran. “Using this tool, it will then be possible to build and test various driver assistance applications such as eye tracking, fatigue detection, lip reading, and so on.”\n“With this study we are trying to make the interface between the car and the driver more intuitive; reading intentions from facial features is a very natural interactive mode,” adds Olivier Pajot, PSA Peugeot Citroën’s representative on the EPFL campus.\nThe instrument, developed using a prototyping platform provided by the French car manufacturer, is currently operational, although the research is still far from finished. Vehicles impose a number of specific limitations, beginning with the question of where to place the camera. It cannot obstruct the driver’s field of vision. “One of the possible options is to place it behind the steering wheel, which would require a system that’s quick enough to recapture the face detection after the arms of the steering wheel interrupt it,” explains Thiran. Another issue is adapting to changing lighting conditions, in order to track the driver’s face as the car goes into a tunnel, for example, or when driving into a setting sun. And, finally, the tool must perform as well when the driver is facing it as when she turns her head to the side.\nImproving performance\n“We are currently working on improving the system’s performance, particularly by increasing the number of images processed,” continues Thiran. “The next step is to test it in realistic conditions. PSA Peugeot Citroën will install the platform on a car and our lab will test the system under various application scenarios.”\nPSA Peugeot Citroën opened an office in EPFL’s Innovation Square in summer 2011, with the goal of collaborating on research and innovation projects.

In the same way, the noise of jet engines could be deflected towards the sky rather than the ground, and certain types of vehicle could be rendered undetectable by sonar.\nScientists at EPFL’s Laboratory for Electromagnetism and Acoustics have succeeded in creating a device that implements the principle of negative refraction in the domain of acoustics. This was achieved by applying recent findings from the domain of electromagnetism, and the results could mean that one day objects are no longer an obstacle to sound.\n“Even though it’s only at the experimental stage, the study of this phenomenon has become a burning topic in acoustics over the last three or four years”, describes Hervé Lissek, scientist and co-author of an article recently published in the journal Physical Review B*.\nAlready well understood in the area of optics, the phenomenon of refraction is illustrated by the deflection of a light beam when it encounters an alteration in the propagation medium. This explains why a straw, when dipped into a glass of water, appears to be broken at the point where it enters the liquid – the trajectory of the light is deflected when it passes from one medium (air) to another (water). Refraction is also responsible for mirages and rainbows. \nTo “flow” around an object\nNegative refraction is not found in nature. It can be produced by using artificial structures called “metamaterials”, which have the property of further bending – or inverting the path of – light rays, resulting in their potential to “flow” around an object, at least theoretically. Some scientists believe that this phenomenon could one day be used to make objects invisible or transparent, a bit like Harry Potter’s cape!\nFor the first time, EPFL scientists have succeeded in demonstrating the possibility of obtaining negative refraction in the domain of acoustics using a discrete device; this work was based on a recent PhD thesis in the domain of electromagnetism**. Sound is defined by two essential properties of a fluid (a material medium) in which it travels: its mass, put in movement by an acoustic disturbance, the acceleration of which is normally directed according to the forces of acoustic pressure (inertial force); and its compressibility, which allows it naturally to oppose such forces (restoring force).\nUsing the device they conceived, the EPFL scientists obtained, simultaneously, negative values for these two parameters; that is to say, to further compress the particle of fluid subjected to excessive acoustic pressure, and to determine that its acceleration oppose the forces of pressure. This combination is a prerequisite in obtaining negative refraction, a property that has been initially observed in a digital model of acoustic metamaterial. Similar results have also been observed in a second phase, using an experimental prototype which enabled the validation of the theoretical concept.\nEven though we are still a long way from a genuine acoustic “invisibility cape”, these results demonstrate the performance of a tangible physical system representing negative refraction, while constituting an important achievement for research in this area.\n*“Acoustic transmission line metamaterial with negative/zero/positive refractive index”, published in Physical Review B – Frédéric Bongard, Hervé Lissek and Juan R.

{"id": 406, "text": "Today’s consumers want a cleaner, greener society. There are a number of concepts out there addressing this goal, such as green economy, green growth, sustainable development, bioeconomy and circular economy. These terms have even been adopted by non-profit organizations, lobbies and international organizations for use in their names and initiatives. But that doesn’t necessarily mean we’re all clear on exactly what these concepts mean. At least that’s according to a recent study carried out at EPFL. The research, published this month in \nJournal of Cleaner Production\n, looked specifically at the concept of the green economy. Scientists compared 140 definitions found in journal articles (117) and white papers (23) published over the past ten years. 95 of these definitions were of “green economy” and 45 of “green growth,” a similar term that is often used as a synonym. \nThe concept of a green economy first appeared in the scientific literature in the 1990s but didn’t really gain traction until 2008 – in the wake of the global financial crisis – especially in political and academic circles. The United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were also major drivers of this trend. “The number of journal articles published on this topic every year went from zero in 2008 to 200 in 2018,” says Albert Merino-Saum, the study’s lead author and a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS). But the problem is that each article has its own definition of what the green economy is. While everyone seems to agree that a green economy is based on various social, economic and technological factors, the way each one is described and the importance given to each one can vary from one study to the next.\n“We were surprised to see that all these articles were being published without referring to a seminal study or benchmark paper giving a clear definition of ‘green economy.’ That’s highly unusual for scientific research, where people first try to establish a common conceptual basis. So in our study we aimed to clarify the term and thereby help policymakers evaluate different options in view of the consequences,” says Merino-Saum.\nThree conceptual families\n The first step was to establish a framework of around 40 conceptual elements for evaluating the 140 definitions. The scientists found that the definitions could be grouped into three main families. The first is what they call “econocentric,” or focused on economic factors like trade and finance to achieve environmental and social goals. “This family is closest to the idea of ‘green growth,’ except that discussions of green growth generally don’t account for the fact that natural resources are limited,” says Merino-Saum. The second family focuses more heavily on human well-being. Here the emphasis is on reducing inequality in the distribution of wealth and access to natural resources. The third family sees science and technology as a solution for environmental problems and a vector for sustainable economic growth. “Going forward, we’d like to see journal articles start by stating which ‘green economy’ conceptual family they are referring to,” says Merino-Saum. \nAn idea on its way out? \n But that assumes that the green economy concept is here to stay. Some people think it’s merely a fad that will soon go out of fashion. “Right now we’re seeing a lot of articles about the ‘circular economy.’ From 2008 to 2018, the number of these articles has swelled from zero per year to 800, with a sharp rise in 2015,” says Merino-Saum. This surge could be due in part to reports issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has become a thought leader on the topic, and to the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan. Merino-Saum believes that the green economy concept will only last if researchers make a clear distinction between it and its cousin, sustainable development – such as the fact that the former is more practice-oriented. One sign that ‘green economy’ could be on the way out is its rejection by the UN, which, in its 2030 Agenda, talks about 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe irony isn’t lost on Merino-Saum that the terms coming in and out of fashion relate to sustainability. “Of course, some of the terms are only used for green washing,” he says bluntly, “but most of them are genuinely intended to spur a transition to a more sustainable society.” According to Merino-Saum, the keys are: using the right indicators to measure how effectively concepts are being implemented, and adapting implementation to the actual conditions in a given situation. For instance, priorities like access to water, water quality and access to healthcare can differ from one country – or region – to the next. Now that this study is finished, Merino-Saum and his team plan to dissect some other concepts. Next up? ‘Smart cities’ and ‘urban sustainability.’", "summary": "Concerns about climate change have given rise to a whole series of concepts that are widely used despite their lack of a concrete definition.

{"id": 407, "text": "For humans, it comes perfectly naturally. But walking on two legs is actually a complicated task, requiring several muscles to perform delicate balancing acts. That’s why, in spite of years of major technological advancements in the field, humanoid robots are still far from being able to get around easily and reliably. Engineers at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory are testing new walking algoritms on a plateform called COMAN, short for COmpliant HuMANoid. This 95-cm-tall humanoid is designed specifically for studying walking – which is why it has no head.\nCOMAN was developed under the EU AMARSi project and is being used by several research teams. The EPFL team is looking specifically at the “brains” of the machine. “We developed algorithms that can improve the robot’s balance while it’s walking,” says Hamed Razavi, a researcher scientist at the Biorobotics Lab.\nIn harmony with symmetries\nOne of COMAN’s distinguishing features is its joints, which are integrated with elastic elements that give it greater flexibility when performing different tasks. The EPFL team came up with a novel control algorithm for the robot, based on the existing symmetries in the structure and dynamics of the robot’ as well as the mathematical equations representing the robot dynamics. “You could say we’re working in harmony with these symmetries rather than against them. As a result, we obtain a more natural and robust walking gait,” says Razavi.\nThe control algorithm uses sophisticated computer programs to carefully analyze the date received from the robot – including its position, velocity, joint angles, etc. – and sends appropriate commands to the motors, telling them what to do in order to maintain the robot's balance. “For example, if someone pushes COMAN, for example, our algorithms will calculate exactly where its foot should land in order to counteract the perturbation,” says Razavi.\nClimbing stairs and opening doors\nThe algorithms are geared towards three types of realworld applications. The first is carrying out rescue missions in disastrous scenarios. “In environments designed by humans - like a nuclear power plant where there are stairs to climb and doors to open – humanoid robots can get around more easily than robots with wheels,” says Razavi. The second is helping with tasks like carrying heavy boxes or moving objects (see box). And the third is creating exoskeletons for the disabled.\n“Making the robots more stable is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Razavi. The next step is refining the algorithms so that the humanoids have a wider range of movement and can overcome obstacles and walk on irregular or sloped surfaces.\nHumanoids helping humans\nAs part of this project, Jessica Lanini and Hamed Razavi studied how two people carrying an object together are able to walk, turn and speed up in a coordinated manner – without communicating with each other. Their findings, recently published in , indicate that the two people automatically synchronize their steps, like a quadruped. Now the researchers plan to apply their results to humanoid robots.\n“Whether for manufacturing or natural disasters, we need robots that can interact with humans and help us carry heavy objects,” says Lanini. “But such robots don’t exist. That’s because, in order to operate safely and effectively, the robots would need to be able to make decisions and respond to unexpected circumstances.”\nThe researchers decided to observe humans, who do things better and more naturally than robots. They analyzed the way humans move and found that some factors like speed, force and hand position play a pivotal role in understanding “commands” like speeding up or stopping. The next step is modeling these observations in order to program the robots. “What is exactly that makes us realize to slow down or turn? The applied force? A combination of force and speed? The boundary is not yet clear,” says Razavi. \nClara Marc", "summary": "Walking on two legs isn’t as easy as it seems. For robots and their designers, it is an even bigger challenge!

{"id": 408, "text": "Will it be possible one day to reconfigure electronic microchips however we want, even when they are in use? A recent discovery by a team at EPFL suggests as much. The researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to create conductive pathways several atoms wide in a material, to move them around at will and even to make them disappear. Their research is the subject of a recent article appearing in Nature Nanotechnology.\nAdaptable electronics is generating significant interest in the scientific community because of the many applications. Imagine for a moment that one single microchip was capable of accomplishing the tasks of several different circuits. For example, a circuit assigned to process sound information could, when not being used for this purpose, be reassigned to process images. This would allow us to miniaturise our electronic devices.\nAt the same time, it would become possible to develop resilient circuits. Whenever a microchip is damaged, it could theoretically reconfigure itself so that it could still function using the components that remain intact. \"An effective way to keep faulty devices working when they are in hard-to-reach places, like space,\" says Leo McGilly, the article's lead author.\nUnderlying this promising technology are so-called 'ferroelectric' materials in which it is possible to create flexible conductive pathways. These pathways are generated by applying an electric field to the material. More specifically, when the electric current is applied, certain atoms moves either \"up\" or \"down,\" which is known as polarisation. In recent years, the academic world has observed that conductive pathways several atoms wide - called 'walls' - form between these polarized zones. The only problem is that, until now, it was impossible to control how these pathways form.\nAt this point, the researchers have tested their research on isolated materials. The next step consists in developing a prototype of a reconfigurable circuit. Leo McGilly would go even further. \"The fact that we can generate pathways wherever we want could allow us to imitate in the future phenomena that take place inside the brain, with the regular creation of new synapses. This could prove useful in reproducing the phenomenon of learning in an artificial brain.\"\n-----\nAdd. informations:", "summary": "Multitasking circuits capable of reconfiguring themselves in real time and switching functions as the need arises - this is the promising application stemming from a discovery made at EPFL and published in Nature Nanotechnology.

{"id": 409, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process. After all, as Mazur noted, “we are all born as scientists.” Who dare to know.", "summary": "EPFL held a special Education Day last Friday, 17 May, as part of events commemorating its 50\nth\n anniversary.

It uses them simultaneously, then aggregates the data obtained to deliver the final content to each unit. As a result the download speed can be doubled when two devices work together. “Videos represent 60% of the traffic on mobile networks, and the demand is growing faster than the ability of the network to provide bandwidth,” says Christina Fragouli, co-founder of the start-up. This results in increasing interruptions while viewing a video.\nThis ingenious system comes with many constraints. “To accomplish this, we must solve the problem of resource allocation, all the while accounting for variabilities in the wireless network,” explains Lorenzo Keller, the other co-founder of this spin-off from EPFL and University of California Irvine (UCI). The algorithms behind this system provide for any wireless device which transmits, via any network, at any time.

{"id": 412, "text": "For rent: 32 individual rooms for a combined surface area of 4cm\n2\n, heating and food included! Biologists and microfluidics specialists at EPFL have joined forces and developed a highly innovative research tool: a 2cm by 2cm ‘chip’ with 32 independent compartments, each of which is designed to hold a nematode – a widely used worm in the research world. The device is described in the journal \nMolecular Neurodegeneration\n.\n“Unlike conventional cultures in petri dishes, this device lets us monitor individual worms rather than a population of them,” said Laurent Mouchiroud, from EPFL's Laboratory of Integrative Systems Physiology.\nFreeze frame\nEach of these ‘cells’ is fed by microfluidic channels. These allow variable concentrations of nutrients or therapeutic molecules to be injected with precision. The ambient temperature can also be adjusted.\nEach worm is observed through a microscope throughout its life. However, for more detailed investigations and very high resolution images, the worms need to be immobilized. “For this we use a temperature-sensitive solution,” said Matteo Cornaglia, from the Laboratory of Microsystems. “We inject it in liquid form at 15°C, then bring the temperature up to 25°C, which transforms it into a gel. The worm is immobilized in just a few minutes, then we bring the temperature back down and rinse out the solution – and the worm is able to move again.”\nProtein aggregates in the cross-hairs\nThis method is fully reversible and does not affect the nematode’s development. Using it, researchers can observe the formation of protein aggregates linked to several neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s. The same worm can be photographed several times, as the clusters develop. “This is totally new, and it will help us learn more not only about how these aggregates grow, but also about the tissue in which they form,” said Mouchiroud. “In addition, we have already been able to test and observe the effect of certain drugs on how the clusters form.”\nNematodes are very useful models for studying a number of human diseases. In many cases, they obviate the need to experiment on rodents. But until now, handling nematodes was a delicate affair.

{"id": 413, "text": "This new robot sucks: to move, air has to be sucked out of its individual components. Inspired by muscle contraction, its individual soft components are activated (they collapse) when negative pressure (vacuum) is applied to them. The robot uses suction to grab objects or to stick to a smooth wall for climbing, so it can really achieve a wide range of tasks because of the unique properties of vacuum. The robot can be reconfigured to perform different tasks, making it highly modular and versatile, with a wide range of applications in both research and in industry. The invention is published today in \nScience Robotics\n.\n“What we have is a fully functional robot which is entirely powered by vacuum, which has never been done before,” says EPFL roboticist Matt Robertson who worked on the project. “Previous work has shown individual components powered by vacuum, but never in a complete system.”\nVacuum-powered components are a recent addition to robotics – and, more importantly, they’re safe. Today, most actuators on the market are activated by applying positive pressure, i.e. by injecting air into their components. But containing positive pressure requires stiff high-pressure pneumatics, which also pose a safety threat: in extreme situations, they can explode. By comparison, vacuum-powered actuators are safe, soft, and simple to build.\n“What's more is that our soft building blocks are designed to be plug-and-play, so ultimately we can assemble several types of robots from the same basic units,” says EPFL scientists and lead researcher Jamie Paik. “They can be reconfigured to perform different tasks like crawling, gripping canisters, and climbing a vertical wall.”\nA five-module robot can move like a tentacle; a four-module robot with a suction gripper can grab an object and drop it on a target; a three-module robot can crawl on the ground; a two-module robot can be equipped with suction-cup feet to climb a smooth, vertical surface, like glass. The enormous versatility of the new robots can be exploited for studying locomotion and for future applications at an industrial level.\nThis research was funded in part by NCCR Robotics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have created the first functional robot powered entirely by vacuum: made up of soft building blocks, it moves by having air sucked out of them.

{"id": 414, "text": "A second small Swiss satellite is going to be launched into space. After SwissCube in 2009, the Swiss Space Center (SSC) at EPFL is working on a new project. Baptized as CubETH, the youngest member of the Swiss cubsats family takes a lot from its predecessor: it measures ten cubic centimeters and weighs less than 1.5 kg. However, its scientific mission is more ambitious. This device is the result of a partnership with the Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich (ETHZ) as well as other collaborators. Its launching is scheduled for the end of 2015 at the earliest. The prototype is currently going through the “flat sat” stage: in order to test all its electronic components, they are electrically connected as they will be in the final structure while lying flat on a lab’s table.\n\"We aim at making CubETH a high performance orbitographic tool capable of calculating its position, altitude and orientation in space with high accuracy,\" said Markus Rothacher, director of the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab at ETH Zurich and main investigator for the scientific part of the project. The idea is to design a stable satellite in order to prevent it from spinning, as it happened to the SwissCube. \"But most importantly, added the specialist, we want to create conditions for future cubsats constellations so that, for example, we could carry out thorough observations of Earth at a given time. For that reason, it is essential to know the satellites’ exact orbits so as to coordinate their trajectories and scientific equipment.\"\nProven on Earth, unprecented in space\nTo achieve a more accurate measurement of the satellite’s orbit, the researchers opted for GPS receivers designed by the Swiss company u-blox. \"These sensors caught our interest because they are small, cheap and their performance is well proven, said Anton Ivanov, SSC researcher in charge of the satellite’s entire technical design. The u-blox receivers are very common, particularly in mobile phones, but they have never been used in space. We want to prove that, by adapting its software, this low cost piece of hardware originally developed for terrestrial purposes can be used in space applications.\"\nIn addition, these sensors are compatible with other navigational systems like the Russian GLONASS or the European Galileo. Hence, researchers are envisaging using all of these GPS technologies, not only for the cubsats constellations but also in the context of the \"cleaner\" satellite project CleanSpace One. They could certainly provide the high precision necessary for carrying out the delicate maneuvers to approach and capture space debris.\nFinally, the CubETH will also have an antenna on its side to study the atmosphere’s composition and nature. The idea is yet again to verify the efficiency of less expensive components than those traditionally used in space. In such a way, the CubETH project remains faithful to the spirit behind SwissCube and cubsats in general: being a platform for testing and demonstrating the applicability of standard electronic components in space.\nAn educational role\nThe cubesats’ format was devised by the California and Stanford universities to allow scholars conduct their own spatial scientific experiments at a reduced cost. The most innovative and significant design elements of SwissCube have been kept, such as the use of cell phone batteries packaged in a waterproof and thermally controlled casing. Another preserved feature is the use of the innovative system of copper pads that provide a better attachment of the solar cells on the satellite’s walls.\nEven before its launch, the new satellite will have also played an important educational role. In addition to generating links and collaborations between the country’s two Federal Institutes of Technology, the different pieces of software on board the satellite will have been the object of study of undergraduate and doctoral students lucky enough to take advantage of a concrete project for learning about space technologies.\n*\n Other Project Partners\n:\n Academic: Hochschule Zentralschweiz (Luzern), Hochschule Rapperswil Tecknik\n Industrial: u- blox, RUAG, Saphyrion.", "summary": "CubETH is the name of a joint project between EPFL’s Swiss Space Center and ETHZ whose main objective is to build a satellite scheduled for launch in late 2015.

{"id": 415, "text": "Concrete has been around since the 19\nth\n century. Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

{"id": 417, "text": "Space technologies, and above all satellites, have enormous potential in many areas such as logistics, natural resource exploitation, safety and environmental protection. But these possibilities are poorly known and largely underutilized. To address this shortcoming, the European Space Agency (ESA) has launched a program called the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP). José Achache, former director of ESA’s Earth Observation programs and Group on Earth Observations (GEO) in Geneva, is now the IAP programs’ Swiss Ambassador. Based in EPFL’s Innovation Square, he also collaborates with EPFL’s Space Center.\n-\tWhat is your job?\nOur goal is to reach out to companies and communities in order to make them aware of the advantages of space technologies, to encourage them to invest in these applications, and in this way to boost the development of space technologies and expand the range of their usage. The IAP program provides funding to help develop these applications, and we provide assistance in setting them up, both technically and financially. I am responsible for representing the IAP program in Switzerland, and for promoting the applications of satellite data in three main sectors: telecommunications, Earth observation, and positioning.\n-\tAre these sectors particularly promising?\nDefinitely! A recent study on the potential of geo-spatial services estimated that they will generate $150-270 billion per year in coming years. And there are even more companies that don’t use space technologies even though they have every reason to do so. So there’s still a lot to be done.\n-\tDo you have examples of the kinds of companies or activities that could benefit?\nThere was an international maritime transport company that lost track of thousands of containers every year. Using a system that linked telecommunications and GPS, they were able to better monitor shipments and reduced their losses by a factor of a thousand. All companies that produce, buy and transport foods could benefit from space technologies to verify the origin of their imports, monitor production conditions and assess the efficiency of the negotiation and transportation chains. In the safety sector, I can give the example of an application developed with IAP support that used local and satellite radar to detect birds flying near airports. This service, particularly beneficial for those in charge of nighttime takeoffs, significantly increases safety and reduces the loss of material. Another example: satellite imaging systems that can reveal subsidence on the order of a millimeter are systematically used to monitor large infrastructures such as dams, bridges and mountain roadways.\n-\tAre any public sector groups interested in these technologies?\nYes, many political bodies are interested. Thanks to geolocation, it’s possible for countries that don’t have land survey data to better identify and manage their territory. For everything related to environmental protection and the development of renewable energy, satellites provide precise and valuable information on the state of crops, forests, soils and seas. The great thing about satellites is that they are global, they operate 24/7, and they’re designed to last for at least 40 years. They’re a great tool for statistics and for managing Earth-based activities and resources, and it’s in everyone’s best interests to share these data.

{"id": 418, "text": "The “classical” role for a gene is to produce proteins, which are essential for the functioning of cells. However, our genomes also encode genes that produce long non-coding RNAs, whose functions are more mysterious. Yet, since four or five years ago we know that thousands of these still poorly understood genes are present in the human and mouse genomes. How and in which organs are they activated? Is this biological “dark matter” much ado about nothing or is there something more interesting to it?\nA team led by Professor Henrik Kaessmann at UNIL’s Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) compiled an authentic catalog of long non-coding RNAs in eleven species. By adopting an evolutionary approach, they discovered that about 2500 long non-coding RNAs first appeared at least 90 million years ago in the common ancestor of most placental mammals. From a functional point of view, these “ancient” genes turned out to be particularly interesting.\nFirst author of the \nNature\n article, Anamaria Necsulea, scientist at the Laboratory of developmental genomics of EPFL, expanded the scope of the investigation on these long non-coding RNAs to six primate species (man, macaque, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan), and to mouse, opossum (a marsupial mammal), platypus (a monotreme mammal that lays eggs and nurses its young with milk), as well as to an \"external group\" composed by a bird (chicken) and an amphibian (frog). The common ancestor of all these species goes back over 350 million years.\nGenes maintained during evolution\nThe biologists used the CIG genomics platform and the Vital-IT computing center at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to identify long non-coding RNAs in several major organs of the 11 species under scrutiny. \"Thanks to bioinformatics, we discovered RNA sequences produced from genome locations where no genes had been previously mapped,\" she said. \"We then analyzed these genes to find out whether or not they encoded proteins. Thus, we could identify between 3000 and 15000 long non-coding RNA genes, depending on the species.\"\nIn the second phase of the research, a comparison among the different species allowed the scientists to pinpoint the emergence of these genes in the evolutionary history. While 11,000 long non-coding RNAs are shared by all primates, 2,500 go back to an ancestor common to man and mouse, about 90 million years ago. Only a hundred genes of this kind stem from an ancestor common to all eleven species considered, including birds and amphibians. \"One of our main findings is that the activity of these non-coding genes is controlled by the same transcription factors that regulate protein-coding gene activity. Even more strikingly, we found that the 2,500 oldest long noncoding RNA genes are regulated by factors that are important for embryonic development. This suggests that, among the 2500 long non-coding RNAs conserved during the evolution of placental mammals, a large percentage may function specifically in embryonic development.\"\nNew network of interactions\nThe third phase of the research allowed the scientists to highlight a network of interactions (specifically, co-expression interactions, that is: genes are activated in the same organs or cell types) involving both long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. For instance, they found that some non-coding genes are strongly associated to protein coding genes involved in brain function or in spermatogenesis, which suggests similar functions for these long non-coding RNA genes.\n In the case of the H19X gene - one of the most ancient long noncoding RNA genes identified in this study - its association to the placental mammals’ H19 gene (which was the first long non-coding RNA identified years ago) helped to uncover its functioning: \"The H19 prevents the placenta from excessively growing inside the mother's womb,\" said Anamaria Necsulea. \"We can assume that H19X also contributes to this function. We now plan to disable this gene in mice to test its functions in the placenta.\"\nAmong the subcategories of RNA producing genes, are these long RNA genes more useful than it originally seemed? By tracking them in 11 different species, this new study of unprecedented scale suggests that some of our genomes’ \"dark matter\" may play a role in the development and functioning of the most vital organs of our bodies. Future experimental studies will further clarify the role of these genes that have just revealed their first secrets to us.", "summary": "Biologists have studied the functionality of a poorly understood category of genes, which produce long non-coding RNA molecules rather than proteins.

{"id": 419, "text": "“I was really surprised, when doing this research, to find that 50% of spin-outs don’t necessarily establish themselves near the parent company,” observes EPFL professor Christopher Tucci. In an article appearing this summer in the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, he demonstrated that new companies often also choose to set up shop thousands of kilometers, or even continents, away from their parent companies. He looked at U.S.-based international companies specializing in hard disk technology, drawing upon a database of information on 400 U.S. counties. Tucci is familiar with these constant changes taking place in the business environment, because he has been studying them for many years. So why do these companies choose to either stay close to home or head for the horizon?\nWhy stay? \n In the early 2000s, the so-called “agglomeration theory” from evolutionary economics hypothesized that an entrepreneur always chooses to stay in proximity to the parent company, in order to tap into group advantages. This decision allows a new company working in the same sector to benefit from the stability and solidity of the parent company and from on-site provider and client networks. “Our study shows that companies who choose not to move away have more aggressive strategies, and to succeed, they need to maintain local relationships. We also found that those who decide to stay within a restricted perimeter are technologically much more advanced than other spin-outs, but financially quite similar,” Tucci adds.\nWhy move away?\n Companies who decide to leave aren’t banking on technological innovation, but instead are looking for new markets. “Thanks to this study, we now understand better how spin-outs position themselves in the market. In both cases, the companies from which they have spun out often become their principal clients.”\n Another theory, not confirmed by the study, is the “spillover” theory. It hypothesizes that stronger companies don’t want to establish spin-outs in industrial clusters because of “spillovers:” they fear that their ideas or technologies will spill over and be stolen by neighboring competitors. “But this effect can’t be clearly seen from the database we used in this research,” notes Tucci. \n He also observed that the spin-outs that stay typically generate new spin-outs themselves. Tucci points to the case of IBM: “Almost all the big hard disk companies came from IBM.” Its first spin-out was Seagate Technology, created in 1978 by Al Shugart and Finis Conner, a company that manufactured embedded hard disks in Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox. It set up R&D sites in Silicon Valley and then branched out to Northern Ireland and Singapore. Interestingly enough it has also, in turn, generated several spin-outs of its own.", "summary": "Research at EPFL’s Chair of Corporate Strategy and Innovation has shown that contrary to what was thought from previous studies, spin-outs don’t systematically set up shop near their parent companies.

{"id": 421, "text": "A second small Swiss satellite is going to be launched into space. After SwissCube in 2009, the Swiss Space Center (SSC) at EPFL is working on a new project. Baptized as CubETH, the youngest member of the Swiss cubsats family takes a lot from its predecessor: it measures ten cubic centimeters and weighs less than 1.5 kg. However, its scientific mission is more ambitious. This device is the result of a partnership with the Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich (ETHZ) as well as other collaborators. Its launching is scheduled for the end of 2015 at the earliest. The prototype is currently going through the “flat sat” stage: in order to test all its electronic components, they are electrically connected as they will be in the final structure while lying flat on a lab’s table.\n\"We aim at making CubETH a high performance orbitographic tool capable of calculating its position, altitude and orientation in space with high accuracy,\" said Markus Rothacher, director of the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab at ETH Zurich and main investigator for the scientific part of the project. The idea is to design a stable satellite in order to prevent it from spinning, as it happened to the SwissCube. \"But most importantly, added the specialist, we want to create conditions for future cubsats constellations so that, for example, we could carry out thorough observations of Earth at a given time. For that reason, it is essential to know the satellites’ exact orbits so as to coordinate their trajectories and scientific equipment.\"\nProven on Earth, unprecented in space\nTo achieve a more accurate measurement of the satellite’s orbit, the researchers opted for GPS receivers designed by the Swiss company u-blox. \"These sensors caught our interest because they are small, cheap and their performance is well proven, said Anton Ivanov, SSC researcher in charge of the satellite’s entire technical design. The u-blox receivers are very common, particularly in mobile phones, but they have never been used in space. We want to prove that, by adapting its software, this low cost piece of hardware originally developed for terrestrial purposes can be used in space applications.\"\nIn addition, these sensors are compatible with other navigational systems like the Russian GLONASS or the European Galileo. Hence, researchers are envisaging using all of these GPS technologies, not only for the cubsats constellations but also in the context of the \"cleaner\" satellite project CleanSpace One. They could certainly provide the high precision necessary for carrying out the delicate maneuvers to approach and capture space debris.\nFinally, the CubETH will also have an antenna on its side to study the atmosphere’s composition and nature. The idea is yet again to verify the efficiency of less expensive components than those traditionally used in space. In such a way, the CubETH project remains faithful to the spirit behind SwissCube and cubsats in general: being a platform for testing and demonstrating the applicability of standard electronic components in space.\nAn educational role\nThe cubesats’ format was devised by the California and Stanford universities to allow scholars conduct their own spatial scientific experiments at a reduced cost. The most innovative and significant design elements of SwissCube have been kept, such as the use of cell phone batteries packaged in a waterproof and thermally controlled casing. Another preserved feature is the use of the innovative system of copper pads that provide a better attachment of the solar cells on the satellite’s walls.\nEven before its launch, the new satellite will have also played an important educational role. In addition to generating links and collaborations between the country’s two Federal Institutes of Technology, the different pieces of software on board the satellite will have been the object of study of undergraduate and doctoral students lucky enough to take advantage of a concrete project for learning about space technologies.\n*\n Other Project Partners\n:\n Academic: Hochschule Zentralschweiz (Luzern), Hochschule Rapperswil Tecknik\n Industrial: u- blox, RUAG, Saphyrion.", "summary": "CubETH is the name of a joint project between EPFL’s Swiss Space Center and ETHZ whose main objective is to build a satellite scheduled for launch in late 2015.

{"id": 426, "text": "Preserving water is a real challenge in hot, dry parts of the world. “Farmers in these countries often cover water reservoirs with thousands of tiny plastic balls, a kind of tarp or a large umbrella to prevent the water from evaporating. But these systems can be expensive to set up and take down – and they can’t adapt to the water surface as evaporation causes it to change size and shape,” says Jamie Paik, the head of EPFL’s  (RRL) and a professor at the School of Engineering. Researchers from RRL, working in association with a scientist from Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Chile, have developed a water-preservation system tailored specifically to Chile’s winegrowing region as part of a project sponsored by EPFL’s .\nRobust, flexible and modular origami robots\nTheir system involves robots that look like little floating tiles. Powered by embedded solar panels, they can assemble themselves automatically on the water surface and move as it changes size and shape. “The idea isn’t necessarily to cover the entire water surface but to have the robots follow the sun and avoid shady spots. That means the robots would continuously cover places where the water evaporates – and it would minimize the number of robots needed,” says Paik. \nResearchers are also looking into other ideas, such as using floating robots not to cover the water surface but to unfold and fold up a tarp automatically based on the shape of the water surface. These robots would be much easier to move around than plastic balls or a mounted tarp and could automatically adapt to changes in water levels. What’s more, the solar energy generated by the researcher’s robots could be a boon to sunny regions. Two  scientists – Jianlin Huang and Frédéric Giraud – tested the robots’ power-generating capacity on Lake Geneva before heading to Chile; they found that in just half an hour, a robot could generate enough power to fully charge a smartphone.\nResponding to a pressing global need \n“We saw how urgently a system like ours was needed as soon as we arrived in Chile,” says Paik. The temperature and amount of sunlight in the country’s regions can vary drastically from one day to the next, resulting in substantial fluctuations in water-reservoir shapes and making existing methods ineffective. Many of Chile’s vineyards are run by cooperatives of small families that can’t afford to invest in complicated, costly systems. And its economy depends heavily on wine production in a country prone to crop-ravishing droughts. \nThe RRL team intends to further their research and finalize their technology. Farming cooperatives could eventually be interested in collectively purchasing the little robots.

{"id": 428, "text": "Spintronics is an emerging field of electronics, where instead of using the charge of electrons, devices work by manipulating electron spin. Already tested in hard drives, spintronics are poised to replace current information technology, providing increased data transfer speeds, processing power, memory density and storage capacity. Controlling electron spin can be achieved with topological insulators; a novel class of materials that behave as insulators on the inside, but are highly conductive on their surfaces. However, it has been unclear how exactly a normal material can become a topological insulator, and also how to implement them for real technological impact. Publishing in \nPhysical Review Letters\n, EPFL scientists offer solutions to both problems by studying the spin structure of few atoms-thick films of a common topological insulator.\n Future electronics will most likely utilize an intrinsic property of electrons called spin. This spin can take either of two possible states: “up” or “down”, which in a classical picture corresponds to a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the electron around its axis. The electron spin can also be viewed as an extremely small magnetic field surrounding the electron. The field of spintronics aims to exploit spin in order to develop a new era of technological applications. Information technology in particular stands to gain the most, as spintronics can offer considerably higher overall computing speeds and storage capacities at lower power consumption. \n Just like conventional electronics requires switching between high and low current states, spintronics require the control of electron spin states and switch between “up” and “down”. Recent interest has focused on topological insulators, which can conduct spin-polarised electrons on their surface while their inner bulk acts as an insulator. However, manufacturing and implementing topological insulators has been limited because of technical limitations and because the formation of their unusual properties has not been entirely clear.\n An international team of researchers led by Hugo Dil at EPFL has now shown how spin-polarised electrons evolves on the surface of atomically flat bismuth-selenide topological insulator films no more than 30 atoms thick. The researchers used a spectroscopic technique called SARPES, which allowed them to determine the different spin states of electrons travelling across the conducting surface of a topological insulator. They found that the ability of the topological insulator to control the electron spin depends on its interface to the substrate and, surprisingly, not on the film thickness. \n The team’s findings show that tuning the chemical make-up of a topological insulator can directly manipulate the spin of electrons flowing across its surface. The discovery not only contributes to the understanding of the function of topological insulators, but also provides a fundamental means of designing spintronics devices in the future. \nReference\nLandolt G, Schreyeck S, Eremeev SV, Slomski B, Muff S, Osterwalder J, Chulkov EV, Gould C, Karczewski G, Brunner K, Buhmann H, Molenkamp LW, and Dil JH. 2014.

The field of spintronics seeks to tap the quantum properties of “spin,” the term often used to describe one of the fundamental properties of elementary particles – in this case, electrons. This is among the most cutting-edge areas of research in electronics today.\nResearchers working in the Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES), which is run by Professor Andras Kis, were able to quantify these quantum properties for a category of two-dimensional semiconductors called transition metal dichalcogenides, or TMDCs. Their research projects, which were published recently in \nACS Nano\n and today in \nNature Communications\n, confirm that materials like graphene (C), molybdenite (MoS\n2\n) and tungsten diselenide (WSe\n2\n) offer, either alone or by combining some of their characteristics, new perspectives for the field of electronics – perspectives that could ultimately lead to smaller chips that generate less heat.\n“With the methods we’ve recently developed, we’ve shown that it is possible to access the spin in these TMDC materials, quantify it and use it to introduce new functionalities,” says Kis.\nThe device developed at the LANES is composed of monolayer MoS2 is the active channel, encapsulated between atomically flat h-BN layers and contacted to multilayer graphene.\nThis all takes place at an extremely small scale. In order to access these quantum properties, the researchers must work with high quality materials. “If we want to examine certain characteristics of electrons, including their energy, we need to be able to watch them move over relatively long distances without there being too much dispersion or disruption,” explains Kis.\nIn the form of waves\nThe researchers’ method allows them to obtain samples of sufficient quality both to observe how electrons move around in the form of waves and to quantify their energy.\nBut the LANES team was also able to access another quantum property. Spins of electrons and holes in this type of a 2D semiconductor can be in one of two states, which are conventionally described as being oriented upward – spin up – or downward – spin down. Their energy will be slightly different in each of these two states. That’s called spin splitting, and the EPFL researchers have measured it for the first time for electrons in TMDC materials.\nIn the second publication, the researchers wrote about how they used the spin splitting in a TMDC in order to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene without using a magnetic field.\nSpin splitting used in a TMDC to introduce polarized spin currents in graphene.\nThese discoveries are a step forward for the emerging field of spintronics and make it increasingly likely that a different property of charge carriers – i.e. spin, in addition to the electrical charge – will play a role in tomorrow’s electronic devices.\nThe work was performed in collaboration with Takashi Taniguchi and Kenji Watanabe from NIMS Japan (ACS Nano and Nature Comm. papers) and Barbaros Özyilmaz from National University of Singapore (ACS Nano paper).", "summary": "EPFL researchers have successfully measured some of the quantum properties of electrons in two-dimensional semiconductors.

{"id": 435, "text": "One day as you reach Geneva’s main train station to start your daily commute you notice a new sign showing some kind of underwater train. At first, you focus on the ripples marking the surface of the water. But as you approach and look more closely at the sign, you notice something strange about the rails – the train has no wheels. It seems to be suspended in mid-air.\nYou follow the arrow, which leads you to an elevator a few meters further on. The destination is indicated above the door: Lausanne. That’s where you’re going. So you get on the elevator, and it takes you deep below the ground. Your fellow passengers look as confused as you are. The elevator doors finally open and you step into a brand-new station already packed with commuters. You get on board. As the train pulls out of the station you realize that it’s not running on the rails but ‘levitating’ above them. You get to Lausanne in around ten minutes. You’re lost for words when it dawns on you that your journey has taken you under the waters of Lake Geneva. Another elevator is waiting for you as you get off the train. It takes you back up to the surface into the familiar bustle of Lausanne’s train station.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Swissmetro\nElia Notari has just obtained his Master’s in civil engineering from EPFL. He came up with this visionary train line for his Master’s project, which was supervised by Aurelio Muttoni, a full professor and director of EPFL’s Structural Concrete Laboratory (IBETON). Those with a sharp eye will no doubt notice some similarities with the Swissmetro project, an idea for a futuristic metro system developed at EPFL in the 1990s. Swissmetro was intended to link the main towns in Switzerland at a speed of 500 km/h. Notari’s Master’s project is in fact a variation of the Swissmetro design, which put the trains in underground tunnels rather than through Lake Geneva.\nBut is it really possible to build a metro through Lake Geneva? What some consider sacrilegious is a fascinating technical challenge for others – one that draws on multiple disciplines, covering everything from structural design and hydraulics to geotechnics and the environmental impact.\nA submerged bridge\nNotari focused on designing and calculating the dimensions of a double-track tunnel made out of reinforced concrete: an ‘underwater bridge’ – or to be more specific, a ‘floating underwater tunnel.’ Covering a distance of around 55 kilometers, the tracks would use magnetic levitation – or maglev – to get the train to travel at high speed. With this type of system, one set of magnets is placed on the tracks; a second set on the bottom of the train is repelled by the first, which pushes the train up off the track. In some cases, the repulsive force of the magnet is controlled by a current running along the track.\nFig.1: The double-track tunnel and its compartments containing ballast. © EPFL 2018 / E. Notari\nThis kind of system is not yet used in transportation, but several countries are now testing prototypes and plan to start building soon. In 2015, the Shinkansen Maglev prototype developed by Japanese company JR Central set the world record when it reached a speed of 603 km/h. For his work, Notari drew on policy guidelines developed in Germany, which are better suited to short distances, like that between Geneva and Lausanne.\nSeveral options to choose from\nThere are several options available to an engineer looking to build a train that can run under water. The tunnel can, for example, be set under the ground, as is the case with Eurostar, which was opened in 1994 across the Channel and connects London with several cities in mainland Europe.\nNorway is looking into another option to link its fjords with its cities – an underwater tunnel suspended at a series of floats that can be seen on the surface. Yet another solution involves putting metal rods in the ground to anchor down the tunnel. However, this will only work if the tunnel itself is buoyant enough.\nYet none of these options was quite right for Lake Geneva. This was mainly because its clear waters make it popular among sports enthusiasts and esthetes, which meant the student had to design a tunnel that was at least 20 meters deep and not visible from the surface.\n30 meters underwater\nNotari therefore went with a bridge located 30 meters below the surface and supported by piers made of reinforced concrete. This solution was the most rigid, which is a crucial factor for a high-speed train. It was also the most secure in the event of internal flooding. Other advantages also guided his choice. With this solution, the temperature would be constant throughout the entire structure, which would prevent any thermal deformation as a result of the changing seasons. Waves are also at their weakest at that kind of depth, and the bridge would not get in the way of any existing structures.\nWhat’s more, the hydrostatic pressure would be a bonus in terms of the solidity of the 199 modules making up the concrete tunnels. The engineer’s tunnel measures 14.5 meters in diameter and is designed to withstand earthquakes, internal and external explosions, flooding, tsunamis and landslides. The structure would include compartments containing ballast to make it possible to stabilize the tunnel at any time based on Archimedes’ principle. To adjust to the lake’s varying depth, the height of the pillars, which are 6 meters in diameter, would range from 7.5 to 45 meters. The bridge’s route would follow the lakeshore (see Fig.2. on the left). And the two ends of the line would be connected to the Geneva and Lausanne train stations via elevators.\nToo technically feasible to be utopian\nThe idea of an underwater bridge in Lake Geneva doesn’t seem so utopian to the freshly graduated engineer. “The concept of an underwater bridge has been around for a century,” says Notari. “Our know-how has advanced significantly thanks to projects like oil platforms and offshore wind farms. What’s missing is a pioneering investor who’s ready to put up the money to fund the construction of a prototype.”\nFor Aurelio Muttoni, high-speed transportation projects have great potential: “The solution that Elia studied is technically realistic. I myself came up with a similar solution in the 1990s when studying the feasibility of crossing Lake Lugano as part of the southern extension of the Gotthard high-speed train line.” Muttoni adds that he was inspired by Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s ultra-fast train, when suggesting the topic to his student. (See the .)\nBut given the complexity of the situation, the environmental challenges and the high costs of this kind of project, Muttoni is convinced that it will be many years before Lake Geneva gets an underwater tunnel.", "summary": "Summer series.

EPFL scientists have now found that a liver protein called “liver receptor homolog 1” (LRH-1) is responsible for the digestion of glutamine into smaller molecules, which are avidly consumed by liver cancer cells. Therefore, blocking LRH-1 causes cancer cells to starve and greatly reduces the development of liver cancer in mice, while preserving normal cells. The discovery is published in \nGenes & Development\n, and can introduce new drugs that target LRH-1 to effectively treat liver cancers.\nLRH-1 is a receptor in the cell nucleus, where it regulates the expression of various genes. In this study, scientists from different groups at EPFL led by , discovered that LRH-1 coordinates several key genes that are involved in the metabolism of glutamine – an amino acid to which liver cancer cells become addicted. The researchers found that LRH-1 drives the development of liver tumors by helping cancer cells to convert glutamine into molecules that are directly needed for proliferation.\nThis would also mean that disrupting the function of LRH-1 in the liver of mice would protect against the development of liver cancer. That is exactly what the scientists found when they studied mice that had been genetically modified to not express LRH-1 – so called “knockout” mice. After exposing them to chemical carcinogens, the livers of knockout mice showed dramatically less development of tumors. “Shutting down this pathway by inhibiting LRH-1 abrogates the utilization of glutamine as a fuel and brings the cancerous cells in tremendous metabolic distress,” says Pan Xu, the first author of the study.\nBased on the study, LRH-1 could be a new drug target to prevent the development of liver cancer. Because cancer cells, unlike normal cells, are very often addicted to glutamine, drugs that inhibit glutamine metabolism have been proposed as new highly efficient chemotherapy agents.\n“Inhibiting LRH-1 can thus be an effective way to starve only liver cancer cells, while leaving normal cells intact,” says Kristina Schoonjans. Her lab is now actively trying to identify new chemotherapeutic agents to treat liver cancer by developing specific compounds that inhibit LRH-1. The researchers also hope that these findings may extend to other types of cancer, since LRH-1 is also abundant in the pancreas and ovaries.\nThis work involved a collaboration of Kristina Schoonjans’ lab with EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering and Institute of the Physics of Biological Systems, and the University of Groningen. It was funded by EPFL, the Swiss Cancer League, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and the Novartis Consumer Health Foundation.\nReference\nXu P, Oosterveer MH, Stein S, Demagny H, Ryu D, Moullan N, Wang X, Can E, Zamboni N, Comment A, Auwerx J, Schoonjans K. \nLRH-1-dependent programming of mitochondrial glutamine processing drives liver cancer. \nGenes & Development \n13 June 2016.

{"id": 437, "text": "Around a dozen teams from six European countries are gearing up to compete in the sixth annual HydroContest, which will be held on Lake Neuchâtel in Yverdon-les-Bains this year from 1 to 8 September. This year’s contest is more specifically called HydroContest-X, because it is being organized jointly by three universities in French-speaking Switzerland: EPFL, the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture (HEIA-FR) and the Vaud School of Management and Engineering (HEIG-VD). The contest, which is supported every year by the Hydros Foundation, challenges students to design, build and race the most energy-efficient boats possible. The event is free of charge and open to the public.\nEach team designs and builds miniature, remote-controlled boats to compete in two contest categories. The two categories are complementary, like Laurel and Hardy – one for thin and light boats, where the aim is to sail fast and far; the other for bigger and heavier ones, which must haul 200 kg of cargo to simulate a freight vessel. Boats in both categories run on batteries provided by the organizer. The event aims to not only enhance students’ education, but also build awareness about the need for cleaner, more energy-efficient shipping vessels and spark ideas for technology in this area.\nAn asymmetric boat\nEPFL students have participated in the contest every year since it was launched. And this year’s team will show up in Yverdon-les-Bains with not two, but three boats. Two of them are from last year’s HydroContest. The first one, which competed in the Mass Transport category, is a hybrid between a catamaran and an airboat that sails on a thin cushion of air. It won the innovation prize last year but was eliminated during the quarterfinals. The second boat, which competed in the Private Boats category, is a twin-foil vessel designed in 2016. This boat proved to be fast but fairly unstable; it came in second place last year behind HEIA-FR.\nThe third boat – new this year – is designed after a prao, a traditional Indonesian sailboat. It has only one hull and one lateral float, making it asymmetric. “We designed it over the past year, it works, and we’ve tested it several times, yet it still needs to be tweaked,” says Sébastien Jaffaux, head of EPFL’s HydroContest team. “So at this point it’s too early to enter it in the race. But if we get the new foils in time, we’ll run demos on the lake.”\nBut the students have big plans for next year, when, as part of the Swiss Solar Boat project, they will use their prototypes as test platforms for the 2020 Monaco Solar & Energy Boat Challenge. The boats in that event – another international competition – will measure over six meters long and have a sailor on board.\nFollow HydroContest EPFL Team on Facebook:  and Twitter: @Hydro_EPFL_Team", "summary": "This year, three universities from French-speaking Switzerland – EPFL, HEIA-FR and HEIG-VD – will co-host the sixth annual HydroContest competition, challenging student teams to come up with fast, energy-efficient boat designs.", "claim": "This year, three universities from French-speaking Switzerland – EPFL, HEIA-FR and the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture – will co-host the sixth annual HydroContest competition, challenging student teams to come up with fast, energy-efficient boat designs.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [17, 23], "noise": false}
{"id": 438, "text": "Vincent Kaufmann, a sociologist who specializes in mobility studies, decided to expand his usual focus on urban areas to include Switzerland and the European Union (EU). Kaufmann, who is also the head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, teamed up with Spanish researcher Ander Audikana to write an essay on mobility and the free movement of people in the EU and in Switzerland. The authors’ starting point was the “Stop mass immigration\" initiative, which was approved by voters on 9 February 2014.\nTheir essay provides a Swiss perspective that people concerned about a borderless EU and its unintended consequences might do well to consider. Clive H. Church, researcher at the University of Kent,\nalso draws an interesting parallel between Switzerland and post-Brexit UK in the book’s preface. Vincent Kaufmann tells us why this essay is important.\nWhat gave rise to this essay?\nSwitzerland has been dealing with mobility-related issues for decades: the introduction of the Erasmus program, truck traffic crossing the Alps, limiting trucks to 40 tons, the AlpTransit initiative, the free movement of people, the modal shift from road to rail, and so on. All these issues have one thing in common: mobility. And yet, they are never analyzed together. On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people voted on two separate questions that, in reality, were both rooted in mobility. On that day, the people approved the “Stop mass immigration” initiative, which called for immigration quotas. They also gave the go-ahead for a fund to upgrade the country’s rail infrastructure. In a way, Swiss people paradoxically voted for “less mobility” and “more mobility” at the same time. Since then, there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric but very little sociological analysis of what really happened in that vote. Seeing this, Ander Audikana and I wanted to show how important it is to look at all these mobility issues together, in Switzerland but also in the EU, in order to get a better idea of what the consequences will be.\nWhat are your main conclusions?\nIn the first part of our essay, we look at the EU’s founding documents. It’s clear that the free movement of people – much more than economic interests – was at the core of the European project. These documents show that mobility was considered the only way of unifying the member states and erasing the differences in their political and welfare systems. The Erasmus program, for example, clearly states this goal in its founding texts. But there are two sides to mobility: movement and “moorings”. Moorings refer to the connections a person makes once they have moved to a new place: building meaningful social relationships, absorbing the culture, learning the language, making use of public spaces, coming to identify with the place and building an emotional bond with it etc. Unfortunately, EU policies largely overlook this, and instead demand that people move from place to place while failing to assess the consequences of widespread geographical mobility on regional development, the ability of diverse groups of people to live alongside each other, and wage dumping. These problems are left to the individual member countries, and we think this is a major shortcoming.\nHow does this shortcoming affect Switzerland?\nIn theory, an EU company could win a contract to plant trees in a small Swiss town, and no local landscaping companies would be able to compete on price. This is a good example of mobility without moorings: the cross-border deal is encouraged without first looking at whether this scenario is fair. While people consider these types of situations totally unfair, the EU has created a legal apparatus that is simply oblivious to this. It’s this type of mechanism that Europeans are now rallying against, as we see in the rise in populism. The mobility demanded by the EU creates as many problems as it solves.\nYou interviewed the leaders of the six main political parties in Switzerland about this issue. Yet they are cited anonymously in your essay. Why did you do this?\nWe wanted to get away from partisan politics and take an anthropological approach. Rereading these interviews, we saw that mobility-related questions did not fit neatly into the left-right paradigm. We see, for example, very liberal views on both sides: the idea that the world will be a better place the more people move around. At the same time, there’s a need for the state to be more assertive and get a better grip on the flow of money, people and goods. We think that where these two positions meet is where we can find compromises and solutions. In Switzerland, local identity is important and is currently seen as being under threat. The people want the government to do something about this.\nIs this what the EU could learn from the Swiss experience when it comes to rethinking mobility and the elimination of borders? \nSwitzerland is seeking a better balance between mobility and moorings. The fact that the EU is so dogmatic about being borderless is a problem for Switzerland, since this country doesn’t work that way. The Swiss don't subscribe to dogmas – they reach compromises through discussion and direct democracy. For EU countries, Switzerland is an interesting laboratory. Debates that do not happen elsewhere take place here. We feel that the way in which the Swiss achieve compromises on questions of mobility and the free movement of people could help the EU overcome some of the hurdles it faces. Our analysis shows, for example, that the EU should not have focused so much on a policy of \nmobility\n in its founding documents but rather on a policy of \naccessibility\n: access to services, to infrastructure and to other countries. The EU’s overriding goal should not be to make sure that people move from here to there at all costs. It should be to guarantee a certain level of fairness when people, goods, and services move across borders. Returning to the example of EU companies competing in Switzerland: in order to gain access to the Swiss market, these companies should apply Swiss prices.\nIn your essay, you foresee a return to medieval, walled-in cities in Europe. Is the situation that dire? \nThe current border situation will require a strong political response by the EU. Failing that, we believe there’s a good chance that walls, watchtowers and barbed wire could indeed pop up all over Europe, transforming the continent into a gated community.\nVincent Kaufmann, Ander Audikana, \nMobilité et Libre circulation en Europe: un regard suisse\n, Fondation Jean Monnet, Economica - Les Cahiers rouges, Paris, 2017.", "summary": "Vincent Kaufmann, an EPFL researcher, has co-authored an essay on Switzerland’s recent referendums on mobility and the free movement of people.

{"id": 439, "text": "In 2017, startups around the world raised some 4.6 billion dollars by issuing virtual tokens that can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies or services. And much of this activity is taking place in Switzerland, where ICOs brought in 850 million dollars last year according to figures published by IFZ (Institut für Finanzdienstleistungen). But so far, few manufacturers have gotten in on the act.\nLakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that develops customized, highly pure diamonds, is an exception. It is set to launch its own ICO, selling machine-hours in the form of virtual tokens. Over two million tokens – worth a total of 60 million francs – will be issued. The company plans to use this money to significantly ramp up its production capacity. Once the ICO has been completed, buyers will be able to sell their tokens or exchange them for diamonds, thereby creating the first-ever crowd-funded diamond “mine.”\nThe smaller the more expensive\n“With natural diamonds, prices go up as the stones get bigger. But with us it’s the opposite,” says Pascal Gallo, the startup’s founder and CEO. The diamonds produced by LakeDiamond are much purer than natural diamonds. The company’s manufacturing process, in which layers of carbon atoms – the sole ingredient of diamonds – are built up through vapor deposition, eliminates nearly all impurities. These industrial diamonds allow for much greater precision thanks to their hardness, thermal and electrical conductivity, and optical properties.\nThe carefully calibrated size of the diamonds – down to the micron – and the high tech processing they undergo are what set these diamonds apart. The method used to customize the diamonds was developed in conjunction with Niels Quack’s lab at EPFL. The carefully sized diamonds can be set in complex mechanical systems such as watch movements and used in high powered lasers, transistors and photonic platforms.\nThe vast majority of companies that have launched ICOs also use blockchain technology. Their main motivation is simplicity: the companies can deal directly with their investors, and this reduces paperwork and saves time. For LakeDiamond, there’s also the question of independence. “We tried traditional fundraising methods, but most potential investors were in the military sector,” says Gallo. “And we don’t want to take the company in that direction.”\nA smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain\nThe “user,” in the company’s parlance, buys a certain number of tokens secured by an Ethereum smart contract. Ethereum is one of several types of blockchain, which are used to record and share information without any external oversight. Blockchains are so safe because all transactions are verifiable and transparent. A white paper describes the project in detail and includes the transaction clauses and the code used to create the tokens (“ether”) that are issued against the cryptocurrency.\n“Our project is unique: we connect diamond growth reactors to the Ethereum blockchain, which lets token holders produce their own diamonds,” says Romain Braud, the company’s blockchain specialist. LakeDiamond’s tokens are referred to as Time-based Machine Tokens (TMT) because they represent hours of use of the reactors. They also give holders a preferential right to “mine” the diamonds ordered by the company’s industrial clients. This means that token holders can support a client project by trading in their tokens for that project – and ultimately benefiting from the value of the client’s order. Tokens can also be sold on secondary markets, just like traditional cryptocurrencies.\nThe first phase of LakeDiamond’s ICO is meant for professional investors (“token users”). The ICO will be opened to the public this fall once the company has obtained authorization from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).", "summary": "LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that produces and customizes ultra-pure diamonds for industrial use, is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) today.

{"id": 441, "text": "For humans, it comes perfectly naturally. But walking on two legs is actually a complicated task, requiring several muscles to perform delicate balancing acts. That’s why, in spite of years of major technological advancements in the field, humanoid robots are still far from being able to get around easily and reliably. Engineers at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory are testing new walking algoritms on a plateform called COMAN, short for COmpliant HuMANoid. This 95-cm-tall humanoid is designed specifically for studying walking – which is why it has no head.\nCOMAN was developed under the EU AMARSi project and is being used by several research teams. The EPFL team is looking specifically at the “brains” of the machine. “We developed algorithms that can improve the robot’s balance while it’s walking,” says Hamed Razavi, a researcher scientist at the Biorobotics Lab.\nIn harmony with symmetries\nOne of COMAN’s distinguishing features is its joints, which are integrated with elastic elements that give it greater flexibility when performing different tasks. The EPFL team came up with a novel control algorithm for the robot, based on the existing symmetries in the structure and dynamics of the robot’ as well as the mathematical equations representing the robot dynamics. “You could say we’re working in harmony with these symmetries rather than against them. As a result, we obtain a more natural and robust walking gait,” says Razavi.\nThe control algorithm uses sophisticated computer programs to carefully analyze the date received from the robot – including its position, velocity, joint angles, etc. – and sends appropriate commands to the motors, telling them what to do in order to maintain the robot's balance. “For example, if someone pushes COMAN, for example, our algorithms will calculate exactly where its foot should land in order to counteract the perturbation,” says Razavi.\nClimbing stairs and opening doors\nThe algorithms are geared towards three types of realworld applications. The first is carrying out rescue missions in disastrous scenarios. “In environments designed by humans - like a nuclear power plant where there are stairs to climb and doors to open – humanoid robots can get around more easily than robots with wheels,” says Razavi. The second is helping with tasks like carrying heavy boxes or moving objects (see box). And the third is creating exoskeletons for the disabled.\n“Making the robots more stable is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Razavi. The next step is refining the algorithms so that the humanoids have a wider range of movement and can overcome obstacles and walk on irregular or sloped surfaces.\nHumanoids helping humans\nAs part of this project, Jessica Lanini and Hamed Razavi studied how two people carrying an object together are able to walk, turn and speed up in a coordinated manner – without communicating with each other. Their findings, recently published in , indicate that the two people automatically synchronize their steps, like a quadruped. Now the researchers plan to apply their results to humanoid robots.\n“Whether for manufacturing or natural disasters, we need robots that can interact with humans and help us carry heavy objects,” says Lanini. “But such robots don’t exist. That’s because, in order to operate safely and effectively, the robots would need to be able to make decisions and respond to unexpected circumstances.”\nThe researchers decided to observe humans, who do things better and more naturally than robots. They analyzed the way humans move and found that some factors like speed, force and hand position play a pivotal role in understanding “commands” like speeding up or stopping. The next step is modeling these observations in order to program the robots. “What is exactly that makes us realize to slow down or turn? The applied force? A combination of force and speed? The boundary is not yet clear,” says Razavi. \nClara Marc", "summary": "Walking on two legs isn’t as easy as it seems. For robots and their designers, it is an even bigger challenge!

Martin Vetterli, President of Swiss National Science Foundation, will share his view with colleagues from other national research foundations.\nSwiss startups promote their novel solutions on April 1\nCommitted to the promotion of startups, The Brain Forum also hosts a pitch session for Swiss startups on April 1, allowing early-stage companies to showcase their innovations in front of a high-profile panel and The Brain Forum stakeholders.\nFrom eye-inspired cameras to brain-machine interfaces, an exhibition area is specifically designed to provide a platform to demonstrate progress in the translation of groundbreaking science into novel solutions for social challenges. One of them is the Reality Substitution prototype RealiSM.\nReality Substitution is on track to replace traditional virtual reality \nUntil recently, virtual reality’s widespread use, both commercially and in scientific research, has been hampered by the need to develop custom virtual worlds using labor-intensive 3D animation. Researchers and engineers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and the W Science Initiative are unveiling a Reality Substitution Machine prototype at The Brain Forum that could change all of that. The project, known as RealiSM, has developed an easy-to-use virtual world creator that captures real-world situations to be played back in head-mounted displays (HMD). The system will soon be employed in the lab to study memory and peri-personal space (the space defined by what is within one’s reach) and will have numerous clinical uses for treating phobias and PTSD therapy.\n“There is a positive feedback loop between virtual reality and cognitive neuroscience,” says EPFL researcher and project leader Bruno Herbelin. “On one hand, with a Virtual Reality setup we have an environment that can be completely controlled and endlessly repeated—which are ideal experimental conditions. On the other hand, insights from the cognitive sciences are leading to more immersive, extremely realistic experiences for increasingly effective clinical therapies, behavioral experiments and even better gameplay for entertainment.”\nThe RealiSM project aims to make this technology more accessible to the average clinician and could also bring the technology to developing countries. Other potential uses include immersive, real-time video recording to bring business calls to the next level or even help those working or serving their country abroad feel closer to home.\nReal-time demonstrations at The Brain Forum 2015\n An immersion booth, dedicated to the RealiSM project and designed especially for The Brain Forum, will house a real-time demonstration of the teleconferencing ability of the new reality substitution platform until April 1, 2015.\nProgram information: http://thebrainforum.org/program", "summary": "The Brain Forum 2015 in Lausanne opened today and is generating huge interest: more than 1000 people have registered.

They include the nomination of two new Deans at the vice-president level for academic affairs: the professors Hubert Girault for the Bachelor and Master programs, and Stephan Morgenthaler for international relations. These appointments, which are the result of the end of Dominique Bonvin’s tenure and the nomination of Martin Vetterli as Dean of the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, replacing Willy Zwaenepoel, took effect on March 1.\nOpening up to Asia\nFor Stephan Morgenthaler, it’s a return to international affairs. Before the year 2000, he was already academically responsible for this service. In the meantime, a reorganization of the management of the school had eliminated the position in its existing form, and it was Martin Vetterli, vice-president for institutional affairs, who had taken over responsibility.\n“The school has strengthened its position on the international stage, and its reputation continues to grow, especially in Asia. We are obliged to foster our relations with other universities, attract the best students, but also to ensure that our own students can easily go there to study”, explains Stephan Morgenthaler. “Other projects, such as the idea of offshore campuses, will also need to be taken forward during the next few years.” This Professor of Statistics will be supported in his tasks by Antoine Fromentin, administrator responsible for international relations.\nCourses and practical work integrated\nHubert Girault, Professeur in the Chemistry section, replaces Dominique Bonvin, at the end of an appointment lasting more than six years. During this period, the latter succeeded in aligning EPFL with the Bologna standards, in particular by establishing a strategy to enable access to Master programs. He was also behind the accreditation of related studies, and an evaluation system for the quality of the teaching. More recently, Dominique Bonvin sketched the initial outlines of a new method of teaching. “The students spend much too much time sitting and listening”, he states. “The old ex cathedra style, with lessons set apart from practical work, is no longer suited to our requirements.”\nAmong the new initiatives aimed at the EPFL students of tomorrow is also the idea of a “common thread” during the first year, with only a small part of the course devoted to a speciality. “It will be easier to change stream after the first year”, adds Dominique Bonvin. He has also initiated a discussion on the creation of new study programs – Bachelor and Master – of “generalist engineers”, having noticed that employers are often less interested in the specializations of graduates than the fact that they have acquired, during their studies, a valuable scientific approach to their work.\nContacts between the students and companies will moreover be reinforced: from the end of this year, a mandatory period of work experience – from two to six months – will be integrated into the program of future engineers. As well as helping the students to better apprehend the reality of the world of work, this will give owners of companies a glimpse of the skills taught at EPFL. “A lot of new things are going to happen in teaching, and this is both stimulating and gratifying”, sums up Hubert Girault, who accepted without hesitation the offer to take up the challenge of replacing Dominique Bonvin.", "summary": "“Young people and their world have changed, and we must adapt our methods of teaching accordingly.” This is the message from Philippe Gillet, Vice-President of EPFL for academic affairs, who has announced the nomination of two new Deans and several reorganizations.", "claim": "“Young people and their world have changed, and we must adapt our methods of teaching accordingly.” This is the message from Hubert Girault, Vice-President of EPFL for academic affairs, who has announced the nomination of two new Deans and several reorganizations.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [25, 26], "noise": false}

Today and tomorrow, as well as on Thursday and Friday next wek, the School will be opening its doors to the undergraduates of the future. These visits are becoming more popular every year: 2050 have registered for this year’s event, 400 more than in 2010, and 600 more than in 2009. “The growing reputation of EPFL certainly accounts for the high attendance”, comments Maya Fruehauf, who is responsible for promoting undergraduate courses. The large majority of the sixth formers come from French-speaking Switzerland (a special day is organized in January for those from the German-speaking area and Ticino), but over 450 are travelling from France. “Our visits to certain high schools and a stand at the “Salon de l’Etudiant” student fair in Paris, as well as word-of-mouth, have all worked well”, she points out. It’s also worth remembering that the degrees awarded by the School are accredited in France by the Commission des Titres d’Ingénieur (CTI), and that students selected by the ENS in Lyon, and who have passed its entrance test, may join various departments without examination. Other young people are coming from even further afield: in particular from the USA, Sweden, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Despite this surge of interest, the percentage of girls attending the open days remains stable at around 35%.\nFaced with this wave of interest, Thursday’s general information event has been reorganized for lack of a hall big enough, to be replaced by three sessions over the course of the day at the Rolex Learning Center conference hall. To get a general idea of the range of courses, the sixth-formers will take part in information sessions offered by the departments. The current students will also help by showing them around “their” campus. The second day will enable those with a greater level of interest – that is, over 75% of the participants – to soak up the atmosphere of a department, attend workshops and meet the specialists. Almost 200 people (including undergraduates and doctoral students, professors, and those working in industry) will be called upon to answer questions from the sixth-formers during the practical exercises, discussion sessions, mealtimes, etc. “The aim is to attract new students who have made an informed choice,” points out Maya Fruehauf, “and not to promise them a ‘perfect’ education.” The number of sixth-formers registered for each department reflects the proportion of students in the department. For example, architecture and life sciences have over 100 signed up, which is more than communication systems, electricity or materials. “We don’t know how many of those attending the open days will actually enrol at the start of the 2011 academic year,” emphasizes Maya Fruehauf, “but a survey conducted among new students indicated that around half of them rated these information events most highly in the list of factors that influenced their choice.”", "summary": "There will be quite a crowd on campus today!

{"id": 451, "text": "Looking for life on other planets is not straightforward. It usually relies on chemical detection, which might be limited or even completely irrelevant to alien biology. On the other hand, motion is a trait of all life, and can be used to identify microorganisms without any need of chemical foreknowledge. EPFL scientists have now developed an extremely sensitive yet simple motion detector that can be built easily by adapting already-existent technology. The system has proven accurate with detecting bacteria, yeast, and even cancer cells, and is considered for the rapid testing of drugs and even the detection of extraterrestrial life. The work is published in the \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)\n.\nGiovanni Dietler, Sandor Kasas and Giovanni Longo at EPFL have developed a motion detector that uses a nano-sized cantilever to detect motion. A cantilever is essentially a beam that is anchored only at one end, with the other end bearing a load. The cantilever design is often used with bridges and buildings, but here it is implemented on the micrometer scale, and about 500 bacteria can be deposited on it.\nThe idea comes from the technology behind an existing microscope, the atomic force microscope. This powerful microscope uses a cantilever to produce pictures of the very atoms on a surface. The cantilever scans the surface like the needle of a record player and its up-and-down movement is read by a laser to produce an image.\nThe motion sensor the Dietler and Kasas developed works the same way, but here the sample is attached on the cantilever itself. For example, a bacterium attaches to the cantilever. If the bacterium is alive, it will inevitably move in some way, e.g. move its flagellum or simply carry out normal biological functions. That motion also moves the much smaller and sensitive cantilever and it is captured by the readout laser as series of vibrations. The signal is taken as a sign of life.\nThe EPFL scientists successfully tested their novel system with isolated bacteria, yeast, mouse and human cells. They even tested soil from the fields around the EPFL campus and water from the nearby Sorge river. In each case, they were able to accurately detect and isolate vibration signatures from living cells. When they used drugs to kill anything alive, the motion signals stopped.\n\"The system has the benefit of being completely chemistry-free,\" says Dietler. \"That means that it can be used anywhere - in drug testing or even in the search for extraterrestrial life.\" The scientists envision a large array of cantilever sensors used in future space exploration probes like the Mars rover. As it relies on motion rather than chemistry, the cantilever sensor would be able to detect life forms in mediums that are native to other planets, such as the methane in the lakes of Titan.\nHowever, the more immediate applications of the cantilever system are in drug development. Used in a larger array, the cantilevers could be covered with bacteria or cancer cells and incubated with various drug compounds. If the drugs are effective against the attached cells, the motion signals would decrease or stop altogether as the cells die off. This approach would be considerably quicker than current high-throughput systems used in by pharmaceutical companies when looking for candidate antibiotics or anticancer drugs.\n\"This is really the next step,\" says Dietler. \"But we're still calling ESA and NASA to see if they're interested.\"\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Living Matter with the University of Lausanne and the Vlaams Institute for Biotechnology.\nReference\nKasas S, Simone Ruggeri FS, Benadiba C, Maillard C, Stupar P, Tournuc H, Dietler G, Longo G. \nDetecting nanoscale vibrations as signature of life.\nPNAS\n 29 December 2014. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1415348112", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed an extremely sensitive device that can detect life forms by sensing the slightest motion.

{"id": 452, "text": "In the cell, proteins often interact directly with DNA to regulate and influence the expression of genes. For this to happen, proteins need to travel into the cell’s nucleus where the DNA is tightly twisted and packed as chromatin, which forms the well-known chromosomes.\nWhen the protein reaches its target location, chromatin unwinds to reveal the section of DNA that the protein will interact with. This interaction is obviously of great interest to biologists as it lies at the heart of multiple important cell functions or even malfunctions that lead to disease.\nTo study protein-chromatin interactions, biologists use a technique called “chromatin immunoprecipitation” (ChIP). The basic idea behind ChIP is to use an antibody that targets the chromatin-binding protein, and then to “pull it down” or precipitate it with the captured section of DNA. The DNA that is bound by the protein is then identified via sequencing, which is why the technique is usually referred to as “ChIP-seq”.\nSince it was invented in 2007, ChIP-seq has become the most popular method for studying chromatin-associated proteins like histones and transcription factors. However, it requires a long sequence of manual steps that limit both its throughput and sensitivity.\nNow, scientists led by Bart Deplancke at EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering have developed a new approach to ChIP that promises to automate and lower its cost and complexity. The new method, dubbed “FloChIP” uses microfluidics, a bioengineering field that EPFL has helped developing and expanding.\nMicrofluidics essentially involves the precise manipulation of fluids through chips that contain multiple, carefully designed channels. Because it mimics the inner dynamics of a cell, this technique can and is already used in a number of bioengineering processes.\nFloChIP implements microfluidics to greatly streamline the ChIP workflow. In a paper published in PNAS, the EPFL scientists demonstrate that FloChIP is highly modular and can perform multiple ChIP-seq assays simultaneously and reproducibly in an automated way. In the paper, the researchers show this for both histone marks and transcription factors.\nA diagram showing how FloChIP works, included in the PNAS paper. \nCredit: R. Dainese (EPFL).\n“Thanks to its cost-effectiveness, throughput and general applicability, we believe that FloChIP will establish itself as a valid complement to the existing tools for the study of chromatin biology and protein-DNA interactions,” says Riccardo Dainese, the study’s first author.\n“With this new technology, true automation of a difficult assay such as ChIP is within reach,” adds Deplancke. “This will hopefully catalyze an increased use of chromatin-bound proteins as highly informative diagnostic indicators for a wide range of diseases including cancer.”\nOther contributors\nSwiss institute of Bioinformatics\nSystemsX.ch\nEPFL\nInnosuisse", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed FloChip, a new microfluidic take on the widely used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique.

{"id": 453, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process.

{"id": 454, "text": "“Ouay, ask the nurse what time she’s coming.” “Ouay, tell John to go run errands.” Or “Ouay, I don’t feel well, call the nurse.” The round smart speaker developed by the student team acts on the sound of a user’s voice. And it can connect users with people outside the home – caregivers, friends or family members can send text or voice messages to Ouay through a special app and Ouay reads the messages out loud. By providing a constant connection, the system allows elderly patients to remain independent while at the same time reassuring everyone involved that help is never far away. It has already been tested by several organizations that provide home-care services to the elderly.\nToday there is a host of new systems for helping the elderly or handicapped live on their own, as well as a growing number of specially equipped apartment buildings. These developments are often motivated by the dual goals of improving patients’ lives and keeping costs down. And recent technological advancements, such as in sensors and alert systems, are supporting this trend. But the two people behind the idea for Ouay – Sven Borden, a first-year Master’s student in microengineering at EPFL, and Loïc Rochat, a student in mechanical engineering – found that there was one key element missing, based on their personal experience with elderly people. “We needed a reliable device that patients can use to easily communicate with people outside the home. That would help them feel more independent,” says Borden. They fleshed out their idea at the Zurich hackathon, a weekend-long brainstorming marathon where would-be entrepreneurs come with a business idea and draft a business plan. Once the hackathon was over, the duo took their business plan and decided to run with it.\nA reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit at EPFL \nBorden and Rochat teamed up with other students from EPFL, HEC and HE-ARC, and then spoke with local caregivers and patients in order to pinpoint their needs. “I think Ouay is a good reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit we have here at EPFL,” says Borden. The students initially set up an association to build up their network and pool their funds. Since this initial investment, Ouay has expanded its reach considerably; the student team received an XGrant (financial support that EPFL provides to student startups) as well as a CHF 20,000 FIT Digital grant from Vaud’s Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). The proceeds were used to create the prototypes that are currently being tested by home-care providers.\nHelping people fall asleep with remote hypnosis \nFor elderly patients, even minor inconveniences – like not being able to find something in their apartment or a nurse showing up late – can cause a great deal of stress. And caring for elderly patients can also cause stress for friends and family. To help alleviate these factors, Ouay has a number of useful features including alerts for taking medication, reminders for doctor’s appointments and messages that can reassure someone feeling anxious. These features work through the mobile telephone network. Jean-Luc Tuma, who heads up the local home-care group Uniquecare santé et soins à domicile, sees the clear benefits of the device, which his staff tested: “It’s an excellent way to help patients live autonomously, independently and safely.” And his staff discovered new uses for Ouay as they tried it out in real-life situations. “The most remarkable thing we’ve done so far is having a hypnotherapist use the device to help a patient fall asleep through remote hypnosis,” says Tuma. He believes Ouay will eventually become a standard tool for caregivers.\nThe students officially launched their company and want to bring in more people. They plan to seek out “motivated students aiming to become professional developers, prototype builders or electronic device designers, and give them another opportunity to work on concrete problems,” says Rochat.", "summary": "Two students from EPFL have developed a smart speaker with voice-activation technology that connects patients directly to their loved ones as well as caregivers and emergency services.

{"id": 455, "text": "Will there be lots of gadgets under the family Christmas tree this year? By the back door, robotic vacuums are bringing cyberstuff into daily life; they’re among the first autonomous devices that can be easily used by ordinary households.\nThat’s all the impetus scientists needed to seize the opportunity and do a study. Understanding to what extent robots will influence daily life in the future is in fact one of the central issues being studied in the EPFL-based National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Robotics.\n In 2011, a team from EPFL’s Pedagogical Research and Support team (CRAFT) conducted a qualitative study on household robots. Nine compositionally diverse families (young, older, with and without children) were given a machine from one of the most common brands. “We interviewed the families before they got the robot, and then we followed them for six months, starting with their first contact with the device,” explains anthropologist and study co-author Valérie Bauwens.\nRapid and irrevocable decisions\n Seven criteria of varying importance – practical, but also emotional - were developed to judge the degree to which the families adopted the robots. Put to the test and further refined by this first field study, these criteria will be useful to engineers at EPFL and elsewhere who are thinking about the domestic robots of the future.\nIn the end only three of the nine families liked the automatic vacuum cleaners. “It was interesting to observe that the decision whether or not to abandon them was made really fast, after about only two weeks,” Bauwens says. “Our robots had very little time to prove themselves!”\nAmong the elements that the users didn’t like, the researchers listed the need to modify the setup of an apartment so that the robot could do its work correctly. In addition, they didn’t like having to change certain behaviors, such as leaving things on the floor, which compromised the machine’s performance. “We even had one user who was careful to put the coffee table up on the couch to make room for the robot to work,” says second author Julia Fink.\nKids are quickly bored\n The scientists also looked at the influence that these new “companions” might have on the family ecosystem. “Overall, we didn’t see many changes,” Bauwens says. “The mother is still generally in control of household organization, even with this tool.” Two of the study subjects, however, appropriated the device, giving it a name or talking to it. The children were at first very excited by the arrival of the new toy, but the older ones quickly lost interest. “It’s just a vacuum cleaner!” said one of them.\n The first robot to get a foothold in apartments is thus a kind of guinea pig. Its successors - such as “Ranger,” a robotic box under development at EPFL that encourages kids to put away their toys by amusing interactions such as speaking and moving its eyes - can benefit from the problems it encountered. As for the robotic vacuums, resellers will certainly have a good idea by mid-January, high season for returns, whether or not their statistics confirm the result of the qualitative study.\nSwiss TV TSR1 consumers' show A Bon Entendeur will talk about vacuum robots and this EPFL research in its January 10 edition.", "summary": "Are robots welcome in our homes?

{"id": 456, "text": "The idea to rid central Lausanne of cars came to two architecture students while they were deciding on their master’s project.\nThey realized that one building in particular – the Saint-François parking lot – was at the core of the problem. This building links the city center with the Flon neighborhood, meaning that it could play a strategic role in turning downtown Lausanne car-free. So they decided to expand and completely transform it. “Our building holds a restaurant, a co-op market with local products, and a hotel that offers medium-term accommodations such as for artists, conference-goers and businesspeople,” says Flavien Davin. “There would also be common spaces and a co-working area to promote interaction between these groups.”\nThe students also added a public staircase along the side of the building. “We felt that this ‘patchwork building’ deserved an important role, as it sits above one of Lausanne’s public transport hubs,” says Bernard Valette, co-author of the study. “Currently, people who use the parking lot do not have direct access to the various means of public transport beneath the building. Our aim was to better coordinate the building’s different purposes.”\nPedestrian zone and distribution depots\nTheir project also encompasses the Flon train station, which is the third largest in French-speaking Switzerland in terms of passenger numbers. “Our vision was to transform the downtown area, between the Flon neighborhood and Saint-François, into a huge pedestrian zone. That would require expanding the public transport system and totally redesigning the city’s logistics,” says Valette. The students’ project takes into account the future M3 metro line, which will strengthen the link between the north and south of the city, as well as the future tram line that will connect the western side of the city to its center. They would add yet another tramline, between Morges and Lutry, in order to relieve throughtraffic south of the city.\nMaintaining the flow of goods to stores and residents in a car-free city center would require some radical thinking. For this, the students designed three major ‘automated distribution depots’ in the city through which all goods headed for downtown stores and residents would pass. These strategic nodes would deliver the packages to automated distribution depots or directly to the intended recipients using electric shuttles. This approach will keep residents from having to travel outside the city to buy things that require a vehicle, e.g. furniture.\nAccording to the students, once the public transport system has been beefed up and distribution depots created, the downtown area could be rid of cars. “Eliminating cars would free up a surface area equal to eight times the size of the Flon neighborhood,” says Valette. “The former streets could be covered in trees, defying the idea that you need a car to get outdoors and enjoy nature.” Underscoring this notion, the students would remove the sidewalks running along the streets. In Saint-François, for example, public transport would run down the center of the wide avenue. The remaining space would be used for outside seating and greenery. Further down, some streets in Flon would become wooded. And according to the students’ timeline, downtown Lausanne could become fully pedestrian by 2035.\nChanges ahead \nIs all this realistic? It certainly seems to be, because a similar project is already in the works in Oslo for 2019. The city of Brussels is considering it too. Paris even closed the right bank of the Seine to cars this year, after closing the left bank in 2013. For Emmanuel Rey, the director of EPFL’s Laboratory of Architecture and Sustainable Technologies (LAST) and the academic director of the Master’s project, the students’ work is highly relevant: “You have to remember that cities were completely transformed by the rise of the automobile – symbolizing the triumph of modernity – in the second half of the 20th century. In Lausanne, for example, there were 66 km of tramlines in 1930. The city gave up on them completely in 1964, but they’re now making a comeback as one of the key links in the Lausanne-Morges conurbation project. As the built environment expands and the energy transition forges ahead, we have to expect important functional changes in all urban territories.”\nSolving two problems at once\nThe students note that the generational factor also comes into play. “For the under-30s, cars may no longer be a symbol of freedom,” says Davin. “Many of these people don’t have a license and just don’t see the need for one. In fact, the number of cars in the canton of Vaud has been stagnating for the past five years. Throughout this project, we realized how cars have created multiple problems in cities. By moving them away from the center, we can immediately solve two of those problems: we can improve both the quality of life for city dwellers as well as the prospects for urban densification. We wanted our project to be visionary, yet realistic. Even if the idea of a car-free city center still scares some people.”", "summary": "A master's project in architecture redesigns downtown Lausanne, setting out the key steps that could enable the city to free itself of cars by 2035.

{"id": 457, "text": "“Tutu” by Miles Davis and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple have already made their mark on music history. Now they have entered the annals of science, for eternity. Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA! I've been a part of this festival for decades and it truly is a magnificent representation of what happens when different cultures unite for the sake of music. Absolute magic. And I'm proud to know that the memory of this special place will never be lost.”", "summary": "Thanks to an innovative technology for encoding data in DNA strands, two items of world heritage – songs recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival and digitized by EPFL – have been safeguarded for eternity.

{"id": 458, "text": "Today’s consumers want a cleaner, greener society. There are a number of concepts out there addressing this goal, such as green economy, green growth, sustainable development, bioeconomy and circular economy. These terms have even been adopted by non-profit organizations, lobbies and international organizations for use in their names and initiatives. But that doesn’t necessarily mean we’re all clear on exactly what these concepts mean. At least that’s according to a recent study carried out at EPFL. The research, published this month in \nJournal of Cleaner Production\n, looked specifically at the concept of the green economy. Scientists compared 140 definitions found in journal articles (117) and white papers (23) published over the past ten years. 95 of these definitions were of “green economy” and 45 of “green growth,” a similar term that is often used as a synonym. \nThe concept of a green economy first appeared in the scientific literature in the 1990s but didn’t really gain traction until 2008 – in the wake of the global financial crisis – especially in political and academic circles. The United Nations (UN) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) were also major drivers of this trend. “The number of journal articles published on this topic every year went from zero in 2008 to 200 in 2018,” says Albert Merino-Saum, the study’s lead author and a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory for Human-Environment Relations in Urban Systems (HERUS). But the problem is that each article has its own definition of what the green economy is. While everyone seems to agree that a green economy is based on various social, economic and technological factors, the way each one is described and the importance given to each one can vary from one study to the next.\n“We were surprised to see that all these articles were being published without referring to a seminal study or benchmark paper giving a clear definition of ‘green economy.’ That’s highly unusual for scientific research, where people first try to establish a common conceptual basis. So in our study we aimed to clarify the term and thereby help policymakers evaluate different options in view of the consequences,” says Merino-Saum.\nThree conceptual families\n The first step was to establish a framework of around 40 conceptual elements for evaluating the 140 definitions. The scientists found that the definitions could be grouped into three main families. The first is what they call “econocentric,” or focused on economic factors like trade and finance to achieve environmental and social goals. “This family is closest to the idea of ‘green growth,’ except that discussions of green growth generally don’t account for the fact that natural resources are limited,” says Merino-Saum. The second family focuses more heavily on human well-being. Here the emphasis is on reducing inequality in the distribution of wealth and access to natural resources. The third family sees science and technology as a solution for environmental problems and a vector for sustainable economic growth. “Going forward, we’d like to see journal articles start by stating which ‘green economy’ conceptual family they are referring to,” says Merino-Saum. \nAn idea on its way out? \n But that assumes that the green economy concept is here to stay. Some people think it’s merely a fad that will soon go out of fashion. “Right now we’re seeing a lot of articles about the ‘circular economy.’ From 2008 to 2018, the number of these articles has swelled from zero per year to 800, with a sharp rise in 2015,” says Merino-Saum. This surge could be due in part to reports issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has become a thought leader on the topic, and to the EU’s Circular Economy Action Plan. Merino-Saum believes that the green economy concept will only last if researchers make a clear distinction between it and its cousin, sustainable development – such as the fact that the former is more practice-oriented. One sign that ‘green economy’ could be on the way out is its rejection by the UN, which, in its 2030 Agenda, talks about 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe irony isn’t lost on Merino-Saum that the terms coming in and out of fashion relate to sustainability. “Of course, some of the terms are only used for green washing,” he says bluntly, “but most of them are genuinely intended to spur a transition to a more sustainable society.” According to Merino-Saum, the keys are: using the right indicators to measure how effectively concepts are being implemented, and adapting implementation to the actual conditions in a given situation. For instance, priorities like access to water, water quality and access to healthcare can differ from one country – or region – to the next. Now that this study is finished, Merino-Saum and his team plan to dissect some other concepts. Next up? ‘Smart cities’ and ‘urban sustainability.’", "summary": "Concerns about climate change have given rise to a whole series of concepts that are widely used despite their lack of a concrete definition.

A team of researchers at the Defitech Foundation Chair in Brain-Machine Interface (CNBI), headed by José del R. Millán, has however been working on a revolutionary brain-machine approach in order to restore a sense of independence to the disabled. The idea is to remotely control a robot from home with one's thoughts. The research, involving numerous subjects located in different countries, produced excellent results in both human and technical terms. The conclusions are discussed in the June special edition of Proceedings of the IEEE, dedicated to brain-machine interfaces.\n19 people tested, 100% success rate\n Nine disabled people and ten healthy people in Italy, Germany and Switzerland took part in the task of piloting a robot with their thoughts. For several weeks, each of the subjects put on an electrode-studded hat capable of analysing their brain signals. They then instructed the robot to move, transmitting their instructions in real time via internet from their home country. By virtue of its video camera, screen and wheels, the robot, located in an EPFL laboratory, was able to film itself as it moved while displaying the face of the remote pilot via Skype. The person at the controls, as if moving in place of the robot, was able to interact with whoever the robot crossed paths with. “Each of the 9 subjects with disabilities managed to remotely control the robot with ease after less than 10 days of training,” said Professor Millán.\nShared control between human and machine\n The brain-machine interface developed by the researchers goes even further. The robot is able to avoid obstacles by itself, even when it is not told to. To avoid getting overly tired, the pilot can also take a break from giving indications. If it doesn’t receive more indications, the robot will continue on the indicated path until it receives the order to stop. In this way, control over the robot is shared between the human and the computer, allowing the pilot to rest while navigating.\nNo difference between healthy and disabled subjects\n In the end, the tests revealed no difference in piloting ability between healthy and disabled subjects. In the second part of the tests, the disabled people with residual mobility were asked to pilot the robot with the movements they were still capable of doing, for example by simply pressing the side of their head on buttons placed nearby. They piloted the robot just as if they were uniquely using their thoughts, further proof of the effectiveness of the system.\nMature technology available \n The positive results of this research bring to a close the European project called TOBI (Tools for Brain-Computer Interaction), which began in 2008.

{"id": 463, "text": "Targeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is a surgical procedure on patients with amputations that reroutes residual limb nerves towards intact muscles and skin in order to fit them with a limb prosthesis allowing unprecedented control. By its nature, TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input; however the detailed brain mechanisms have never been investigated before and the success of TMSR prostheses will depend on our ability to understand the ways the brain re-maps these pathways. Now, EPFL scientists have used ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI to show how TMSR affects upper-limb representations in the brains of patients with amputations, in particular in primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex and regions processing more complex brain functions. The findings are .\nTargeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is used to improve the control of upper limb prostheses. Residual nerves from the amputated limb are transferred to reinnervate and activate new muscle targets. This way, a patient fitted with a TMSR prosthetic “sends” motor commands to the re-innervated muscles, where his or her movement intentions are decoded and sent to the prosthetic limb. On the other hand, direct stimulation of the skin over the re-innervated muscles is sent back to the brain, inducing touch perception on the missing limb.\nBut how does the brain encode and integrate such artificial touch and movements of the prosthetic limb? How does this impact our ability to better integrate and control prosthetics? Achieving and fine-tuning such control depends on knowing how the patient’s brain re-maps various motor and somatosensory pathways in the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. \nThe , in collaboration with Andrea Serino at the University Hospital of Lausanne and teams of clinicians and researchers in Switzerland and abroad have successfully mapped out these changes in the cortices of three patients with upper-limb amputations who had undergone TMSR and were proficient users of prosthetic limbs developed by  and his group at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.\nThe scientists used ultra-high field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow across it. This gave them an unprecedented insight at great spatial resolution into the cortical organization of primary motor and somatosensory cortex of each patient.\nSurprisingly, the study showed that motor cortex maps of the amputated limb were similar in terms of extent, strength, and topography to individuals without limb amputation, but they were different from patients with amputations that did not receive TMSR, but were using standard prostheses. This shows the unique impact of the surgical TMSR procedure on the brain’s motor map.\nThe approach was even able to identify maps of missing (phantom) fingers in the somatosensory cortex of the TMSR patients that were activated through the reinnervated skin regions from the chest or residual limb.\nThe somatosensory maps showed that the brain had preserved its original topographical organization, although to a lesser degree than in healthy subjects. Moreover, when investigating the connections between upper-limb maps in both cortices, the researchers found normal connections in the TMSR patients, which were comparable with healthy controls. However, preservation of original mapping was again reduced in non-TMSR patients, showing that the TMSR procedure preserves strong functional connections between primary sensory and motor cortex.\nThe study also showed that TMSR is still in need of improvement: the connections between the primary sensory and motor cortex with the higher-level embodiment regions in fronto-parietal cortex were as weak in the TMSR patients as in the non-TMSR patients, and differed with respect to healthy subjects.\nThis suggests that, despite enabling good motor performance, TMSR-empowered artificial limbs still do not move and feel like a real limb and are still not encoded by the patient’s brain as a real limb. The scientists conclude that future TMSR prosthetics should implement systematic somatosensory feedback linked to the robotic hand movements, enabling patients to feel the sensory consequences of the movements of their artificial limb.\nThe findings provide the first detailed neuroimaging investigation in patients with bionic limbs based on the TMSR prosthesis, and show that ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI is an exceptional tool for studying the upper-limb maps of the motor and somatosensory cortex following amputation.\nIn addition, the findings suggest that TMSR may counteract poorly adapted plasticity in the cortex after losing a limb. According to the authors, this may provide new insights into the nature and the reversibility of cortical plasticity in patients with amputations and its link to phantom limb syndrome and pain.\nFinally, the study also shows that there is a need of further engineering advances such as the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prosthetics that can enable them to move and feel as real limbs.\nContributors\nUniversity Hospital Lausanne (CHUV)\nThe Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center (Bar-Ilan University)\nFoundation Campus Biotech Geneva\nEPFL Biomedical Imaging Research Center\nSpinoza Centre for Neuroimaging\nClinique Romande de Réadaptation – SUVA\nCentro Protesi INAIL\nRehabilitation Institute of Chicago\nUniversity Hospital Geneva (HUG)\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nBertarelli Foundation\nReference\nAndrea Serino, Michel Akselrod, Roy Salomon, Roberto Martuzzi, Maria Laura Blefari, Elisa Canzoneri, Giulio Rognini, Wietske van der Zwaag, Maria Iakova, François Luthi, Amedeo Amoresano, Todd Kuiken, Olaf Blanke. \nUpper limb cortical maps in amputees with targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation: a 7T fMRI study. \nBrain\n 27 October 2017.

{"id": 464, "text": "“The status quo on the software market needs to change, explains Viktor Kuncak, Associate Professor at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences' . All too often, developers adopt a software patch strategy for products that are already being sold on the market!” And yet there are tools out there that can improve the reliability of software before products reach consumers. Moreover, these tools are already widely used for hardware development. “Once a microchip has been manufactured, it’s too late to fix an error.” In fact, the later an error is detected, the more expensive it becomes to fix it.” Greater software reliability can also bring benefits to many different areas such as aviation or medical equipment, making them more reliable. \nViktor Kuncak and post-doctoral researcher Andrew Reynolds are currently working to develop automatic software verification tools. Just like a mathematical demonstration seeks to prove that an affirmation may be true for a given set of values, software verification is aimed at ensuring that a function will not cause a crash or produce an outlier for the full range of possible user entries or actions.\nIf there is one tool that mathematicians regularly use, it is mathematical induction. This method consists of proving that a theorem holds true for a given natural number (n) and that what is true for n is also true for the natural number that follows (n+1). Once this has been done, one must also prove the validity of the theorem for the smallest natural number: 0. This form of demonstration was previously not possible with an SMT solver (satisfiability modulo theories), which is an essential component of automatic software verification. The two researchers have now managed to overcome this obstacle, developing an approach that allows one to automatically use mathematical induction in a constraint resolution process. The code input language to be verified is Scala, “we chose it because of its similarity with mathematical formulations and reasoning,” explains Viktor Kuncak.\nApart from the computerization of mathematical induction, this approach is also remarkable because it breaks down tasks. “Whenever a verification cannot be executed directly, our tool breaks the problem down into sub-problems that it may be able to resolve. When there is a known path, this path will be used. Otherwise, other paths will be explored and a new breakdown may be performed, thereby allowing a large number of potential problem-solving pathways to be explored, explains Viktor Kuncak.\nAlthough the EPFL researchers are more specifically interested in potential applications to software verification, advances in the area of automated mathematical proofs can also benefit other fields. “The primary focus of SMT solvers has been for problems faced by industry (including software verification). Only more recently have SMT solvers been used for solving more difficult problems, which would include solving open mathematical problems. So far, this has been somewhat limited, but is starting to become more common,” states Andrew Reynolds. “One project along these lines is the TPTP library of problems pursued by the University of Miami. The use of SMT solvers such as the one I work on (CVC4) has led to solving several previously unsolved problems in this library.”\nThe approaches that the EPFL researchers are focused on are interesting both in terms of success rates and speed of execution. What are the limits of this tool? “It’s a bit like having a brilliant student,” explains Viktor Kuncak, “We cannot ascertain the theoretical limits but empirically, we have observed that the tool has more difficulty handling certain formulas than others,” The research conducted with Andrew Reynolds at the EPFL began in 2014. “We have obtained good results in only a few months, notes Viktor Kuncak. The EPFL has a certain lead in this field and we hope to consolidate this position.”", "summary": "It is possible to test computer programs using tools borrowed from mathematicians and their famous demonstrations.

{"id": 465, "text": "How did vertebrates walk 300 million years ago? Could they already stand upright on their legs? Did they move in a balanced, energy-efficient way? Scientists at EPFL’s  and the  at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin set out to answer these questions. Using the fossilized skeleton and footprints of \nOrobates pabsti \n– a vertebrate that, on the evolutionary tree, comes between amphibians on one hand and reptiles and mammals on the other – the scientists created computer simulations and a robot. Drawing on experimental studies of four living amphibian and reptile species, they used these tools to gauge how plausible different ways of walking were for the fossilized animal.\n“\nOrobates \nis an ideal candidate for understanding how land vertebrates evolved because it is in the lineage leading to modern amniotes. These animals formed in eggs laid on land and became largely independent of water,” says John Nyakatura, a professor at Humboldt-Universität. What’s more, \nOrobates \nis the oldest-known vertebrate for which scientists have been able to link a fossil with its fossilized footprints. “This combination is what enabled us to carry out our unique quantitative study, which paves the way to replicating the walk of other fossilized animals,” says Auke Ijspeert, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. The researchers’ findings appear in .\nA motion-based model and then a robotic one\nTo better understand how \nOrobates \nwalked and pinpoint just how advanced its locomotion was, the scientists at Humboldt-Universität developed a digital model of its skeleton based on the animal’s fossil and the biomechanics of modern animals with sprawling postures. They used this model to carry out the first kinematic computer simulation of \nOrobates’ \ngait as it walks on its digitalized footprints. This simulation focuses on movements (rather than forces) and identifies gaits where the animal’s bones do not collide or come out of their joints.\nIn parallel, two scientists at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory – post-doctoral researcher Kamilo Melo and PhD student Tomislav Horvat – used the fossilized animal anatomy to build a robot called OroBOT. Designed and scaled to match the shape and movements of the extinct animal, OroBOT was used to calculate the physics of how \nOrobates \nwalked. “We tested our hypotheses about the animal’s locomotion dynamics with our robotic model, which factors in the real-world physics of the animal’s gait,” says Melo.\nTesting hundreds of different gaits, based on contemporary animals\nThe interdisciplinary team of scientists tested hundreds of different gaits with their robot in order to determine which ones \nOrobates \ncould have used – and those that it clearly did not. The gaits they tested were based on biomechanical principles extracted from similar modern-day animals such as caimans, salamanders, iguanas and skinks, which they analyzed through X-ray videos and force measurements. “We studied the biomechanics of their movements and determined which mechanical principles they all followed,” says Nyakatura. The research team looked at three features in particular: how erect the animal stood on its legs; how its backbone bent; and how much its elbow or shoulder joints bent as it walked. These three features determine what the researchers call the animal’s “sprawling gait space.” They created  where fellow scientists – and the wider public – can explore the universe of movements that \nOrobates \ncould have used.\nWith these results, they came up with the most likely ways that \nOrobates \nmay have walked. They scored the gaits based on how much energy was required, how stable the movements were, how the leg forces compared with those of other sprawling animals, and how closely the movements aligned with the fossilized footprints. The gaits with good scores appear quite athletic and most closely resemble the movements of caimans. This suggests that \nOrobates \nprobably already held itself a little upright on its legs – unlike salamanders and skinks. Its locomotion was thus more advanced than had been previously thought. \nThe study concludes that advanced — more upright, balanced and mechanically power-saving —locomotion, as in \nOrobates\n, may have evolved before the common ancestor of reptiles and mammals lived. The novel approach developed for this study can be applied by other scientists in their work, and it could be modified to study other evolutionary transitions, such as the origins of flight or galloping gaits in mammals.\nContacts\nFor inquiries about robotics, in English or Spanish:\nKamilo Melo (robotics engineer, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)\nEmail: \nFor inquiries about robotics, in French:\nAuke J.

Mirko Kovac, from EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, is a young robotics engineer who has already made leaps forward in the field with his grasshopper-inspired jumping robot.\nHe and his collaborators have created an innovative perching mechanism where the robot flies head first into the object, a tree for example—without being destroyed— and attaches to almost any type of surface using sharp prongs. It then detaches on command. The goal is to create robots that can travel in swarms over rough terrain to come to the aide of catastrophe victims.\n “We are not blindly imitating nature, but using the same principles to possibly improve on it,” explains Kovac, who recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL. “Simple behavioral laws such as jumping, flying and perching lead to complex control over movement without the need for high computational power.”\n Jumping, gliding and perching allow for mobility over rocky territory or destroyed urban areas. This new form of AI takes its inspiration from the insect world, but is more as an abstract reflection on their instincts and design principles than merely imitating their morphology. This simplicity allows for greater mobility since the robots are not bogged down with heavy batteries. Kovac imagines swarms of his robots equipped with different sensors and small cameras that could be deployed over devastated areas to transmit essential information back to rescue command centers.\n The labs most recent innovation, perching a robot, saves valuable energy by allowing the robot to rest like insects or birds do. Many previous perching mechanisms include a complicated swooping maneuver to decrease momentum and land on legs, often without the ability of detaching. The mechanism developed by Dr Kovac and Jürg Markus Germann, recently published in the Journal of Micro-Nano Mechatronics, avoids this problem by using two spring-loaded arms fitted with pins that dig into the surface, whether it is wood or concrete. The snapping of the arms creates a forward momentum, allowing for a soft deceleration of the glider and avoiding mechanical damage. A remotely controlled mini-motor then detracts the pins and allows the robot to continue on its way.\n “I am fascinated by the creative process,” says Kovac, “and how it is possible to use the sophistication found in nature to create something completely new.” The perching mechanism can be easily adapted to other robots. His previous robot, a quarter-gram jumping robot that can achieve heights of up to four and a half feet, could now be fitted with the new perching mechanism as well as wings, thus creating a hybrid creature that gets around much like a flying grasshopper.\n Having recently finished his doctoral studies as EPFL, Mirko Kovac is spending this summer in the United States as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.", "summary": "A swarm of flying robots soars into a blazing forest fire.

We caught up with him for a short interview. \nIn a globalized market where competition is extremely fierce, is Swiss manufacturing still profitable in the area of microengineering?\n When it comes to mass-producing basic parts, such as engine parts for example, we can't compete with countries like China and India due to our higher labor costs. However, we do have an advantage when in comes to high-value-added products, or in other words sophisticated and innovative products.

Is there a crisis in Swiss manufacturing?\n No, this is not the case for high-value-added products. Some Swiss companies have moved production offshore to Asia or Eastern Europe only to change their minds and come back to Switzerland due to problems of quality. Having to regularly send engineers abroad to resolve such problems is just too expensive in the end. It's also easier if the production site and the R&D site are not too far apart.\nBut some multinationals are quick to relocate...\n Multinationals are different because the decision-makers are not necessarily in Switzerland anyway.

To answer this question, scientists have longed for a way to observe the spinal cord’s function in vivo. Until recently, they needed to resort to animal studies, but the advent of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is now providing a new window into the richness of spinal cord signals, directly in humans.\n© 2020 EPFL / Highlighting the spinal cord's functional architecture reveals an active spinal cord even for subjects at rest.\nNow, scientists at EPFL have combined tailored protocols for spinal cord fMRI with advanced analysis techniques, in order to disentangle these signals and clearly view the spinal cord in action. Tested on 19 healthy subjects, the scientists obtained unprecedented views of the spinal cord’s functional architecture and showed for the first time just how dynamic the spinal cord is, even for subjects at rest. The results are published in today’s issue of Neuron.\n“One of the main challenges about observing spinal cord function is getting rid of noise from the rest of the subject’s body, like breathing, the heartbeat, or simply seeing beyond the surrounding vertebral bones,” explains Nawal Kinany, first author of the study. “We managed to decompose spontaneous spinal activity into meaningful networks, with a level of neuroanatomical detail that had never been reached before.”\nThe study was done at Campus Biotech in collaboration with Silvestro Micera who is the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Translational Neuroengineering at EPFL and Professor of Bioelectronics at Scuola Sant’Anna in Pisa, Italy, as well as with Dimitri Van De Ville who leads EPFL’s Medical Imaging Processing Lab and is also affiliated with the Department of Radiology and Medical Informatics of the Geneva University.\n© 2020 EPFL / Dimitri Van De Ville (left) and Nawal Kinany (right) with a healthy subject, at Campus Biotech.\nFrom the perspective of the subject, one simply has to lie down in an fMRI scanner and remain immobile throughout the scan, typically around 10 minutes. The images resulting from the scan are then analyzed to provide a 4-dimensional view – through space and time – to view the dynamics of spinal circuits within the anatomy of the subject.\n“These results are clear evidence that spinal resting-state activity is richly organized and thus must bear physiological relevance beyond what was assumed so far,” explains Van De Ville. \nGiven its central position at the interface between the brain and the rest of body, the spinal cord is a key player in all human behaviour. The scientists targeted the cervical level because of its involvement in controlling arm and hand muscles. Their approach could help understand how spinal circuits are orchestrated to support the wide range of movements we perform in our everyday life.\n“Only a deeper understanding of human motor control can allow for the development of more effective neurorehabilitation approaches. Our new method provides a very important tool in this direction,” furthers Micera.\nTested for now on healthy subjects, the scientists believe that these new protocols will one day be a valuable tool for evaluating the status of dysfunctional or injured spinal cord circuitry, which could promote the development of targeted therapies that rebalance spinal activity or optimally harness the spared connections.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a non-invasive technique for unraveling the complex dynamics generated by spinal cord circuits to unprecedented detail, a first in functional magnetic resonance imaging that may one day help diagnose spinal cord dysfunction or injury.", "claim": "Nawal Kinany scientists have developed a non-invasive technique for unraveling the complex dynamics generated by spinal cord circuits to unprecedented detail, a first in functional magnetic resonance imaging that may one day help diagnose spinal cord dysfunction or injury.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 1], "noise": false}
{"id": 469, "text": "When used in very large quantities in drinking water, chlorine presents significant risks to public health. As well as neutralizing the pathogens found in water, chlorine reacts with the natural organic matter and produces a variety of disinfection by-products (DBPs).\nThe discovery of a potential link between DBPs and an increased rate of miscarriages and bladder cancers has led to the implementation of stricter regulations, as well as changes in the design of water-treatment systems during the last decade.\nThese concerns, added to the risks involved in the storage of chlorine in gaseous form, have recently persuaded many sewage or water-treatment stations to partially stop using chlorine for the disinfection of water. Many systems are now using chloramine instead.\nHowever, as described by Urs von Gunten (School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering at EPFL and EAWAG) and David L. Sedlak (University of California) , a series of recent studies suggests that this change from chlorine to chloramine has led to unexpected consequences that present risks to public health and the environment.

In Switzerland, the taste of chlorine causes suspicion and complaints from the public. “In the U.S. it’s the opposite,” he explains. “If drinking water doesn’t taste of chlorine, people are concerned!”\nThis specialist of drinking-water treatment notes a rather diversified situation in Europe: “The application of standards differs from one country to another. In Switzerland, Germany and Austria the use of chlorine as a disinfectant for water is avoided as far as possible. In Spain, however, it is used a lot, and France is somewhere in between.\nConsidering the risks that the use of chlorine presents to public health, Urs von Gunten offers this conclusion: “The solution can be found in a rigorous regulation that protects drinking water resources, that guarantee clean disinfection, and that maintain distribution systems - these measures would avoid using large quantities of chlorine as a disinfectant and avoid the unpleasant odors, tastes, and health risks that accompany it.”", "summary": "Disinfection using chlorine has played an important role in the supply of drinking water, but its use also involves some risk.

The firms that make these items produce large amounts of CO\n2\n emissions and have a huge impact on the environment. At the COP21 climate conference in Paris, world leaders highlighted the prominent role that manufacturers could play in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nMaziar Kermani, a researcher at EPFL’s  group, which is headed by Professor François Maréchal, has come up with a pioneering mathematical model that could cut the amount of water and energy used in industrial processes. He has developed a way to recycle lost heat and energy and to employ biorefinery technologies – combining turbines and organic fluids – to boost power production.\nKermani applied his model to a Canadian paper mill. He found that, in theory, it could cut the amount of water the firm used from 820 kg to 230-300 kg per second (a drop of around 60%). It could also allow the mill to produce more than six times as much electricity (from 3 MW to around 20 MW). His findings have been published in \nEnergies\n.\nContinuous recycling of water and heat\nKermani tested out his theory on kraft pulping – by far the most popular paper-making method in the industry.\nWood chips are wetted, cooked (in digesters), washed, dried and bleached to make pulp. All of this produces vast amounts of steam which, in addition to being used in the process itself, generates more than enough electricity to power the plant. The surplus energy can then be sold.\nAccording to Kermani, however, the current system is far from optimal. “Huge amounts of water and energy go to waste because the stages of the process aren’t connected,” he explains. “For instance, the mill uses cold water to wash and cool the pulp. But that water, which contains valuable heat, is then discarded. Likewise, high-pressure steam is produced by burning black liquor at extremely high temperatures – around 1,200°C. The steam powers turbines to generate electricity and provides a heat source for other processes, but it’s too energy intensive to produce.”\nOrganic fluids\n In his paper, Kermani outlines several ways in which the heated water could be reused. He also recommends introducing organic Rankine cycles, which rely on a special property of organic fluids: the fact that they turn into high-pressure steam at relatively low temperatures (250°C). “Using organic fluids would allow the mill to produce the steam it needs using recovered hot water at low-to-medium temperatures,” he explains.\nThe Canadian firm has expressed interest in Kermani’s model. “As compared to strictly mathematical and limited methods, the proposed approach provides insightful information for the preliminary design of industrial heat exchanger networks involved in pulp and paper,” says Canadian industrial process expert Marzouk Benali, who is tasked with optimizing that company’s processes. “Its flexibility offers opportunities to assess the direct impacts of integrating emerging biorefinery technologies within existing large facilities.”\nKermani’s model has potential applications in other sectors and industries as well.\nCollaborations:\nThis research was conducted as part of a collaboration between EPFL and CanmetENERGY, a Natural Resources Canada research center.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher has developed a mathematical model for optimizing heat transfer in factories and dramatically reducing water and energy consumption.

But these systems can be expensive to set up and take down – and they can’t adapt to the water surface as evaporation causes it to change size and shape,” says Jamie Paik, the head of EPFL’s  (RRL) and a professor at the School of Engineering. Researchers from RRL, working in association with a scientist from Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Chile, have developed a water-preservation system tailored specifically to Chile’s winegrowing region as part of a project sponsored by EPFL’s .\nRobust, flexible and modular origami robots\nTheir system involves robots that look like little floating tiles. Powered by embedded solar panels, they can assemble themselves automatically on the water surface and move as it changes size and shape. “The idea isn’t necessarily to cover the entire water surface but to have the robots follow the sun and avoid shady spots. That means the robots would continuously cover places where the water evaporates – and it would minimize the number of robots needed,” says Paik. \nResearchers are also looking into other ideas, such as using floating robots not to cover the water surface but to unfold and fold up a tarp automatically based on the shape of the water surface. These robots would be much easier to move around than plastic balls or a mounted tarp and could automatically adapt to changes in water levels. What’s more, the solar energy generated by the researcher’s robots could be a boon to sunny regions.

The temperature and amount of sunlight in the country’s regions can vary drastically from one day to the next, resulting in substantial fluctuations in water-reservoir shapes and making existing methods ineffective. Many of Chile’s vineyards are run by cooperatives of small families that can’t afford to invest in complicated, costly systems. And its economy depends heavily on wine production in a country prone to crop-ravishing droughts. \nThe RRL team intends to further their research and finalize their technology.

Commissioned by the Federal Roads Office, this research involves testing the stress resistance of pre-cast concrete beams. These tests are performed on the campus in a large hall. The objective is to develop a model of calculation that will be used in the future checking of freeway bridges.\nThe enormous project to construct the freeway network in Switzerland took place between 1960 and 1980, and deployed a number of bridges made of pre-cast concrete. The checking of these structures according to current Swiss standards can sometimes cause problems, as theycontain very little shear reinforcement.\nWhat is the impact in relation to the resistance of the bridge if the load is increased; for example, to accommodate an emergency lane? Or if there is rusting in the structure? At what juncture should the bridge be reinforced?\nTo address these critical safety issues, le doctoral student Michael Rupf and his team are checking concrete beams in the laboratory. These bridge components are deformed by loads applied by precisely defined levels of kilonewtons. Each level corresponds to a given stress resistance. The beam is deformed up to breaking point, and every five seconds a computer measures the strength, movement and tilt of the beam.\nA measurement matrix is applied to the beam. At each level, the matrix is measured to the nearest thousandth of a millimeter and the cracks are re-drawn. The data are then sent to a computer. The analysis of the measurements enables an understanding of the behavior of the specimen beam. The model developed using the experience gained will be validated by the trial data. The goal is thus to obtain and refine a robust predictive tool.\nThe Federal Roads Office has a significant interest in this project, because this calculation tool will allow the validation of the decision whether or not to begin large-scale and costly repair work.

{"id": 474, "text": "How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.\nHuman comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”\nCoccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”\nCoccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average. The researcher’s first step was to assess the campus’ energy balance; she looked at individual buildings and the effect that buildings have on each other. Summers will be hotter and hotter, and this will be felt more in built spaces than in wooded ones. Existing buildings will have to be renovated, and new buildings will require design changes. Particular attention will have to be paid to the exterior of buildings: “Vegetation moderates microclimates and blocks solar and infrared radiation, evapotranspiration reduces the air temperature, and plants provide shade,” says Coccolo. “These factors completely change our perceived thermal comfort.”\nTurning climate challenges into design opportunities\nTo offset the expected rise in summer temperatures, the study shows that, in addition to proper insulation, buildings and their immediate surroundings will need to provide more shade through protective features according to the level of solar radiation, the direction the building faces and the season. For Coccolo, this goes beyond simply multiplying the number of plants and trees; the focus should be on what truly enhances comfort. This may include such things as foliage density and plant height. Replacing asphalt with grass, for example, can radically change our thermal perception.\nThe Urban Systems group at the LESO-PB believes that, in the future, architects and urban planners will need to work together in designing the space between buildings, which is just as important as the space inside them (leso.epfl.ch/urbansimulation).\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press Service EPFL\n +4179 502 81 06\nSilvia Coccolo\n Postdoctoral Researcher\n +41 21 693 4543\nJean-Louis Scartezzini \nDirector of the Laboratory of Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory\n +41 21 693 55 49", "summary": "In the year 2100, temperatures at EPFL are expected to be similar to those currently experienced in Perugia, in central Italy.

{"id": 475, "text": "In our information society, the synthesis, distribution, and processing of radio and microwave signals are ubiquitous in wireless networks, telecommunications, and radars. The current tendency is to use carriers in higher frequency bands, especially with looming bandwidth bottlenecks due to demands for e.g. 5G and the “Internet of Things”. “Microwave photonics”, a combination of microwave engineering and optoelectronics, might offer a solution.\nA key building block of microwave photonics is optical frequency combs, which provide hundreds of equidistant and mutually coherent laser lines. They are ultrashort optical pulses emitted with a stable repetition rate that corresponds precisely to the frequency spacing of comb lines. The photodetection of the pulses produces a microwave carrier.\nIn recent years there has been significant progress on chip-scale frequency combs generated from nonlinear microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers. These frequency combs rely on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons, which are ultrashort coherent light pulses circulating inside optical microresonators. Because of this, these frequency combs are commonly called “soliton microcombs”.\nGenerating soliton microcombs needs nonlinear microresonators, and these can be directly built on-chip using CMOS nanofabrication technology. The co-integration with electronic circuitry and integrated lasers paves the path to comb miniaturization, allowing a host of applications in metrology, spectroscopy and communications.\nPublishing in \nNature Photonics\n, an EPFL research team led by Tobias J. Kippenberg has now demonstrated integrated soliton microcombs with repetition rates as low as 10 GHz. This was achieved by significantly lowering the optical losses of integrated photonic waveguides based on silicon nitride, a material already used in CMOS micro-electronic circuits, and which has also been used in the last decade to build photonic integrated circuits that guide laser light on-chip.\nThe scientists were able to manufacture silicon nitride waveguides with the lowest loss in any photonic integrated circuit. Using this technology, the generated coherent soliton pulses have repetition rates in both the microwave K- (~20 GHz, used in 5G) and X-band (~10 GHz, used in radars).\nThe resulting microwave signals feature phase noise properties on par with or even lower than commercial electronic microwave synthesizers. The demonstration of integrated soliton microcombs at microwave repetition rates bridges the fields of integrated photonics, nonlinear optics and microwave photonics.\nThe EPFL team achieved a level of optical losses low enough to allow light to propagate nearly 1 meter in a waveguide that is only 1 micrometer in diameter –100 times smaller than that a human hair. This loss level is still more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value in optical fibers, but represents the lowest loss in any tightly confining waveguide for integrated nonlinear photonics to date.\nSuch low loss is the result of a new manufacturing process developed by EPFL scientists – the “silicon nitride photonic Damascene process”. “This process, when carried out using deep-ultraviolet stepper lithography, gives truly spectacular performance in terms of low loss, which is not attainable using conventional nanofabrication techniques,” says Junqiu Liu, the paper’s first author who also lead the fabrication of silicon nitride nanophotonic chips at EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi). “These microcombs, and their microwave signals, could be critical elements for building fully integrated low-noise microwave oscillators for future architectures of radars and information networks.”\nThe EPFL team is already working with collaborators in US to develop hybrid-integrated soliton microcomb modules that combine chip-scale semiconductor lasers. These highly compact microcombs can impact many applications, e.g. transceivers in datacenters, LiDAR, compact optical atomic clocks, optical coherence tomography, microwave photonics, and spectroscopy.", "summary": "Using integrated photonic chips fabricated at EPFL, scientists have demonstrated laser-based microwave generators.

{"id": 476, "text": "Most rod-shaped bacteria divide by splitting into two around the middle after their DNA has replicated safely and segregated to opposite ends of the cell. This seemingly simple process actually demands tight and precise coordination, which is achieved through two biological systems: nucleoid occlusion, which protects the cell’s genetic material from dividing until it replicates and segregates, and the “minicell” system, which localizes the site of division around the middle of the cell, where a dividing wall will form to split it in two. But some pathogenic bacteria, e.g. \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n, don’t use these mechanisms. EPFL scientists have now combined optical and atomic force microscopy to track division in such bacteria for the first time, and have discovered that they use instead an undulating “wave-pattern” along their length to mark future sites of division. The findings are .\nThe work was carried out jointly by the labs of  and  at EPFL. The scientists wanted to understand how bacteria that do not have the genes for nucleoid occlusion and the minicell system “decide” where and when to divide. This is important, as many pathogenic bacteria fall into this category, and knowing how they divide can open up new ways to fight them.\nThe researchers focused on \nMycobacterium smegmatis\n, a non-pathogenic relative of \nM. tuberculosis\n. Neither of these bacteria uses the two “conventional” biological systems for coordinating division, meaning that a non-conventional approach was needed for studying them. \nThe researchers combined two types of microscopy to track the life cycle of the bacteria. The first technique was optical microscopy, which uses fluorescent labels for “seeing” various biological structures and biomolecules. The second technique was atomic force microscopy, which provides extremely high-resolution images of structures on the cell surface by “feeling” the surface with a tiny mechanical probe, much like a blind person can form a three-dimensional mental image of an object by passing their hands over its surface.\n“This experiment constitutes the longest continuous atomic force microscopy experiment ever performed on growing cells,” says Georg Fantner, while John McKinney adds: “It illustrates the power of new technologies not only to analyze the things we already knew about with greater resolution, but also to discover new things that we hadn’t anticipated.”\nArmed with a custom-built instrument that combines the two techniques, the scientists created long-term time-lapses of the growth and division of the bacteria over multiple generations. Unexpectedly, they found that the bacteria produce undulating “trough-like” patterns across their length. These morphological landmarks on the undulating surface of mycobacterial cells correspond to future sites of cell division. \nThe troughs are roughly repeating waves, which the scientists calculated to have an average wavelength of ~1.8 μm, and an amplitude too small to resolve with conventional microscopes (about 100 nm). This might be the reason why waveform troughs have not been reported before. \nThe time-lapse images also showed that, after the mycobacterium divides, the new “daughter” cells inherit the “mother” cell’s wave-trough pattern, and ultimately divide at the center-most wave-trough.\nWave-troughs can form up to three generations before they are used as division sites. According to Alexander Eskandarian, the lead author of the study, these morphological features are “by far the earliest known landmark of future division sites in bacteria.\" Building on these observations, future research will focus on identifying the underlying mechanisms responsible for wave-trough formation and propagation and recruitment of the cell division machinery.\nThis work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the Innovative Medicines Initiative, the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7), and the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO).\nReference\nHaig A.

{"id": 478, "text": "Hepatoblastoma is a rare pediatric liver cancer, usually diagnosed in the first three years of life. Histological methods are used to distinguish between the different subtypes of hepatoblastoma. EPFL scientists have now found metabolic differences between hepatoblastoma subtypes, and identified several biomarkers that can help obtain more accurate subtyping of the disease. The work is .\nThere are many subtypes of hepatoblastoma, the two major ones being fetal and embryonal. Clinically, pure fetal cases have the best prognosis. The way oncologists distinguish between the different subtypes is by staining biopsies and observing the tumor architecture. However, this is not satisfactory.\n“When we compare tumors on the microscope, we know almost nothing about their differences,” says Etienne Meylan, whose led this study. “It’s a little like comparing cars: only when we look inside at the engine we begin to understand what makes them so fundamentally different to each other. Our study shows that different types of hepatoblastoma use different nutrients, or fuels, to grow. Some use glucose, others might rely on fatty acids. In the era of personalized medicine this is important, as we want to be sure we block the right fuel for the right tumor.”\nMeylan’s lab built on the genetics of hepatoblastoma, which involves frequent mutations in the gene CTNNB1. This gene produces the protein beta-catenin, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription. Because of its dual function, mutations of the CTNNB1 gene can have diverse and far-reaching consequences, including in cancers like hepatoblastoma. Beta-catenin is a component of a signaling pathway called Wnt/beta-catenin, which is responsible for regulating the expression of multiple genes. What is of interest is that many components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are affected and overactive in various tumors.\nSomething that is becoming increasingly significant in oncology is that different types of cancers show characteristic metabolic profiles, e.g. in the way they produce, store, and use glucose, glutamine, fatty acids etc. Based on this, the EPFL researchers looked at the relationship of the CTNNB1 gene and the cell’s metabolism.\nThe researchers first showed that beta-catenin, as part of the Wnt signaling pathway directly regulates the expression of a gene that produces a glucose transporter protein (GLUT3).\nNext, they used RNA sequencing to identify molecular and metabolic features that are specific to hepatoblastoma. This approach revealed that several enzymes involved in the metabolism of glucose are overexpressed in embryonal hepatoblastoma cells as compared to fetal hepatoblastoma cells. \nFinally, the scientists found that embryonal hepatoblastoma cells show high levels of glucose uptake. In addition, they also found that these cells are very sensitive to the perturbation of an enzyme involved in the cell’s use of glucose, which might hint to a metabolically driven therapy in the future.\nWorking off their discoveries, the researchers used immunohistochemistry of three metabolic biomarkers to better distinguish embryonal from fetal components out of a large panel of human hepatoblastoma biopsies, collected from French and Swiss university hospitals.\nThe study shows that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is crucial for reprograming the energy management of tumor cells. It also provides a new, metabolic classification of human hepatoblastoma that can help oncologists develop novel diagnostic methods and even treatments.\n\"This paper is a milestone of upmost importance for our children with hepatoblastoma,” says , Surgical Director of the Swiss Reference Centre for Liver Diseases in Children (Hospital University of Geneva), who was not involved in the study. “As a further step towards personalized medicine, these discovered biomarkers allow for individual characterization of the children' liver tumor, helping us in risk stratification, and eventually allowing for an adjusted, personalized treatment.”\nContributors \nSIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics\nGeneva University Hospitals\nFaculté de Médecine Université Paris Sud\nLudwig Center for Cancer Research and Department of Oncology\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nFondation Recherche sur le Cancer de l’Enfant ()\nReference \nStefania Crippa, Pierre-Benoit Ancey, Jessica Vazquez, Paolo Angelino, Anne-Laure Rougemont, Catherine Guettier, Vincent Zoete, Mauro Delorenzi, Olivier Michielin, Etienne Meylan. \nMutant CTNNB1 and histological heterogeneity define metabolic subtypes of hepatoblastoma. \nEMBO Molecular Medicine \n18 September 2017.

He and his colleagues set out to understand how people’s opinions on four hot-button topics – climate change, abortion, vaccination and immigration – were swayed based on the statements of celebrity spokespeople.\nThe researchers randomly mixed and matched real statements with real celebrities, to test their hypothesis that statements attributed to known and respected spokespeople had more influence than those from unknown or disliked sources. Study subjects also read statements attributed to an “expert”, who unbeknownst to them was made up by the researchers.\n“We expected experts to have a bigger effect on changing opinions than disliked celebrities, but our preliminary results actually show that experts have the least impact, and that their statements can even backfire.

By the back door, robotic vacuums are bringing cyberstuff into daily life; they’re among the first autonomous devices that can be easily used by ordinary households.\nThat’s all the impetus scientists needed to seize the opportunity and do a study. Understanding to what extent robots will influence daily life in the future is in fact one of the central issues being studied in the EPFL-based National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Robotics.\n In 2011, a team from EPFL’s Pedagogical Research and Support team (CRAFT) conducted a qualitative study on household robots. Nine compositionally diverse families (young, older, with and without children) were given a machine from one of the most common brands. “We interviewed the families before they got the robot, and then we followed them for six months, starting with their first contact with the device,” explains anthropologist and study co-author Valérie Bauwens.\nRapid and irrevocable decisions\n Seven criteria of varying importance – practical, but also emotional - were developed to judge the degree to which the families adopted the robots. Put to the test and further refined by this first field study, these criteria will be useful to engineers at EPFL and elsewhere who are thinking about the domestic robots of the future.\nIn the end only three of the nine families liked the automatic vacuum cleaners. “It was interesting to observe that the decision whether or not to abandon them was made really fast, after about only two weeks,” Bauwens says. “Our robots had very little time to prove themselves!”\nAmong the elements that the users didn’t like, the researchers listed the need to modify the setup of an apartment so that the robot could do its work correctly. In addition, they didn’t like having to change certain behaviors, such as leaving things on the floor, which compromised the machine’s performance. “We even had one user who was careful to put the coffee table up on the couch to make room for the robot to work,” says second author Julia Fink.\nKids are quickly bored\n The scientists also looked at the influence that these new “companions” might have on the family ecosystem. “Overall, we didn’t see many changes,” Bauwens says. “The mother is still generally in control of household organization, even with this tool.” Two of the study subjects, however, appropriated the device, giving it a name or talking to it. The children were at first very excited by the arrival of the new toy, but the older ones quickly lost interest. “It’s just a vacuum cleaner!” said one of them.\n The first robot to get a foothold in apartments is thus a kind of guinea pig. Its successors - such as “Ranger,” a robotic box under development at EPFL that encourages kids to put away their toys by amusing interactions such as speaking and moving its eyes - can benefit from the problems it encountered. As for the robotic vacuums, resellers will certainly have a good idea by mid-January, high season for returns, whether or not their statistics confirm the result of the qualitative study.\nSwiss TV TSR1 consumers' show A Bon Entendeur will talk about vacuum robots and this EPFL research in its January 10 edition.", "summary": "Are robots welcome in our homes?

{"id": 484, "text": "Human visual perception works well and is very effective at seeing what's important to us. But our eyes are not capable of averaging video images that last longer than 40 milliseconds. This is something that a camera can do, however, thanks to its adjustable exposure time.\nEPFL researchers used this fact to hide visual information. They modified an image over time through temporal masking, eventually turning it into a video. They tweaked a number of the image’s technical components to make it invisible, but without changing the underlying image. This temporal variation cannot be detected by the human eye, which is busy watching the resulting video. But a camera can reveal the hidden image.\nThe researchers started with a simple observation: if you spin a disk with two different colors, they start to meld. “You have two pieces of information – red and green colors – but when the human eye sees them over time, it stops detecting two colors and just picks up yellow,” said Sami Arpa, from EPFL’s Image and Visual Representation Lab (IVRL). Arpa wondered if this method could be used to hide an image within an image and trick our brains. So he designed a disk where the second image can only be seen by syncing the speed at which the disk rotates with a strobe light. “From there we thought we could produce the same effect with video,” Arpa said.\nSo how do you hide an image in a video? This is no mean feat, because images contain much more information than texts do. The trick lies in masking one signal by another. “Normally, for this to work, the two signals need to have the same contrast, orientation and frequency,” said Sabine Süsstrunk, the head of the lab. “But that gets pretty complicated when you want to hide an image in a video, as the two signals are so different in nature.”\nA camera can detect the hidden information\nThe researchers took advantage of the temporal limits of our visual capacity to design an algorithm that creates special video seals. They came up with a “tempocode,” a video made of moving patterns that can mask the varying frequencies of an image.\nOnly a camera or smartphone app can reveal the hidden image. They have a feature that the human eye lacks – adjustable exposure time – which can be used to temporally average the images. It’s as if these devices were viewing all the superimposed photos at once, since video is nothing other than a series of images.\n“We turned an image into a video, but to make sure that human eyes couldn’t see it, we had to juggle a number of constraints – it was really difficult,” said Roger David Hersch, who helped develop the method. “We can choose an exposure time of 8, 10 or 15 seconds, which isn’t possible with the human eye.”\nThe results of their work were just published in the \nJournal of the Optical Society of America A\n.\nSAMI ARPA, SABINE SÜSSTRUNK AND ROGER D.

{"id": 485, "text": "Will it be possible one day to reconfigure electronic microchips however we want, even when they are in use? A recent discovery by a team at EPFL suggests as much. The researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to create conductive pathways several atoms wide in a material, to move them around at will and even to make them disappear. Their research is the subject of a recent article appearing in Nature Nanotechnology.\nAdaptable electronics is generating significant interest in the scientific community because of the many applications. Imagine for a moment that one single microchip was capable of accomplishing the tasks of several different circuits. For example, a circuit assigned to process sound information could, when not being used for this purpose, be reassigned to process images. This would allow us to miniaturise our electronic devices.\nAt the same time, it would become possible to develop resilient circuits. Whenever a microchip is damaged, it could theoretically reconfigure itself so that it could still function using the components that remain intact. \"An effective way to keep faulty devices working when they are in hard-to-reach places, like space,\" says Leo McGilly, the article's lead author.\nUnderlying this promising technology are so-called 'ferroelectric' materials in which it is possible to create flexible conductive pathways. These pathways are generated by applying an electric field to the material. More specifically, when the electric current is applied, certain atoms moves either \"up\" or \"down,\" which is known as polarisation. In recent years, the academic world has observed that conductive pathways several atoms wide - called 'walls' - form between these polarized zones. The only problem is that, until now, it was impossible to control how these pathways form.\nAt this point, the researchers have tested their research on isolated materials. The next step consists in developing a prototype of a reconfigurable circuit. Leo McGilly would go even further. \"The fact that we can generate pathways wherever we want could allow us to imitate in the future phenomena that take place inside the brain, with the regular creation of new synapses.

{"id": 486, "text": "Hepatoblastoma is a rare pediatric liver cancer, usually diagnosed in the first three years of life. Histological methods are used to distinguish between the different subtypes of hepatoblastoma. EPFL scientists have now found metabolic differences between hepatoblastoma subtypes, and identified several biomarkers that can help obtain more accurate subtyping of the disease. The work is .\nThere are many subtypes of hepatoblastoma, the two major ones being fetal and embryonal. Clinically, pure fetal cases have the best prognosis. The way oncologists distinguish between the different subtypes is by staining biopsies and observing the tumor architecture. However, this is not satisfactory.\n“When we compare tumors on the microscope, we know almost nothing about their differences,” says Etienne Meylan, whose led this study. “It’s a little like comparing cars: only when we look inside at the engine we begin to understand what makes them so fundamentally different to each other. Our study shows that different types of hepatoblastoma use different nutrients, or fuels, to grow. Some use glucose, others might rely on fatty acids. In the era of personalized medicine this is important, as we want to be sure we block the right fuel for the right tumor.”\nMeylan’s lab built on the genetics of hepatoblastoma, which involves frequent mutations in the gene CTNNB1. This gene produces the protein beta-catenin, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription. Because of its dual function, mutations of the CTNNB1 gene can have diverse and far-reaching consequences, including in cancers like hepatoblastoma. Beta-catenin is a component of a signaling pathway called Wnt/beta-catenin, which is responsible for regulating the expression of multiple genes. What is of interest is that many components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are affected and overactive in various tumors.\nSomething that is becoming increasingly significant in oncology is that different types of cancers show characteristic metabolic profiles, e.g. in the way they produce, store, and use glucose, glutamine, fatty acids etc. Based on this, the EPFL researchers looked at the relationship of the CTNNB1 gene and the cell’s metabolism.\nThe researchers first showed that beta-catenin, as part of the Wnt signaling pathway directly regulates the expression of a gene that produces a glucose transporter protein (GLUT3).\nNext, they used RNA sequencing to identify molecular and metabolic features that are specific to hepatoblastoma. This approach revealed that several enzymes involved in the metabolism of glucose are overexpressed in embryonal hepatoblastoma cells as compared to fetal hepatoblastoma cells. \nFinally, the scientists found that embryonal hepatoblastoma cells show high levels of glucose uptake. In addition, they also found that these cells are very sensitive to the perturbation of an enzyme involved in the cell’s use of glucose, which might hint to a metabolically driven therapy in the future.\nWorking off their discoveries, the researchers used immunohistochemistry of three metabolic biomarkers to better distinguish embryonal from fetal components out of a large panel of human hepatoblastoma biopsies, collected from French and Swiss university hospitals.\nThe study shows that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is crucial for reprograming the energy management of tumor cells. It also provides a new, metabolic classification of human hepatoblastoma that can help oncologists develop novel diagnostic methods and even treatments.\n\"This paper is a milestone of upmost importance for our children with hepatoblastoma,” says , Surgical Director of the Swiss Reference Centre for Liver Diseases in Children (Hospital University of Geneva), who was not involved in the study. “As a further step towards personalized medicine, these discovered biomarkers allow for individual characterization of the children' liver tumor, helping us in risk stratification, and eventually allowing for an adjusted, personalized treatment.”\nContributors \nSIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics\nGeneva University Hospitals\nFaculté de Médecine Université Paris Sud\nLudwig Center for Cancer Research and Department of Oncology\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nFondation Recherche sur le Cancer de l’Enfant ()\nReference \nStefania Crippa, Pierre-Benoit Ancey, Jessica Vazquez, Paolo Angelino, Anne-Laure Rougemont, Catherine Guettier, Vincent Zoete, Mauro Delorenzi, Olivier Michielin, Etienne Meylan. \nMutant CTNNB1 and histological heterogeneity define metabolic subtypes of hepatoblastoma. \nEMBO Molecular Medicine \n18 September 2017.

{"id": 487, "text": "For humans, it comes perfectly naturally. But walking on two legs is actually a complicated task, requiring several muscles to perform delicate balancing acts. That’s why, in spite of years of major technological advancements in the field, humanoid robots are still far from being able to get around easily and reliably. Engineers at EPFL’s Biorobotics Laboratory are testing new walking algoritms on a plateform called COMAN, short for COmpliant HuMANoid. This 95-cm-tall humanoid is designed specifically for studying walking – which is why it has no head.\nCOMAN was developed under the EU AMARSi project and is being used by several research teams. The EPFL team is looking specifically at the “brains” of the machine. “We developed algorithms that can improve the robot’s balance while it’s walking,” says Hamed Razavi, a researcher scientist at the Biorobotics Lab.\nIn harmony with symmetries\nOne of COMAN’s distinguishing features is its joints, which are integrated with elastic elements that give it greater flexibility when performing different tasks. The EPFL team came up with a novel control algorithm for the robot, based on the existing symmetries in the structure and dynamics of the robot’ as well as the mathematical equations representing the robot dynamics. “You could say we’re working in harmony with these symmetries rather than against them. As a result, we obtain a more natural and robust walking gait,” says Razavi.\nThe control algorithm uses sophisticated computer programs to carefully analyze the date received from the robot – including its position, velocity, joint angles, etc. – and sends appropriate commands to the motors, telling them what to do in order to maintain the robot's balance. “For example, if someone pushes COMAN, for example, our algorithms will calculate exactly where its foot should land in order to counteract the perturbation,” says Razavi.\nClimbing stairs and opening doors\nThe algorithms are geared towards three types of realworld applications. The first is carrying out rescue missions in disastrous scenarios. “In environments designed by humans - like a nuclear power plant where there are stairs to climb and doors to open – humanoid robots can get around more easily than robots with wheels,” says Razavi. The second is helping with tasks like carrying heavy boxes or moving objects (see box). And the third is creating exoskeletons for the disabled.\n“Making the robots more stable is just the tip of the iceberg,” says Razavi. The next step is refining the algorithms so that the humanoids have a wider range of movement and can overcome obstacles and walk on irregular or sloped surfaces.\nHumanoids helping humans\nAs part of this project, Jessica Lanini and Hamed Razavi studied how two people carrying an object together are able to walk, turn and speed up in a coordinated manner – without communicating with each other. Their findings, recently published in , indicate that the two people automatically synchronize their steps, like a quadruped. Now the researchers plan to apply their results to humanoid robots.\n“Whether for manufacturing or natural disasters, we need robots that can interact with humans and help us carry heavy objects,” says Lanini. “But such robots don’t exist. That’s because, in order to operate safely and effectively, the robots would need to be able to make decisions and respond to unexpected circumstances.”\nThe researchers decided to observe humans, who do things better and more naturally than robots. They analyzed the way humans move and found that some factors like speed, force and hand position play a pivotal role in understanding “commands” like speeding up or stopping. The next step is modeling these observations in order to program the robots. “What is exactly that makes us realize to slow down or turn? The applied force? A combination of force and speed? The boundary is not yet clear,” says Razavi. \nClara Marc", "summary": "Walking on two legs isn’t as easy as it seems. For robots and their designers, it is an even bigger challenge!

But the online platforms these companies have developed also collect users’ personal data – from passengers and drivers alike. Multiplied by millions of users each day, that comes out to be a goldmine of information, especially in the era of Big Data. Researchers from EPFL and the Faculty of Business and Economics at UNIL looked at how the same level of service could be achieved without disclosing users’ personal data. Their software, called  (O for oblivious), can be used to set up a ride where only the driver and passenger know the starting point, route and destination.\n“Ride-hailing apps like Uber have created a lot of buzz and controversy. But the issue of data protection has been less discussed,” says Jean-Pierre Hubaux, a professor at EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Sciences. Some data security concerns have already been reported in the press, such as a flaw that revealed data about hundreds of drivers and – even worse – a threat by a Uber executive to dig up dirt on unfriendly journalists. The members of the project team, who are all experts on data protection, could not pass up the challenge of seeing whether it would be technically possible to keep personal data confidential in ride-hailing platforms. They will present the results of their research at two conferences in North America this summer.\nStill convenient and fast\nORide uses a cryptographic system similar to homomorphic encryption. It can carry out operations on encrypted data and get the same result as if the data was not encrypted. For example, it can add an encrypted 2 + 2 to get an encrypted 4. So when someone uses ORide to search for a driver, the system will receive encrypted location data about the passenger and the drivers who are available. It will then identify the closest drivers, and – still using encrypted data – let the passenger select a driver. Once the two app users are matched up, ORide will display the location of each one on the other’s smartphone.\nThe route that the driver takes is also coded in the users’ smartphones. The only data seen by the ride-hailing company is the distance travelled and the cost of the ride, since this information is what the company will use to take its cut of the fee and what passengers will use as a record of their travel expense. What’s more, ORide doesn’t affect the app’s convenience – passengers can still pay with their credit cards and evaluate their drivers. “Our protocol was designed not to provide complete anonymity, but to make it very hard to track the passengers’ and the drivers’ movements,” says Hubaux. The researchers also realized that their system needs to allow passengers to hunt down a lost item or provide evidence in case of a dispute with a driver. In the event of such a dispute, the data can be re-identified, but only with the agreement of the party making the complaint.\nConfidentiality: a selling point\nThe project team tested their system using public data on New York taxi drivers. They wanted to make sure in particular that the encryption protocol doesn’t slow down the process of searching for a driver. New York – whose population is roughly the same size as Switzerland’s – has just as many Uber and Lyft drivers as taxi drivers. “The encryption with a high-security key adds just a few milliseconds to the search time and doesn’t require a faster internet connection,” says Hubaux. “On the downside, ORide won’t necessarily find the closest driver, which means passengers could have to wait one or two extra minutes.”\nUber and its rivals are now free to decide whether they’re interested – especially since the researchers purposely chose not to patent their technology. “This is a highly competitive market, and confidentiality could be a selling point or a way to avoid a legal battle if a firm has to share the data it has access to with the secret services,” adds Hubaux.", "summary": "Researchers from EPFL and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping their personal data secret.", "claim": "Researchers from EPFL and UNIL have developed an encryption protocol that can put drivers in touch with passengers while keeping my personal data secret.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [21, 21], "noise": false}
{"id": 489, "text": "Pharmaceuticals, energy, perfumes, polymers – all are industrially produced via chemical reactions. To carry out reactions, one needs reactors (vessels of different types and sizes ) to mix the various reagents and some catalysts, while controlling the pressure, temperature, and other parameters.\nUsually, industrial chemical reactions take place in large vessels, producing big quantities of substances. The use of these vast reactors has many drawbacks. For example, it’s difficult to obtain uniform mixing at constant temperatures, and one has to stop the process regularly to empty the reactor. Moreover, chemical reactions are often successfully performed in small reactors in the laboratory, but many problems arise in achieving the same results when the production is scaled-up in industry. This is like preparation of a dish for two people doesn’t involve too much difficulty, but preparing the same dish for 100 people is a different matter!\nThe EPFL’s Group of Chemical Reaction Engineering (GGRC) headed by Lioubov Kiwi has studied the use of microreactors for many years. They produce the required substances in tiny pipes, quickly enabling a highly uniform mixing that is perfectly controlled in terms of temperature (which also avoids the risk of explosion), often without the use of solvents, and in a continuous flow. For example, the reagents could be injected through two separate pipes in a Y-shaped system. They react when they meet, and the resulting product comes out through the third pipe. Detractors say that only insufficient quantities can be produced, but these reactors can be used by thousands in parallel. The products created in these microreactors are purer and therefore higher quality, as the process avoids the manufacturing of undesirable by-products inherent in large reactors.\nProfessor Kiwi and her team have received 2.4 million Swiss francs from the European Union to develop these microreactors. 650 thousand Swiss francs have been allocated to a new project, POLYCAT, which started up on November 15. The goal is to combine the advantages of a microreactor and a nano-catalyst. “To reach our objective, we employ micro- and nano-technologies together”, explains Lioubov Kiwi. The concept/process consists of the deposition on the micro-reactor walls of a polymer thin film that anchors the catalyst nanoparticles (gold, palladium etc.). These nanoparticles remain exposed to the reacting liquids or gases while being firmly fixed to the walls of the micro-capillaries.\nSuch a catalytic reactor could become a reality within two to three years, significantly improving the performance of industrial chemical reactions in terms of their quality, as well as their environmental and safety-related impact.", "summary": "EPFL’s Lioubov Kiwi and her group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "claim": "EPFL’s Lioubov Kiwi and her group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}

Without realizing it, we are constantly tweaking our pace, stride length and foot lift. But could we consciously play with these parameters in order to influence our energy expenditure?\n Researchers at EPFL’s  from the School of Engineering studied eight gait parameters in order to come up with a very sophisticated software program that uses an avatar to predict how much energy people use when they walk depending on their walking style. This research has been published in . Salman Faraji, the co-lead author, devoted an entire section of his thesis to this topic.\nThe avatar – a torso equipped with two legs with feet – can be freely configured. Users start by entering their height and weight and can then set the walking speed, distance between their feet (stride length and stride width), and foot lift, along with the incline of both the torso and the ground. They can also add mass and simulate the effect of being pushed or pulled at different parts of the body. The number of calories burned and the energy consumption are displayed in real time whenever the parameters are modified.\nMaking custom exoskeletons\nThis pioneering software drew on a number of experiments appearing in recent literature, and it offers a huge number of potential applications – especially in the medical realm. “The software could be used to select the best design for an exoskeleton or a custom prosthetic, in order to reduce the user's effort. With a wearable exoskeleton, for example, we could optimize the location of the battery and actuators, or determine the ideal walking pattern for the user’s preferred speed,” says Amy Wu, the study’s other co-lead author. The software could even determine where a backpack should be worn in order to minimize energy expenditure. “If, on the other hand, your goal is to burn calories, the software could be used to find a series of movements with a high metabolic cost.”\nDesigned for \nhumanoid robots\n The software was created in a robotics lab and was initially intended to study the mechanics of human gait for use in humanoid robots. “The way humans walk is extremely complex. The level of control required is a huge challenge for humanoid robots, which often don’t get it quite right,” says Faraji. “We have a long way to go before we really understand all the parameters that go into human, animal and robot locomotion.”\n -----\n An application can be downloaded in order to try out the simulator here: \n Publication in Scientific Reports :", "summary": "New avatar-based software developed at EPFL looks at how people walk in order to predict their energy expenditure.

{"id": 492, "text": "Swiss democracy produces lots of data: municipality-by-municipality ballot results and the votes of the National Council are publicly available, as are the responses of the candidates and voters who filled in the questionnaire on the \"smartvote\" voter recommendation website before the 2011 Federal elections. Under the supervision of professors Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran, Vincent Etter and Julien Herzen, PhD students in the Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory, explored these data to reveal a number of interesting facts. They are currently continuing their research by creating a platform, Predikon.ch, that will be able to predict the results of a federal vote based on initial results coming in from municipalities and past data.\nYes, the “Röstigraben” exists! “And it was a bit of a surprise,” admits Etter. They performed a dimensionality reduction on the municipal results for all votes since 1981. This is a standard tool used by statisticians who specialize in data analysis to produce a graphical representation of data. Two groups emerged: one French-speaking and one of German-speaking. (You can see it at ). “The municipalities closest to the intersection of the groups on the graph are also those that are geographically closest to the linguistic border,” notes Herzen.\nWhile the linguistic divide is easy to see on this representation, it’s a bit more difficult to make sense of the graph’s axes, obtained by the dimensionality reduction. “It’s not the traditional left-right and conservative-liberal divisions,” explains Etter. Over time, the Italian-speaking regions seem to move away from the French-speaking districts to join their German-speaking compatriots. In a future version of their interactive graphic, the scientists plan to add a temporal cursor that will highlight this.\nRight and Left are alive and well \nAlthough the Röstigraben can’t be explained by either the left-right or conservative-liberal divide, these classical political categories are alive and well when it comes to politicians, as the duo found when they applied the same data visualization tools to information from the 2011 Federal elections obtained from the voter recommendation website smartvote.ch.\nWith the same data analysis approach, the researchers explored whether the political parties were really all that different from one another. They showed that the positions of 25.8% of the socialist candidates were closer to the median of the green party positions than to their own party’s position. Inversely, the proportion was 18.8%. But the overlap was greatest in the PBD, with more than half of its politicians closer to the median of another party (most often the PDC, 33.1%) than aligned with their own.\nEtter and Herzen also showed that it would be easy for a candidate who filled in his or her own smartvote profile to choose responses that would optimize the number of times they would be recommended to voters that trusted the site. However, this was evidently not exploited in 2011, since the difference between the voting records of parliamentary politicians and their smartvote profile was very small.\nEbikon, a small town that has it right\nThe next step for the two computer scientists is to predict the result of an vote by combining the initial votes coming in from a small number of municipalities with the database of past results. The platform they are developing with Victor Kristof, a student in Communication systems, is called Predikon.ch, a combination of the words “Prediction” and “Ebikon.” This small town near Lucerne (population 12,000) appeared in their preparatory studies to be the one whose results most reliably predicted the federal result. “By doing the exercise with past votes, in 96% of the cases, the result in Ebikon gave us the correct result at the federal level,” explains Herzen.\nThe project’s development is hampered by the fact that each of Switzerland’s 26 cantons has a different system for presenting its data, and that often these platforms are only online for a few hours the day the vote is held, while ballots are still being counted; but nonetheless there’s a good chance that the Predikon index will soon be mentioned in the news updates on these Sundays.\nThe Predikon project, along with all of Etter and Herzen’s research, will be presented at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences Open House, Saturday November 22 at 3:30 pm in room BC420, during a seminar entitled “La démocratie suisse vue par les données.” Throughout the Open House, a Predikon demo will be held on the fourth floor of the BC building.

Their findings rely on data gathered over 10 years in the canton of Geneva and were published in the journal Nature Nutrition and Diabetes. They highlight the need for a fine-grained assessment of public health and provide insights that could help guide campaigns to prevent obesity.\nPublic health specialists long ago connected the dots between people’s socioeconomic context and social networks on their health and obesity rates. In particular, body-mass-index (BMI) – a measure that describes body shape based on height and weight – has been believed to reflect the income and the average BMI of their social circles. As a result, obesity prevention campaigns have typically targeted large swaths of the population in low-income neighborhoods. But the data gathered from thousands of adults and children living in Geneva beg for a subtler interpretation.\nHealth data for more than 6600 adults, including measured height and weight, were collected from 2001 to 2010 as part of the Bus Santé population-based study, initiated and carried out by Idris Guessous of the Geneva University Hospitals. The campaign included several units including a mobile examination unit that went to several places in the State to evaluate the health of the canton’s residents. The dataset was rounded off with health evaluations of more than 3600 children, obtained in schools across the canton in 2011.\nEvaluating these data geographically confirmed that adults’ and children’s BMI values are not distributed randomly on a map of the canton. Instead, they were found to divide the map into regions with predominantly high or low values, and a larger one where neither trend prevailed. To the south of the Rhone River, the researchers detected a region characterized by low BMI values. North or the Rhone, and to the west of the Praille district, values of high BMI were overrepresented. Between the two, the researchers detected a large “neutral” belt, with a mixed population.\nRed dots represent adults with a high BMI that are surrounded by adults with similarly high BMI values (high-high). Blue dots represent the opposite situation (low-low). White dots mean that neither trend is detected. Purple and pink dots represent low-high and high-low respectively.\n Source:\nNature, 2014.\nThe study revealed two surprising features. First, high adult BMI values did not always overlap with those for children, especially in the heart of the city, north of the Rhone River. And second, at least for adults, the researchers found that differences in income were not enough to explain their findings. But according to the researchers, there are a number other of potential causes, including urban planning, social networks, sport infrastructure, and the promotion of softer forms of mobility, such as walking, biking, or public transportation. In the future, the researchers from EPFL’s Laboratory of Geographical Information Systems, who performed the spatial analysis of the results, will seek to tease out the effect of each of these and other factors on BMI.\nThe study brings to light the importance of finer-grained analysis of community health, both in terms of to geography and age. Lessons learned will primarily benefit other communities seeking to more accurately analyze the health of their residents. But they will also help those involved in setting up anti-obesity campaigns, allowing them to more accurately tailor adult or child specific interventions to the target audience they aim to reach.", "summary": "Whether you live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the canton of Geneva.", "claim": "Whether her live downtown or in the suburbs could have a surprising effect on your bodyweight and your health, with roots running deeper than income differences, says a recent study carried out on data gathered in the canton of Geneva.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 1], "noise": false}
{"id": 499, "text": "In 2017, startups around the world raised some 4.6 billion dollars by issuing virtual tokens that can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies or services. And much of this activity is taking place in Switzerland, where ICOs brought in 850 million dollars last year according to figures published by IFZ (Institut für Finanzdienstleistungen). But so far, few manufacturers have gotten in on the act.\nLakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that develops customized, highly pure diamonds, is an exception. It is set to launch its own ICO, selling machine-hours in the form of virtual tokens. Over two million tokens – worth a total of 60 million francs – will be issued. The company plans to use this money to significantly ramp up its production capacity. Once the ICO has been completed, buyers will be able to sell their tokens or exchange them for diamonds, thereby creating the first-ever crowd-funded diamond “mine.”\nThe smaller the more expensive\n“With natural diamonds, prices go up as the stones get bigger. But with us it’s the opposite,” says Pascal Gallo, the startup’s founder and CEO. The diamonds produced by LakeDiamond are much purer than natural diamonds. The company’s manufacturing process, in which layers of carbon atoms – the sole ingredient of diamonds – are built up through vapor deposition, eliminates nearly all impurities. These industrial diamonds allow for much greater precision thanks to their hardness, thermal and electrical conductivity, and optical properties.\nThe carefully calibrated size of the diamonds – down to the micron – and the high tech processing they undergo are what set these diamonds apart. The method used to customize the diamonds was developed in conjunction with Niels Quack’s lab at EPFL. The carefully sized diamonds can be set in complex mechanical systems such as watch movements and used in high powered lasers, transistors and photonic platforms.\nThe vast majority of companies that have launched ICOs also use blockchain technology. Their main motivation is simplicity: the companies can deal directly with their investors, and this reduces paperwork and saves time. For LakeDiamond, there’s also the question of independence. “We tried traditional fundraising methods, but most potential investors were in the military sector,” says Gallo. “And we don’t want to take the company in that direction.”\nA smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain\nThe “user,” in the company’s parlance, buys a certain number of tokens secured by an Ethereum smart contract. Ethereum is one of several types of blockchain, which are used to record and share information without any external oversight. Blockchains are so safe because all transactions are verifiable and transparent. A white paper describes the project in detail and includes the transaction clauses and the code used to create the tokens (“ether”) that are issued against the cryptocurrency.\n“Our project is unique: we connect diamond growth reactors to the Ethereum blockchain, which lets token holders produce their own diamonds,” says Romain Braud, the company’s blockchain specialist. LakeDiamond’s tokens are referred to as Time-based Machine Tokens (TMT) because they represent hours of use of the reactors. They also give holders a preferential right to “mine” the diamonds ordered by the company’s industrial clients. This means that token holders can support a client project by trading in their tokens for that project – and ultimately benefiting from the value of the client’s order. Tokens can also be sold on secondary markets, just like traditional cryptocurrencies.\nThe first phase of LakeDiamond’s ICO is meant for professional investors (“token users”). The ICO will be opened to the public this fall once the company has obtained authorization from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).", "summary": "LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that produces and customizes ultra-pure diamonds for industrial use, is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) today.

{"id": 501, "text": "Most modern buildings are composed of several layers of materials, each with its own important function: the concrete core supports its weight; the insulation regulates its heat exchange; the facade contributes to its aesthetics. Now, engineers at EPFL are developing a single building block that does all of that, and produces electricity. This new component will provide a sleek alternative to traditional construction materials, and will be lighter, safer, and more energy efficient.\n“We use a composite sandwich construction to make this multi-functional building element,” explains Thomas Keller of the Composite Construction Laboratory (CCLab). The sandwich comprises a dense foam interior encased between layers of glass-fibre reinforced polymer. “We started working on these composite materials over 10 years ago and used them in 2009 for the roof of the Main Entrance Building at the Novartis Campus in Basel, Switzerland,” he says.\nAnd now, with funding from, they are trying to add electricity generation to the mix. “Now our goal is to encapsulate a thin flexible sheet of photovoltaic cells beneath a translucent layer of glass fiber reinforced polymer,” he continues. If they succeed, this material could contribute to making solar panels more attractive to architects by offering them more flexibility than traditional construction materials based on reinforced concrete, rigid solar panels, and glass.\nThe solar cell technology comes from Flexcell, a startup from IMT Neuchâtel (since 2009 part of EPFL), that became famous for its flexible sheets of photovoltaic cells. Despite lower efficiencies than conventional photovoltaic cells, their light weight, small volume, and low production costs make them ideal for encapsulation into building elements. And the ease of fitting curved surfaces with them will open new avenues in sustainable architectural design.\nOn top of that there are the other, already demonstrated advantages of these lightweight sandwich components. Prefabrication means that they can be assembled in a factory under ideal conditions before being transported to the construction site, increasing the quality and the safety of the buildings and shortening construction times. And since they are modular, individual elements are easy to repair or to replace if they fail.\nPerfecting the ingredients\n The glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) plays a double role in this sandwich. A layer of GFRP a few millimeters thick encases the foam core, giving the building block its remarkable stability. Another layer of it encapsulates and protects the solar cells, drawing on an interesting optical property of the GFRP: when applied thinly, it is almost as transparent as glass, with an optical transmittance only four percent lower. Currently, a PhD student at the CCLab is perfecting this layer’s thickness to find the best compromise between structural stability and optical translucence.\n“Besides the optical issues,” says Keller, “we are dealing with temperature related issues. Heating the resin leads to a loss of efficiency in light transmission. Beyond a certain critical temperature, the material could degrade and fail to recover its original state when it cools down.” But so far it has withstood temperatures beyond those expected even in the hotter parts of the world, without showing signs of degradation.\nNot yet two years in to the project, the scientists involved are optimistic. Solar electricity generation is here to stay, and considering the widespread use of curved concrete surfaces in contemporary architecture, there could be great potential for this new solar sandwich.", "summary": "All in one: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at EPFL", "claim": "All in one: A new electricity generating building component is being developed at GFRP", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [14, 14], "noise": false}
{"id": 502, "text": "At  – educational facilities designed to promote cross-disciplinary research – a groundbreaking new device is in the works. Eight Master’s students in microengineering, bioengineering and life sciences () developed a portable biosensor for the  competition, which was held at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands on 7–8 September 2018. Their device can provide precise measurements of the amount of vancomycin, an antibiotic used as a last-resort treatment, in a patient’s blood plasma. This information will help doctors deliver exactly the amount of drug needed and therefore reduce the occurrence of harmful side effects. For instance, vancomycin is known to cause damage to the kidneys and to hearing.\n“We started working on the biosensor last fall alongside our coursework, and this summer have been working on it full-time. Being able to use the DLL has made our research a lot easier, since they have all the equipment we need,” says Alix Faillétaz, a Master’s student in bioengineering. This is the second year in a row that EPFL is participating in SensUs, where its team will be up against students from 12 other universities from around the world. “The competition was launched three years ago. It’s really demanding and is a huge challenge for the students. They must overcome a series of problems and learn to work together, trust each other and delegate tasks based on each individual’s specific skills,” says Professor Philippe Renaud, who is coaching the team.\nPolarization-based measurements\nSensUs aims to encourage the development of biosensors, targeting a different application each year – although the objective always relates to measuring a biomarker with an impact on public health. The objective is chosen by a panel of experts that includes Professor Renaud. Existing tests to measure vancomycin require a great deal of time, a considerable amount of blood and a special machine that costs tens of thousands of Swiss francs. But the EPFL team’s portable biosensor can take measurements in less than five minutes with just a few drops of blood, and costs under 5,000 francs. Their device shines polarized light on a sample containing a homogeneous mixture of the patient’s blood plasma and a synthetized peptide (an amino-acid sequence) solution.\nHow does it work? “We first created a peptide that bonds specifically to vancomycin, and then we added a fluorescent compound,” says Faillétaz. “As the vancomycin bonds to the fluorescent peptide, the peptide’s movement slows and the light it emits becomes more and more polarized. By measuring the degree of light polarization, we can calculate the vancomycin concentration in a patient’s blood.” According to Professor Renaud, this method already exists but has never been used to make a portable biosensor.\nAt the competition, the EPFL team will have to not only prove their biosensor’s efficacy by analyzing various samples, but also demonstrate its benefits for the healthcare industry and its market potential. “By changing the synthesis compound, our biosensor could be used to detect other antibiotics and biomarkers,” says David Vilela, a Master’s student in life sciences.\nEPFL on the first step of the podium\n The SenSwiss team won the most awards in the SensUs international competition. They won the technical award, and placed second for the awards related to creativity and entrepreneurship. Their biosensor has proven to be the most effective in accurately measuring the amount of vancomycin in blood plasma samples. This can be done in less than five minutes, with only a few drops of blood and innovative technology. The team also demonstrated the commercialization potential of his invention, its usefulness to medical personnel and the possibility of adapting the test to other antibiotics.\nThe SenSwiss team: \nMatthieu Pinto (microengineering student) optical detection part, Victor Steininger (bioengineering student) electrical and mechanical parts, Mathieu Jeckelmann (bioengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Jacopo Oswald (microengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Paul Philipp (life sciences student) biological part, Aly Makhlouf (bioengineering student) biological part, David Vilela (life sciences student) biological part, Alix Faillétaz (bioengineering student) electrical part.", "summary": "A team of eight EPFL students won the technical prize in the SensUs international competition, designing a portable biosensor that can measure the amount of vancomycin in a patient’s blood stream, enabling doctors to better control the dosage and reduce harmful side effects.

{"id": 503, "text": "This may be Switzerland’s last stand, since its eligibility for European research and funding programs is in jeopardy. The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.\nEPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).\nEPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.\nHowever, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants. This restriction was temporarily lifted on 15 September 2014.\nThis grace period will end on 9 February 2017. Swiss researchers can therefore still respond to calls for proposals whose deadline falls before that date.\nEPFL H2020 Advanced Grants\nSmit, Berend – MaGic\nThe Materials Genome in Action\nIt is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

{"id": 504, "text": "With cities expected to grow significantly in the future, it is vital to plan their development and anticipate their impact on the environment ahead of time. Nahid Mohajeri, an urban architect and geographer at EPFL, looked into Geneva’s history in order to understand how the city developed the way it did and predict how it will change in the future.\nIn order to model a city's evolution over time, Dr. Mohajeri came up with the idea of combining two different scientific approaches: statistical thermodynamics – \nPreliminary results, published in Ecological Modelling, indicate that cities in general – and Geneva in particular – grow by virtue of two very different processes: they spread out and/or become denser. Dr. Mohajeri also observed that large cities are proportionally more energy efficient and have a lower specific ecological footprint per resident than small towns.\nFor the purpose of quantifying the different cities, the researcher analyzed them in terms of their thermodynamic entropy, which scientists call “randomness.” She also used other physics and engineering methods, such as spatial analysis. In this way, Dr. Mohajeri was able to model cities on a computer.\nThe goal is to compare the ecological impact of various urban forms – compact or dispersed – in view of one day developing a framework for building eco-cities. But is there really an ideal urban form? That’s what Dr. Mohajeri is trying to determine.\nEvery city evolves on the basis of several criteria specific to that city, such as the land on which it was built and the political decisions that transform it. “Kerman, in southern Iran, is an interesting example,” said the researcher. “The city experienced rapid growth at the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979. ‘Revolutionary’ housing was quickly thrown up on the outskirts of the city. The old town is squat and dense, and its expansion seems to be aimed at replicating an American city.”\nDr. Mohajeri analyzed dozens of cities around the world, from New Orleans to London and Geneva. Some give the impression of having grown haphazardly, while others are neatly squared off by their avenues, or, like Geneva, stretch out slowly in the shape of an octagon.\nThe parameters used by the researcher focus on the spatial distribution of 11,418 buildings. According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, more than 83% of Switzerland’s population will live in urban areas in 2050. Dr. Mohajeri’s studies on entropy led to the discovery that two very different processes drove Geneva’s growth: expansion (where streets and buildings were added to the edge of the city) and densification (where streets and buildings were added within the existing city). Expansion has been the dominant force in Geneva over the past 170 years.\nThe Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO - PB) uses the thermodynamic-statistical approach, which originated in the field of physics, to learn more about the complex relationship between the built environment and the natural environment.\nOnce the laws of thermodynamics that govern a given city’s growth are identified, the next step will be to learn how their spatial-temporal evolution affects the functioning of their ecosystem. More specifically, the idea is to determine how a city’s growth and form influence its energy consumption, changes in land cover, biodiversity and human well-being.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher is modeling cities in order to understand their metabolism and determine their ecological impact when they grow and change.

For the EPFL roboticists, these robots provide a tool for studying animal locomotion and biomechanics in future research.\n“We use a process called \nbio-informed robotics,\n” says scientist Kamilo Melo of EPFL’s Biorob Laboratory. He explains, “We study biology, gather information and data to \ninform\n robotic design, and then we use that design to gain understanding of the original biology.”\nThe design process involved studying the crocodiles and monitor lizards in order to reproduce the walking movement of these creatures. This involved imitating joints with motors, bones with aluminium and carbon fiber, and skin with a waterproof suit made out of latex. A mini-computer, wired to the 24 motors needed to make the reptiles move, could be remote-controlled as far as 500 meters away.\nThe reptilian robots serve a valuable role for another line of research of the Biorob lab: search and rescue. Robots may one day be deployed in emergency situations, like after an earthquake, in order to locate and possibly even rescue victims. The Ugandan terrain was perfect for testing the robustness of the robotic reptiles: Murchison Falls Natural Park was humid, muddy and dusty with temperatures reaching as high as 70 degrees Celsius inside of the latex skin.\n“We encourage roboticists to take their robots out of the lab,” says EPFL scientist Tomislav Horvat, who worked alongside Melo throughout the reptilian adventure. “This will make them learn things that are hard to see in controlled environments and that will greatly improve their designs and software.”\nThis research was funded in part by NCCR Robotics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists designed, built and remote-controlled the robotic structures of a crocodile and a lizard for a field experiment, in the depths of Africa, in collaboration with the BBC.

{"id": 506, "text": "A second small Swiss satellite is going to be launched into space. After SwissCube in 2009, the Swiss Space Center (SSC) at EPFL is working on a new project. Baptized as CubETH, the youngest member of the Swiss cubsats family takes a lot from its predecessor: it measures ten cubic centimeters and weighs less than 1.5 kg. However, its scientific mission is more ambitious. This device is the result of a partnership with the Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich (ETHZ) as well as other collaborators. Its launching is scheduled for the end of 2015 at the earliest. The prototype is currently going through the “flat sat” stage: in order to test all its electronic components, they are electrically connected as they will be in the final structure while lying flat on a lab’s table.\n\"We aim at making CubETH a high performance orbitographic tool capable of calculating its position, altitude and orientation in space with high accuracy,\" said Markus Rothacher, director of the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab at ETH Zurich and main investigator for the scientific part of the project. The idea is to design a stable satellite in order to prevent it from spinning, as it happened to the SwissCube. \"But most importantly, added the specialist, we want to create conditions for future cubsats constellations so that, for example, we could carry out thorough observations of Earth at a given time. For that reason, it is essential to know the satellites’ exact orbits so as to coordinate their trajectories and scientific equipment.\"\nProven on Earth, unprecented in space\nTo achieve a more accurate measurement of the satellite’s orbit, the researchers opted for GPS receivers designed by the Swiss company u-blox. \"These sensors caught our interest because they are small, cheap and their performance is well proven, said Anton Ivanov, SSC researcher in charge of the satellite’s entire technical design. The u-blox receivers are very common, particularly in mobile phones, but they have never been used in space. We want to prove that, by adapting its software, this low cost piece of hardware originally developed for terrestrial purposes can be used in space applications.\"\nIn addition, these sensors are compatible with other navigational systems like the Russian GLONASS or the European Galileo. Hence, researchers are envisaging using all of these GPS technologies, not only for the cubsats constellations but also in the context of the \"cleaner\" satellite project CleanSpace One. They could certainly provide the high precision necessary for carrying out the delicate maneuvers to approach and capture space debris.\nFinally, the CubETH will also have an antenna on its side to study the atmosphere’s composition and nature. The idea is yet again to verify the efficiency of less expensive components than those traditionally used in space. In such a way, the CubETH project remains faithful to the spirit behind SwissCube and cubsats in general: being a platform for testing and demonstrating the applicability of standard electronic components in space.\nAn educational role\nThe cubesats’ format was devised by the California and Stanford universities to allow scholars conduct their own spatial scientific experiments at a reduced cost. The most innovative and significant design elements of SwissCube have been kept, such as the use of cell phone batteries packaged in a waterproof and thermally controlled casing. Another preserved feature is the use of the innovative system of copper pads that provide a better attachment of the solar cells on the satellite’s walls.\nEven before its launch, the new satellite will have also played an important educational role. In addition to generating links and collaborations between the country’s two Federal Institutes of Technology, the different pieces of software on board the satellite will have been the object of study of undergraduate and doctoral students lucky enough to take advantage of a concrete project for learning about space technologies.\n*\n Other Project Partners\n:\n Academic: Hochschule Zentralschweiz (Luzern), Hochschule Rapperswil Tecknik\n Industrial: u- blox, RUAG, Saphyrion.", "summary": "CubETH is the name of a joint project between EPFL’s Swiss Space Center and ETHZ whose main objective is to build a satellite scheduled for launch in late 2015.

It would also constitute a major touristic attraction. The 38 km long work of art’s estimated cost is 2.5 billion francs...\nRemembering the Entreroches canal\n The student from the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) has, in a way, revisited the original concept behind the Entreroches canal. Currently disused, some of its course is still visible in some places between Cossonay and Morges.\n The Entreroches canal was the answer to the old European dream of a waterway linking the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The arrival of the railway combined with the lack of money during the 19th century ended this dream abruptly.\nNavigation path\n Departure takes place on the harbor of Grandson, on Lake Neuchâtel.

This is partially caused by the presence of architectural barriers – since there are several towns along its way and it is not always possible to get round them, not to mention too costly. Environmental protection laws forced Fränz Zeimetz to reconsider some of his choices: \"Take the Venoge River for instance: a law dating from 1997 states that it is forbidden to change its natural course, to touch its watershed and to transform its tributaries. Therefore, the best way to get there was underground. \"\nInteractive Tunnels\n Since the canal is designed to transport leisure boats as well as cargo, the student decided to trade his engineering skills for architectural creativity.

{"id": 509, "text": "Is there life on a distant planet? One way astronomers are trying to find out is by analyzing the light that is scattered off a planet’s atmosphere. Some of that light, which originates from the stars it orbits, has interacted with its atmosphere, and provides important clues to the gases it contains. If gases like oxygen, methane or ozone are detected, that could indicate the presence of living organisms. Such gases are known as biosignatures. A team of scientists from EPFL and Tor Vergata University of Rome has developed a statistical model that can help astronomers interpret the results of the search for these “signs of life”. Their research has just been published in \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nSince the first exoplanet – a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun – was discovered 25 years ago, over 4,300 more have been identified. And the list is still growing: a new one is discovered every two or three days. Around 200 of the exoplanets found so far are telluric, meaning they consist mainly of rocks, like the Earth. While that’s not the only requirement for a planet to be able to host life – it also needs to have water and be a certain distance from its sun – it is one criterion that astronomers are using to focus their search.\nIn the coming years, the use of gas spectroscopy to detect biosignatures in planets’ atmospheres will become an increasingly important element of astronomy. Many research programs are already under way in this area, such as for the CHEOPS exoplanet-hunting satellite, which went into orbit in December 2019, and the James-Webb optical telescope, scheduled to be launched in October 2021.\nStarting with an unknown\nWhile much progress has been made on detecting exoplanetary biosignatures, several question marks remain. What are the implications of this kind of research? And how should we interpret the results? What if just one biosignature is detected on a planet? Or what if no biosignatures are detected – what should we conclude? Those kinds of questions are what the EPFL-Tor Vergata scientists set out to answer with their new model.\nTheir work tackles the problem from a new angle. Traditionally, astronomers have looked for life on another planet based on what we know about life and biological evolution on Earth. But with their new method, the scientists started with an unknown: how many other planets in our galaxy have some form of life. Their model incorporates factors like the estimated number of other stars in the galaxy similar to the Sun and how many telluric planets might be orbiting within a habitable distance from those stars. It uses Bayesian statistics – particularly well suited to small sample sizes – to calculate the probability of life in our galaxy based on how many biosignatures are detected: one, several or none at all.\n“Intuitively it makes sense that if we find life on one other planet, there are probably many others in the galaxy with some type of living organism. But how many?” says Amedeo Balbi, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics in Tor Vergata’s Physics Department. “Our model turns that intuitive assumption into a statistical calculation, and lets us determine exactly what the numbers mean in terms of quantity and frequency.”\n“Astronomers already use various assumptions to evaluate how credible life is on a given planet,” says Claudio Grimaldi, a scientist at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Complex Matter (LPMC) who is also affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Research Center in Rome. “One of our research goals was thus to develop a method for weighing and comparing those assumptions in light of the new data that will be collected over the coming years.”\nSpreading from one planet to another\nGiven the small number of planets that will likely be examined in the near future, and assuming that life will emerge independently on any one planet, the EPFL-Tor Vergata study found that if even just one biosignature is detected, we can conclude with a greater than 95% probability that there are over 100,000 inhabited planets in the galaxy – more than the number of pulsars, which are objects created when a massive star explodes at the end of its life. On the other hand, if no biosignatures are detected, we cannot necessarily conclude that other forms of life do not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.\nThe scientists also looked at the theory of panspermia, which states that instead of emerging independently on a given planet, life forms could be carried over from another planet – such as through organic matter or microscopic organisms being carried on comets or spreading between neighboring planets. This implies that the probability of life on a planet also depends on how far it is from other planets and how easily various life forms – whose physical characteristics could be extremely different from those we are familiar with – are able to resist the extreme conditions of space travel and adapt to the new planet. Factoring in panspermia alters the inferred number of inhabited planets elsewhere in the galaxy.", "summary": "One way to determine whether there is life on another planet is to look for biosignatures in the light that is scattered off its atmosphere.

The objective of this grant program is to ensure that there is a new supply of graduate scientists, to encourage mobility, and to support women’s careers. “The number of grants is limited, while the number of doctoral students with the required level to aspire to these grants has largely increased”, observes Caroline Vandevyver, responsible for the preparation of the application forms. “This is the result of the strict selection of doctoral students performed by the Doctoral School. Only 15% of them applied in 2005, compared to 27% in 2010.” In a market which is becoming more and more competitive, doctoral students are increasingly aware of the value of doing research abroad. While not all of them become professors, many find interesting opportunities in universities, as well as in industry.\n An FNS grant constitutes a first-rate opportunity, since it enables the doctoral student who has completed his/her thesis to continue his/her education in the university and the topic of his/her choice. The grant is awarded for a period of 18 months, and includes an allowance for personal expenses, an amount for travel expenses, and possibly also a contribution towards research and symposium costs. The amount granted depends on marital status, family-related responsibilities, and the cost of living in the country of residence. They are awarded independently of nationality, sex or family situation. Only the applicants’ competencies are taken into account. The researchers are thus able to devote their entire attention to their research work. The only condition for applying is to have obtained a doctoral degree at EPFL. “All those who received one of these grants said that it had been a springboard for their professional career”, adds Caroline Vandevyver.\n EPFL and its teachers strongly encourage these research periods abroad. They constitute an almost inevitable step in a scientific career, are practically essential in becoming a professor, and a major asset in being selected for important positions. The likelihood of becoming a professor is greater for someone who has benefited from a grant. In a recent study, the EPFL Research Commission has observed that 17% of post-doctoral scholarship students began an academic career, but that only 23% of them came back to Switzerland to pursue it. We might therefore wonder: what is the benefit for a university such as EPFL to see its best people leave?

Matias, also eight years old, then continued: “I asked my brother, who’s in Australia, to check whether vortexes really do turn the other way down there.” His brother also participated in this competition once. “This interest in science runs in the family,” said his dad, who was the team’s coach that day.\nThat’s just what this competition is designed to bring out: the goal is to get kids interested in science and research. “They may not yet have the mathematical tools to understand and model a scientific problem,” said Andrea Fabian Montabert, who was in charge of organizing the competition. “But they can still come up with hypotheses, set up an experiment and improve their results through trial and error. And they can make observations and draw conclusions.” The competition lets kids try their hand at scientific and technical experiments in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\nTeamwork and cooperation\n After taking a short quiz designed to test their general science knowledge, the competitors played a fun game that required solid teamwork. They had to cross an imaginary swamp and feed a paper crocodile – but they had to be quick and nimble and work together effectively. Professor André Châtelain, who used to run EPFL’s Experimental Physics Institute, brought the competition to a close with a short talk on scientific curiosity.\nAt the end of the competition, the kids all went home. But who knows, maybe they’ll be back on campus one day as students.\nThe results and final rankings are available here: http://", "summary": "On Saturday, EPFL hosted 250 budding young scientists – aged between 8 and 15 – in the fifth annual “Curious and Inventive” science competition, run by the school’s Science Outreach Department.", "claim": "On Saturday, EPFL hosted four budding young scientists – aged between 8 and 15 – in the fifth annual “Curious and Inventive” science competition, run by the school’s Science Outreach Department.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 5], "noise": false}
{"id": 513, "text": "Coral reefs are dying on a massive scale around the world, and global warming is driving this extinction. The planet’s largest reef, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, is currently experiencing enormous coral bleaching for the second year in a row, while last year left only a third of its 2300-km ecosystem unbleached. The demise of coral reefs heralds the loss of some of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems.\nCoral bleaching in the Maldives. Photo credit: The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers\nNow, scientists have shown that corals in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Northern Red Sea are particularly resistant to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification. The results are published today in the journal \nRoyal Society\nOpen Science.\nThe implications are important, as the Gulf of Aqaba is a unique coral refuge. The corals may provide the key to understanding the biological mechanism that leads to thermal resistance, or the weakness that underlies massive bleaching. There is also the hope that the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs could be used to re-seed deteriorated reefs in the Red Sea and perhaps even around the world.\nScientists at EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and UNIL (Université de Lausanne) in Switzerland, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period. They found that the corals did not bleach.\n “[Under these conditions,] most corals around the world would probably bleach and have a high degree of mortality,” says EPFL scientist Thomas Krueger. “Most of the variables that we measured actually improved, suggesting that these corals are living under suboptimal temperatures right now and might be better prepared for future ocean warming.”\nInterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nAt the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat, the scientists exposed corals of the species \nStylophora pistillata\n, collected from the Gulf of Aqaba, to water temperatures and acidification. The conditions resemble the summer conditions of a future ocean in this region if local ocean warming continues at its current rate of approximately 0.4-0.5°C per decade. They performed an overall health check of all the major physiological functions of the corals, measuring variables like energy metabolism, the ability to build a skeleton, and nutrient exchange at the molecular level between the coral-host and their algae symbionts. These physiological variables were mostly unaffected by the harsh experimental treatment. Still, further work on ecologically relevant variables like fertility or competitive performance is needed.\nSymbiotic corals live together with an algae partner, much in the same way humans are in symbiosis with gut bacteria. Just as bacteria in the gut aid with digestion, providing valuable nutrients to the rest of the body, the algae that live within the coral-partner provide nutrients to the corals. The bacteria in our body thrive within our digestive tract, just as the algae benefit from living within the coral partner. Bleaching occurs when the colored algae are ejected by their coral-partner, and the symbiosis breaks down. If the algae do not return, the coral dies.\nCorals growing at the InterUniversity Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat. Photo credit: EPFL\nPre-acclimated to thermal tolerance\nThe coral species \nStylophora pistillata \noccurs in other regions of the world, and beyond the Gulf of Aqaba, does not necessarily demonstrate thermal resistance. The biological mechanism that underlies the robustness of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs is still unknown, but the scientists have an idea of how the species evolved to become thermally resistant.\n“Corals in the Gulf of Aqaba are pre-acclimated to thermal tolerance due to the special geography and recent history of the Red Sea,” says scientist Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences.\nAt the end of the last ice age, corals started recolonizing the whole of the Red Sea through the southern connection to the Indian Ocean. The thermal bottleneck at the southern entrance with summer water temperatures rising to 30-32°C provided a selective barrier, allowing only highly resistant individuals to move north. Ironically, this heat-resistant founding population encountered much cooler waters once reaching the northern end, where the Gulf of Aqaba is located.\nBased on this, the study hypothesized that these corals might be able to better cope with today’s ocean warming, considering that they not only descended from a heat-selected founding population, but they also started their warming trajectory from a lower temperature, compared to their counterparts in the central and southern Red Sea.\nProtection of the Gulf of Aqaba Reef\nDespite being resistant to global warming, the corals from the Gulf of Aqaba are still vulnerable to other stresses like pollution.\n“Local disturbances, such as local oil pollution, nutrients from fish farms, herbicides from gardening, may reduce the exceptionally high tolerance of the Gulf of Aqaba Reefs,” says Fine.\n“This reef should receive international recognition as a natural site of great importance, because it might very well be one of the last reefs standing at the end of this century,” says Anders Meibom of EPFL. “I would like to encourage the countries around the Gulf of Aqaba – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel – to get together and create a strong protection environmental program, because even if these corals are resistant to rising water temperatures, they are still sensitive to local pollution, overfishing etc, and they need to be protected from this now.”\nScientists Anders Meibom (left) of EPFL/ UNIL and Maoz Fine of Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel.", "summary": "Coral reefs in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures.

{"id": 514, "text": "When used in very large quantities in drinking water, chlorine presents significant risks to public health. As well as neutralizing the pathogens found in water, chlorine reacts with the natural organic matter and produces a variety of disinfection by-products (DBPs).\nThe discovery of a potential link between DBPs and an increased rate of miscarriages and bladder cancers has led to the implementation of stricter regulations, as well as changes in the design of water-treatment systems during the last decade.\nThese concerns, added to the risks involved in the storage of chlorine in gaseous form, have recently persuaded many sewage or water-treatment stations to partially stop using chlorine for the disinfection of water. Many systems are now using chloramine instead.\nHowever, as described by Urs von Gunten (School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering at EPFL and EAWAG) and David L. Sedlak (University of California) , a series of recent studies suggests that this change from chlorine to chloramine has led to unexpected consequences that present risks to public health and the environment. It was discovered that monochloramine can form NDMA, a substance that has proved to be much more toxic than the “traditional elements” formed by chlorine.\nThe risks of chlorine\n“This problem affects mainly the U.S.”, explains Urs von Gunten “as the use of monochloramine is illegal in Switzerland. What’s more, in Switzerland the water is often pumped directly from the water-table, and is distributed without chlorine.\"\nIn particular, they apply to the protection of drinking-water sources, the appropriate treatment of water, and the maintenance of distribution networks . These measures enable the authorities to minimize the presence of chlorine, or to avoid its presence altogether.\nUrs von Gunten also raises the issue of the different levels of acceptance in the population. In Switzerland, the taste of chlorine causes suspicion and complaints from the public. “In the U.S. it’s the opposite,” he explains. “If drinking water doesn’t taste of chlorine, people are concerned!”\nThis specialist of drinking-water treatment notes a rather diversified situation in Europe: “The application of standards differs from one country to another. In Switzerland, Germany and Austria the use of chlorine as a disinfectant for water is avoided as far as possible. In Spain, however, it is used a lot, and France is somewhere in between.\nConsidering the risks that the use of chlorine presents to public health, Urs von Gunten offers this conclusion: “The solution can be found in a rigorous regulation that protects drinking water resources, that guarantee clean disinfection, and that maintain distribution systems - these measures would avoid using large quantities of chlorine as a disinfectant and avoid the unpleasant odors, tastes, and health risks that accompany it.”", "summary": "Disinfection using chlorine has played an important role in the supply of drinking water, but its use also involves some risk.

{"id": 515, "text": "The “deep artificial composer”, or “DAC” for short, generates brand-new melodies that imitate traditional folk music of Irish or Klezmer origin. It does so without plagiarising already existing ones, since melodies it writes are as original as those produced by a human composer. The results were presented in April at this year’s edition of the .\nThe DAC actually produces musical scores of melodies, symbolic music written using notation, and does not generate audio files. “The deep artificial composer can produce complete melodies, with a beginning and an end, that are completely novel and that share features that we relate to style,” says EPFL scientists Florian Colombo who developed the artificial intelligence under the guidance of Wulfram Gerstner, director of the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory.\nColombo continues, “To my knowledge, this is the first time that an artificial neural network model has produced entire and convincing melodies. We also provide a new tool to evaluate the originality of a piece.”\nAlgorithmic music composition was first suggested in the literature by English mathematician Ada Lovelace in the 19\nth\n century, requiring an “Analytical Machine” which could be programmed to solve even the most complex problems, like writing music. The computational power of modern computers and the sheer amount of digitized musical scores are now making automatic music composition a reality.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is already capable of composing symbolic music and is often based on implementing music theory. What’s new with the DAC is that the AI learns to compose complete melodies without any music theory from start to finish, solely based on a large database of existing music. No human postproduction is necessary.\nExtracting music style with probabilities\nEPFL’s deep artificial composer avoids traditional music theory altogether. Each style of music has its own set of rules, and existing AI generated music often uses the Western musical language of harmony and counterpoint. In fact, the EPFL algorithm determines its own composition rules by extracting probability distributions from existing melodies using neural networks, requiring only the computation power of graphic cards that can speed up calculations by a factor of ten compared to standard computers.\nThe DAC extracts the style of the music by learning how a given piece of music transitions from one note to the next, and calculates the probability of the next note’s pitch and duration. The algorithm then trains on multiple scores of music, of any given style, in order to improve its ability to correctly predict the pitch and duration of the upcoming note.\nOnce the training is complete, which means that the predictive performance of the deep artificial composer has reached its target value, set at 50% successful pitches and 80% successful durations, it no longer needs to be trained and can be used to generate new melodies, one note at a time. The deep artificial composer builds a string of notes from beginning to end, including the very first note and the length of the composition, that resembles melodies of the dataset that was used for the training. Listen to a  based on Irish and Klezmer melodies and interpreted by Colombo on the cello.\nOf course, the DAC can compose melodies before the training process is complete, but this leads to , even to the untrained ear. It can also be trained beyond the target value, but the generated pieces tend to resemble existing compositions. The DAC can also determine itself if the composition is original enough by comparing phrases of notes with existing patterns in its database of melodies. Similarly, the algorithm can determine the musical genre – Irish or Klezmer folk in this case – of the generated scores.\nThe generated music is not limited to Irish or Klezmer traditional folk music: any style of music could be used. It just so happens that many Irish and Klezmer melodies are already digitized and easily accessible.\nInsight into the human brain\nThe computing power behind the artificial intelligence is an artificial neural network, known as “long short-term memory” and invented twenty years ago at the IDSIA in Lugano. It has already proven useful for speech recognition and is widely used by the largest software companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.\n“The success of the deep artificial composer provides insight into how the human brain works,” says Gerstner. “Neural networks with memory spanning different time scales are needed to successfully create music, implying that the ability of the human brain to retain information, even after a long period of time, is key to composing music.”\nFor Colombo and Gerstner, the work is preliminary since the DAC is limited to single voice compositions. In the long-run, Colombo hopes to generate a score for an entire orchestra.", "summary": "A deep-learning algorithm developed by EPFL scientists can generate melodies that imitate a given style of music.

{"id": 516, "text": "Before cell division, the long strings of the cell’s DNA are wrapped tightly into the structures we know as chromosomes. This protects the cell’s genetic material from physical and chemical damage.\nThe ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. These are specialized structures that have to be replicated with each cell division cycle. But the complete replication of telomeres up to the very ends of chromosomes also requires specialized mechanisms, and these are limited. Telomeres are also very sensitive to oxidative damage, which affects their ability to replicate.\nBecause of this, telomeres shrink over time, limiting the lifespan of cells. Telomere shortening is essentially the cause of cell aging.\nNow,  and Wareed Ahmed at EPFL have discovered two antioxidant enzymes that work together to prevent oxidation of telomeric DNA at chromosome ends. The scientists disrupted both the enzymes, called PRDX1 and MTH1, in cancer cells, and found that the cells’ telomeres shrunk with every round of cell division, eventually disappearing altogether.\nOne of the promising targets in cancer therapy is the enzyme telomerase. Normally, telomerase prevents telomeres from shortening in germ and stem cells, which helps with development. But telomerase is also highly active in cancer cells, keeping their telomeres intact and making the cells virtually immortal. The new work shows that disrupting PRDX1 and MTH1 prevents telomerase from counteracting telomere shortening.\nSo far, attempts to efficiently block telomerase in cancer have not been fruitful in the clinic. The discovery of the co-operating enzymes opens up a new opportunity to indirectly block telomerase. “Instead of inhibiting the enzyme itself, we target its substrate – the chromosome end – making it un-extendable by telomerase,” says Lingner.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have identified two enzymes that protect chromosomes from oxidative damage and shortening.

In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nThe School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.\nThe font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge.

{"id": 518, "text": "Many phenomena occurring in nature and industry happen very quickly: a tear running through a piece of fabric, a rubber ball bouncing off a hard floor, a drop of water wetting a dry surface and a piece of scotch tape peeling off, for example. Capturing images of these phenomena would help scientists better understand them, but conventional cameras aren’t fast enough – and high-speed cameras are prohibitively expensive. \nBut scientists at EPFL’s , working in association with Harvard University researchers in the , have developed a new imaging method called Virtual Frame Technique (VFT) that can generate thousands of images of these phenomena as they occur step by step, using a photo taken from any kind of device, including a smartphone. What’s more, VFT has been shown to perform better than high-speed cameras. \nWorking with a conventional photo\nThe method starts by analyzing a conventional photo. “If you use a regular camera to take a picture of a drop of water hitting a dry surface, the water’s movement will cause the picture to be blurry. But these blurred areas are precisely where the phenomenon is taking place, both spatially and temporally. That’s what our technique uses to piece together the underlying phenomenon,” says John Kolinski, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. In other words, VFT works by deconstructing the blurry parts of pictures. \nA method for binary phenomena\nThe first step is to shine light on the phenomenon just as the conventional picture is taken, so that the blurry parts can be exploited. “This initial illumination step must be done correctly so that the blurry parts of the picture contain the right information and can be used. At this point the object must have a quantifiable instantaneous state of either completely blocking the light or completely letting it through,” says Kolinski. The next step is to employ advanced image-processing methods to improve the conventional picture’s temporal resolution and specific illumination scheme, and then turn it into a binary image – that is, containing either black or white pixels. \nThis method offers an advantage because many natural phenomena are binary; for example, a piece of fabric is either torn or it isn’t, a surface is either wet or dry. That means only two greyscale values are necessary to depict them – no need for the 15,000+ intensity values available with conventional cameras. By sacrificing the ability to resolve intensity, the scientists were able to use the camera sensor’s bit depth, or the amount of information the sensor can obtain, to increase the frame rate while retaining full spatial resolution. Temporal resolution can be improved even further by adjusting the timing of a light pulse.\nTime-lapse photos over extremely short periods \nVFT therefore breaks down a conventional photo of an object in rapid motion into thousands of images that show every step of the process. “It’s like taking time-lapse photos of a nearly instantaneous phenomenon,” says Kolinski. The scientists tested their technique on pictures taken by all kinds of devices, from smartphones to sophisticated professional cameras, and found that it consistently resulted in a faster frame rate. While careful illumination is required, the method is quite general, and has been used to record a rich variety of phenomena, from droplet impacts to fracture mechanics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a new image-processing method that can capture extremely rapid phenomena using any type of camera.

{"id": 521, "text": "Decision-making has gathered immense interest in fields like psychology, neuroscience, robotics and even economics, with numerous models and software simulating the human mind. However, such models are limited to a type of decision-making that focuses only on each decision step in isolation, without taking into account the preceding decisions leading up to it, although the latter is often our everyday experience. Publishing in \nPLoS One\n, scientists from EPFL and the University of Berne have perfected a model that can simulate this type of decision-making and learning conditions with surprising accuracy.\nDecisions, feedback, learning\nDecision-making comes in two major into two types: Markovian and non-Markovian, named after the mathematician Andrey Markov (1856-1922). Simply put, in Markovian decision-making, the next decision step depends entirely on the current state of affairs. For example, when playing backgammon, the next move depends only on the current layout of the board, and not on how it got to be like that. This relatively straightforward process has been extensively modeled in computers and machines.\nNon-Markovian decision-making is more complex. Here, the next step is affected by other factors, such as external constraints and previous decisions. For example, a person’s goal might be to travel on the train. But what will happens when he arrives at the door to the train depends on whether or not he has previously visited the ticket booth to buy a ticket. In other words, the next step depends on how he got there; without a ticket, he cannot proceed to the desired goal. In neuroscience, the “buy-ticket” step is referred to as a “switch-state”.\nA new model of decision-making\nA team led by Michael Herzog at EPFL and Walter Senn at the University of Berne developed the first biologically plausible model that can handle non-Markovian decision-making. Herzog’s group has now tested it with humans as well as various computer models. The model, developed in a previous study, was now validated with two distinct tests, designed by Aaron Michael Clarke and Elisa Tartaglia in Herzog’s lab. The tests were performed by human subjects, and three computer models with different degrees of learning ability. In addition, the test were also taken by an advanced brain model called a “spiking neuron network”, which makes decisions based on whether the majority of neurons in a population fired a signal, or “spike”, and simulates human performance in a very realistic manner.\nThe first experiment tested the impact of the switch-state on people’s decision-making and learning. Users played a computer game where they had to navigate through eight icons (a gun, a car etc.) to finally reach the end goal (called “Yeah!”). Each icon came with three buttons, each leading down a different route, and the user had to decide which one to take. Although there was a relatively short route from the first icon to the goal, it was impossible to go through it unless the user first went through a switch-state icon – an image of a computer. Users repeated the experiment multiple times, becoming increasingly better at deciding which routes to pick. For example, most people took over 80 clicks to get to the goal when they began, but after 40 games, they needed fewer than ten.\nThe second experiment tested how delayed feedback affects decision-making and learning. Here, users were shown a set of experimental images and told that each image belonged to either category one or category two. Each category corresponded to either the left or the right arrow on the keyboard, but the participants were not told which arrow went with which image beforehand. Next, the users were shown each image one at a time, and had to press either the left or right arrow depending on the category of each icon. In response, the screen produce a RIGHT or WRONG feedback message. As the test went on, the feedback became delayed, to the point where feedback from one icon would come after the feedback for the next icon had appeared.\nDecision dynamics\nThe results of the study drew three major conclusions. First, that human decision-making can perform just as well as current sophisticated computer models under non-Markovian conditions, such as the presence of a switch-state. This is a significant finding in our current efforts to model the human brain and develop artificial intelligence systems.\nSecondly, that delayed feedback significantly impairs human decision-making and learning, even though it does not impact the performance of computer models, which have perfect memory. In the second experiment, it took human participants ten times more attempts to correctly recall and assign arrows to icons. Feedback is a crucial element of decision-making and learning. We set a goal, make a decision about how to achieve it, act accordingly, and then find out whether or not our goal was met. In some cases, e.g. learning to ride a bike, feedback on every decision we make for balancing, pedaling, braking etc. is instant: either we stay up and going, or we fall down. But in many other cases, such as playing backgammon, feedback is significantly delayed; it can take a while to find out if each move has led us to victory or not.\nFinally, the researchers found that the spiking neurons model matches and describes human performance very well. The significance of this cannot be overstated, as non-Markovian decision-making has proven to be very challenging for computer models. “This is a proof-of-concept study,” says Michael Herzog. “But the study makes an important contribution toward understanding, and accurately modeling, the human brain – and even surpassing its abilities with artificial intelligence.”\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute with the University of Berne. \nReference\n Clarke AM, Friedrich J, Tartaglia EM, Marchesotti S, Senn W, Herzog MH. \nHuman and Machine Learning in Non-Markovian Decision Making.\nPLoS One\n 21 April 2015. 10(4): e0123105.

Inset shows a scanning electron micrograph of the drum. The top membrane of the drum is suspended only 50nm (1/2000th of the diameter of hair) above a metal plate. This is then used to manipulate and amplify microwaves in the quantum regime. Credit: N. R. Bernier ​​ and L. D. Tóth (EPFL).​\nIn a recent experiment at EPFL, a microwave resonator, a circuit that supports electric signals oscillating at a resonance frequency, is coupled to the vibrations of a metallic micro-drum. By actively cooling the mechanical motion close to the lowest energy allowed by quantum mechanics, the micro-drum can be turned into a quantum reservoir – an environment that can shape the states of the microwaves. The findings are published as an  in \nNature Physics\n.\nLászló Dániel Tóth, Nathan Bernier, and Dr Alexey Feofanov led the research effort in , with support from Dr Andreas Nunnenkamp, a theorist at the University of Cambridge, UK.\nMicrowaves are electromagnetic waves, just like visible light, but with a frequency that is four orders of magnitude smaller. Microwaves form the backbone of several everyday technologies, from microwave ovens and cellular phones to satellite communication, and have recently gained further importance in manipulating quantum information in superconducting circuits — one of the most promising candidates to realize future quantum computers.\nThe micro-drum, only 30 microns in diameter, 100 nanometers thick and fabricated in the Center of MicroNanotechnology (CMi) at EPFL, constitutes the top plate of a capacitor in a superconducting microwave resonator. The drum’s position modulates the resonator’s resonance frequency and, conversely, a voltage across the capacitor exerts a force on the micro-drum. Through this bidirectional interaction, energy can be exchanged between mechanical vibrations and the microwave oscillations in the superconducting circuit.\nIn the experiment, the micro-drum is first cooled close to its lowest energy quantum level by a suitably tuned microwave tone. Every microwave photon (a quantum of light) carries away the energy of a phonon (a quantum of mechanical motion) such that the mechanical energy is reduced. This cooling process increases the dissipation and turns the micro-drum into a dissipative reservoir for the microwave resonator.\nBy tuning the interactions between the cavity and the cooled micro-drum, which is now an environment for the microwaves, the cavity can be turned into a microwave amplifier. The most interesting aspect of this amplification process is the added noise, that is, how much random, unwanted fluctuations are added to the amplified signal.\nAlbeit counter-intuitive, quantum mechanics dictates that this added noise cannot be suppressed completely, even in principle. The amplifier realized in the EPFL experiment operates very close to this limit, therefore it is as “quiet” as it can be. Interestingly, in a different regime, the micro-drum turns the microwave resonator into a maser (or microwave laser).\n“There has been a lot of research focus on bringing mechanical oscillators into the quantum regime in the past few years.” says Dr. Alexey Feofanov, postdoctoral researcher on the project. “However, our experiment is one of the first which actually shows and harnesses their capabilities for future quantum technologies.”\nLooking ahead, this experiment enables novel phenomena in cavity optomechanical systems like noiseless microwave routing or microwave entanglement. Generally, it proves that mechanical oscillators can be a useful resource in the rapidly growing field of quantum science and engineering.\nFuture activities on the emerging research possibilities created by this work will be supported by two recently started EC Horizon 2020 projects:  and , both coordinated at EPFL.\nThe project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, NCCR QSIT, and the European Union iQUOEMS.

{"id": 523, "text": "“I was really surprised, when doing this research, to find that 50% of spin-outs don’t necessarily establish themselves near the parent company,” observes EPFL professor Christopher Tucci. In an article appearing this summer in the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, he demonstrated that new companies often also choose to set up shop thousands of kilometers, or even continents, away from their parent companies. He looked at U.S.-based international companies specializing in hard disk technology, drawing upon a database of information on 400 U.S. counties. Tucci is familiar with these constant changes taking place in the business environment, because he has been studying them for many years. So why do these companies choose to either stay close to home or head for the horizon?\nWhy stay? \n In the early 2000s, the so-called “agglomeration theory” from evolutionary economics hypothesized that an entrepreneur always chooses to stay in proximity to the parent company, in order to tap into group advantages. This decision allows a new company working in the same sector to benefit from the stability and solidity of the parent company and from on-site provider and client networks. “Our study shows that companies who choose not to move away have more aggressive strategies, and to succeed, they need to maintain local relationships. We also found that those who decide to stay within a restricted perimeter are technologically much more advanced than other spin-outs, but financially quite similar,” Tucci adds.\nWhy move away?\n Companies who decide to leave aren’t banking on technological innovation, but instead are looking for new markets. “Thanks to this study, we now understand better how spin-outs position themselves in the market. In both cases, the companies from which they have spun out often become their principal clients.”\n Another theory, not confirmed by the study, is the “spillover” theory. It hypothesizes that stronger companies don’t want to establish spin-outs in industrial clusters because of “spillovers:” they fear that their ideas or technologies will spill over and be stolen by neighboring competitors. “But this effect can’t be clearly seen from the database we used in this research,” notes Tucci. \n He also observed that the spin-outs that stay typically generate new spin-outs themselves. Tucci points to the case of IBM: “Almost all the big hard disk companies came from IBM.” Its first spin-out was Seagate Technology, created in 1978 by Al Shugart and Finis Conner, a company that manufactured embedded hard disks in Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox. It set up R&D sites in Silicon Valley and then branched out to Northern Ireland and Singapore. Interestingly enough it has also, in turn, generated several spin-outs of its own.", "summary": "Research at EPFL’s Chair of Corporate Strategy and Innovation has shown that contrary to what was thought from previous studies, spin-outs don’t systematically set up shop near their parent companies.

They assembled the first mathematical models of the airplane, combining expertise from almost 15 laboratories and providing a first global picture. They also worked on aspects like flight simulators, solar cell technology, motor optimization, and man-machine interfaces with the participation of 20 laboratories. As Solar Impulse lands in New York, this fruitful collaboration continues with studies that address turbulence during take-off and landing, models of composite materials, and pilot well-being under strenuous flight conditions.\nValidating the Dream\nEPFL set the scientific framework of this solar powered airplane back in 2003 as the official scientific partner to Solar Impulse. The first report preferred a plane to the alternate proposal of a Zeppelin, suggesting a wingspan of approximately 70 meters and a weight of 1800 kg – close to the 63.5 meter, 1600 kg HB-SIA plane that just landed at JFK International Airport. This very first model was established by Pierre-Olivier Moix at the Industrial Electronics Laboratory. In close collaboration with André Borschberg, who would later become CEO, co-founder and pilot of Solar Impulse, Moix combined a set of components into a single mathematical model and found that a solar-powered plane could fly around the world.\nTo build this model, technical specifications were provided by EPFL scientists on components such as motor propeller optimization, energy generation and management, composite materials and multi-functional solar skins. Scientist Alfio Quarteroni and collaborators later extended this model for efficient design of a solar airplane using advanced mathematics. The same methodology was used to design the yacht Alinghi, which won the America’s Cup in 2003 and 2007.\nMonitoring the Pilots During Strenuous Flights\nTechnology to monitor the vital signs of the Solar Impulse pilots is currently being developed at EPFL. The pilots were already monitored during a 72-hour flight simulation in 2012. Researcher David Atienza and collaborators developed the most clinically accurate, portable device – conveniently built into T-shirts or sleek chest-bands — to monitor heart rates and detect irregularities in real time. Based on EEG signals, researcher José del R. Millán and collaborators measured the mental awareness and sleep patterns of the pilots throughout the three days and three nights of flight. They also tested the cognitive performance of the pilots and, more specifically, how well they perceived their own mental aptitude several times during the flight.\nThe advice and technology provided by EPFL scientists has guided Solar Impulse throughout its adventure, and it has stimulated valuable research at EPFL.

Indeed, , who leads the Data Science Lab () in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, believes that it’s going to take more than statements from scientists to communicate the facts of the COVID-19 situation, and to encourage  like frequent hand-washing and social distancing.\n“There is a very human aspect to facts; it’s not just about the facts themselves, but about how people understand them,” says West, who is also a member of the UNIL-EPFL Center for Digital Humanities ().\n“When you go from scientific papers to social media, audiences don’t have the same background, and we need to understand how they read these kinds of information. That’s something many scientists don’t care much about, and it’s where digital humanities research can really play a role.”\nChoosing a messenger\nWest describes an ongoing research project, funded through the Collaborative Research on Science and Society () program, which underscores the importance of understanding how people understand data, especially when it comes to controversial or risk-laden issues. He and his colleagues set out to understand how people’s opinions on four hot-button topics – climate change, abortion, vaccination and immigration – were swayed based on the statements of celebrity spokespeople.\nThe researchers randomly mixed and matched real statements with real celebrities, to test their hypothesis that statements attributed to known and respected spokespeople had more influence than those from unknown or disliked sources. Study subjects also read statements attributed to an “expert”, who unbeknownst to them was made up by the researchers.\n“We expected experts to have a bigger effect on changing opinions than disliked celebrities, but our preliminary results actually show that experts have the least impact, and that their statements can even backfire. I think this is one example of how digital humanities can help in this crisis, because it can help shape the strategies we use to educate the public.”\nThree tips from a data scientist\n EPFL professor Robert West offers some advice for how to navigate COVID-19 data without falling victim to false information, whether from fake news or simple misinterpretation.\nCheck the sources of data interpretations…and of the data itself. \n“I think it’s obvious advice, but even I have to remind myself of it, because as humans we have an innate hunger for sensational news,” West says. In addition to looking for reputable sources (universities and respected news outlets top social media, for example), he advises always reading graph and infographic captions carefully. Since different countries have different approaches to collecting epidemiological data and testing for COVID-19, their numbers aren’t always comparable.\nRead the axis labels. \nCheck to see if graphs are linear or , as this makes a big difference when it comes to understanding exponential growth.\nKeep perspective. \nBear in mind that data on the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing. “What we’re seeing online reflects events that are unfolding in real time, and what we read today may be different tomorrow,” West says.", "summary": "With the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a race against the clock to implement science-based measures to protect society’s most vulnerable populations.

Since then, it has become stronger, more flexible, more resistant and standardized across the industry, and it can be prefabricated. The time has now come to bring the process for pouring concrete into the digital era, moving away from forms and towards 3D printing. That’s the idea that Agnès Petit, the founder of the startup Mobbot, used to win over the jury and walk away with the 2018 Isabelle Musy Award.\nAfter graduating from ETH Zurich with a PhD in cosmochemistry, Petit began working for concrete producer Holcim and then joined Creabeton, a manufacturer of concrete structures. “The wooden forms typically used for pouring concrete are too stiff and can’t be used to make customized shapes quickly and cheaply. And forms made using 3D-printing require a lot of raw materials and generate significant amounts of waste,” says Petit. That’s what prompted her – backed by ten years of experience in the concrete industry – to found Mobbot, short for “mobile robot.” Her idea was to create a small, easily portable robot that could work directly at construction sites and build concrete objects using 3D printing. The robot would be programmed to extrude (rather than pour) the concrete according to the exact dimensions at the site and take into account any special configurations or obstacles.\n3D printing of concrete versus formwork\n“Typically an architect drafts blueprints on paper and gives them to a construction company, which in turn makes 2D diagrams of the wooden forms needed to \npour the concrete. That eats up a lot of time and resources, and generally the forms have to be adjusted on site anyway. My idea was to eliminate all these steps and deposit the concrete directly, without having to create diagrams or forms,” says Petit. Her system can calculate the exact dimensions of concrete structures that need to be built using a scanner that generates a “cloud” of points in three dimensions; these points are then fed to a computer program that guides the robot’s arm as it deposits the concrete, much like a 3D printer would do if it was making chocolate.\nThe main challenge is to end up with concrete just as smooth as if it had been poured into a mold. The concrete mixture needs to be viscous enough that droplets can be deposited without running. However, the secret doesn’t lie only in the concrete composition, which should be as simple and conventional as possible, but also in the depositing system. And here Petit is keeping her novel design under wraps, and has filed for a patent to protect it.\nThe Isabelle Musy Award, established in 2014, recognizes outstanding women entrepreneurs in the fields of science and technology.

Before a panel of international judges, forty finalists in three categories presented their projects that use new technologies for social purposes.\nInspired by insects, the flying machine is not afraid of collisions. Instead, it bounces off of obstacles thanks to a small spherical cage that surrounds it. “The idea is that the body of the robot remains in equilibrium after a collision, so that it can maintain its trajectory,” explains the start-up CTO Adrien Briod in previous article on the EPFL website. “It can be sent to hard-to-reach locations during a disaster, for example to film the environment with its onboard camera and provide valuable information to rescuers.” Based in EPFL’s Innovation Park, Flyability was founded in 2014 as a spin-off of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and the NCCR Robotics.\nAccording to company CEO Patrick Thévoz, the prize, which was awarded in the presence of the Ruler of Dubai, will enable the drone to clear a path towards commercialization.

The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.\nEPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).\nEPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.\nHowever, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants. This restriction was temporarily lifted on 15 September 2014.\nThis grace period will end on 9 February 2017. Swiss researchers can therefore still respond to calls for proposals whose deadline falls before that date.\nEPFL H2020 Advanced Grants\nSmit, Berend – MaGic\nThe Materials Genome in Action\nIt is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

Two factors – price and journey time – have long determined how commuters choose to get to work. But much has changed in the past 25 years. According to an EPFL survey covering Greater Geneva, commuters are now more concerned about how they spend their travel time. The research provides detailed insights into the transport habits of the area’s workers, breaking down the findings according to people’s place of residence, age, educational attainment, and more.\nResearchers at EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LASUR), working under the direction of Professor Vincent Kaufmann, commissioned a telephone survey of a representative sample of the working-age population of Greater Geneva – a sprawling conurbation of 209 municipalities with a population of one million people, around 50% of whom live in Geneva Canton itself, 40% in the neighboring French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie, and 10% in the Nyon region (in Vaud Canton).\nDriving falling further out of favor\nThe 2018 survey, which followed similar exercises in 1994 and 2011, sampled around 2,100 people living within 500 meters of a public transport stop or 800 meters of a train station. The findings point to declining attitudes towards driving over time. In 1994, just 12% of respondents associated the car with negative adjectives such as “polluting” and “expensive”; in 2018, that number rose to 33%. Conversely, the image of public transportation is improving, albeit slowly: 50% of those surveyed in 2018 described it in positive terms (compared with 39% in 1994), while only 38% used negative descriptors (46% in 1994). Long journey times seem to be the main barrier to greater enthusiasm for public transportation, although the 15 December opening of the Léman Express – a commuter rail network with expected commercial speeds of around 50 km/h – should go some way to enhancing its image. Respondents were generally more effusive when asked about walking and cycling, although many urban commuters said that traveling by bike was dangerous.\nA promising future for cycling\nThe 2018 survey produced a wealth of insights for the researchers – not least the fact that Greater Geneva’s working-age population has embraced multimodal transport with open arms. Car, motorcycle and scooter owners are no longer wedded to their vehicles, with most reporting a willingness to use a different mode of transport instead. Indeed, the majority of commuters living across the border in France said they would be happy to leave their vehicle at home if viable alternatives were available.\nThe findings also highlighted the extent to which commuters – most of whom now have smartphones and other internet-enabled devices – are keen to make the most of their journey time. Other important considerations include convenience, efficiency and CO\n2\n emissions. According to the researchers, the priorities for transport planners are clear: pay special attention to transit hubs, make public transportation as convenient as possible, and introduce more attractive fare options for occasional users.\nThe latest survey was the first of its kind to include commuters living in France – and it underscored how a shortage of other options leaves them with little choice but to take the car. What’s more, relatively abundant parking in Geneva city center and the inner suburbs provides yet more incentive for people to drive to work. The researchers recommend a series of measures to address this problem, including stepping up parking enforcement and restricting parking on private land in areas with good public transportation links.", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have carried out an in-depth survey of commuter practices in Greater Geneva – the area covering Geneva Canton, the Nyon region and neighboring parts of France.", "claim": "Researchers at French have carried out an in-depth survey of commuter practices in Greater Geneva – the area covering Geneva Canton, the Nyon region and neighboring parts of France.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 2], "noise": false}

High-precision technology is used in numerous space instruments, EPFL’s CleanSpace One satellite project is aimed at one day cleaning up space debris, and Swiss chocolate has now been sent into space. Each of the six astronauts* currently serving on the International Space Station (ISS) has received a box with six brand-name chocolate bars. They were included in the latest resupply mission, which was carried by a SpaceX rocket launched on 8 April. The special delivery, sponsored by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), was carefully prepared by the Swiss Space Center (SSC), at EPFL. As a thank you, the British astronaut Tim Peake sent a picture yesterday.\n“This initiative was undertaken as part of Switzerland’s co-presidency of the European Space Agency Ministerial Council,” said Volker Gass, the director of the SSC. “The aim is to encourage and support the astronauts in their work in a symbolic way that reflects our country’s spirit and culture.”\nBut sending food into space is no cakewalk. As for any object or person preparing to leave Earth’s atmosphere, strict conditions must be met. In the end, it took six months for the chocolates, which were packaged last September, to finally get off the ground. While the launch was delayed several times since the start of the year, the chocolates also had to undergo the full gamut of checks and tests.\nRecipe revealed\nFirst, the proposal had to be approved by the European Space Agency (ESA).

The weight of the boxes had to be minimized as well, which was done by removing all unnecessary paper and cardboard. And the manufacturer had to provide a full and detailed list of ingredients, thus revealing part of its trade secret.\nNo sharp corners\nThe boxes were then sent to the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), in the Netherlands, whose work includes testing satellites and their sub-systems by simulating the conditions they will experience when launched and once in space.\n“All objects going to the ISS have to undergo testing to ensure they are not flammable, do not produce fragments that could spread around the cabin, and cannot injure the astronauts,” said Bernd Rattenbacher, from the Center of Competence in Aerospace Biomedical Science & Technology at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\nESTEC’s main task was to ensure that the boxes did not have any sharp corners or edges presenting a risk of injury. Once approved, the boxes were sent to the Aerospace Logistics Technology Engineering Company (ALTEC), another ESA center, in Italy. There, the contents of the package were verified and the customs documentation was completed. The package was finally sent to NASA, which delivered it to the ISS from the Cape Canaveral launch site in Florida.\nThe latest word was that it took 10 days after launch for the chocolates to reach the hands of the astronauts, who were busy unpacking three tons of food, equipment and scientific experiments included in the latest resupply mission.

{"id": 534, "text": "One day, a virtual version of your own heart pumping may help doctors diagnose heart disease and determine the best treatment for you, without the need of surgical intervention or other invasive clinical practices. EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni’s goal is precisely this as he builds mathematical tools to simulate heart function with increasing accuracy and that can be personalized to your heart based on medical scans. He recently added the behavior of a patient-specific aortic valve to his overall functioning heart model. The results are published June 7th in \nBiomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology\n.\nA personalized virtual heart for preventing cardiovascular disease\nThe human heart is an extraordinarily complex organ that pumps an estimated 180 million liters of blood, which would fill more than seven Olympic-sized swimming pools in one’s lifetime, thereby ensuring that oxygenated blood reaches the entire body. Cardiovascular problems may lead to malfunction, disease, or death. Heart disease causes 40% of deaths in the EU and costs an estimated 196 billion a year, yet 80% of acquired heart diseases and stroke episodes are preventable.\nQuarteroni aims to help prevent or treat cardiovascular disease by providing a personalized virtual heart to patients, essentially a detailed mathematical description of a patient’s heart and how it functions – or malfunctions.\nEvery person’s heart is unique. Correctly modeling the intricacies of each individual heart therefore requires a customizable mathematical description of both its geometry and its dynamics. But doing so in a mathematically sound way is no easy task; it requires large amounts of patient-specific data and computational power to solve complex equations. Thanks to increasingly powerful computers, building a realistic virtual heart is becoming a reality.\nHow to build a virtual aortic valve\nIn constructing a virtual heart that is complete and functional, the aortic valve cannot be neglected. Quarteroni and his team recently added to their heart model the way blood flows from inside the heart into the aorta, taking into account the complex shapes and properties of the aorta’s physiological membranes: the valve leaflets.\n“A mathematical description of the aortic valve and its interaction with blood flow exists in the literature, but not at this level of detail for a specific patient,” says Quarteroni.\nFrom MRI scans of a patient, they reconstructed the shape of the aorta, which they represented using a 3D computational mesh. Using mathematical tools to characterize the mechanics of the valve, they described the movement of three triangular-shaped leaflets that make up the aortic valve. To determine how blood flows inside of the atria, the heart’s cavities, they next approximated and numerically solved the mathematical equations (Navier-Stokes) that describe viscous fluid dynamics, adapting them for a patient-specific geometry. Even with this preliminary work, it is a relatively easy task to personalize the model to another patient by using a new set of MRI scans.\nAs the director of iHeart, an EU-funded project, Quarteroni’s long-term vision is to build patient-specific virtual models of the entire cardiovascular system, including the heart, all of the body’s blood vessels, and of the approximately five liters of blood flowing through the body. \n“If successful, \niHeart \nwill help clinicians to tackle important questions efficiently, both in diagnostics and treatment, with a tremendous impact for society,” says Quarteroni. “It will provide a unique, unprecedented research environment for exploring the heart with an immensely powerful and non–invasive mathematical microscope, making it possible to simulate cardiovascular disease, like carotid stenosis and aneuryisms that can affect the heart, the abdomen, the brain and other parts the body.”\nQuarteroni believes that a personalized virtual heart model may become clinically available in less than a decade. Earlier prototypes of the virtual model may be developed and tested sooner, possibly within a five-year horizon. This will require significant investment in the development of robust mathematical and numerical tools to simulate heart function that is tailored to a specific patient.", "summary": "EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni and his team are building a virtual heart model based on personalized medical images that may one day help cardiologists and cardiac surgeons non-invasively diagnose pathological heart conditions.

{"id": 535, "text": "Katie Bouman was one of 200 scientists who helped create the first-ever image of a black hole, released this past April. The 30-year old researcher, who was recently named an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), came to speak at EPFL’s Open Science Day. Martin Vetterli took advantage of that opportunity to sit down with her and ask her a few questions about their field of shared interest.\nMV: “It’s pretty unusual for someone to become a star researcher at such a young age. How did you get into science?\nKB: I was very interested in science as a kid. When I was in third grade, I remember looking under rocks all the time. And as I got older, I was constantly drawn to the different science topics covered in class. In sixth grade, I first got involved in science fair projects, and I continued doing that on and off through high school. Then, when I tried out research for the first time, I was thrilled: it was so different from a homework set, where you know there’s a solution even if it’s difficult to find. Research was a new way of thinking and problem-solving for me, and I found that very exciting.\nHow did you get into computer science?\nIt wasn’t until high school, when a friend convinced me to take a computer science class. At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago. Initially, they didn’t believe their results and reran the experiment several times. Some things have changed since then, but we’re still dealing with noisy data, right?\nYes, when we first created the black-hole image, or at least the day we got the data, we entered it into an imaging script and a ring appeared. I actually went from being really excited to being mad at the colleagues who gave us the data – which I was convinced were fake. It just seemed too good to be true! Nothing ever works like that the first time. It was just so much more beautiful than any synthetic data we had created. It actually took weeks before I believed the data were real, and that our colleagues weren’t trying to trick us or test us.", "summary": "The first-ever image of a black hole was unveiled to the public this past April.

{"id": 536, "text": "Mathematician David Strütt, a scientific collaborator at EPFL, worked for four months to develop , a math video game in Minecraft, where the gamer has to find a Eulerian cycle in a graph. Minecraft is a sandbox video game released in 2011, where the gamer can build almost anything, from simple houses to complex calculators, using only cubes and fluids. These countless possibilities are what lured David Strütt into Minecraft’s universe: “the game might be first intended for kids but I was studying for my Bachelor’s degree in mathematics when I discovered it. I fell in love with the game when I realized there is all the necessary blocks to build a Turing machine inside the game. It was a long time ago, so I have since forgotten what a Turing machine is. But the gist of it is: anything is possible inside the game”.\nMatheminecraft, , is a video game around Eulerian graphs with a tutorial and four levels. The project was made for the Maths Outreach team with the idea that it should be ready for the EPFL Open days in September 2019. After the success encountered at the Open Days, it was decided that the game will be proposed to classes of the region as a series of ateliers organized by the Maths Outreach Team and the Science Outreach Departement (SPS). During 4 weeks, 36 classes of children – 8 to 10 years old– registered to visit EPFL and took part in a two hours matinée where they played Matheminecraft and did various chemistry experiments. Minecraft is a very popular game and has been described as one of the greatest games of all time. Children immediately recognize the game and a growing roar of “are we going to play Minecraft” fills the air as they enter the room. “I think Minecraft digitally plays the same role LEGOs did in my childhood. It appeals to anyone who takes a bit of their time to dive into it” speculates David.\nThe idea behind the project is the following. Consider a graph: that is a drawing on a board made of dots called vertices which are linked by lines called edges. The question that is asked about graphs is: “is it possible to cross each edge exactly once, pass by each vertex at least once, and end up at the starting vertex?”. The first mathematician to ask that question is the Swiss Leonhard Euler in 1736. Not only did he wonder about that, but he provided the answer, giving an exhaustive description of which graphs admit such a path and which don’t.\nIn the Matheminecraft atelier, we try to answer Leonhard Euler’s question. An easy way to introduce Eulerian cycles to schoolchildren is to ask them about figures or drawings that can be done without lifting the pen and going twice on the same line. Triangle, square, star, a plethora of examples comes to their minds. In Matheminecraft each level consists of a graph that admits an Eulerian cycle. The game uses graphs that are easy enough, in the following sense: an Eulerian cycle will be found if the gamers make sure they don't get stuck. Such graphs are quite easy to work with, making the game suited to grade-schoolers.\nIn the game, each vertex is represented as a large color dot and each edge as a bridge. To keep the video game spirit, and to ensure that one bridge is only crossed once, David Strütt added a \"lava condition\", meaning that bridges, once crossed, will turn into lava. That makes them unable to be crossed again. A map of the graph is there to help the children. Famous Minecraft animals were added to decorate the levels, such as skeleton horses and Mooshrooms.\nThe story of Matheminecraft will not end there, as additional levels are in preparation and new series of ateliers – organized with the SPS – will take place in 2020 and 2021 Furthermore, a Matheminecraft 2.0 will see the day. It will include Eulerian trails, where the gamer will have to choose the starting point of his cycle. This would make the game harder and suitable for older grade-schoolers.\nThe freedom offered by Minecraft gave rise to other projects in the Maths Outreach Team, as a Summer School is currently in preparation in association with the . “Of course, at some point in my childhood I wanted to become a game developer. Only later in my teens did I think I could become a mathematician. Somehow, I became both” concludes David.\nGraph theory\nThe mathematical theory behind the game is vast and well known. It’s graph theory and was first mentioned as such in 1736 by Leonhard Euler. Euler laid the foundations of graph theory in his paper about the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad in Russia). This is a famous problem related to the urban geography of the city: can we found a walk through the city that would cross each bridge once and only once.\nEuler proved that there was no solution to that problem. The graph theory gives us tools to answer our initial question: given a graph, can we visit each vertex, pass by each edge once and end up at the starting point? Let us restrict ourselves to undirected, connected, graphs, which simplifies the answer.\nIf we can answer \"yes\", the goal is reached and the graph admits an Eulerian cycle. Furthermore, the starting and ending point does not matter.\nIf the answer is \"no\", then some of the requirements are not verified. That is the case with the Königsberg bridges. But there exist graphs where we can visit each vertex, pass by each edge once but end up at a different vertex. In such cases, the graph admits an Eulerian trail or path.\nIf the mathematical proofs might not be suitable for schoolchildren, testing whether an undirected graph is Eulerian (with a cycle or a trail) is easy – depending of course on the graph at hand and one’s ability at counting. To know if a graph is Eulerian, we need to define the simple notion of degree or valency of a vertex of a graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex – in layman's terms that is the number of edges arriving (or leaving) a vertex.\nIf each vertex has an even degree then the graph admits an Eulerian cycle. If there are exactly two vertices with an odd degree then the graph admits an Eulerian trail. In the latter case, the starting and ending points are the vertices with odd degree.\nIf Matheminecraft does not cover Eulerian trails, the theory is nevertheless explained in a very mathematical way, on a blackboard – or on a whiteboard for a lack of better options.", "summary": "Using the famous computer game Minecraft, Mathematicians at EPFL have developed a video game around Eulerian Cycles.

{"id": 537, "text": "“Ouay, ask the nurse what time she’s coming.” “Ouay, tell John to go run errands.” Or “Ouay, I don’t feel well, call the nurse.” The round smart speaker developed by the student team acts on the sound of a user’s voice. And it can connect users with people outside the home – caregivers, friends or family members can send text or voice messages to Ouay through a special app and Ouay reads the messages out loud. By providing a constant connection, the system allows elderly patients to remain independent while at the same time reassuring everyone involved that help is never far away. It has already been tested by several organizations that provide home-care services to the elderly.\nToday there is a host of new systems for helping the elderly or handicapped live on their own, as well as a growing number of specially equipped apartment buildings. These developments are often motivated by the dual goals of improving patients’ lives and keeping costs down. And recent technological advancements, such as in sensors and alert systems, are supporting this trend. But the two people behind the idea for Ouay – Sven Borden, a first-year Master’s student in microengineering at EPFL, and Loïc Rochat, a student in mechanical engineering – found that there was one key element missing, based on their personal experience with elderly people. “We needed a reliable device that patients can use to easily communicate with people outside the home. That would help them feel more independent,” says Borden. They fleshed out their idea at the Zurich hackathon, a weekend-long brainstorming marathon where would-be entrepreneurs come with a business idea and draft a business plan. Once the hackathon was over, the duo took their business plan and decided to run with it.\nA reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit at EPFL \nBorden and Rochat teamed up with other students from EPFL, HEC and HE-ARC, and then spoke with local caregivers and patients in order to pinpoint their needs. “I think Ouay is a good reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit we have here at EPFL,” says Borden. The students initially set up an association to build up their network and pool their funds. Since this initial investment, Ouay has expanded its reach considerably; the student team received an XGrant (financial support that EPFL provides to student startups) as well as a CHF 20,000 FIT Digital grant from Vaud’s Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). The proceeds were used to create the prototypes that are currently being tested by home-care providers.\nHelping people fall asleep with remote hypnosis \nFor elderly patients, even minor inconveniences – like not being able to find something in their apartment or a nurse showing up late – can cause a great deal of stress. And caring for elderly patients can also cause stress for friends and family. To help alleviate these factors, Ouay has a number of useful features including alerts for taking medication, reminders for doctor’s appointments and messages that can reassure someone feeling anxious. These features work through the mobile telephone network. Jean-Luc Tuma, who heads up the local home-care group Uniquecare santé et soins à domicile, sees the clear benefits of the device, which his staff tested: “It’s an excellent way to help patients live autonomously, independently and safely.” And his staff discovered new uses for Ouay as they tried it out in real-life situations. “The most remarkable thing we’ve done so far is having a hypnotherapist use the device to help a patient fall asleep through remote hypnosis,” says Tuma. He believes Ouay will eventually become a standard tool for caregivers.\nThe students officially launched their company and want to bring in more people. They plan to seek out “motivated students aiming to become professional developers, prototype builders or electronic device designers, and give them another opportunity to work on concrete problems,” says Rochat.", "summary": "Two students from EPFL have developed a smart speaker with voice-activation technology that connects patients directly to their loved ones as well as caregivers and emergency services.

{"id": 539, "text": "Can a home run entirely on solar facades? Apparently so, according to NeighborHub, a house designed and built for the 2017 Solar Decathlon by Swiss students from EPFL, the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg (HEIA-FR), the Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD Genève) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR). With NeighborHub, the students wanted to show that it makes both practical and economic sense to install solar panels on a home’s facade – thereby maximizing the surface area put to use – even though sunlight can sometimes struggle to penetrate urban areas. “Unlike rooftops, facades are more likely to be in the shade since other buildings can block the sunlight,” says Philippe Couty, the engineer coordinating the project for HEIA-FR. “That could sharply reduce the amount of power that solar panels generate. But we wanted to show that solar energy can indeed be produced on facades, even in areas packed with a lot of buildings.” The project team went about searching for technology that could prove them right. Peter Cuony, head of solar power systems at Groupe E Connect and a member of the project team from the very beginning, came up with the idea of using power optimizers. The students found that these optimizers fit the bill perfectly, and they installed one in each panel to continuously monitor and adjust the solar panels’ performance.\nMaximizing each panel’s output\n In conventional solar power systems, the panels are connected in series, which means each one can generate only as much energy as the lowest-producing one. Power inverters, taking their cue from the least productive panel, convert the direct current into the alternating current that the home can use. But this method can be a major handicap for the efficiency of solar panels installed on building facades, since the weakest link (e.g. the most shaded panel) could pull down the entire system’s power generation. And that was exactly what happened before the power optimizers were installed on each panel. “Even if each panel has a different level of sun exposure and consequently generates a different amount of energy, the optimizers draw on the instantaneous maximum power generation of each panel, regardless of how much sunlight they do – or don’t – receive,” says Victor Saadé, an EPFL electrical engineering student who is leading the project group responsible for solar panels.\nAchieving energy independence\n Thanks to this novel way of using existing technology, NeighborHub can run entirely on the power generated from its facade-installed solar panels. It even generates more energy than it needs. What’s more, its rooftop remains free for other purposes, like promoting biodiversity – the space can be used to cultivate a variety of plants.\nThe energy independence achieved by the one-story house offers encouraging prospects for residential buildings. Each story could generate enough power for its own needs. That could be a major benefit for cities that are growing vertically.\n“Our house demonstrates that it is possible to produce enough energy for an entire building using solar panels installed only on the building facades,” says Cuony.\nNeighborHub’s open house next Saturday will give the public a unique opportunity to check out the next-generation house before it heads off to the Solar Decathlon competition, which will be held in Denver from 5 to 15 October 2017.\nNeighborHub open house at a glance\n “\nNeighborHub ready to head off to the United States\n”\n Saturday, 10 June 2017, 10am to 5pm\n Smart Living Lab, Halle bleue, blueFACTORY, Passage du Cardinal 13B, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland\n Free of charge, no sign-up required\n Learn more at\nThe project is supported by the following partners:\nThree public-sector partners: Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Canton of Fribourg, City of Fribourg and Smart Living Lab\nAnd the following private partners: Groupe E and Landolt & Cie SA, JPF-Ducret, Régent SA, La Mobilière and Setimac", "summary": "EPFL, in association with the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg, the Geneva School of Art and Design and the University of Fribourg, is taking part in the 2017 international Solar Decathlon competition.

{"id": 540, "text": "A pollen grain suspended in water appears to move about randomly; this is what is known as “Brownian Motion.” The grain is hit on all sides by water molecules, which make it quiver. At the human scale, on the contrary, a swimmer plows forward in the water by continuing to move in the direction of her propulsion; her motion is aided by the eddies that she leaves in her wake. For the first time, physicists have observed and measured the effect of these eddies at the microscopic scale. They have found that the viscosity of the water doesn’t completely inhibit the momentum that the water molecules transfer to the pollen grain. As Einstein suspected back in 1905, his formula describing Brownian motion needs to be adjusted.\nBy observing at very high speeds the shadow cast by a the particle on a detector, researchers in EPFL’s Laboratory of Complex Matter Physics were able to show, and measure, the existence of eddies formed by a particle in motion in a liquid. These tiny vortices dissipate after just five microseconds. “The rate at which the vortex dissipates depends on the size of the particle that creates it and the density and viscosity of the liquid,” explains Sylvia Jeney.\nOptical tweezers\nThe challenge was to measure the characteristics of these vortices. To do this, the physicists used what they refer to as “optical tweezers.” Using a laser, they are able to hold very small objects, such as a particle in a liquid, as if the particle was attached to the end of a spring. By measuring the vibration of the particle against the spring, they can demonstrate that the vortex increases the particle’s fluctuations. And, inversely, it is possible to determine certain properties of the particle, such as its size or shape, from the characteristics of the vortex. It’s as if one could deduce the size or shape of a swimmer’s body from the wake she leaves in the water.\nFrom biology to sensors\nThese developments hold promise for making improvements in many areas. “In biology, exchanges between the cell and its surroundings take place in a liquid medium; proteins or viruses that pass through the membrane are one example,” notes Jeney. Elsewhere, micro-sensors used in viscous media currently lack precision. They are used to test interactions in a liquid between a drug and various molecules attached to a microscaffolding. These results could help scientists improve these interactions.\nSources:\n Resonances arising from hydrodynamic memory in Brownian motion, Thomas Franosch, Matthias Grimm, Maxim Belushkin, Flavio M.

{"id": 541, "text": "Scientists from EPFL and WSL have been studying soils in oil palm cultivation for years, in an effort to develop more sustainable methods for growing this crop. Palm oil production has been criticized by environmentalists because of its large carbon footprint and negative impact on biodiversity. For instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia – the world’s two biggest producers – it has directly or indirectly caused large-scale deforestation, thereby reducing biodiversity and releasing significant amounts of CO\n2\n into the atmosphere. And planting oil palm trees in the deforested areas does not make up for the lost carbon storage capacity, according to a . \nBut the findings of a new study by EPFL and WSL – appearing today in \nScience Advances\n – indicate there may be a carbon-friendly alternative to deforestation. The scientists investigated oil palm crops that had been planted on former pastures in the Los Llanos region of Colombia, the world’s fourth-largest palm oil producer. There, large areas of pastures – which themselves had been planted in the past on savannas – were replaced by oil palm plantations 56 years ago. By calculating the crops’ carbon footprint since then, the scientists found that the total carbon storage – taking into account both vegetation and soil stocks – was unchanged relative to when the land had been used for pastures.\n“Our study is the first to look at the carbon footprint of palm oil production over the long term – that is, across two plantation cycles, since oil palm trees are replaced every 25–30 years,” says Juan Carlos Quezada, a PhD student at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS) and the study’s lead author. “It’s also the first to explore how converting pastures into oil palm farms affects soil quality and fertility over the long term, looking at all soil layers, not just the surface.”\nCarbon capture\nIn tropical climates, pastures – especially those that have been neglected and degraded – commonly consist of large grassy areas with a few small trees scattered around. Planting dense populations of oil palm trees – which can reach 15 meters in height – on these pastures can increase the carbon capture rate per unit of surface area, thanks to the palm trees’ roots, trunks and leaves, as well as the vegetation around them.\nUnder typical farming methods, oil palm trees are cut down every 25–30 years and replaced with young trees to start a new plantation cycle. As the roots and other parts of the old trees decompose, they nourish the soil and partially offset the carbon initially lost in the upper soil layer when the pastureland was converted. As a result, over the long term cultivation period, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem remains unchanged compared to the initial level before land conversion took place. \nAn alternative worth exploring \n“We should bear in mind that palm oil in and of itself is not harmful – neither to our health, when eaten in moderation, nor to the economy. And we’re not talking just about multinationals – the incomes of hundreds of small farmers in Colombia and other countries depend on it,” says Alexandre Buttler, head of ECOS and a co-author of the study. “The problem lies with the negative carbon impact and loss of biodiversity caused by deforestation. But the main palm oil producing countries have large abandoned pastures that could be converted favorably, thus limiting the massive carbon loss resulting from deforestation.” \nThis study was conducted as part of the  project, a cross-disciplinary initiative funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and led by ETH Zurich.

{"id": 542, "text": "Pharmaceuticals, energy, perfumes, polymers – all are industrially produced via chemical reactions. To carry out reactions, one needs reactors (vessels of different types and sizes ) to mix the various reagents and some catalysts, while controlling the pressure, temperature, and other parameters.\nUsually, industrial chemical reactions take place in large vessels, producing big quantities of substances. The use of these vast reactors has many drawbacks. For example, it’s difficult to obtain uniform mixing at constant temperatures, and one has to stop the process regularly to empty the reactor. Moreover, chemical reactions are often successfully performed in small reactors in the laboratory, but many problems arise in achieving the same results when the production is scaled-up in industry. This is like preparation of a dish for two people doesn’t involve too much difficulty, but preparing the same dish for 100 people is a different matter!\nThe EPFL’s Group of Chemical Reaction Engineering (GGRC) headed by Lioubov Kiwi has studied the use of microreactors for many years. They produce the required substances in tiny pipes, quickly enabling a highly uniform mixing that is perfectly controlled in terms of temperature (which also avoids the risk of explosion), often without the use of solvents, and in a continuous flow. For example, the reagents could be injected through two separate pipes in a Y-shaped system. They react when they meet, and the resulting product comes out through the third pipe. Detractors say that only insufficient quantities can be produced, but these reactors can be used by thousands in parallel. The products created in these microreactors are purer and therefore higher quality, as the process avoids the manufacturing of undesirable by-products inherent in large reactors.\nProfessor Kiwi and her team have received 2.4 million Swiss francs from the European Union to develop these microreactors. 650 thousand Swiss francs have been allocated to a new project, POLYCAT, which started up on November 15. The goal is to combine the advantages of a microreactor and a nano-catalyst. “To reach our objective, we employ micro- and nano-technologies together”, explains Lioubov Kiwi. The concept/process consists of the deposition on the micro-reactor walls of a polymer thin film that anchors the catalyst nanoparticles (gold, palladium etc.). These nanoparticles remain exposed to the reacting liquids or gases while being firmly fixed to the walls of the micro-capillaries.\nSuch a catalytic reactor could become a reality within two to three years, significantly improving the performance of industrial chemical reactions in terms of their quality, as well as their environmental and safety-related impact.", "summary": "EPFL’s Lioubov Kiwi and her group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "claim": "EPFL’s Lioubov Kiwi and our group are developing new reactors by using micro- et nano-technologies.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [5, 5], "noise": false}

{"id": 546, "text": "E-voting is becoming increasingly popular both in Switzerland and further afield. The town of Zug, for instance, is currently testing an online questionnaire – a first step towards e-voting. But doubts about whether centralized systems are secure prevent online voting from being adopted more widely. EPFL, through the Center for Digital Trust (C4DT), has created and tested an e-voting system based on blockchain technology. It is the first such system to guarantee both cryptographic anonymity and decentralized verification.\nEPFL’s  (DEDIS), developed the e-voting system, which, when put to the test during EPFL’s internal elections, passed with flying colors. The system, underpinned by the blockchain principle of distributed trust, decentralizes the voting and counting processes. These processes are run by several separately managed machines rather than by one central service alone. Data is kept anonymous, and the election outcome is transparent, readily verifiable and guaranteed to be valid. Professor Bryan Ford, who runs DEDIS, is proud of the contribution made by his lab: “We were able to harness our expertise in decentralization technology in order to increase the appeal of e-voting and meet the legitimate needs of voters and electoral authorities.”\nLooking ahead, this system could prove extremely useful in sensitive elections where suspicions of wrongdoing are rife. Using a distributed system means that the opposing sides, which may not trust each other, can be sure that the results are valid and can get actively involved in making the voting process secure. According to Olivier Crochat, C4DT’s executive director, this technology is a great example of the possibilities that digital trust has to offer: “At the moment, the only thing competing sides or the international community can do in contested elections is to send in observers. Yet with this decentralized approach to e-voting, anyone can verify the data and prove that the election was not rigged. What’s more, the technology developed at EPFL does not require much infrastructure and is very easy to put in place, so it can be applied in a wide range of elections.”\nAn open-source environment\nThe e-voting system will be one of the first modules made available on the C4DT’s Digital-Trust Open Platform (DTOP), which brings together open-source software in the aim of building digital trust through technology – one of the central objectives of the new center.\nThe C4DT, which was unveiled by EPFL in December 2017, is a partnership between research institutions, industry, the public sector and civil society. It seeks to develop digital systems based on data-protection, encryption, machine learning and blockchain technologies in order to facilitate interactions with policymakers and social institutions and offer digital protection and security in fields ranging from finance and health to democracy and humanitarian assistance.\nMore information is available at:", "summary": "An e-voting system based on blockchain technology has just been tested at EPFL.

But how will we make the transition from a handful of autonomous and connected cars today to a true smart system offering enhanced safety, comfort and seamless and robust operation, in just 15 years’ time? Researchers who worked on the European AutoNet2030 project believe it can be achieved by combining driving assistance technologies and inter-vehicle communications. They have shown that it is possible for vehicles with or without drivers to operate in high-speed, multi-lane traffic autonomously under real-life conditions. This is a key step in the ongoing shift towards autonomous driving. \n06.02.17 - Switzerland has launched a National Center for Data Science in order to innovate in the realm of data and computer science, and to provide an infrastructure for fostering multidisciplinary research and open science, with applications ranging from personalized health to environmental issues.

The initiative will ensure that Switzerland possesses expertise and excellence in data science while striving to be globally competitive.\n27.02.17 - EPFL researchers can now measure a slalom skier’s exact time at each gate all the way down the slope. The team at the Laboratory of Movement Analysis and Measurement has now come up with a way to closely track performance on each section of the slalom course by drawing on several different technologies. They started with accelerometers and gyroscopes, which measure the skiers’ acceleration and angular speed. The researchers then added a magnetic system to measure the elapsed time at each gate. Their system also calculates the skiers’ speed and trajectory more accurately than GPS.\n20.03.17 - On Sunday, 19 March, the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) reached Cape Town, South Africa.

{"id": 550, "text": "At 5:01 pm Wednesday evening, the Philae lander touched down on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko – Chury, for short – seven hours after taking leave of its mothership, the Rosetta orbiter. Although there are still concerns about its anchoring and the resulting feasibility of some operations, the washing-machine sized robot has already gotten to work, sending data and spectacular images of its new surroundings.\nLaunched in 2004 by the European Space Agency, the probe made a 10-year voyage, traveling 500 million kilometers from Earth, to wind up somewhere between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In March, Rosetta’s systems were rebooted successfully as it approached the comet, and in August it began to orbit. The first photos of the comet revealed a fascinating shape, seemingly the result of an agglomeration of two rocky cores. The images sent yesterday by Philae indicate that the comet seems to be made up primarily of rock, and not ice. Grégoire Bourban space engineer and Deputy Director of the EPFL Swiss Space Center, gives us his engineer’s viewpoint on this exceptional event.\n-\tWhy was this operation such a huge challenge, from a space engineering point of view? \nIn the heat of the operation, Wednesday, someone dared to compare this adventure with the first human moon landing. And I share that opinion. Because this operation is very different from others that have involved a lander. For the missions on Venus or Mars, for example, we were dealing with bodies that had been studied for a long time, and we understood the precise nature of the ground we’d be landing on. In addition, they were much larger targets, with many appropriate landing spots. What is unique about Chury is that we knew next to nothing about it in August 2014; but we had to choose a landing site, then make millions of descent calculations, studying various trajectories. Managing to do this successfully, from 500 million miles away, is quite simply incredible!\n-\tWhat will Philae allow us to study, and how will it operate? \nThe Philae mission is a true success, even if the lander has experienced some anchoring issues and only two of its three feet appear to be stable. We still don’t know what the consequences of this will be on the analysis operations. If all goes as planned, the lander and orbiter will remain for an entire year in this configuration, accompanying a comet for the first time ever in its trip around the Sun. As it approaches the sun, its core will begin to melt, and thus it will release gases that will react with others already in suspension. Comets are considered to be a possible origin of the presence of water on Earth, and studying this comet’s composition could thus give us valuable information about our origins.\nTo carry out these tasks, Philae is equipped with various instruments for analyzing particles, electromagnetic radiation, various gases, soil properties and even the sounds that the comet emits. It can bore up to 20 centimeters beneath the surface and remove samples. It’s these soil-sampling operations that are in question due to the failure of the harpoons to anchor the lander. And given the weak gravity, even a very small perturbation could eject the robot from the surface.\n-\n\tSome elements or instruments on board Philae and Rosetta were made in Switzerland. Which ones are they and what do they do?\nThere was a significant Swiss involvement in this project. The most well known instrument is Rosina; developed at the University of Bern, it’s what we call a mass spectrometer. Its objective is to analyze the composition of the comet’s atmosphere, the temperature and density of the gases, and their evolution as the comet approaches the Sun. Several companies, including APCO and Clemessy, also developed ground-based support systems, that is, everything used to test the electrical and mechanical properties of the instruments before they’re launched into space. Certain components, most notably the mechanisms for pointing the communications antenna and the solar panel supports, were built by Mecanex in Nyon, which is now part of the company RUAG Space. Finally, some of Philae’s micro-cameras were developed at the CSEM in Neuchâtel. The first images sent from the surface of the comet, made public yesterday morning, came from these instruments!\n-\tWhat lessons can we learn from this for future space operations and exploration?\nMissions like this are very rare, because they are terribly costly in terms of both money and time – more than €1.5 billion and 20 years of work went into Rosetta. The concrete results that she will provide and the public enthusiasm we’re seeing are extremely positive signals for us, because they will encourage decision makers in European countries to continue to invest in space projects and fund the ESA. One of the most significant interests of this mission, in engineering terms, is in robotics and automation. In the space sector, we’re usually dealing with telecoms satellites or observational satellites orbiting Earth, and thus primarily sensor technology. Rosetta is a spectacular demonstration that these technologies [robotics and automation, ed.] operate well in space, and could thus encourage an increase in launching more robotics-type projects.\nImage: first picture taken by Philae once on the comet's surface.

{"id": 551, "text": "How can the challenges presented by the ever-growing number of wireless mobile devices and the demand for increasingly high data be met without increasing energy consumption and emission power? Currently MIMO (\nmultiple-input, multiple outputs\n) uses several antennas to transmit and receive signals. This technique is progressively being implemented in devices such as wireless modems and is to be used for the next generation of mobile phones. However, it poses problems because it is costly and difficult to integrate into hardware. \n At EPFL, Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s group has demonstrated that a single antenna can simultaneously transmit two separate signals that have the same throughput as a MIMO solution. The results were published at the beginning of the year, and part of the new findings will be presented by Julien Perruisseau-Carrier, at the IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation in Chicago, at the beginning of July.\t\n In a MIMO system, antennas generally have to be placed at a certain distance from each other, which makes inserting them into mobile and miniature devices a complicated process. An even greater problem with this technique is that each separate transmitting antenna must have its own encoding and amplifying signal device, which is costly and energy-consuming.\nOne antenna, two signals \nAs part of collaboration with researchers from Athens Information Technology (AIT), Julien Perruisseau-Carrier’s team developed an antenna capable of emitting simultaneously two information flows, transmitting two independent signals with the same throughput, just as two antennas would do in a MIMO system. This technique called \"Beamspace MIMO\" allows to significantly reduce the number of physical antennas.\n Contrary to what one might think, an antenna does not emit signals in a homogeneous and circular manner. Instead, the repartition of the antenna's radiation is called \"radiation pattern.\" Scientists have managed to decompose this pattern in two, allowing simultaneous emission of two distinct information flows.\n Another advantage of this technique is that only one coding and amplifying device is required to treat the first information flow. The second signal is treated only upstream and then used to make the radiation pattern decomposable. The latter signal acts therefore both as an information carrier and as a mean to decompose the principal pattern. \"This technique allows us to get rid of part of the usual hardware,\" says Julien Perruisseau-Carrier. The process is however difficult and complex. \"One of the biggest challenges is to ensure that each pattern is really independent, to allow an efficient treatment of the information.”\nSuccess thanks to a global approach\t\n The results were obtained through a cross-disciplinary approach. \"This work required us to look at both antennas, particularly reconfigurable ones, and radio coding. Although they are closely linked, these two disciplines are unfortunately often considered separately, which hinders this kind of innovative work,\" explains the scientist.\nJulien Perruisseau-Carrier and his doctoral student Moshen Yousefbeiki are now focusing on a new antenna prototype that will be much more compact and adapted to small mobile devices, such as cell phones and miniature antennas that can be implanted for medical purposes.\nPublication:", "summary": "Scientists at EPFL have developed a single antenna that is capable of transmitting the same data as a two-antenna system.

{"id": 552, "text": "Around a dozen teams from six European countries are gearing up to compete in the sixth annual HydroContest, which will be held on Lake Neuchâtel in Yverdon-les-Bains this year from 1 to 8 September. This year’s contest is more specifically called HydroContest-X, because it is being organized jointly by three universities in French-speaking Switzerland: EPFL, the Fribourg School of Engineering and Architecture (HEIA-FR) and the Vaud School of Management and Engineering (HEIG-VD). The contest, which is supported every year by the Hydros Foundation, challenges students to design, build and race the most energy-efficient boats possible. The event is free of charge and open to the public.\nEach team designs and builds miniature, remote-controlled boats to compete in two contest categories. The two categories are complementary, like Laurel and Hardy – one for thin and light boats, where the aim is to sail fast and far; the other for bigger and heavier ones, which must haul 200 kg of cargo to simulate a freight vessel. Boats in both categories run on batteries provided by the organizer. The event aims to not only enhance students’ education, but also build awareness about the need for cleaner, more energy-efficient shipping vessels and spark ideas for technology in this area.\nAn asymmetric boat\nEPFL students have participated in the contest every year since it was launched. And this year’s team will show up in Yverdon-les-Bains with not two, but three boats. Two of them are from last year’s HydroContest. The first one, which competed in the Mass Transport category, is a hybrid between a catamaran and an airboat that sails on a thin cushion of air. It won the innovation prize last year but was eliminated during the quarterfinals. The second boat, which competed in the Private Boats category, is a twin-foil vessel designed in 2016. This boat proved to be fast but fairly unstable; it came in second place last year behind HEIA-FR.\nThe third boat – new this year – is designed after a prao, a traditional Indonesian sailboat. It has only one hull and one lateral float, making it asymmetric. “We designed it over the past year, it works, and we’ve tested it several times, yet it still needs to be tweaked,” says Sébastien Jaffaux, head of EPFL’s HydroContest team. “So at this point it’s too early to enter it in the race. But if we get the new foils in time, we’ll run demos on the lake.”\nBut the students have big plans for next year, when, as part of the Swiss Solar Boat project, they will use their prototypes as test platforms for the 2020 Monaco Solar & Energy Boat Challenge. The boats in that event – another international competition – will measure over six meters long and have a sailor on board.\nFollow HydroContest EPFL Team on Facebook:  and Twitter: @Hydro_EPFL_Team", "summary": "This year, three universities from French-speaking Switzerland – EPFL, HEIA-FR and HEIG-VD – will co-host the sixth annual HydroContest competition, challenging student teams to come up with fast, energy-efficient boat designs.", "claim": "This year, 200 kg universities from French-speaking Switzerland – EPFL, HEIA-FR and HEIG-VD – will co-host the sixth annual HydroContest competition, challenging student teams to come up with fast, energy-efficient boat designs.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [3, 4], "noise": false}

Organoids promise to cut down on the need for animal testing and offer better models to study how human organs form and how that process goes awry in disease. However, conventional approaches to grow organoids result in stem cells assembling into micro- to millimeter-sized, hollow spheres. “That is non-physiological, because many organs, such as the intestine or the airway, are tube-shaped and much larger” says Matthias Lütolf, a professor at EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering, who led the study published today in \nNature Materials\n.\nTo develop larger organoids that resemble their normal counterparts, Lütolf and his team turned to bioprinting.

{"id": 555, "text": "Is lightning born of an angry sky? Not always. In some circumstances, it can also be initiated from the ground. Upward-moving discharges can easily be distinguished from downward ones by the inverted branches of the lightning which point to the clouds rather than the ground. Upward strikes are a poorly understood phenomenon and mainly occur where tall and slender structures are located on high ground. A researcher from EPFL’s Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory (EMC) took an interest in this topic, analyzed it and ended up writing his thesis on it. The results of his research were published in a recent issue of the \nJournal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics\n.\n“Ground-to-cloud lightning strikes have been observed since the 1930s, but it is only recently, with the growing use of wind turbines, that it has become a real concern,” said Aleksandr Smorgonskii, a doctoral student at the EMC Lab.\nDespite their power, these discharges are harmless when it comes to communication antennas and skyscrapers. These metallic structures, equipped with lightning rods, conduct the electricity from the ground to the top where they escape without causing any damage. The same is not true of wind turbines, however.\nBlades destroyed\n“In order to optimize wind capture, wind turbines are commonly built in the mountains – on crests no less,\" said Smorgonskii. “The combination of a tall structure and high altitude corresponds exactly to the conditions in which ground-to-cloud lightning forms. If the tower is made of metal, the blades are the weak point. Not only are they long and light, and thus fragile, but they are also made of non-conductive composite materials. As a result, they are often damaged, if not destroyed, by the extreme electrical charge.\"\nSmorgonskii’s’ idea was to analyze the mechanisms underlying this type of lightning strike in order to adapt the design of wind farms to account for these risks. He analyzed data that had been recorded over the course of around 15 years at two mountaintop radio transmitters, one on Gaisberg Mountain in Austria and the other on Säntis Mountain in central Switzerland. The latter transmitter, perched over 2,500 meters above sea level, is known for being the most lightning-prone spot in Europe.\nThunderstorm activity\nAmong the most interesting figures revealed by the study is the fact that, in one year, these high structures can record up to 100 more upward than downward strikes. It also appears that most ground-to-cloud strikes occur in the absence of existing thunderstorm activity. Using the Europe-wide lightning-detection system Euclid, Smorgonskii determined, for a given upward strike, whether a downward strike had taken place within a 50-kilometer radius less than one second before. This was true in only 15% of cases. Which means that more than 80% of ground-to-cloud strikes are initiated independently.\n\"Weather conditions, especially the temperature and its distribution in the air, also appear to be an important factor in triggering these lightning strikes,” said Smorgonskii. Determining the exact nature of the risks will require careful study of both geographical and climatological data specific to each site.\nA Youtube video of upward lightening flashes can be viewed .

{"id": 556, "text": "Human visual perception works well and is very effective at seeing what's important to us. But our eyes are not capable of averaging video images that last longer than 40 milliseconds. This is something that a camera can do, however, thanks to its adjustable exposure time.\nEPFL researchers used this fact to hide visual information. They modified an image over time through temporal masking, eventually turning it into a video. They tweaked a number of the image’s technical components to make it invisible, but without changing the underlying image. This temporal variation cannot be detected by the human eye, which is busy watching the resulting video. But a camera can reveal the hidden image.\nThe researchers started with a simple observation: if you spin a disk with two different colors, they start to meld. “You have two pieces of information – red and green colors – but when the human eye sees them over time, it stops detecting two colors and just picks up yellow,” said Sami Arpa, from EPFL’s Image and Visual Representation Lab (IVRL). Arpa wondered if this method could be used to hide an image within an image and trick our brains. So he designed a disk where the second image can only be seen by syncing the speed at which the disk rotates with a strobe light. “From there we thought we could produce the same effect with video,” Arpa said.\nSo how do you hide an image in a video? This is no mean feat, because images contain much more information than texts do. The trick lies in masking one signal by another. “Normally, for this to work, the two signals need to have the same contrast, orientation and frequency,” said Sabine Süsstrunk, the head of the lab. “But that gets pretty complicated when you want to hide an image in a video, as the two signals are so different in nature.”\nA camera can detect the hidden information\nThe researchers took advantage of the temporal limits of our visual capacity to design an algorithm that creates special video seals. They came up with a “tempocode,” a video made of moving patterns that can mask the varying frequencies of an image.\nOnly a camera or smartphone app can reveal the hidden image. They have a feature that the human eye lacks – adjustable exposure time – which can be used to temporally average the images. It’s as if these devices were viewing all the superimposed photos at once, since video is nothing other than a series of images.\n“We turned an image into a video, but to make sure that human eyes couldn’t see it, we had to juggle a number of constraints – it was really difficult,” said Roger David Hersch, who helped develop the method. “We can choose an exposure time of 8, 10 or 15 seconds, which isn’t possible with the human eye.”\nThe results of their work were just published in the \nJournal of the Optical Society of America A\n.\nSAMI ARPA, SABINE SÜSSTRUNK AND ROGER D.

Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.\nThis Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”\nThe structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.\nBetween tradition and modernity\nYannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction. So while the base of the pavilion can be constructed with conventional rammed earth – erected and dried on the building’s foundations – the upper floor of the pavilion will be composed by earthen blocks that will be used as prefabricated components. This approach will help cut down the building time. The earth needed for the columns of the mock-up will be taken from local construction sites and tested by experts.\nThe two students continue to marvel at the wonders of rammed earth: “We think that the sensible thing to do is to use materials available to us, and that includes earth – which is 100% recyclable,” says Claessens. “In our project, the earth walls – and not the concrete – are load-bearing. We are turning normal building codes on their head.” Pretolani is equally enthusiastic: “We felt we had a free hand in terms of project design because there is so much potential in rammed earth, which is not a contemporary material in terms of its aesthetics and does not have well-developed building standards.”\nPilot project\nThe mock-up could also serve as a pilot project for a new technique – prestressed rammed earth – in which steel cables, linked together to meet seismic standards, will run through the building’s earthen columns from top to bottom. For that reason, the engineers backstopping the students will monitor the project once it’s completed, making up for the lack of building standards.\nMany architects steer clear of earth as a building material, since they feel it slows the speed of construction and leads to higher costs. The St. Gallen pavilion could upend such conventional thinking, according to Boltshauser, since it will only take a month to build: “By combining prefabricated earth blocks with other prefabricated concrete components, the pavilion is a glimpse at what could be the future of rammed-earth construction. It will also allow us to calculate the associated savings in terms of costs and gray energy.”\nTextiles and rammed earth go way back \nThe Sittertal valley was a manufacturing region, specializing in dyeing textiles, until the 19th century. The buildings, located between the Sitter river and a canal, have been maintained and renovated and are now dedicated to the visual arts and artisanal crafts. They play host to artist residences, a library, material archives and exhibitions. “Expertise in earth building spread from France to Switzerland through the linen trade, starting in the 17th century. Using the rammed-earth technique for a building on a site that was once devoted to textiles is our way of acknowledging that history,” adds Boltshauser.\nOne week after the construction work begins, an exhibition describing the history of this building technique, called “Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” will open. This exhibition was first shown at EPFL’s Archizoom space in the spring of 2017. In St. Gallen, it will be set up in the Sitterwerk library, just opposite the students’ pavilion project.\n“Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” Sittertal, from 21 August to 15 October 2017.

Three years later, he is the proud co-creator of a new gantry design, based on superconducting magnets, that has the potential to change the future of how we treat cancer.\nHadron therapy is of great interest to the medical community as a pioneering radiation therapy that makes use of charged particles to deliver a highly localized dose to a tumor. Unlike traditional radiotherapy, because it minimizes radiation to any neighboring tissue, it may cause fewer side effects and avoid the generation of secondary tumors.\nHowever, because a hadron is made up of charged particles, a magnetic field is needed to ensure that it goes to exactly the right place in the patient. This requires a complex assembly of magnets in giant machines. It also needs to rotate around the patient with 0.5 mm (5 human hairs!) of precision, making it an incredibly complex piece of engineering. Currently, there are only two facilities in the world, at Heidelberg in Germany where the machine is around 13 meters tall, 25 meters in length and weighing more than 600 tons, and Chiba in Japan, where it is 11 meters tall, 13 meters in length and 250 tons in weight, because it is superconductive.\nEnter GaToroid, which, as Felcini says, aims not just to reduce the size of hadron therapy machines but also their complexity, “using toroidal superconducting magnets, the idea of GaToroid is to have a machine that looks like an MRI, so instead of a gigantic rotating magnetic arm that moves around the patient, we have something circular that is in a steady state with the patient inside. This has enabled us to make the machine much smaller. However, unlike an MRI, the patient is not immersed in the magnetic field, but it is confined by the coils around them.” The idea is that this technology will make hadron therapy far more accessible as it won’t require machines the size of a four-story building.\nReflecting on his PhD research, Felcini feels it has been an honor to work on such a visionary project, “My CERN mentor, Luca Bottura is the ‘yoda-master’ of magnets and it has been amazing to work with him. I’m really proud of my contribution to GaToroid requiring the integration of several aspects of physics and engineering, such as superconductivity, beam optics, mechanics, cryogenics, vacuum, and qualification for therapy. I specifically focused on the design of the superconducting coils and integrating magnet engineering with beam dynamics through particle tracking. With all of these different aspects coming together I had an amazing chance to not focus on a single thing but the opportunity to think very broadly.”\nDr Bertrand Dutoit is looking forward to following Felcini’s career and future achievements and extolled the virtue of working in a region with such top-class research facilities, “having CERN at such close proximity is a fantastic collaboration opportunity for EPFL and Enrico had access to top scientists as well as the technical workshop team where he was able to start building the system he designed and calculated. Enrico was challenged by many different aspects of the GaToroid project, each dictating his constraints but still managed a great PhD, becoming a highly attractive scientist for research institutes and companies in the cancer treatment business.”\nWork is currently underway to construct the first demonstration model, scaled down by a factor of 3 with the aim of taking the next step and building a full-scale machine in the next decade.\n(Video: (c) CERN)", "summary": "Joint CERN-EPFL doctoral research has led to the design of a new machine to deliver cutting edge hadron therapy to treat cancer.", "claim": "Joint CERN-EPFL doctoral research has led to the design of a new machine to deliver cutting edge hadron therapy to treat cancer.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}

By the back door, robotic vacuums are bringing cyberstuff into daily life; they’re among the first autonomous devices that can be easily used by ordinary households.\nThat’s all the impetus scientists needed to seize the opportunity and do a study. Understanding to what extent robots will influence daily life in the future is in fact one of the central issues being studied in the EPFL-based National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) in Robotics.\n In 2011, a team from EPFL’s Pedagogical Research and Support team (CRAFT) conducted a qualitative study on household robots. Nine compositionally diverse families (young, older, with and without children) were given a machine from one of the most common brands. “We interviewed the families before they got the robot, and then we followed them for six months, starting with their first contact with the device,” explains anthropologist and study co-author Valérie Bauwens.\nRapid and irrevocable decisions\n Seven criteria of varying importance – practical, but also emotional - were developed to judge the degree to which the families adopted the robots. Put to the test and further refined by this first field study, these criteria will be useful to engineers at EPFL and elsewhere who are thinking about the domestic robots of the future.\nIn the end only three of the nine families liked the automatic vacuum cleaners. “It was interesting to observe that the decision whether or not to abandon them was made really fast, after about only two weeks,” Bauwens says. “Our robots had very little time to prove themselves!”\nAmong the elements that the users didn’t like, the researchers listed the need to modify the setup of an apartment so that the robot could do its work correctly. In addition, they didn’t like having to change certain behaviors, such as leaving things on the floor, which compromised the machine’s performance. “We even had one user who was careful to put the coffee table up on the couch to make room for the robot to work,” says second author Julia Fink.\nKids are quickly bored\n The scientists also looked at the influence that these new “companions” might have on the family ecosystem. “Overall, we didn’t see many changes,” Bauwens says. “The mother is still generally in control of household organization, even with this tool.” Two of the study subjects, however, appropriated the device, giving it a name or talking to it. The children were at first very excited by the arrival of the new toy, but the older ones quickly lost interest. “It’s just a vacuum cleaner!” said one of them.\n The first robot to get a foothold in apartments is thus a kind of guinea pig. Its successors - such as “Ranger,” a robotic box under development at EPFL that encourages kids to put away their toys by amusing interactions such as speaking and moving its eyes - can benefit from the problems it encountered.

{"id": 567, "text": "How can we constantly monitor the stability of a bridge or detect a leak in a gas pipeline in real time? A method based on optical fibers has become the norm in recent years. By carefully measuring the path of light in fibers up to 100 kilometers long, we can glean information on the temperature, pressure and intensity of magnetic fields along the entire length of the fiber. It’s similar to a nerve, which tells us the intensity and location of a stimulus.\nBut this method is nearing its limits. Depending on the planned use, it’s necessary to sacrifice length, accept a lower resolution or add more equipment – a costly undertaking.\nOne hair, a million measurements\nThanks to the work done by EPFL’s Group for Fibre Optics (GFO), it will now be possible to maintain an extremely fine resolution even when the fiber gets longer. “We have no trouble getting a million measurement points from one optical fiber the width of a hair, for a resolution of one centimeter over 10 kilometers,” said Luc Thévenaz, the director of GFO. That’s 100 times more precise than current techniques.\nMeasurements made with this type of instrument have to be processed, because they include ‘parasites’. But the ratio between useful signals and noise cannot go below a certain threshold, otherwise the measurements will not be reliable.\nGraphic arts to the rescue\nThe EPFL researchers were able to boost this ratio significantly by borrowing a technology from an entirely different field: graphic arts. “The values collected from these measurement points on the fiber can be represented as a matrix of pixels – a two-dimensional image,” said Dr. Thévenaz. \"By applying standard graphic filters to this image, like those found in Photoshop, we were able to reduce the noise inherent in this measurement technique very effectively and identify the desired values more precisely.”\nPursuing this logic further, his teams also transformed more complex measurements, which take into account several parameters simultaneously, into video sequences. Here again, the magic of ‘standard’ video filters was at work.\nIn Dr. Thévenaz’s view, these advances, which are described in articles appearing in \nLight: Science & Applications – Nature\n and \nNature Communications\n, bring the field of distributed optical fiber sensors into a new era simply by using software techniques.

{"id": 568, "text": "Today’s urbanites are ultra-connected and want to make their voices heard on key issues affecting their cities and neighborhoods. Digital platforms are the most convenient and efficient way to do this – but most cities lack the requisite technological capabilities. That means residents’ input is seldom incorporated into planning decisions. At least that’s the main finding of an architecture thesis carried out at EPFL and defended on 28 November. The study compared Geneva with Singapore, an Asian metropolis recognized as the world’s preeminent smart city.\n“We feel we’re at a pivotal moment. People are adopting new lifestyles – new ways of living, working and getting around. But the tools used for urban planning haven’t changed. Geneva’s district maps date back to 1929! So there’s a gap between the way city residents live today and the methods used to design their neighborhoods. That’s what made me want to investigate this topic further,” says Stéphanie Hasler, an architecture researcher at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT), a research center headed by Jérôme Chenal and Marc Soutter.\nDozens of tools at hand\nThis gap exists despite the dozens of tools urban planners have at their disposal for collecting data on how residents use city services: social media, crowdsourcing platforms and mobile apps, to name just a few (see photos galery). Hasler visited Singapore and saw that its city officials use such tools on a daily basis because city residents willingly share their personal data and ideas with local authorities. A few years ago, the city set up a website where residents can view plans for current and future projects and give their opinions. The website encourages dialogue and prevents residents from having to make a trip to the local planning office.\nChanging city\nSo what tools does Geneva have? “Things are changing and I wanted my thesis to make a positive contribution to the city’s development,” says Hasler. She found that Geneva currently uses data only for broader management purposes, such as to reduce traffic congestion or improve energy efficiency. And efforts to solicit residents’ opinions relate primarily to getting feedback on existing projects rather than spawning new ideas. However, Hasler stresses that involving residents in the planning phases is essential for making cities more sustainable, particularly in the areas of transportation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. She also points out a dichotomy unique to Switzerland: “This country has a highly developed sense of democracy as well as advanced technology, but the two are not always combined,” she says.\nList of digital platforms\nSo how can city officials improve things? Hasler’s thesis includes a list of digital platforms that they could use to better listen to and incorporate residents’ ideas. She came up with the list after testing around 50 such platforms worldwide, which she grouped by type of urban project they are meant to address.\nHasler prefers to talk about “responsive cities” rather than “smart cities,” as the former implies putting residents’ needs first. “Urban planners have to serve as coordinators between politicians, experts and residents. Digital technology is essential to doing this effectively, because it helps incorporate the interests of all stakeholders in decision-making,” she says. However, Hasler sensed resistance to the concept of connected urban planning among some of the Geneva planners she interviewed in her research. “Staff training or continuing education programs will be necessary,” she adds.\nCombining the 15 district maps\nIn addition to efforts to more fully involve city residents, Hasler states that Geneva city officials could also work on streamlining their processes and combining the 15 district maps into a single application that all city staff could use. That would help prevent people from working in silos and eliminate discrepancies among the maps. Singapore has been using such an application since 2016, which can also display real-time information on the types of transportation that city residents are using, for example.\nThis thesis research was carried out at EPFL’s Urban and Regional Planning Community (CEAT) in association with ETH Zurich’s Future Cities Lab in Singapore.", "summary": "By comparing the cities of Geneva and Singapore, an EPFL thesis found that urban planners can reap multiple benefits by better leveraging digital technology.

{"id": 570, "text": "For many poor farmers in India and Africa, finger millet is a major staple food. The crop species is not only a rich source of minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and zinc, and it contains many vitamins and essential amino acids. The plant is also characterized by its resistance to drought and heat. As it is very healthy and gluten-free, it is finding increased use as a food in industrial countries as well. Despite its importance, finger millet has been given very little scientific attention until now.\nLarge and complex genome due to fusion of two plant species\nFinger millet arose through the hybridization of two different plant species. The plant is therefore polyploid, which means it has a four-fold set of chromosomes and almost twice as many genes as its original species. The size and complexity of the genome are thought to have conferred the broad environmental tolerance of finger millet, while making genome research extremely difficult. For the first time, an international team of researchers from the University of Zurich has now managed to decode the complex genome of finger millet in great detail. It comprises about 2.6 million base pairs and has more than 62,300 genes – about twice as many as rice, for example.\nNew strategy for genome sequencing and mapping\nA good 57,900 finger millet genes – over 90 percent – occur in more than two copies. As their DNA sequences are very similar, it was difficult to correctly allocate the numerous, decoded DNA sections within the entire genome. In cooperation with Ralph Schlapbach and Sirisha Aluri from the Functional Genomics Center at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, the team headed up by Kentaro Shimizu, professor at the UZH Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, has managed to overcome these difficulties. For this purpose, the scientists combined a sophisticated bioinformatics strategy developed by Masaomi Hatakeyama that uses state-of-the-art sequencing methods with a new technology that can optically map the long, individual DNA molecules in the genome. “Our newly developed strategy will help sequence the genome of other polyploid cultivated plants that have not been able to be determined until now,” Shimizu says.\nImproving the supply of nutrients and drought resistance\nAn interdisciplinary team of researchers from Zurich and Bangalore, India, worked together on this project. The work was supported by Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (ISCB), a bilateral research and development program financed by the Swiss and Indian governments, as well as by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The objective is to improve food security and to develop the capacity of biotechnological research in India. “The newly available genome data of finger millet opens up numerous possibilities for modern plant breeding,” Shimizu emphasizes. “On the one hand, to help people with mineral deficiencies in India and in industrialized countries and, on the other hand, to make important crop plants more resistant to drought and aridness.”\nLiterature\n:\nMasaomi Hatakeyama, Sirisha Aluri, Mathi Thumilan Balachadran, Sajeevan Radha Sivarajan, Andrea Patrignani, Simon Grüter, Lucy Poveda, Rie Shimizu-Inatsugi, John Baeten, Kees-Jan Francoijs, Karaba N.

The firms that make these items produce large amounts of CO\n2\n emissions and have a huge impact on the environment. At the COP21 climate conference in Paris, world leaders highlighted the prominent role that manufacturers could play in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nMaziar Kermani, a researcher at EPFL’s  group, which is headed by Professor François Maréchal, has come up with a pioneering mathematical model that could cut the amount of water and energy used in industrial processes. He has developed a way to recycle lost heat and energy and to employ biorefinery technologies – combining turbines and organic fluids – to boost power production.\nKermani applied his model to a Canadian paper mill. He found that, in theory, it could cut the amount of water the firm used from 820 kg to 230-300 kg per second (a drop of around 60%). It could also allow the mill to produce more than six times as much electricity (from 3 MW to around 20 MW). His findings have been published in \nEnergies\n.\nContinuous recycling of water and heat\nKermani tested out his theory on kraft pulping – by far the most popular paper-making method in the industry.\nWood chips are wetted, cooked (in digesters), washed, dried and bleached to make pulp. All of this produces vast amounts of steam which, in addition to being used in the process itself, generates more than enough electricity to power the plant. The surplus energy can then be sold.\nAccording to Kermani, however, the current system is far from optimal. “Huge amounts of water and energy go to waste because the stages of the process aren’t connected,” he explains. “For instance, the mill uses cold water to wash and cool the pulp. But that water, which contains valuable heat, is then discarded. Likewise, high-pressure steam is produced by burning black liquor at extremely high temperatures – around 1,200°C. The steam powers turbines to generate electricity and provides a heat source for other processes, but it’s too energy intensive to produce.”\nOrganic fluids\n In his paper, Kermani outlines several ways in which the heated water could be reused. He also recommends introducing organic Rankine cycles, which rely on a special property of organic fluids: the fact that they turn into high-pressure steam at relatively low temperatures (250°C). “Using organic fluids would allow the mill to produce the steam it needs using recovered hot water at low-to-medium temperatures,” he explains.\nThe Canadian firm has expressed interest in Kermani’s model. “As compared to strictly mathematical and limited methods, the proposed approach provides insightful information for the preliminary design of industrial heat exchanger networks involved in pulp and paper,” says Canadian industrial process expert Marzouk Benali, who is tasked with optimizing that company’s processes. “Its flexibility offers opportunities to assess the direct impacts of integrating emerging biorefinery technologies within existing large facilities.”\nKermani’s model has potential applications in other sectors and industries as well.\nCollaborations:\nThis research was conducted as part of a collaboration between EPFL and CanmetENERGY, a Natural Resources Canada research center.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher has developed a mathematical model for optimizing heat transfer in factories and dramatically reducing water and energy consumption.

To answer this question, scientists have longed for a way to observe the spinal cord’s function in vivo. Until recently, they needed to resort to animal studies, but the advent of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is now providing a new window into the richness of spinal cord signals, directly in humans.\n© 2020 EPFL / Highlighting the spinal cord's functional architecture reveals an active spinal cord even for subjects at rest.\nNow, scientists at EPFL have combined tailored protocols for spinal cord fMRI with advanced analysis techniques, in order to disentangle these signals and clearly view the spinal cord in action. Tested on 19 healthy subjects, the scientists obtained unprecedented views of the spinal cord’s functional architecture and showed for the first time just how dynamic the spinal cord is, even for subjects at rest. The results are published in today’s issue of Neuron.\n“One of the main challenges about observing spinal cord function is getting rid of noise from the rest of the subject’s body, like breathing, the heartbeat, or simply seeing beyond the surrounding vertebral bones,” explains Nawal Kinany, first author of the study. “We managed to decompose spontaneous spinal activity into meaningful networks, with a level of neuroanatomical detail that had never been reached before.”\nThe study was done at Campus Biotech in collaboration with Silvestro Micera who is the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Translational Neuroengineering at EPFL and Professor of Bioelectronics at Scuola Sant’Anna in Pisa, Italy, as well as with Dimitri Van De Ville who leads EPFL’s Medical Imaging Processing Lab and is also affiliated with the Department of Radiology and Medical Informatics of the Geneva University.\n© 2020 EPFL / Dimitri Van De Ville (left) and Nawal Kinany (right) with a healthy subject, at Campus Biotech.\nFrom the perspective of the subject, one simply has to lie down in an fMRI scanner and remain immobile throughout the scan, typically around 10 minutes. The images resulting from the scan are then analyzed to provide a 4-dimensional view – through space and time – to view the dynamics of spinal circuits within the anatomy of the subject.\n“These results are clear evidence that spinal resting-state activity is richly organized and thus must bear physiological relevance beyond what was assumed so far,” explains Van De Ville. \nGiven its central position at the interface between the brain and the rest of body, the spinal cord is a key player in all human behaviour. The scientists targeted the cervical level because of its involvement in controlling arm and hand muscles. Their approach could help understand how spinal circuits are orchestrated to support the wide range of movements we perform in our everyday life.\n“Only a deeper understanding of human motor control can allow for the development of more effective neurorehabilitation approaches. Our new method provides a very important tool in this direction,” furthers Micera.\nTested for now on healthy subjects, the scientists believe that these new protocols will one day be a valuable tool for evaluating the status of dysfunctional or injured spinal cord circuitry, which could promote the development of targeted therapies that rebalance spinal activity or optimally harness the spared connections.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a non-invasive technique for unraveling the complex dynamics generated by spinal cord circuits to unprecedented detail, a first in functional magnetic resonance imaging that may one day help diagnose spinal cord dysfunction or injury.", "claim": "EPFL scientists have developed a non-invasive technique for unraveling the complex dynamics generated by spinal cord circuits to unprecedented detail, a first in functional magnetic resonance imaging that may one day help diagnose spinal cord dysfunction or injury.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}

{"id": 576, "text": "Treatments for beating tumours are mainly based on CD8 T lymphocytes, which specialise in detecting and eliminating intracellular infections and in killing cancer cells. A large proportion of patients, however, do not respond to these treatments. This prompted a research team from the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman (SCCL, Switzerland) to bring together the universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL), the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), EPFL and CHUV to investigate CD4 T lymphocytes. While these play a supporting role with CD8 T cells, their ability to eliminate tumour cells directly has been a matter of controversy. Using innovative nanoimaging technologies designed at the EPFL's School of Engineering laboratory, the scientists found that when the CD4 T lymphocytes were directly put in close contact to the cancer cells, up to a third of them could also kill them. This discovery, the subject of an article in \nScience Advances\n, is significant and broadens the therapeutic perspectives based on administering CD4 T lymphocytes to patients who are resistant to conventional therapies.\nWhen cancer cells proliferate in our bodies, our immune system kicks in. The first line of fighters capable of destroying tumour cells are CD8 T lymphocytes known as cytotoxic T cells, backed up by CD4 T lymphocytes. The latter secrete factors that help the former in many ways. “That’s why lots of cancer treatments are based on CD8 T lymphocytes,” begins Camilla Jandus, last author of the study and a pro- fessor in the Department of Pathology and Immunology in UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and adjunct scientist at LICR. “Unfortunately, some patients don’t respond to these treatments, and so we have to find new ones.”\nThe SCCL team turned their focus to CD4 T lymphocytes, which offer invaluable support to our immune system, as Pedro Romero, a professor in the Department of Fundamental Oncology in UNIL’s Faculty of Medicine and Biology, explains: “These have a much wider spectrum of functional specialisations than CD8 T lymphocytes, and for a long time we didn’t know for sure whether they had the capacity to diffe- rentiate into killer lymphocytes.”\n20,000 individual “boxing rings”\nTo address this question, the scientists examined CD4 T lymphocytes from around twenty patients with melanoma who were being treated at CHUV. “Although melanoma isn’t the most common skin cancer, it is the deadliest, and it’s particularly sensitive to immunotherapies,” spells out Professor Jandus. The researchers isolated the CD4 T lymphocytes from both the blood and fragments of the tumours with the idea of comparing them directly. Dissociated tumour cells and CD4 T cells were co-incubated to observe their behaviour individually. Observation tools were then required to provide highly-advanced resolution down to the single cell level. “We created chips of over 20,000 mini-wells of 65 picolitres (1 picolitre = 10-12 litre) that can accommodate a CD4 T cell and a tumour cell in each of them, and function like boxing rings,” says Hatice Altug, a professor in EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory. The researchers then photographed all these thousands wells simultaneously every five minutes for 24 hours in order to observe the interactions occurring between the two cells from a large set of pairs. “We know that it takes about two and a half hours for a CD8 to kill a tumour cell, and we decided to observe these boxing rings for 24 hours without knowing how, and if, the CD4s would react,” continues Professor Altug.\nA third of the CD4s emerged victorious\nTo the great satisfaction of the scientists, the high-throughput inte- gration of dynamic imaging data showed that up to a third of the CD4 T lymphocytes succeeded in killing the tumour cell to which they were closely linked within five hours. As Professor Romero stresses: “These direct observations at the level of individual lymphocytes, which were revealed for the first time at such a level of sensitivity, definitively confirm the existence of CD4 T lymphocytes capable of killing tumour cells. And this happens while the tumour cells sometimes manage to divert them from their function of providing protective support to make allies of them.”\nPicowell array chip in a standard microscope slide with separated chambbers.\n © 2021 EPFL\nBy analysing the killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes in detail, the scientists found that they expressed the SLAMF7 molecule, which promoted their tumor killer activity. “That’s why we’re now going to isolate and cultivate in vitro the best killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes so we can turn them into a veritable army of trillions of cells, which we can then inject into patients on whom CD8-based treatments don’t work,” says Dr Jandus. The human body naturally has only a small number of CD4 T lymphocytes directed against tumours, and not enough to defeat them. “The ability to visualise this close combat with our picowell chip paves the way for expanding the arsenal in the fight against cancer, which we now need to develop,” concludes Professor Altug.", "summary": "A team from EPFL and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy them.", "claim": "A team from EPFL and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy us.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "PronounSwap", "augmentation_span": [34, 34], "noise": false}

Collagen 6 removal in mice without ANTXR2 restore uterine structure and function (Right). This result indicates that collagen 6 accumulation is the cause of uterine tissue disruption in mice devoid of ANTXR2, the latter playing a crucial role in collagen 6 degradation.\nHyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS) is a rare but severe genetic disease that affects babies, children, and adults. A glassy substance called hyaline accumulates in the skin and various organs of patients, causing painful deformities and may lead to early death. The disease is caused by gene mutations that destroy the function of a protein whose physiological function is little understood. EPFL scientists have now studied and characterized its function for the first time, showing that it binds and controls the body levels of an important type of collagen. The work is published in \nNature Communications\n.\nHFS is caused by a mutation of a gene called \nCMG2,\n also abbreviated as \nANTXR2\n because it renders cells sensitive to anthrax infections. The gene produces a protein that is embedded in the membrane of cells, and is known to bind anthrax toxins internalizing them into the cell where they exert their action. This is however not the physiological function of this protein.\nThe HFS mutation of the gene causes the protein to lose its function. A hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of collagen in large nodules under the skin. Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, found in skin, cartilage, blood vessels, and even teeth. There are many different types of collagen, which surround cells and support the body’s various tissues and organs by forming elastic or rigid structural networks.\nThe lab of  has now shown for the first time that the CMG2 protein interacts with a type of collagen called collagen VI. Normally, CMG2 binds collagen VI and, when there is too much, internalizes it into the cell’s lysosomes for degradation. The study suggests that, in HFS, the mutation of the CMG2 gene disrupts the function of the protein, leading to accumulation of collagen VI in various parts of the body.\nCollagen VI is a type of collagen that recent studies have found in multiple sites in the body, such as the heart, neurons, immune cells, tendons, lungs, and the skin. Depending on the type of tissue, it plays different protective and mechanical roles, but it has also been shown to be involved in a number of diseases, including the growth of cancer tumors.\nThe EPFL researchers studied HFS nodules in mouse models as well as a human patient. The female HFS mice characteristically suffer from accumulation of collagen in the uterus, which makes them sterile. The human patient had nodules at various body sites including the scalp and behind the ear. Studying tissue samples, the researchers found that the nodules in both mice and human were rich in collagen VI.\nWanting to understand the relationship between CMG2 and collagen VI, the team developed double-knockout mice in which the genes for both proteins — CMG2 and collagen VI — had been deleted. Previous studies have shown that CMG2-knockout mice are infertile due to uterine nodules that render them infertile. But remarkably, the scientists found that when the gene for collagen VI was deleted too, the mice regained their fertility, confirming that CMG2 and collagen VI are somehow connected in HFS.\nFurther studies showed that CMG2 physically binds collagen VI through a specialized domain. The CMG2 protein then acts as a receptor, sending a signal into the cell, causing collagen VI to be internalized and degraded inside the cell’s lysosomes.\nThe study reveals a major physiological function for CMG2 and demonstrates its interaction with collagen VI. This interaction explains how major HSF symptoms arise when mutation of the \nCMG2\n gene disrupts the ability of the CMG2 protein to control the levels of collagen VI, which then over-accumulates and produces the painful and disfiguring symptoms of the disease.\nThis study was led by EPFL’s Global Health Institute in collaboration with the University of Bern, the Medical University of Innsbruck, the University of Freiburg, the Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV), and the University of Padova. It was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), the Gelu Foundation, the\nFrancis and Marie-France Minkoff Foundation, the Solis Foundation, and the Associazione ISI.\nReference\nJérôme Bürgi, Béatrice Kunz, Laurence Abrami, Julie Deuquet, Alessandra Piersigilli, Sabine Scholl-Bürgi, Ekkehart Lausch, Sheila Unger, Andrea Superti-Furga, Paolo Bonaldo, F.

{"id": 581, "text": "Switzerland is one of the countries in Europe that relies the most on geothermal energy for residential heating. A study conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy in 2019 found that the country has  (GSHPs) – the “highest concentration per square kilometer in the world.” Many of these pumps are installed in residential yards at depths of up to 400 meters and use a vertical closed-loop system to circulate heat up to the surface.\nThe advantage of GSHPs is that they have little impact on the environment. They can heat homes and buildings all year long since geothermal energy is a stable heat source. And they offer a promising alternative for decarbonizing the heating sector. In Switzerland, buildings’ heating and cooling systems account for a third of total energy demand, and 75% of the country’s energy comes from fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. \nOperation of a vertical ground-source heat pump. © ADEME\nA finite energy source\nIn 2017, Doris Leuthard, then-president of the Swiss Confederation, called geothermal energy an “incredible energy source” but warned that it’s not infinite; it needs to be extracted according to specific rules. For instance, the borehole heat exchangers used in GSHPs should be installed a certain distance apart to prevent thermal interference – the heat-exchanger equivalent of a short circuit – and prevent the ground from cooling. “The heat-transfer fluid absorbs the heat that’s in the ground,” says Alina Walch, a PhD student at EPFL’s . “If too many of these exchangers are packed into a tiny space, the ground will cool off, which is something we absolutely need to avoid.”\nThermal interference is one of the factors that a team of scientists, including Walch, took into account in  on 18 November. They calculated the technical potential of GSHPs in the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva. “The technical potential is the maximum amount of geothermal energy that can be extracted by the heat pumps using all the available area in the two cantons, assuming they operate at at least 80% of their rated power,” she says.\nThe research team estimated the available area using existing topographical data on Switzerland, excluding built environments and natural habitats like forests from their study. They then simulated GSHPs installed throughout that area based on factors such as ground temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. “We incorporated the various technical constraints and estimated the optimal borehole spacing that would both comply with installation standards and maximize the extractable heat,” says Walch.\nRegional variation of ground data in the case study region. a) Restriction zones for geothermal installations, b) Ground surface temperature at 1m depth, c) Thermal conductivity, d) Thermal diffusivity derived from the geothermal cadastres. Grey zones are outside the study area. © LESO-PB\nInsufficient capacity in urban centers \nTheirs is the first study of its scale in Switzerland to consider not just the ground’s geothermal capacity but also the technical limitations of GSHPs. The scientists estimate that the annual technical potential of the region they studied is 4.6 TWh, which corresponds to about a third of its total heating demand. They also calculated a maximum energy density of 15.5 kWh/m\n2\n. “Geothermal energy has only limited potential to serve as the region’s only source. It could cover demand in many suburban and rural areas, but would fall considerably short in urban centers,” says Walch. Urban planners can use this information in their technical and economic feasibility studies of GSHP system deployment. \nThe research team also found that the cumulative installed borehole depth shouldn’t exceed 2 km per hectare in order to avoid over-exploitation of the heat capacity of the ground. \nWalch stresses that their findings are only theoretical for now; the study doesn’t factor in local phenomena like phreatic zones and groundwater flows, which can affect the time needed for the ground to cool. It will be essential to drill test bores before installing borehole heat exchangers. \nThe team hopes that by quantifying the heat-generation capacity of shallow geothermal energy, and by pinpointing areas where additional energy sources will be required, their work will inform decarbonization strategies for Switzerland’s heating sector. “Our ultimate goal is to conduct nationwide studies and combine these findings with similar ones for other types of renewable energy,” says Walch, also worked on a study to evaluate . “It’s important to estimate the technical potential independent of heat demand. We’d like to evaluate the capacity of hybrid systems combining geothermal and solar power, using data on both these renewable energies.”", "summary": "An EPFL PhD student has calculated the maximum amount of geothermal energy that could theoretically be extracted using ground-source heat pumps in the Cantons of Vaud and Geneva.

{"id": 582, "text": "Cameroonians call it ‘load-shedding.’ They are referring to ill-timed and never-ending power cuts. More than 70% of the population is not directly affected, however, because they are not even on the grid. For those on it, the grid’s unreliability is the root cause of numerous challenges, especially in hospitals.\nThese problems are the focus of concern for engineers from the University Research Center on Energy for Health Care (CURES), a joint laboratory between EPFL – represented by the EssentialTech programme of the Cooperation and Development Center (CODEV) – and the Yaoundé National Advanced School of Engineering (ENSP). The engineers' conclusions are unequivocal: electrical equipment at hospitals is in poor shape, daily power cuts last up to three hours, electrical fires take place and power surges destroy household appliances. At peak hours, the grid does not generate enough electricity to run sterilizers, and the cuts even affect the lighting in operating theatres. Lives are at stake.\n“Adaptable, sustainable and affordable solutions”\n An in-depth study was carried out in the framework of the CROSS program. This programme, co-financed by EPFL and the University of Lausanne (UNIL), develops technological solutions with both socioeconomic and institutional dimensions. A system using batteries and inverters specially designed for tropical climates was developed and tested in the laboratory. During slack hours it stores up the energy required to meet the needs during peak hours or during power cuts and load-shedding. This solution also isolates and protects electrical equipment from sometimes destructive disruptions on the grid.\nThe total cost of this solution over 10 years – purchase, operations and maintenance – represents 14% of the average annual cost of a hospital’s energy supply. An economic model was used to study the possibility of financing the solution with the resulting savings, which stem in large part from the diesel fuel used for the generators. “The solutions that we come up with have to be adaptable, sustainable and affordable,” said Nicolas Crettenand, who just spent two years in Cameroon as EPFL’s chargé de mission. If the model is successful, hospitals in Cameroon and other developing countries will be able to function more effectively.\nPromoting Swiss know-how in hydroelectricity\n Alongside this effort, EPFL is also engaged in an initiative at the national level to help develop the country’s hydroelectric power. Cameroon is one of four countries on the African continent with significant hydroelectric potential. 70% of electricity production in the country is already the result of hydropower, but that represents only 5% of the potential capacity of this energy source. At the same time, the electrification rate is 50% in cities and 5% in the countryside.\nAcademic and industry partners in Switzerland put together a consortium that is concentrating on small and medium-sized power stations. “At this stage, there is a serious shortage of power stations in Africa with capacity between several hundred kilowatts and several dozen megawatts, and this is a range in which Switzerland has special expertise,” said Crettenand, who ran this project as part of his mission with EPFL’s Energy Center.\nThe consortium aims to work, with local partners, in a spirit of integrated and sustainable development. “We want to develop projects in which hydropower complements other sources of renewable energies and, insofar as possible, provides ways to store energy in storage plants and pumped-storage stations. This type of storage helps with the technical regulation of the power grid and with developing small grids,” said the researcher. The consortium, still more of an interest group at this stage, hopes eventually to help alleviate the electricity problems, especially for the hospitals.", "summary": "EPFL has teamed up with Swiss and Cameroonian partners to address major issues like stabilizing the country’s existing grid, improving energy efficiency and developing hydroelectric potential.", "claim": "EPFL has teamed up with Swiss and Cameroonian partners to address major issues like stabilizing the country’s existing grid, improving energy efficiency and developing hydroelectric potential.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 583, "text": "The “classical” role for a gene is to produce proteins, which are essential for the functioning of cells. However, our genomes also encode genes that produce long non-coding RNAs, whose functions are more mysterious. Yet, since four or five years ago we know that thousands of these still poorly understood genes are present in the human and mouse genomes. How and in which organs are they activated? Is this biological “dark matter” much ado about nothing or is there something more interesting to it?\nA team led by Professor Henrik Kaessmann at UNIL’s Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) compiled an authentic catalog of long non-coding RNAs in eleven species. By adopting an evolutionary approach, they discovered that about 2500 long non-coding RNAs first appeared at least 90 million years ago in the common ancestor of most placental mammals. From a functional point of view, these “ancient” genes turned out to be particularly interesting.\nFirst author of the \nNature\n article, Anamaria Necsulea, scientist at the Laboratory of developmental genomics of EPFL, expanded the scope of the investigation on these long non-coding RNAs to six primate species (man, macaque, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan), and to mouse, opossum (a marsupial mammal), platypus (a monotreme mammal that lays eggs and nurses its young with milk), as well as to an \"external group\" composed by a bird (chicken) and an amphibian (frog). The common ancestor of all these species goes back over 350 million years.\nGenes maintained during evolution\nThe biologists used the CIG genomics platform and the Vital-IT computing center at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to identify long non-coding RNAs in several major organs of the 11 species under scrutiny. \"Thanks to bioinformatics, we discovered RNA sequences produced from genome locations where no genes had been previously mapped,\" she said. \"We then analyzed these genes to find out whether or not they encoded proteins. Thus, we could identify between 3000 and 15000 long non-coding RNA genes, depending on the species.\"\nIn the second phase of the research, a comparison among the different species allowed the scientists to pinpoint the emergence of these genes in the evolutionary history. While 11,000 long non-coding RNAs are shared by all primates, 2,500 go back to an ancestor common to man and mouse, about 90 million years ago. Only a hundred genes of this kind stem from an ancestor common to all eleven species considered, including birds and amphibians. \"One of our main findings is that the activity of these non-coding genes is controlled by the same transcription factors that regulate protein-coding gene activity. Even more strikingly, we found that the 2,500 oldest long noncoding RNA genes are regulated by factors that are important for embryonic development. This suggests that, among the 2500 long non-coding RNAs conserved during the evolution of placental mammals, a large percentage may function specifically in embryonic development.\"\nNew network of interactions\nThe third phase of the research allowed the scientists to highlight a network of interactions (specifically, co-expression interactions, that is: genes are activated in the same organs or cell types) involving both long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. For instance, they found that some non-coding genes are strongly associated to protein coding genes involved in brain function or in spermatogenesis, which suggests similar functions for these long non-coding RNA genes.\n In the case of the H19X gene - one of the most ancient long noncoding RNA genes identified in this study - its association to the placental mammals’ H19 gene (which was the first long non-coding RNA identified years ago) helped to uncover its functioning: \"The H19 prevents the placenta from excessively growing inside the mother's womb,\" said Anamaria Necsulea. \"We can assume that H19X also contributes to this function. We now plan to disable this gene in mice to test its functions in the placenta.\"\nAmong the subcategories of RNA producing genes, are these long RNA genes more useful than it originally seemed? By tracking them in 11 different species, this new study of unprecedented scale suggests that some of our genomes’ \"dark matter\" may play a role in the development and functioning of the most vital organs of our bodies.

Two minutes and forty-two seconds. That was the first round of the day’s competition, and Jules and his teammates were pretty happy with their performance. Their top spun for longer than their opponents’, who used a drill to get theirs going.\nForty-five teams came from all over French-speaking Switzerland to compete in one of three age groups. The teams comprised three or four kids from the same age group, together with a coach. Three months before the competition, the teams were all given the same experimental challenge. This year, it was to build a top that would spin for as long as possible. “We used really basic materials,” said ten-year-old Eline. “We took a ten-centimeter-long piece of ash wood, sharpened the end with a pencil sharpener, and hammered it into a piece of fiberboard that we had cut into a round shape using a hole saw.” Good explanation from this extremely enthusiastic team, which was competing in the middle age group.\nPresenting the results of their research project\n In the second round of the competition, the kids had to present the results of a scientific project that they had completed before the competition, along with their conclusions. A team from the youngest age category explained to a jury how to make various types of vortexes with different liquids and vessels. Eight-year-old Clément, backed by a diagram projected onto a screen, used his hands to illustrate the direction in which the earth rotates. Matias, also eight years old, then continued: “I asked my brother, who’s in Australia, to check whether vortexes really do turn the other way down there.” His brother also participated in this competition once. “This interest in science runs in the family,” said his dad, who was the team’s coach that day.\nThat’s just what this competition is designed to bring out: the goal is to get kids interested in science and research. “They may not yet have the mathematical tools to understand and model a scientific problem,” said Andrea Fabian Montabert, who was in charge of organizing the competition. “But they can still come up with hypotheses, set up an experiment and improve their results through trial and error. And they can make observations and draw conclusions.” The competition lets kids try their hand at scientific and technical experiments in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\nTeamwork and cooperation\n After taking a short quiz designed to test their general science knowledge, the competitors played a fun game that required solid teamwork.

Over half of the brain is actually composed by glial cells, which support and insulate neurons, supply them with energy substrates, protect them from pathogens and even clear out dead neurons from the brain. In fact, glial cells, neurons and the brain’s blood vessels form a functional unit, the neuron-glia-vascular unit (NGV) that regulates the brain’s energy management.\nA team led by Pierre Magistretti (EPFL, KAUST), working with Renaud Jolivet (University College London), has now developed a detailed computer model that accurately captures the dynamics of this relationship. Specifically, the model shows how glucose is shuttled between the three elements of the unit to produce energy for activated neurons.\nPrevious experiments from Magistretti’s group show that glucose flows from a type of glia cells called “astrocytes” to neurons in the form of lactate. However, some theoretical studies have proposed that lactate could go the other way – from neurons to astrocytes. This has major implications for our understanding of brain energy metabolism.\nThe model has now confirmed in quantitative terms that lactate flows from astrocytes to neurons. It is also the first such model to successfully simulate the actual timeframe of this process, a breakthrough that provides a measurable picture of how neurons and glial cells tightly coordinate brain energy metabolism.\nA better understanding of the metabolic relationships between neurons and glia has also important implications for understanding the signals detected with functional brain imaging techniques, such as fMRI and PET, which monitor glucose utilization, blood flow or oxygen consumption changes that occur in register with neuronal activity.\n“This is the first time-dependent and multi-scale model of the neuron-glia-blood vessel that accurately reflects experimental observations from multiple cells types and organisms,” says Pierre Magistretti. The model is now being integrated with the accurate brain model being developed by the Blue Brain Project at EPFL. “By adding the extra layer of neuron-glial dynamics, we can take a step toward more accurately modeling the real working of the brain.”\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL with the University College London, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

{"id": 587, "text": "Neurons communicate with each other at synapses through complex mechanisms. The synapses establish contact between the neurons and convert their electrical signals into chemical signals, the release of neurotransmitters. Study of these phenomena is one of the essential keys to understanding the brain. The team from the EPFL’s Laboratory of Synaptic Mechanisms, headed by Ralf Schneggenburger, has shed some light on previously unknown functions of proteins in the release of neurotransmitters.\n In the first paper (1), the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to deactivate a protein selectively in the calyx of Held, the brain’s largest synapse. This novel method enabled them to discover a direct, unexpected role for the protein RIM (Rab3 interacting molecule), which increases the density of calcium ion (Ca2+) channels, a type of ion channel that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release.\n In the second article (2), the scientists used mice that had been genetically modified so they would not produce a specific protein, synaptotagmin. This Ca2+-sensing protein is known to bind calcium ions (Ca2+), thus initiating neurotransmitter release. The researchers used a virus to reintroduce the missing gene in the nerve terminal and reestablish the gene function at the calyx of Held.\nA Protein’s Double Life\n Subsequently, the scientists used viruses expressing slightly modified versions of the gene coding for the protein. Careful comparison enabled them to reveal a double role of this protein. The function of synaptotagmin is in fact not limited to initiating neurotransmitter release; it also inhibits other Ca2+- sensing proteins present in the nerve terminal. In doing so, it increases the amplitude of the release signal while suppressing background release events. In other words it optimizes the signal quality, similarly to what occurs in an electronic circuit.\n The approaches developed by Ralf Schneggenburger’s team are promising. They should also help us gain more insight into the function of other proteins that are active in the synapses. Since synaptic transmission is the basis of all fast communication between neurons in the brain, misfunction at synapses can underlie several neurodegenerative- and psychiatric disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's Disease. \"Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular bases of synapse function will contribute to the development of treatment strategies of these disorders in the future,” the researcher explained.\n (1)Neuron, January 27, 2011, “”\n (2)Neuron, February 24, 2011, “”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have made a step forward in understanding signal transmission in neuronal networks, thanks to new methods to molecularly influence the nerve terminal.

{"id": 588, "text": "“Tutu” by Miles Davis and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple have already made their mark on music history. Now they have entered the annals of science, for eternity. Recordings of these two legendary songs were digitized by the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) as part of the Montreux Jazz Digital Project, and they are the first to be stored in the form of a DNA sequence that can be subsequently decoded and listened to without any reduction in quality.\nThis feat was achieved by US company Twist Bioscience working in association with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington. The pioneering technology is actually based on a mechanism that has been at work on Earth for billions of years: storing information in the form of DNA strands. This fundamental process is what has allowed all living species, plants and animals alike, to live on from generation to generation.\nThe entire world wide web in a shoe box\nAll electronic data storage involves encoding data in binary format – a series of zeros and ones – and then recording it on a physical medium. DNA works in a similar way, but is composed of long strands of series of four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) that make up a “code.” While the basic principle may be the same, the two methods differ greatly in terms of efficiency: if all the information currently on the internet was stored in the form of DNA, it would fit in a shoe box!\nRecent advances in biotechnology now make it possible for humans to do what Mother Nature has always done. Today’s scientists can create artificial DNA strands, “record” any kind of genetic code on them and then analyze them using a sequencer to reconstruct the original data. What’s more, DNA is extraordinarily stable, as evidenced by prehistoric fragments that have been preserved in amber. Artificial strands created by scientists and carefully encapsulated should likewise last for millennia.\nTo help demonstrate the feasibility of this new method, EPFL’s Metamedia Center provided recordings of two famous songs played at the Montreux Jazz Festival: “Tutu” by Miles Davis, and “Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple. Twist Bioscience and its research partners encoded the recordings, transformed them into DNA strands and then sequenced and decoded them and played them again – without any reduction in quality.\nThe amount of artificial DNA strands needed to record the two songs is invisible to the naked eye, and the amount needed to record all 50 years of the Festival’s archives, which have been included in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register, would be equal in size to a grain of sand. “Our partnership with EPFL in digitizing our archives aims not only at their positive exploration, but also at their preservation for the next generations,” says Thierry Amsallem, president of the Claude Nobs Foundation. “By taking part in this pioneering experiment which writes the songs into DNA strands, we can be certain that they will be saved on a medium that will never become obsolete!”\nA new concept of time \nAt EPFL’s first-ever ArtTech forum, attendees got to hear the two songs played after being stored in DNA, using a demonstrator developed at the EPFL+ECAL Lab. The system shows that being able to store data for thousands of years is a revolutionary breakthrough that can completely change our relationship with data, memory and time. “For us, it means looking into radically new ways of interacting with cultural heritage that can potentially cut across civilizations,” says Nicolas Henchoz, head of the EPFL+ECAL Lab.\nQuincy Jones, a longstanding Festival supporter, is particularly enthusiastic about this technological breakthrough: “With advancements in nanotechnology, I believe we can expect to see people living prolonged lives, and with that, we can also expect to see more developments in the enhancement of how we live. For me, life is all about learning where you came from in order to get where you want to go, but in order to do so, you need access to history! And with the unreliability of how archives are often stored, I sometimes worry that our future generations will be left without such access... So, it absolutely makes my soul smile to know that EPFL, Twist Bioscience and their partners are coming together to preserve the beauty and history of the Montreux Jazz Festival for our future generations, on DNA! I've been a part of this festival for decades and it truly is a magnificent representation of what happens when different cultures unite for the sake of music. Absolute magic.

{"id": 589, "text": "In a paper published in the journal Cell Reports, researchers at EPFL’s Blue Brain Project, a Swiss Brain Research Initiative, have developed a new framework to work out how a single neuron in the brain operates.\nThe analysis was performed using cells from the Blue Brain’s virtual rodent cortex. The researchers expect other types of neurons – non-cortical or human – to operate in the same way.\nTheir results show that when a neuron receives input, the branches of the elaborate tree-like receptors extending from the neuron, known as dendrites, functionally work together in a way that is \nadjusted to the complexity of the input\n.\nThe strength of a synapse determines how strongly a neuron feels an electric signal coming from other neurons, and the act of learning changes this strength. By analyzing the “connectivity matrix” that determines how these synapses communicate with each other, the algorithm establishes when and where synapses group into independent learning units from the structural and electrical properties of dendrites. In other words, the new algorithm determines how the dendrites of neurons functionally break up into separate computing units and finds that they work together \ndynamically, depending on the workload,\n to process information\n.\nThe researchers liken their results to the functioning of computing technology already implemented today. This newly observed dendritic functionality acts like parallel computing units meaning that a neuron is able to process different aspects of the input in parallel, like supercomputers. Each of the parallel computing units can independently learn to adjust its output, much like the nodes in deep learning networks used in artificial intelligence (AI) models today. Comparable to cloud computing, a neuron dynamically breaks up into the number of separate computing units demanded by the workload of the input.\n“In the Blue Brain Project, this mathematical approach helps to ascertain functionally relevant clusters of neuronal input which are inputs that feed into the same parallel processing unit. This then enables us to determine the level of complexity at which to model cortical networks as we digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain,” explains Marc-Oliver Gewaltig, Section Manager in Blue Brain’s Simulation Neuroscience Division.\nParallel computing units of neurons can independently learn to adjust their output\nAdditionally, the research reveals how these parallel processing units influence learning, i.e. the change in connection strength between different neurons. The way a neuron learns depends on the number and location of parallel processors, which in turn depend on the signals arriving from other neurons. For instance, certain synapses that do not learn independently when the neuron’s input level is low, start to learn independently when the input levels are higher.\nTo date traditional learning algorithms (such as those currently used in A.I. applications) assume that neurons are static units that merely integrate and re-scale incoming signals. By contrast, the results show that the number and size of the independent subunits can be controlled by balanced input or shunting inhibition. The researchers propose that this temporary control of the compartmentalization constitutes a powerful mechanism for the branch-specific learning of input features.\n“The method finds that in many brain states, neurons have far fewer parallel processors than expected from dendritic branch patterns. Thus, many synapses appear to be in “grey zones” where they do not belong to any processing unit,” explains lead scientist and first author Willem Wybo. “However, in the brain, neurons receive varying levels of background input and our results show that the number of parallel processors varies with the level of background input, indicating that the same neuron might have different computational roles in different brain states.”\n“We are particularly excited about this observation since it sheds a new light on the role of up/down states in the brain and it also provides a reason as to why cortical inhibition is so location-specific. With the new insights, we can start looking for algorithms that exploit the rapid changes in pairing between processing units, offering us more insight into the fundamental question of how the brain computes,” concludes Gewaltig.", "summary": "How do neurons process information?

{"id": 590, "text": "Many areas of fundamental research are interested in graphene owing to its exceptional characteristics. It is made of one layer of carbon atoms, which makes it light and sturdy, and it is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Despite its apparently limitless potential, however, few applications have been demonstrated to date. Scientists at EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory (BIOS) together with researchers from the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO, Spain) have now added another one. They have harnessed graphene’s unique optical and electronic properties to develop a reconfigurable highly sensitive molecule sensor. The results are described in an article appearing in the latest edition of the journal \nScience\n. \n Focussing light to improve sensing \n The researchers used graphene to improve on a well-­‐known molecule-­‐detection method: infrared absorption spectroscopy. In the standard method, light is used to excite the molecules, which vibrate differently depending on their nature. It can be compared to a guitar string, which makes different sounds depending on its length. By virtue of this vibration, the molecules reveal their presence and even their identity. This “signature” can be “read” in the reflected light. \n This method is not effective, however, in detecting nanometrically-­‐sized molecules. The wavelength of the infrared photon directed at a molecule is around 6 microns (6,000 nanometres – 0.006 millimeters), while the target measures only a few nanometres (about 0.000001 mm). It is very challenging to detect the vibration of such a small molecule in reflected light. \n There is where graphene comes in. If given the correct geometry, the graphene is able to focus the light on a precise spot on its surface and “hear” the vibration of a nanometric molecule that is attached to it. “We first pattern nanostructures on the graphene surface by bombarding it with electron beams and etching it with oxygen ions,” said Daniel Rodrigo, co‐author of the publication. “When the light arrives, the electrons in graphene nanostructures begin to oscillate. This phenomenon, known as ‘localized surface plasmon resonance,’ serves to concentrate light into tiny spots, which are comparable with the dimensions of the target molecules. It is then possible to detect nanometric structures.”\nReconfiguring graphene in real time to see the molecule’s structure\n There is more to it. In addition to identifying the presence of nanometric molecules, this process can also reveal the nature of the bonds connecting the atoms that the molecule is composed of.\nWhen a molecule vibrates, it does not give off only one type of \"sound.\" It produces a whole range of vibrations, which are generated by the bonds connecting the different atoms. Returning to the example of the guitar: each string vibrates differently and together they form one musical instrument. These nuances provide information on the nature of each bond and on the health of the entire molecule. “These vibrations act as a fingerprint that allow us to identify the molecule; such as proteins, and can even tell their health status” said Odeta Limaj, another co-­author of the publication.\nIn order to pick up the sound given off by each of the strings, it has to be possible to identify a whole range of frequencies. And that is something graphene can do. The researchers “tuned” the graphene to different frequencies by applying voltage, which is not possible with current sensors. Making graphene's electrons oscillate in different ways makes it possible to “read” all the vibrations of the molecule on its surface. “We tested this method on proteins that we attached to the graphene. It gave us a full picture of the molecule,” said Hatice Altug.\nA big step closer to using graphene for molecule sensing\n The new graphene-­‐based process represents a major step forward for the researchers, for several reasons. First, this simple method shows that it is possible to conduct a complex analysis using only one device, while it normally requires many different ones. And all this without stressing or modifying the biological sample. Second, it shows graphene’s incredible potential in the area of detection. “There are many possible applications,” said Altug. “We focussed on biomolecules, but the method should also work for polymers, and many other substances,” she added.\n Source :\nDaniel Rodrigo et al.

Patek Philippe and EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) are announcing today the creation of a new chair, the Patek Philippe Chair, dedicated to the application of new micro- and nanotechnologies to watchmaking.\nPatek Philippe’s contribution will be to fund the position of a professor and his or her research team, and EPFL will essentially provide infrastructure. The new Chair will be part of the Neuchâtel-based Institute of Microengineering (IMT). This entity, which has been part of EPFL since 2009, is growing rapidly and is becoming a center of excellence, thanks to the creation of several new research teams and a network that brings together all the major players in the Swiss microengineering industry. Neuchâtel is an advantageous location, since the Jura region is the historical seat of many watchmaking and high-tech companies. This Chair will build a bridge between the private sector and academic research.\n“This agreement is in line with the strong growth that the watchmaking industry is currently experiencing, and for which new technologies and materials have become essential,” emphasizes Nico de Rooij, IMT Director and Vice President of CSEM SA. The horologic industry provided more than 50,000 jobs and some 16 billion Swiss francs in exports in 2010.\nMany avenues to explore\nTo maintain this position and its competitiveness, the industry must continually innovate. “There is much progress to be made, particularly in increasing the energy efficiency of the movements in order to be able to make ever smaller mechanisms and components, and in increasing reliability and the power reserve,” explains Jean-Pierre Musy, technical director at Patek Philippe.\nThe research touches on all production phases: from manufacturing processes to escapement mechanisms to components such as the train and the balance-spring that must be made more efficient, uniform, robust and easy to assemble. A particularly important area of exploration will be developing new high-tech materials, in the continuing quest for properties that will reduce friction, add to esthetics, and improve wear resistance – much like single-crystal silicon, which has revolutionized the industry over the past several years thanks to its elastic properties which have permitted the creation of carefully crafted geometries that allow improved watch movements.\nThe person nominated to this Chair will thus have as his or her objective to investigate a number of research avenues, to assemble a team and to train researchers and scientists to become experts in the field so that they can continue to improve and promote these innovations.", "summary": "Developing new high-tech materials and conducting research in cutting edge micro- and nano-technologies for the flourishing watchmaking industry: this is the goal of the new Patek Philippe Chair.

{"id": 598, "text": "How do buildings affect and interact with each other? How comfortable are people in the world’s cities, which are growing both physically and demographically and consume 75% of the world’s energy? It turns out that the EPFL campus is the perfect testing ground for getting a sense of how cities work and identifying long-term solutions. Wind, heat island, thermal bridges, paved and unpaved surfaces, microclimates – the campus has it all. This makes it ideal for conducting an in-depth analysis of energy demand in buildings and how this correlates to human comfort in the outdoor environment.\nHuman comfort is not a new topic of study for researchers. Given its complexity, however, architects and urban planners do not find it easy to incorporate into their work. “We can quantify thermal and visual comfort inside buildings, but it’s very difficult to do the same outside,” says Silvia Coccolo, a researcher at EPFL’s Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB) who wrote her PhD thesis on this topic. “We can start by looking at where people like to walk around and sit, where they are naturally drawn to, in order to see whether a given site is comfortable and, if so, during what time of the year – since this can vary with the seasons.” Coccolo continues: “Two important aspects are taken into account when quantifying thermal comfort: the energy balance between the amount of heat absorbed and emitted by the body, and psychological perception, which is a subjective sensation.”\nCoccolo identified dozens of microclimates at EPFL, which are the product of the campus’s urban and environmental design; the Avenue du Tir-Fédéral is a wind tunnel, while the Rolex Learning Center, with its unique architecture, creates irregular temperature fluctuations and air currents. The Dorigny forest, which is very popular in the summer, also plays an important role in the local climate. “Sitting in the new Place Cosandey is not at all like sitting at the SwissTech Convention Center: on the same day and with the same air temperature, you feel totally different in both places.”\nCoccolo sought to determine how the EPFL campus architecture should be adapted as the climate changes. Worldwide temperatures are expected to rise by 1.5 degrees, as announced at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. However, ambient temperature readings in the alpine region are rising twice as fast as the global average. The researcher’s first step was to assess the campus’ energy balance; she looked at individual buildings and the effect that buildings have on each other. Summers will be hotter and hotter, and this will be felt more in built spaces than in wooded ones. Existing buildings will have to be renovated, and new buildings will require design changes. Particular attention will have to be paid to the exterior of buildings: “Vegetation moderates microclimates and blocks solar and infrared radiation, evapotranspiration reduces the air temperature, and plants provide shade,” says Coccolo. “These factors completely change our perceived thermal comfort.”\nTurning climate challenges into design opportunities\nTo offset the expected rise in summer temperatures, the study shows that, in addition to proper insulation, buildings and their immediate surroundings will need to provide more shade through protective features according to the level of solar radiation, the direction the building faces and the season. For Coccolo, this goes beyond simply multiplying the number of plants and trees; the focus should be on what truly enhances comfort. This may include such things as foliage density and plant height. Replacing asphalt with grass, for example, can radically change our thermal perception.\nThe Urban Systems group at the LESO-PB believes that, in the future, architects and urban planners will need to work together in designing the space between buildings, which is just as important as the space inside them (leso.epfl.ch/urbansimulation).\nPress Kit\nContacts\nSandy Evangelista\n Press Service EPFL\n +4179 502 81 06\nSilvia Coccolo\n Postdoctoral Researcher\n +41 21 693 4543\nJean-Louis Scartezzini \nDirector of the Laboratory of Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory\n +41 21 693 55 49", "summary": "In the year 2100, temperatures at EPFL are expected to be similar to those currently experienced in Perugia, in central Italy.

{"id": 599, "text": "You can’t miss the three little white eggs that have been driving noiselessly around the EPFL campus on four wheels since 7 May. Halfway between a car and a bike, these electric vehicles are available to users on campus for free. And testers have not been hard to find. “We were expecting about 50 people to sign up, but we’ve had more than 250. We had planned for each vehicle to do two or three runs a day, but they’ve actually done between eight and 13!” exclaims Yoann Loetscher, one of the two founders of the startup, ENUU.\nWorking in partnership with EPFL’s Sustainable Campus initiative, the Biel-based company is using the campus as a micro lab until 1 June. Users have been testing everything about the vehicles, from how easy they are to reserve and operate using the app to their technical features, fleet management and battery recharging. The aim is to fine-tune the design before a fleet of self-service vehicles is rolled out for public use in Biel in mid-July.\nThis initiative is a first for shared mobility. Let’s start with the vehicle itself. It’s manufactured in China and modified slightly for use in Switzerland. It’s electric, about as wide as a scooter, and has handlebars and a seat – you ride it like a bike but it’s as stable as a car. You don’t need a driver’s license, and the vehicle is allowed on bike paths up to a speed limit of 30km/h. For Loetscher, what makes the vehicles stand out is that they offer the advantages of electric bikes along with protection from the rain like cars.\nThe concept is also a first. Once you’ve signed up for the service, you can locate and reserve one of these mini vehicles via an app. The vehicle’s door will open automatically when the reservation begins – and off you go! At EPFL, the vehicles are available free of charge, but the journey can’t last more than 15 minutes. In Biel, where 13 vehicles will be available, users will be able to take three free trips a day lasting a total of 30 minutes. After that, they’ll have to pay.\nResearch projects in the pipeline\n“This pilot phase is crucial for ENUU because it allows us to collect a whole range of data on everything from battery life to areas of use. We’ve noticed, for example, that people use the vehicles a lot around avenues Piccard and Forel and less so near the SG building and at EPFL Innovation Park,” explains Loetscher, an automotive engineer who graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Biel.\nFirst time users are thrown a little off kilter at the start but then get used to driving the egg-shaped vehicle in no time. Some testers regularly take the vehicles for a short 15-minute spin, while others use them to get from point A to point B. Some students have even tried racing two of the vehicles. The pilot project includes a qualitative analysis that will soon be conducted with the testers, even though the campus is not the target location for this type of vehicle.\nThe partnership between ENUU and EPFL began a year ago when the startup contacted the Transport Center. “It’s our role to encourage projects that combine research, innovation and the economy,” says Simone Amorosi, the Center’s Deputy Director. “ENUU is now in talks with two EPFL labs about possible research projects. One involves vehicle autonomy, while the other is aimed at optimizing operational management.”", "summary": "The electric car-sharing vehicle designed by Biel-based startup ENUU has proved to be a big hit on the EPFL campus, where it has been tested since 7 May.", "claim": "The electric car-sharing vehicle designed by Biel-based startup ENUU has proved to be a big hit on the EPFL campus, where it has been tested since 30 minutes", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "DateSwap", "augmentation_span": [31, 32], "noise": false}
{"id": 600, "text": "Treatments for beating tumours are mainly based on CD8 T lymphocytes, which specialise in detecting and eliminating intracellular infections and in killing cancer cells. A large proportion of patients, however, do not respond to these treatments. This prompted a research team from the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman (SCCL, Switzerland) to bring together the universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL), the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), EPFL and CHUV to investigate CD4 T lymphocytes. While these play a supporting role with CD8 T cells, their ability to eliminate tumour cells directly has been a matter of controversy. Using innovative nanoimaging technologies designed at the EPFL's School of Engineering laboratory, the scientists found that when the CD4 T lymphocytes were directly put in close contact to the cancer cells, up to a third of them could also kill them. This discovery, the subject of an article in \nScience Advances\n, is significant and broadens the therapeutic perspectives based on administering CD4 T lymphocytes to patients who are resistant to conventional therapies.\nWhen cancer cells proliferate in our bodies, our immune system kicks in. The first line of fighters capable of destroying tumour cells are CD8 T lymphocytes known as cytotoxic T cells, backed up by CD4 T lymphocytes. The latter secrete factors that help the former in many ways. “That’s why lots of cancer treatments are based on CD8 T lymphocytes,” begins Camilla Jandus, last author of the study and a pro- fessor in the Department of Pathology and Immunology in UNIGE’s Faculty of Medicine and adjunct scientist at LICR. “Unfortunately, some patients don’t respond to these treatments, and so we have to find new ones.”\nThe SCCL team turned their focus to CD4 T lymphocytes, which offer invaluable support to our immune system, as Pedro Romero, a professor in the Department of Fundamental Oncology in UNIL’s Faculty of Medicine and Biology, explains: “These have a much wider spectrum of functional specialisations than CD8 T lymphocytes, and for a long time we didn’t know for sure whether they had the capacity to diffe- rentiate into killer lymphocytes.”\n20,000 individual “boxing rings”\nTo address this question, the scientists examined CD4 T lymphocytes from around twenty patients with melanoma who were being treated at CHUV. “Although melanoma isn’t the most common skin cancer, it is the deadliest, and it’s particularly sensitive to immunotherapies,” spells out Professor Jandus. The researchers isolated the CD4 T lymphocytes from both the blood and fragments of the tumours with the idea of comparing them directly. Dissociated tumour cells and CD4 T cells were co-incubated to observe their behaviour individually. Observation tools were then required to provide highly-advanced resolution down to the single cell level. “We created chips of over 20,000 mini-wells of 65 picolitres (1 picolitre = 10-12 litre) that can accommodate a CD4 T cell and a tumour cell in each of them, and function like boxing rings,” says Hatice Altug, a professor in EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory. The researchers then photographed all these thousands wells simultaneously every five minutes for 24 hours in order to observe the interactions occurring between the two cells from a large set of pairs. “We know that it takes about two and a half hours for a CD8 to kill a tumour cell, and we decided to observe these boxing rings for 24 hours without knowing how, and if, the CD4s would react,” continues Professor Altug.\nA third of the CD4s emerged victorious\nTo the great satisfaction of the scientists, the high-throughput inte- gration of dynamic imaging data showed that up to a third of the CD4 T lymphocytes succeeded in killing the tumour cell to which they were closely linked within five hours. As Professor Romero stresses: “These direct observations at the level of individual lymphocytes, which were revealed for the first time at such a level of sensitivity, definitively confirm the existence of CD4 T lymphocytes capable of killing tumour cells. And this happens while the tumour cells sometimes manage to divert them from their function of providing protective support to make allies of them.”\nPicowell array chip in a standard microscope slide with separated chambbers.\n © 2021 EPFL\nBy analysing the killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes in detail, the scientists found that they expressed the SLAMF7 molecule, which promoted their tumor killer activity. “That’s why we’re now going to isolate and cultivate in vitro the best killer variety of CD4 T lymphocytes so we can turn them into a veritable army of trillions of cells, which we can then inject into patients on whom CD8-based treatments don’t work,” says Dr Jandus. The human body naturally has only a small number of CD4 T lymphocytes directed against tumours, and not enough to defeat them. “The ability to visualise this close combat with our picowell chip paves the way for expanding the arsenal in the fight against cancer, which we now need to develop,” concludes Professor Altug.", "summary": "A team from EPFL and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy them.", "claim": "A team from EPFL and the Swiss Cancer Centre Léman has discovered that CD4 T lymphocytes, which usually play a supporting role in fighting cancer cells, also have the power to destroy them.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 601, "text": "Decision-making has gathered immense interest in fields like psychology, neuroscience, robotics and even economics, with numerous models and software simulating the human mind. However, such models are limited to a type of decision-making that focuses only on each decision step in isolation, without taking into account the preceding decisions leading up to it, although the latter is often our everyday experience. Publishing in \nPLoS One\n, scientists from EPFL and the University of Berne have perfected a model that can simulate this type of decision-making and learning conditions with surprising accuracy.\nDecisions, feedback, learning\nDecision-making comes in two major into two types: Markovian and non-Markovian, named after the mathematician Andrey Markov (1856-1922). Simply put, in Markovian decision-making, the next decision step depends entirely on the current state of affairs. For example, when playing backgammon, the next move depends only on the current layout of the board, and not on how it got to be like that. This relatively straightforward process has been extensively modeled in computers and machines.\nNon-Markovian decision-making is more complex. Here, the next step is affected by other factors, such as external constraints and previous decisions. For example, a person’s goal might be to travel on the train. But what will happens when he arrives at the door to the train depends on whether or not he has previously visited the ticket booth to buy a ticket. In other words, the next step depends on how he got there; without a ticket, he cannot proceed to the desired goal. In neuroscience, the “buy-ticket” step is referred to as a “switch-state”.\nA new model of decision-making\nA team led by Michael Herzog at EPFL and Walter Senn at the University of Berne developed the first biologically plausible model that can handle non-Markovian decision-making. Herzog’s group has now tested it with humans as well as various computer models. The model, developed in a previous study, was now validated with two distinct tests, designed by Aaron Michael Clarke and Elisa Tartaglia in Herzog’s lab. The tests were performed by human subjects, and three computer models with different degrees of learning ability. In addition, the test were also taken by an advanced brain model called a “spiking neuron network”, which makes decisions based on whether the majority of neurons in a population fired a signal, or “spike”, and simulates human performance in a very realistic manner.\nThe first experiment tested the impact of the switch-state on people’s decision-making and learning. Users played a computer game where they had to navigate through eight icons (a gun, a car etc.) to finally reach the end goal (called “Yeah!”). Each icon came with three buttons, each leading down a different route, and the user had to decide which one to take. Although there was a relatively short route from the first icon to the goal, it was impossible to go through it unless the user first went through a switch-state icon – an image of a computer. Users repeated the experiment multiple times, becoming increasingly better at deciding which routes to pick. For example, most people took over 80 clicks to get to the goal when they began, but after 40 games, they needed fewer than ten.\nThe second experiment tested how delayed feedback affects decision-making and learning. Here, users were shown a set of experimental images and told that each image belonged to either category one or category two. Each category corresponded to either the left or the right arrow on the keyboard, but the participants were not told which arrow went with which image beforehand. Next, the users were shown each image one at a time, and had to press either the left or right arrow depending on the category of each icon. In response, the screen produce a RIGHT or WRONG feedback message. As the test went on, the feedback became delayed, to the point where feedback from one icon would come after the feedback for the next icon had appeared.\nDecision dynamics\nThe results of the study drew three major conclusions. First, that human decision-making can perform just as well as current sophisticated computer models under non-Markovian conditions, such as the presence of a switch-state. This is a significant finding in our current efforts to model the human brain and develop artificial intelligence systems.\nSecondly, that delayed feedback significantly impairs human decision-making and learning, even though it does not impact the performance of computer models, which have perfect memory. In the second experiment, it took human participants ten times more attempts to correctly recall and assign arrows to icons. Feedback is a crucial element of decision-making and learning. We set a goal, make a decision about how to achieve it, act accordingly, and then find out whether or not our goal was met. In some cases, e.g. learning to ride a bike, feedback on every decision we make for balancing, pedaling, braking etc. is instant: either we stay up and going, or we fall down. But in many other cases, such as playing backgammon, feedback is significantly delayed; it can take a while to find out if each move has led us to victory or not.\nFinally, the researchers found that the spiking neurons model matches and describes human performance very well. The significance of this cannot be overstated, as non-Markovian decision-making has proven to be very challenging for computer models. “This is a proof-of-concept study,” says Michael Herzog. “But the study makes an important contribution toward understanding, and accurately modeling, the human brain – and even surpassing its abilities with artificial intelligence.”\nThis study represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute with the University of Berne. \nReference\n Clarke AM, Friedrich J, Tartaglia EM, Marchesotti S, Senn W, Herzog MH. \nHuman and Machine Learning in Non-Markovian Decision Making.\nPLoS One\n 21 April 2015. 10(4): e0123105.

The company will launch its new microscope on Monday at the world’s largest cellular biology conference that will be held in San Diego, in the United States.\n3D Cell Explorer is a new type of microscope that will add another dimension to our understanding of how cells work. Thanks to its specially designed software, users can tint various parts of a living cell and observe the cell’s behavior and reactions in real time at a resolution of 200 nanometers. That’s three times smaller than what current microscopes offer. The device works like an MRI scanner: it takes images at different depths in the cell, which it then reassembles using its smart holographic software which can tint any part of the scanned cell based on its refractive index.\nMedically assisted procreation\n The success rate of medically assisted procreation is currently around 30%. This rate could improve with this new microscope. These days, the only way to observe spermatozoids and eggs with the same resolution is to stain them, and that kills the cells. So it is impossible to know what would have happened if these cells had been put into contact. The new microscope could offer promising prospects because it makes it possible to observe the various parts of the ovules and spermatozoids in detail before, during and after they come together. This type of longitudinal study could also be useful in other fields of research, including research on cancer, stem cells, cell therapy and histopathology.\nNanolive was launched two years ago on the basis of a technology developed by its founder, Yann Cotte, during his doctoral studies at EPFL. Since then, the company has grown with the help of some start-up funds and crowdfunding. Among the first customers for the microscope will be Universities and biotech, medtech, pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies.\nNanolive is also developing applications for use by doctors, and these are expected to hit the market in the medium term.

They are awarded independently of nationality, sex or family situation. Only the applicants’ competencies are taken into account. The researchers are thus able to devote their entire attention to their research work. The only condition for applying is to have obtained a doctoral degree at EPFL. “All those who received one of these grants said that it had been a springboard for their professional career”, adds Caroline Vandevyver.\n EPFL and its teachers strongly encourage these research periods abroad. They constitute an almost inevitable step in a scientific career, are practically essential in becoming a professor, and a major asset in being selected for important positions. The likelihood of becoming a professor is greater for someone who has benefited from a grant. In a recent study, the EPFL Research Commission has observed that 17% of post-doctoral scholarship students began an academic career, but that only 23% of them came back to Switzerland to pursue it. We might therefore wonder: what is the benefit for a university such as EPFL to see its best people leave? This question of brain drain versus brain gain has been assessed in depth both at EPFL and the FNS, and the two institutions have reached the conclusion that the benefits of this type of sponsorship is extremely positive, and contributes to increasing the visibility of Switzerland internationally. FNS scholarship students are ambassadors for EPFL worldwide: they increase the institutions renown, and stimulate other researchers to come to study or work in Switzerland. Knowledge is on the move, is no longer limited to domestic borders, and enriches exchanges between researchers. It’s thus by emphasizing openness that institutions such as EPFL encourage scientific careers and guarantee that there is a continued supply of scientists.", "summary": "16% of doctoral students who were granted fellowships for prospective researchers by the Swiss National Science Foundation (FNS), giving them the possibility to do research abroad, have obtained a professorship, some of them at EPFL.", "claim": "only 23% of doctoral students who were granted fellowships for prospective researchers by the Swiss National Science Foundation (FNS), giving them the possibility to do research abroad, have obtained a professorship, some of them at EPFL.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [0, 2], "noise": false}
{"id": 606, "text": "How much light do you receive over the course of a day? What type of light enters your eyes? Spectrace, a new piece of wearable tech, could soon provide the answers to these questions. In a groundbreaking move, researchers at EPFL’s Laboratory of Integrated Performance in Design (LIPID) have teamed up with teachers and students from Geneva School of Art and Design (HEAD – Genève) to develop a light sensor concept. The device, which rests around the neck like a pair of headphones or can be attached to an item of clothing with a magnetic pin, is designed to be worn all day long – at work, during exercise and in social settings.\nThe project has just been awarded an InnoSuisse grant in the eHealth category. Earlier this year, the project received support through an Explorer Grant from the ENAC InnoSeed program at EPFL. This new funding will be used to develop a modular, working prototype and test it in real-world conditions by 2021, with the aim of founding a spin-off to bring the Spectrace sensor to the wider scientific community and the general public. \nCircadian rhythms\nSince the discovery of melanopsin 20 years ago, scientists have taken a growing interest in how a shortage of natural light and excessive exposure to artificial light from screens affect our bodies. Melanopsin, a blue-light-sensitive photopigment found in the human eye, helps keep the body’s internal clock on track and tells our brain whether it’s day or night. It is responsible for synchronizing all our circadian rhythms, and this has a significant impact on our health, from regulating our sleep and our hormone cycle – including the production of melatonin at night – to the ability of our immune system to function properly.\n“We urgently need to pay more attention to our ‘light hygiene’,” says Professor Marilyne Andersen, the director of LIPID and an expert in the field for some 15 years. “We spend so long indoors, which means we’re suffering from a chronic shortage of daylight, and staring at screens all the time, which has especially negative effects at night. We should in fact be getting plentiful light that is rich in blue wavelengths during the day, in order to accumulate a sufficient amount, as this will make us feel better, and limiting this exposure well before bedtime.”\nGap to fill\nVarious types of wearable light sensors exist on the market. Yet none of them can truly measure our exposure to the spectral range of light, i.e., as a function of the light’s wavelength (all the constituent “colors”). That’s what’s new about the prototype developed by EPFL. There is currently not enough data on the type of light to which we are actually exposed as a result of our daily activities and the environment in which we live and work. The physiological effects of light depend not only on its intensity and how long we’re exposed to it, but its spectrum as well. That’s the gap that the new Spectrace sensor is meant to fill.\n Forrest Webler, as part of his PhD research at LIPID, which is being jointly supervised by Prof. Andersen and Dr. Manuel Spitschan at the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology, is working on the concept of the “spectral diet” in order to develop a light exposure classification system.\nWebler’s first step was to source a miniature spectrometer designed for the food processing industry by South Korean startup nanoLambda. Teaming up with Giorgia Chinazzo, then a postdoctoral researcher at LIPID who was involved in this project from the start, he then brought in some EPFL electronics students to repurpose the spectrometer, turning it into a wearable device – with a built-in UV sensor and photometer – that offers a time resolution of less than a second. \nCollaboration with HEAD – Genève\nAt the same time, EPFL worked with Product and Media/interaction designers from HEAD – Genève at a workshop in July 2019, with close to ten students and alumni, that was led by Laure Krayenbuhl, the founder of Biel-based a-project studio. Their mission was to come up with an attractive design that people would be happy to wear. After exploring a variety of concepts, from over-ear and lapel-pin designs to biomaterial patches, they eventually settled on a smart collar-style device with alternative pin attachment systems. The development process intensified this past fall, with the design and technical aspects influencing each other and evolving synergistically. \nIs the spectral profile of people who bike, drive and take the metro to work so different that it affects their health and well-being? Do office window size and orientation matter? Researchers at LIPID will be tackling these questions and more in the coming years.", "summary": "Daylight plays an essential role in sleep, alertness and hormone regulation.

The inner image shows two mitochondrial haplotypes: green linked to low food intake and red to high food intake. Credit: Maria Litovchenko/Roel Bevers\nMany of the characteristics that make people so different from each other, are often the result of small differences in the DNA between individuals. Variation in just a single base in our DNA can cause significant variation in traits like sleep length, weight, height etc. And, unfortunately, they can also become a source of disease.\nTo confidently connect variation within a gene or genome (what biologists call “genotypes”) and variation in traits (“phenotypes”), scientists ideally need standardized genetic tools. One of these is the \nDrosophila\n Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), which consists of more than 200 lines of the fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster\n. Each line in the DGRP has had its genome fully sequenced so that scientists can spot differences between genotypes and then connect these to differences between phenotypes of interest.\nMost of the DNA in eukaryotic cells – the cells that make up higher organisms like fruit flies and humans – sits tightly packed inside the cell’s nucleus. But almost all eukaryotic cells also have mitochondria, an organelle often referred to as the “powerhouse of the cell”. Mitochondria are unique in that they have their own DNA with its own distinct set of genes.\nStudies have hinted that variation in mitochondrial genes is associated with diseases like obesity, type-2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. The problem is that, unlike “regular” genes in nuclear genomes, we actually know very little about how variation in mitochondrial genes relates to variation in phenotypes.\nThis is what Roel Bevers and Maria Litovchenko from  at EPFL have addressed in a paper published in \nNature Metabolism\n. The researchers carried out a comprehensive study connecting variation in mitochondrial DNA with various traits in DGRP fruit-fly lines. The findings can be incorporated into future genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to gain more detailed information about how variation in genes – nuclear and mitochondrial, and their interactions – affect various traits and diseases.\n“So far, DGRP studies have mostly focused on genetic variants in the nucleus because of low mitochondrial DNA coverage,” says Deplancke. “In this study, we wanted to investigate the impact of mitochondrial DNA variation on traits in these fly lines.”\nHis team re-sequenced mitochondrial genomes of 169 DGRP fruit-fly lines, which allowed them to identify 231 gene variants. They then looked at “mitochondrial DNA haplotypes”, which are groups of variants which are always inherited together, identifying 12 distinct haplotypes among the studied fly lines.\nInterestingly, these haplotypes were found to be associated with a range of metabolic phenotypes and diseases. “We found many links to stress- and metabolism-related traits, including food intake in males,” says Deplancke. To confirm this, the researchers swapped mitochondrial genomes between fruit fly lines, which actually changed the eating behavior of males: the mitochondrial haplotype associated with high food intake could increase food intake in fly lines that initially displayed a low food-intake.\nThe work can help future studies by providing a higher resolution to connect genes and traits, e.g. feeding behavior. “There is important mitochondrial haplotype-specific metabolic variation in the DGRP,” conclude the authors. “This demonstrates the importance of incorporating such haplotypes in genotype-phenotype relationship studies.”\nOther contributors\nEPFL (Laboratory of Integrative Systems Physiology)\nSwiss Institute of Bioinformatics\nUniversity of Lausanne (Complex Trait Genetics Group, Robinson Lab)", "summary": "To uncover the relationship between variation in genes and phenotypic diversity, geneticists use a set of fully sequenced fruit-fly genomes.

{"id": 608, "text": "Artificial intelligence shapes our modern lives. It will be one of the defining technologies of the future, with its influence and application expected to accelerate as we go through the 2020s. Yet, the stakes are high; with the countless benefits that AI brings, there is also growing academic and public concern around a lack of transparency, and its misuse, in many areas of life.\nIt’s in this environment that the European Commission has become one of the first political institutions in the world to release a  that could be a game-changer towards a regulatory framework for AI. In addition, this year the European Parliament  on how the EU can best regulate artificial intelligence to boost innovation, ethical standards and trust in technology.\nRecently, an all-virtual conference on the ‘\n Technology\n’ hosted by EPFL’s  (IRGC) and the  explored the principles needed to govern existing and emerging digital technologies, as well as the potential danger of decision-making algorithms and how to prevent these from causing harm.\nStuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and author of the popular textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, proposed that there is huge upside potential in AI, but we are already seeing the risks from the poor design of AI systems, including the impacts of online misinformation, impersonation and deception.\n“I believe that if we don't move quickly, human beings will just be losing their rights, their powers, their individuality and becoming more and more the subject of digital technology rather than the owners of it. For example, there is already AI from 50 different corporate representatives sitting in your pocket stealing your information, and your money, as fast as it can, and there's nobody in your phone who actually works for you. Could we rearrange that so that the software in your phone actually works for you and negotiates with these other entities to keep all of your data private?” he asked.\nReinforcement learning algorithms, that select the content people see on their phones or other devices, are a major problem he continued, “they currently have more power than Hitler or Stalin ever had in their wildest dreams over what billions of people see and read for most of their waking lives. We might argue that running these kinds of experiments without informed consent is a bad idea and, just as we have with pharmaceutical products, we need to have stage 1, 2, and 3 trials on human subjects and look at what effect these algorithms have on people's minds and behavior.”\nBeyond regulating artificial intelligence aimed at individual use, one of the conference debates focused on how governments might use AI in developing and implementing public policy in areas such as healthcare, urban development or education. Bryan Ford, an Associate Professor at EPFL and head of the  (DEDIS) in the , argued that while the cautious use of powerful AI technologies can play many useful roles in low-level mechanisms used in many application domains, it has no legitimate role to play in defining, implementing, or enforcing public policy.\n“Matters of policy in governing humans must remain a domain reserved strictly for humans. For example, AI may have many justifiable uses in electric sensors to detect the presence of a car - how fast it is going or whether it stopped at an intersection, but I would claim AI does not belong anywhere near the policy decision of whether a car's driver warrants suspicion and should be stopped by Highway Patrol.”\n“Because machine learning algorithms learn from data sets that represent historical experience, AI driven policy is fundamentally constrained by the assumption that our past represents the right, best, or only viable basis on which to make decisions about the future. Yet we know that all past and present societies are highly imperfect so to have any hope of genuinely improving our societies, governance must be visionary and forward looking,” Professor Ford continued.\nArtificial intelligence is heterogeneous and complex. When we talk about the governance of, and by, AI are we talking about machine learning, neural networks or autonomous agents, or the different applications of any of these in different areas? Likely, all the above in many different applications. We are only at the beginning of the journey when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, one that most participants agreed has geopolitical implications.\n“These issues may lead directly to a set of trade and geostrategic conflicts that will make them all the more difficult to resolve and all the more crucial. The question is not only to avoid them but to avoid the decoupling of the US from Europe, and Europe and the US from China, and that is going to be a significant challenge economically and geo-strategically,” suggested John Zysman, Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and co-Director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy.\n“Ultimately, there is a thin red line that AI should not cross and some regulation, that balances the benefits and risks from AI applications, is needed. The IRGC is looking at some of the most challenging problems facing society today, and it’s great to have them as part of IC,” said James Larus, Dean of the IC School and IRGC Academic Director.\nConcluding the conference, Marie-Valentine Florin, Executive Director of the IRGC reminded participants that artificial intelligence is a means to an end, not the end, “as societies we need a goal. Maybe that could be something like the Green Deal around sustainability to perhaps give a sense to today’s digital transformation. Digital transformation is the tool, and I don't think society has collectively decided a real objectivel for it yet. That’s what we need to figure out.”", "summary": "EPFL computer science professor tells conference that AI has no legitimate roll in defining, implementing, or enforcing public policy.", "claim": "EPFL computer science professor tells conference that AI has no legitimate roll in defining, implementing, or enforcing public policy.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 609, "text": "One of the biggest obstacles in successfully treating metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, fatty liver etc, is the variation in the way patients respond to medication. The key to this variation lies in the inherent biological differences between individuals, which cannot all be explained genetically. At the same time, this variation makes it very difficult to develop \"standard\" treatments for certain diseases. In a groundbreaking initiative, EPFL and ETHZ scientists have developed a strategy that can define and explain metabolic differences between individuals, essentially paving the way for precision medicine. The work, which also highlights significant issues with animal-based drug studies, is .\nWe are increasingly learning that medical interventions can be more successful when they are tailored to the specific profile of the individual patient. The problem is that defining that profile is extremely difficult, as it involves information on the person's genome, proteins, fats, and all sorts of other layers of biology that make up their tissues and body. And so far, the only differences that we have been seriously taking into account are those found between genes.\nThis is what the labs of  and  set out to solve with their recently published study. Looking at 40 different mice strains, the researchers successfully connected the variation between individuals' genomes to the variation between their proteomes -- their full set of proteins. In this way, they took a giant leap in profiling the biology of a particular individual.\n\"There is a black box between a patient's genome and their disease,\" says Johan Auwerx, whose lab handled the genome side of the study. \"What we have done here is find a way to fill the black box by obtaining information on the patient's proteome.\"\n\"It's much more complex to measure the set of proteins than to sequence the entire genome,\" says Yibo Wu, co-lead author of the study. The scientists used protein data from mice, which they obtained from a new mass spectrometry technique that Aebersold's group developed, known as SWATH-MS. This is a technique that combines the advantages of high-throughput mass spectrometry with high reproducibility and consistency. In short, it is able to identify thousands of different proteins in hundreds of samples much faster and accurately than conventional techniques, allowing the researchers to measure the concentrations of a broad spectrum of liver proteins in the mice.\nThe researchers measured a total of 2,600 different proteins from tissue samples of 40 mice strains, all of which came from the same two ancestors, meaning that they were genetically related to each other. \"We wanted to keep the genetics simple in order to observe differences in the impact of environment (diet) on the proteome, other layers of biology, and their predisposition to develop diseases,\" says Auwerx.\nThe mice were divided into groups of representing each of the 40 strains, and the groups were fed either a high-fat diet - essentially junk food - or a healthy, low-fat diet. Over a few weeks, the scientists charted the mice's physiological data, and tested how fast they could gain weight on the junk-food diet and lose weight by exercising. Despite their similar genetic make-up, the mice on the high-fat diet showed varied responses to diet and exercise. For example, some developed metabolic disorders like fatty liver, while others did not.\nThe researchers then combined the physiological data with data for their genome, their proteome, and their transcriptome, which is essentially their full set of RNAs - another biological \"layer\" in the black box. Through this combination, the scientists were able to better understand the role several proteins play when it comes to metabolizing fat and producing energy from it.\n\"Like the mouse strains in this study, each patient with a disease is genetically different\", says Ruedi Aebersold. \"The approach we used in the mouse cohort can now be applied one-for-one in research on human diseases, and particularly for personalized medicine.\" The SWATH-MS approach is now ready to use in human cohort studies, as the researchers in his group have produces a corresponding database for thousands of human proteins.\n\"The aim here is to be able to customise medical intervention for each patient based on their individual biological makeup, the 'black box',\" says Auwerx. In this vein, his group is now looking at specific drugs that can be used more effectively with this approach to treat metabolic disorders.\nThis work involved a collaboration between EPFL's Interfaculty Institute of Bioengineering with the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology at ETH Zurich, with additional contribution the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the University of Zurich.

{"id": 610, "text": "Neurons are brain cells that communicate with each other by sending electrochemical signals along axons. When a neuron is about to release a signal – in the form of an electric charge – it allows ions to pass through its membrane via ion channels. This ion transfer creates an electrical potential difference between the inside and outside of the cell, and that difference is referred to as the membrane potential.\nA team of researchers at the  within EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI) has come up with a way to monitor changes in membrane potential and to observe ion fluxes by studying the behavior of the water molecules surrounding the membranes of the neurons. The researchers, who successfully tested their method on \nin vitro\n mouse neurons, have just published their findings in \nNo more electrodes or fluorophores\nA better understanding of the electrical activity of neurons could provide insight into a number of processes taking place in our brains. For example, scientists could see whether a neuron is active or resting, or if it is responding to drug treatment. Up until now, the only way to monitor neurons was by injecting fluorophores into, or attaching electrodes onto, the part of the brain being studied – but membrane potential sensitive fluorophores are toxic, and electrodes can damage the neurons.\nRecently, the LBP researchers developed a way of tracking electrical activity in neurons simply by looking at the interactions between water molecules and the neural membranes. “Neurons are surrounded by water molecules, which change orientation in the presence of an electric charge,” says Sylvie Roke, director of the LBP. “When the membrane potential changes, the water molecules will re-orient – and we can observe that.”\nIn their study, the researchers altered the neuronal membrane potential by subjecting the neurons to a rapid influx of potassium ions. This caused the ion channels on the neurons’ surface – which serve to regulate the membrane potential – to open and let the ions through. The researchers then turned off the flow of ions, and the neurons released the ions that they had picked up.\nIn order to monitor this activity, the researchers probed the hydrated neuronal lipid membranes by illuminating the cells with two laser beams of the same frequency. These beams consist of femtosecond laser pulses -using technology for which the 2018 Nobel prize in physics was awarded- so that the water molecules on the interface of the membrane generate photons with a different frequency, known as second-harmonic light.\n“We see both fundamental and applied implications of our research. Not only can it help us understand the mechanisms that the brain uses to send information, but it could also appeal to pharmaceutical companies interested in \nin vitro\n product testing,” adds Roke. “And we have now shown that we can analyze a single neuron or any number of neurons at a time.”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have developed a method to observe the electrical activity of neurons by analyzing the behavior of surrounding water molecules.

{"id": 615, "text": "Gone are the days when the United States and the Soviet Union competed to achieve firsts in spaceflight capability – first in space, first to the moon. That golden age cast a decades-long shadow over space exploration. But that is all changing now, not least with the arrival of new players on the scene. The EPFL Space Center (eSpace) is marking UN World Space Week, the annual October celebration that officially starts today, with a clear statement of its intent to capture the opportunities offered by this decisive turning point.\neSpace, founded in 2014, is expanding and redefining its research priorities with the launch of a new initiative dubbed Sustainable Space Logistics. The move is part of the unit’s ambitious plans to become a center of excellence in equipment and data for space exploration, and in the development of lasting, sustainable space infrastructure.\n“There’s growing talk in space circles of mankind returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent base there,” says eSpace director Jean-Paul Kneib. “But before we can do that, we need to think long and hard about how we design consumables – energy, fuel, water and food – from the standpoint of both recycling and sustainability.”\nIn recent years, more and more governments have launched space programs. Countries like China and India are rising rapidly up the list of world space powers. But the biggest change has been the arrival of private companies on the scene. Firms like SpaceX and EPFL spin-off Astrocast are now sending their own rockets and satellites into space, bringing incredible energy and ground-breaking ideas to the table.\nSatellite constellations\nIn the new space age, satellites are becoming ever smaller – and smarter. Looking ahead, it seems as though satellite constellations are the future, with smaller devices such as CubeSats operating in tandem and forming a robust network that covers more of the Earth’s surface. This development owes much to advances in Internet of Things (IoT) systems.\n“It’s incredible to see how fast technology is evolving,” says Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace who specializes in space debris. “We’re on the cusp of the space research 4.0 era.”\nSince the world’s first satellite was launched over 60 years ago, space has become increasingly cluttered with junk – thousands of pieces of debris ranging from tiny paint chips to rocket stages and entire obsolete satellites. All that debris orbiting the Earth poses a major collision risk, with serious implications for space exploration. In fact, the problem has become so acute in recent years that scientists are having to rethink mission design with junk in mind. The need for sustainable solutions has never been greater.\nSought-after expertise\nEPFL is ideally placed to make the most of this new landscape. “Our skills and expertise are exactly what the space industry is looking for,” says Sonia Ben Hamida, a researcher who recently joined the eSpace team. “In many respects, it’s the perfect fit.”\neSpace’s logistics services could support operations and activities across a broad spectrum of fields, ranging from transport, storage, packaging and distribution, to location, telecommunications, navigation, repair and resupply. Other potential applications include in-orbit manufacturing and assembly, drilling, human presence, surveillance, cleaning, recycling – and more.\nTechnologies developed for other applications by various EPFL labs and startups – especially in microengineering, electronics and robotics – could also be repurposed for use in the space industry. Examples include solar radiation and cosmic ray protective equipment, cleaner propulsion systems, next-generation transport vehicles, and space robots designed to capture junk or move objects around in space. And, of course, artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize viewing, tracking, orientation recognition, and in-orbit assembly systems.\neSpace will define its research priorities after consulting with the European Space Agency (ESA), the Swiss Space Office and other bodies. Pending that decision, manufacturers, scientists, students and other interested parties are invited to contact the center to express their interest.\nTo get in touch with the Sustainable Space Logistics initiative, please write to: \nEPFL Space Center invite participants of all ages, from all around the world to take part in an essay competition to introduce new ideas on the topic of how to develop space logistics services, in a sustainable way:", "summary": "Things are changing in outer space: it is filling with debris, attracting private companies, and raising new technological challenges.

{"id": 616, "text": "The Solar Decathlon was established as an international competition between universities in the United States in 2002. The goal is to design and build a home powered only by solar power in the space of 18 months. Indeed, the Swiss Team has been preparing for the Solar Decathlon 2017 since 2015. This year’s event will take place in Denver, Colorado from October 5-15th. The Swiss Team is made up of around 50 students from four higher education institutions: the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the School of Engineering and Architecture Fribourg (HEIA-FR / HES-SO), the Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD / HES-SO) and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR) united under the banner of the Swiss Living Challenge.\nA multifunctional space...\nThe Swiss team has designed an instigator of change, a neighborhood house that can be integrated into various urban settings. The aim of NeighborHub, as it is called, is to bring neighbors together, working with them on more energy-efficient solutions. There are seven issues to consider: energy, mobility, choice of materials, biodiversity, food, waste management and water management. Visitors can get advice and take part in interactive events and discussions on these seven themes. NeighborHub’s architectural design includes a large multifunctional space to facilitate these various interactions.\n...that speaks to you\nInside NeighborHub there is a temperate zone, the \nskin\n, with a heated space, the \ncore\n, in the middle. These two areas are divided into four modules: an equipment room, a kitchen, a bathroom with a separate dry toilet and a private space with a bedroom. In this shared dwelling, not only the walls but also the furniture and other surfaces speak, as it were, to the building’s occupants by means of printed text and a system of signage devised specially for a shared space. ‘We came up with some catchy phrases to tell visitors about NeighborHub’s features so that they can settle in quickly,’ explains Flavia Viscardi, the student in charge of communication in the building. ‘To complete the house’s vibrant and informative visuals, we’ve used color coding and illustrations.’\nSunshine and plants for the building envelope\nIn line with the Solar Decathlon’s competition rules, solar panels have been installed on NeighborHub’s exterior surfaces, providing 100% of its power. Contrary to common practice, however, these panels are not fixed to the roof; instead, you’ll find the solar and thermal panels on the building’s façades and doors. The external surface consists of photovoltaic cells, together with opaque polycarbonate panels and transparent acrylic panes. ‘The unit also has vertical greenhouses, and an aquaponic system for growing fruit and vegetables with a fish tank below,’ adds Axelle Marchon, the student in charge of coordinating the architectural team.\nA closed water cycle\nThe roof of the building is partly covered by plant matter, and rainwater is collected in the middle. The water used in the NeighborHub can be separated out into various types – much like for waste recycling. The rainwater collected on the roof is used for some domestic appliances, as its low mineral content minimizes scaling. The waste water from these appliances, as well as from showers and sinks, gets used as grey water, which is treated using a phyto-purification process: the water is filtered and purified using a reed bed with different layers of gravel. There is no ‘black water’ from conventional toilets in NeighborHub, as the building is instead equipped with dry toilets. ‘The compost we get from them will provide nutrients for the crops that are grown around the NeighborHub and on the roof, thus completing the circle,’ explains Camilla Wiseman, who, together with her student colleagues, designed the entire water system.\nTimber rooms shipped across the ocean\nThe international nature of the Solar Decathlon competition means the project is subject to an extremely tight timetable. After the building has been constructed, it will be disassembled and must then be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean before reaching the competition venue. This journey cuts down the time allocation for the only two teams based in Europe. This crucial logistical factor was taken into account from the start of the project, however, and so the NeighborHub is made up of modules whose dimensions are suitable for the containers in which they will be shipped. These modules are made entirely out of wood, which is light and has a positive carbon balance. ‘Once the prefabricated modules arrive at the competition venue in Denver, Colorado, they will be assembled, a bit like a Lego house,’ says Matias Cesari, the student in charge of the building site.\nA house like no other\nAs a competition, the Solar Decathlon has focused on traditional dwelling models, featuring a single family home with a car, with various proposed energy and environmental solutions. The competition criteria and rules were therefore devised from this perspective. But are detached houses really in keeping with today’s social and environmental imperatives? ‘NeighborHub not only satisfies the Solar Decathlon criteria, it boldly presents an alternative way of living on a neighborhood scale, that is both collective and environmentally friendly,’ explains Marilyne Andersen, Dean of EPFL’s School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC) and the Faculty Advisor of the project.\nSolid long-term diamond partners\nThe Swiss Living Challenge project could not have made it out of the classrooms without the considerable support of its partners, who provided not just their financial backing but also their expertise. The  is now among the group of institutional partners. The bank  has been a loyal supporter of the project from the very beginning, in keeping with its traditional stance of encouraging Swiss innovation and environmental protection. Landolt is a privileged partner of the EPFL, having worked with it for many years and funded a professorship there. It was therefore only natural for the bank to intensify its commitment to become a Diamond Partner alongside , which has been following the project with great enthusiasm and has contributed its own expertise.\nGroupe E provided technical support throughout all of the project phases.

{"id": 617, "text": "“It’s unexpected and extremely promising!” Luc Thévenaz, the professor in charge of EPFL's Group for Fibre Optics, recently experienced a eureka moment in his research. Picking up on an idea proposed by a discussion group of the European Space Agency, he shifted his attention away from traditional fibers made of glass and focused on the silk strands that spiders produce for their webs. These strands are perfectly cylindrical, smooth, transparent and extremely solid – some of the same characteristics as glass-based fibers.\nBut there is one major difference: while glass is inert, spider silk is made up of very long proteins rolled into a helix structure whose bonds are sensitive to a number of chemical substances.\nReusable chemical sensors \n“The helix in the silk strands unwinds whenever polar molecules like acetic acid and ammonia come into contact with its bonds,” said Dr. Thévenaz. “This measurably modifies the way the strands conduct light, and it gave us the idea of using them to make chemical sensors.”\n The researchers discovered another remarkable property, that the change in the helix structure was completely reversible. A sensor using spider silk could thus be used several times over. “We are looking at the possibility of creating silks by adding molecules meant to react with the substances to be tested. That is often impossible with glass fibers, which we have to heat to more than 1,000°C in order to stretch,” said the researcher. Also, because silk is biodegradable, it is ideal for sensors that could be implanted in a living body without needing to be removed later on.\nSpiders at work \nAt EPFL, doctoral student Desmond Chow and post-doc Kenny Hey Tow are working on natural silk strands with a diameter of 5 microns. They were produced by Australian Nephila edulis spiders grown at the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford. Synthetic silks exist, but they are expensive and do not work as well as real ones.\nThe researchers stretch a silk strand taut in a tiny bracket and direct a laser beam at one end of the strand. At the other end, a polarization analyzer is used to measure infinitesimal changes in the light passing through it. If a gas that interacts with the silk strand is present, the device will pick up on this immediately.\n This research is still in the early stages, but it is already firing the imagination of the fiber optics specialist. “We have presented it at several conferences, where it was met with significant interest,” he said. The study is in the running for research funds. “We are entering a totally new domain that has yet to be explored,” said Dr. Thévenaz.", "summary": "At EPFL, fiber optics specialists have discovered some unique qualities of spider silk when it comes to conducting light and reacting to certain substances.", "claim": "At the Department of Zoology of the University of Oxford, fiber optics specialists have discovered some unique qualities of spider silk when it comes to conducting light and reacting to certain substances.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [1, 9], "noise": false}
{"id": 618, "text": "For his master thesis, Fränz Zeimetz considered several trajectories for building a canal between Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Geneva. He finally chose a segment between Préverenges and Grandson. Such waterway would offer, in his opinion, environmental advantages as well as economic transportation costs. It would also constitute a major touristic attraction. The 38 km long work of art’s estimated cost is 2.5 billion francs...\nRemembering the Entreroches canal\n The student from the Laboratory of Hydraulic Constructions (LCH) has, in a way, revisited the original concept behind the Entreroches canal. Currently disused, some of its course is still visible in some places between Cossonay and Morges.\n The Entreroches canal was the answer to the old European dream of a waterway linking the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The arrival of the railway combined with the lack of money during the 19th century ended this dream abruptly.\nNavigation path\n Departure takes place on the harbor of Grandson, on Lake Neuchâtel. A first tunnel takes you into the Orbe plain which is crossed in the open. Then another tunnel allows you to slide unnoticed under the Mormont hill between Yverdon-les-Bains and Lausanne. In Daillens, the boat gets into a lift and continues its way underground. 6 hours later, you arrive at Lake Geneva in Préverenges.\nA 78 meters lift\nThe Venoge River’s protected course\n Out of the 38 km of the canal, three-quarters pass through tunnels. This is partially caused by the presence of architectural barriers – since there are several towns along its way and it is not always possible to get round them, not to mention too costly. Environmental protection laws forced Fränz Zeimetz to reconsider some of his choices: \"Take the Venoge River for instance: a law dating from 1997 states that it is forbidden to change its natural course, to touch its watershed and to transform its tributaries. Therefore, the best way to get there was underground. \"\nInteractive Tunnels\n Since the canal is designed to transport leisure boats as well as cargo, the student decided to trade his engineering skills for architectural creativity. He thus devised an original way to animate this long underground journey. \"We could project images on the tunnels’ walls showing the outdoor landscapes we are going through or we could even tell the story of the Entreroches canal… why not?\" An engineer has the right to dream.", "summary": "SUMMER SERIES - Student projects (5): An EPFL civil engineering student has envisioned a 38 km long navigation canal between Lake Neuchâtel and Lake Geneva.

EPFL technology monitored his mental states and cardiac rhythm throughout the flight, both in real-time and for post-flight data analysis.\n In a collaboration between EPFL, Hirslanden and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), twenty-seven electrodes placed on Piccard's head measured the electrical activity of his brain, also known as electroencephalogram (EEG).

In an article appearing this summer in the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, he demonstrated that new companies often also choose to set up shop thousands of kilometers, or even continents, away from their parent companies. He looked at U.S.-based international companies specializing in hard disk technology, drawing upon a database of information on 400 U.S. counties. Tucci is familiar with these constant changes taking place in the business environment, because he has been studying them for many years. So why do these companies choose to either stay close to home or head for the horizon?\nWhy stay? \n In the early 2000s, the so-called “agglomeration theory” from evolutionary economics hypothesized that an entrepreneur always chooses to stay in proximity to the parent company, in order to tap into group advantages. This decision allows a new company working in the same sector to benefit from the stability and solidity of the parent company and from on-site provider and client networks. “Our study shows that companies who choose not to move away have more aggressive strategies, and to succeed, they need to maintain local relationships. We also found that those who decide to stay within a restricted perimeter are technologically much more advanced than other spin-outs, but financially quite similar,” Tucci adds.\nWhy move away?\n Companies who decide to leave aren’t banking on technological innovation, but instead are looking for new markets. “Thanks to this study, we now understand better how spin-outs position themselves in the market. In both cases, the companies from which they have spun out often become their principal clients.”\n Another theory, not confirmed by the study, is the “spillover” theory. It hypothesizes that stronger companies don’t want to establish spin-outs in industrial clusters because of “spillovers:” they fear that their ideas or technologies will spill over and be stolen by neighboring competitors. “But this effect can’t be clearly seen from the database we used in this research,” notes Tucci. \n He also observed that the spin-outs that stay typically generate new spin-outs themselves. Tucci points to the case of IBM: “Almost all the big hard disk companies came from IBM.” Its first spin-out was Seagate Technology, created in 1978 by Al Shugart and Finis Conner, a company that manufactured embedded hard disks in Sony’s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox. It set up R&D sites in Silicon Valley and then branched out to Northern Ireland and Singapore. Interestingly enough it has also, in turn, generated several spin-outs of its own.", "summary": "Research at EPFL’s Chair of Corporate Strategy and Innovation has shown that contrary to what was thought from previous studies, spin-outs don’t systematically set up shop near their parent companies.

{"id": 623, "text": "This may be Switzerland’s last stand, since its eligibility for European research and funding programs is in jeopardy. The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.\nEPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).\nEPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.\nHowever, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants. This restriction was temporarily lifted on 15 September 2014.\nThis grace period will end on 9 February 2017. Swiss researchers can therefore still respond to calls for proposals whose deadline falls before that date.\nEPFL H2020 Advanced Grants\nSmit, Berend – MaGic\nThe Materials Genome in Action\nIt is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

{"id": 625, "text": "Swiss and Russian scientists are pooling their scientific expertise to gain better understanding of lake environments. On board ultralight, technology-packed aircraft, they are testing new analysis methods above Lake Geneva and Lake Baikal. With the support of Ferring Pharmaceuticals and the Honorary Consulate of Russia in Lausanne, and with additional help from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the researchers will observe the surfaces of the two lakes from the air. The field campaign has just begun over Lake Geneva. \n In a press conference held on May 14, 2013, the principal investigators unveiled the outlines of the international Léman-Baïkal project. On May 25, the ultralight aircraft will take off on a 7,500 km voyage to Russia. During the flight, EPFL scientists will use on-board technology to study biodiversity. French researchers from the CEA will join the crew for the trip to gain a better understanding of the atmospheric consequences of boreal forest fires. On June 24, the field campaign over Lake Baikal will begin.\nLakes Geneva and Baikal: similarities and differences\n Lake Geneva and Lake Baikal have several things in common. Both glacial lakes are large enough to give rise to complex water circulation phenomena, and both are affected by human activity. They are also different enough that a comparison is of interest. Although Lake Geneva is huge for an Alpine lake, Lake Baikal is on another scale altogether. It’s the world’s largest body of fresh water, stretching more than 600 km in length and with a maximum depth of 1,600 meters. By testing their methods over these two bodies of water, the researchers have ideal conditions in which to develop new analysis methods geared for lake environments. \nState-of-the-art scientific equipment\n One of the ultralights is equipped with a hyperspectral camera that can separate the light spectrum into more than 250 parts. Using this, it becomes possible to see exactly how algae and suspended sediments are distributed and circulate in the layers that rise to the lake surface. The data from the planes will be combined with satellite data as well as water samples taken from a catamaran. Lidars will provide information on atmospheric flow near the surface of the lake. \n River deltas are another important area of research interest. Sidestreams are often vectors of pollution, due to upstream human activity, and their discharge introduces complex flows known as “plumes” into the lake. By clarifying the complex dynamics of this phenomenon, the scientists hope to be able to better understand how pollutants spread. During the first exploration session in Russia, they will set their sights in particular on the plume from the Selenga River, in the delta that is incomparably larger than that of the Rhone River. \nA platform for research exchange between Switzerland and Russia\n In 2011, the elemo field campaign provided an opportunity for Swiss researchers to benefit from Russian technology and expertise. The MIR submersibles made an unprecedented exploration of the waters of Lake Geneva possible. This time, Switzerland will make an important contribution with analysis methods that have been developed at EPFL. “One of our goals is to share our expertise with our Russian colleagues, particularly in the area of hyperspectral imaging,” says EPFL’s Ulrich Lemmin, scientific director of the Leman-Baïkal project. \n Another component of the Léman-Baïkal project is the establishment of a scientific exchange program. Switzerland and Russia will each send five scientists who will live in the partner country. These scientists will organize workshops to share their results, with the objective of publishing joint work in professional journals.\n This adventure is made possible thanks to renewed funding from Ferring Pharmaceuticals. “In 2011, with the elemo campaign, we demonstrated our commitment to the Lake Geneva region and the protection of the lake environment,” explains Michel Pettigrew, President of the Executive Board of Ferring Phamaceuticals. “We are proud to renew our support of this project; it corresponds perfectly with Ferring’s fundamental values, which are centered on human beings, research and the sharing of knowledge.”", "summary": "Ultra-light aircraft are being deployed in both Switzerland and Russia as part of the Léman-Baïkal project.

{"id": 627, "text": "EPFL’s Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI) has developed a method for reducing the power requirement of computer chips by mapping out their logic flows in an entirely new way. By using a different set of logic functions for the gates on the billions of transistors on electronic circuits, this system shortens the circuits’ calculation steps. That means chip designers can make their chips either smaller, faster or more energy efficient. Industry leader Synopsys has just acquired the rights to use the technology through a non-exclusive license agreement.\nStreamed logic structures for more powerful chips \nToday most engineers use electronic design automation software to design circuits. This software programs translate complex computational models into a labyrinth of billions of microscopic transistors. The LSI laboratory, directed by Giovanni De Micheli, has a longtime and worldwide renowned experience in design automation. There are only few companies and commercial products in use that sustain the entire semiconductor industry effort. Luca Amarù – while he was a PhD student at LSI – set out to radically change how design automation software generates logic diagrams in order to produce better designs.\nLuca Amarù, who holds a doctoral degree in computer science, came up with a method that uses only two logic primitives: majority and inverter. These functions are displayed in majority-inverter graphs (MIGs). Initial studies indicated that his approach could cut the number of logic steps needed to execute a given task. Later experiments confirmed this, finding that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18% on average relative to standard programs. That frees up transistor capacity for other tasks; engineers could also use these gains to make their chips faster or their devices smaller.\nAmarù, now a senior R&D manager at Synopsys, took his findings even further.

{"id": 628, "text": "Spintronics is an emerging field of technology where devices work by manipulating the spin of electrons rather than their charge. The field can bring significant advantages to computer technology, combining higher speeds with lower energy consumption. Spintronic circuits need ways to control electron spin without interference from electron charge. Scientists at EPFL, working with Université Paris-Sud and Paul Scherrer Institut, have discovered that a common insulating material behaves as a perfect spintronic conductor because it is not affected by background electron charge. In addition, the material’s properties make it an ideal platform for directly observing a strange subatomic particle that could one day lead to a different, more stable type of quantum computers. Their work is published in \nNature Materials\n.\nSpintronics\nSpintronics (spin-transport or spin-based electronics) is a technology that exploits a quantum property of electrons called spin. Although difficult to describe in everyday terms, electron spin can be loosely compared to the rotation of a planet or a spinning top around its axis. Spin exists in either of two directions: “up” or “down”, which can be described respectively as the clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the electron around its axis. Ultimately, spin is what gives electrons their magnetic properties, influencing the way they behave when they enter a magnetic field.\nThe different directions of electron spin can be used to encode information, much like the binary code used in digital communication. Spintronics can therefore open up a new generation of devices that combine conventional microelectronics with spin-dependent effects, overcoming the limitations of today’s electronics like speed and energy consumption. The main challenge is being able to actually control electron spin, turning “up” or “down” as needed. This can be achieved with certain materials, but the problem is that these are often susceptible to interference from the charge of electrons.\nAn ideal material for spintronics\nThe team of Hugo Dil at EPFL, working with scientists from Paris and the PSI, has shown that a transparent insulating material, which normally does not conduct electrical charge, shows spin-dependent properties. The scientists used a method called SARPES, which has been perfected by Hugo Dil’s group. The data showed that the electron gas at the surface of strontium titanate (SrTiO\n3\n) is spin-polarized, which means that it could be used to control the spin of electrons.\n“This is interesting because it is the first evidence of a large spin polarization effect on a truly insulating substrate”, says Hugo Dil. The discovery has significant implications for the future of spintronics, because it can lead to the development of spin-polarized materials that are not susceptible to interference from non spin-polarized electrical charge, allowing for finer and better control of electron spin.\nA new particle for a different kind of quantum computer\nBeyond spintronics, this insulating material might also be important for quantum computing, as it could be used to directly observe an elusive, strange particle called the Majorana fermion. This particle is unique because it actually is its own antiparticle as well. Sometimes referred to as the “ghost particle”, the Majorana fermion has zero energy, zero moment, zero spin, and, so far, has never been observed unambiguously. In the future, Majorana fermions could become the foundation for a different kind of quantum computer that would, in theory, be exceptionally stable, as it would not be susceptible to external interference and noise.\n This work represents an equal collaboration between Hugo Dil’s group at EPFL (ICMP-SOIS), a group from the Université Paris-Sud (CSNSM & CNRS/IN2P3), and experts at Paul Scherrer Institut (Swiss Light Source). This work was partly funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.\nReference\nSantander-Syro AF, Fortuna F, Bareille C, Rödel TC, Landolt G, Plumb NC, Dil JH, Radović M. \nGiant spin splitting of the two-dimensional electron gas at the surface of SrTiO\n3\n.\nNature Materials\n DOI: 10.1038/nmat4107", "summary": "Spintronics is a new field of electronics, using electron spin rather than charge.

{"id": 631, "text": "One day as you reach Geneva’s main train station to start your daily commute you notice a new sign showing some kind of underwater train. At first, you focus on the ripples marking the surface of the water. But as you approach and look more closely at the sign, you notice something strange about the rails – the train has no wheels. It seems to be suspended in mid-air.\nYou follow the arrow, which leads you to an elevator a few meters further on. The destination is indicated above the door: Lausanne. That’s where you’re going. So you get on the elevator, and it takes you deep below the ground. Your fellow passengers look as confused as you are. The elevator doors finally open and you step into a brand-new station already packed with commuters. You get on board. As the train pulls out of the station you realize that it’s not running on the rails but ‘levitating’ above them. You get to Lausanne in around ten minutes. You’re lost for words when it dawns on you that your journey has taken you under the waters of Lake Geneva. Another elevator is waiting for you as you get off the train. It takes you back up to the surface into the familiar bustle of Lausanne’s train station.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Swissmetro\nElia Notari has just obtained his Master’s in civil engineering from EPFL. He came up with this visionary train line for his Master’s project, which was supervised by Aurelio Muttoni, a full professor and director of EPFL’s Structural Concrete Laboratory (IBETON). Those with a sharp eye will no doubt notice some similarities with the Swissmetro project, an idea for a futuristic metro system developed at EPFL in the 1990s. Swissmetro was intended to link the main towns in Switzerland at a speed of 500 km/h. Notari’s Master’s project is in fact a variation of the Swissmetro design, which put the trains in underground tunnels rather than through Lake Geneva.\nBut is it really possible to build a metro through Lake Geneva? What some consider sacrilegious is a fascinating technical challenge for others – one that draws on multiple disciplines, covering everything from structural design and hydraulics to geotechnics and the environmental impact.\nA submerged bridge\nNotari focused on designing and calculating the dimensions of a double-track tunnel made out of reinforced concrete: an ‘underwater bridge’ – or to be more specific, a ‘floating underwater tunnel.’ Covering a distance of around 55 kilometers, the tracks would use magnetic levitation – or maglev – to get the train to travel at high speed. With this type of system, one set of magnets is placed on the tracks; a second set on the bottom of the train is repelled by the first, which pushes the train up off the track. In some cases, the repulsive force of the magnet is controlled by a current running along the track.\nFig.1: The double-track tunnel and its compartments containing ballast. © EPFL 2018 / E. Notari\nThis kind of system is not yet used in transportation, but several countries are now testing prototypes and plan to start building soon. In 2015, the Shinkansen Maglev prototype developed by Japanese company JR Central set the world record when it reached a speed of 603 km/h. For his work, Notari drew on policy guidelines developed in Germany, which are better suited to short distances, like that between Geneva and Lausanne.\nSeveral options to choose from\nThere are several options available to an engineer looking to build a train that can run under water. The tunnel can, for example, be set under the ground, as is the case with Eurostar, which was opened in 1994 across the Channel and connects London with several cities in mainland Europe.\nNorway is looking into another option to link its fjords with its cities – an underwater tunnel suspended at a series of floats that can be seen on the surface. Yet another solution involves putting metal rods in the ground to anchor down the tunnel. However, this will only work if the tunnel itself is buoyant enough.\nYet none of these options was quite right for Lake Geneva. This was mainly because its clear waters make it popular among sports enthusiasts and esthetes, which meant the student had to design a tunnel that was at least 20 meters deep and not visible from the surface.\n30 meters underwater\nNotari therefore went with a bridge located 30 meters below the surface and supported by piers made of reinforced concrete. This solution was the most rigid, which is a crucial factor for a high-speed train. It was also the most secure in the event of internal flooding. Other advantages also guided his choice. With this solution, the temperature would be constant throughout the entire structure, which would prevent any thermal deformation as a result of the changing seasons. Waves are also at their weakest at that kind of depth, and the bridge would not get in the way of any existing structures.\nWhat’s more, the hydrostatic pressure would be a bonus in terms of the solidity of the 199 modules making up the concrete tunnels. The engineer’s tunnel measures 14.5 meters in diameter and is designed to withstand earthquakes, internal and external explosions, flooding, tsunamis and landslides. The structure would include compartments containing ballast to make it possible to stabilize the tunnel at any time based on Archimedes’ principle. To adjust to the lake’s varying depth, the height of the pillars, which are 6 meters in diameter, would range from 7.5 to 45 meters. The bridge’s route would follow the lakeshore (see Fig.2. on the left). And the two ends of the line would be connected to the Geneva and Lausanne train stations via elevators.\nToo technically feasible to be utopian\nThe idea of an underwater bridge in Lake Geneva doesn’t seem so utopian to the freshly graduated engineer. “The concept of an underwater bridge has been around for a century,” says Notari. “Our know-how has advanced significantly thanks to projects like oil platforms and offshore wind farms. What’s missing is a pioneering investor who’s ready to put up the money to fund the construction of a prototype.”\nFor Aurelio Muttoni, high-speed transportation projects have great potential: “The solution that Elia studied is technically realistic. I myself came up with a similar solution in the 1990s when studying the feasibility of crossing Lake Lugano as part of the southern extension of the Gotthard high-speed train line.” Muttoni adds that he was inspired by Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s ultra-fast train, when suggesting the topic to his student. (See the .)\nBut given the complexity of the situation, the environmental challenges and the high costs of this kind of project, Muttoni is convinced that it will be many years before Lake Geneva gets an underwater tunnel.", "summary": "Summer series.

{"id": 632, "text": "Many phenomena occurring in nature and industry happen very quickly: a tear running through a piece of fabric, a rubber ball bouncing off a hard floor, a drop of water wetting a dry surface and a piece of scotch tape peeling off, for example. Capturing images of these phenomena would help scientists better understand them, but conventional cameras aren’t fast enough – and high-speed cameras are prohibitively expensive. \nBut scientists at EPFL’s , working in association with Harvard University researchers in the , have developed a new imaging method called Virtual Frame Technique (VFT) that can generate thousands of images of these phenomena as they occur step by step, using a photo taken from any kind of device, including a smartphone. What’s more, VFT has been shown to perform better than high-speed cameras. \nWorking with a conventional photo\nThe method starts by analyzing a conventional photo. “If you use a regular camera to take a picture of a drop of water hitting a dry surface, the water’s movement will cause the picture to be blurry. But these blurred areas are precisely where the phenomenon is taking place, both spatially and temporally. That’s what our technique uses to piece together the underlying phenomenon,” says John Kolinski, a professor at EPFL’s School of Engineering. In other words, VFT works by deconstructing the blurry parts of pictures. \nA method for binary phenomena\nThe first step is to shine light on the phenomenon just as the conventional picture is taken, so that the blurry parts can be exploited. “This initial illumination step must be done correctly so that the blurry parts of the picture contain the right information and can be used. At this point the object must have a quantifiable instantaneous state of either completely blocking the light or completely letting it through,” says Kolinski. The next step is to employ advanced image-processing methods to improve the conventional picture’s temporal resolution and specific illumination scheme, and then turn it into a binary image – that is, containing either black or white pixels. \nThis method offers an advantage because many natural phenomena are binary; for example, a piece of fabric is either torn or it isn’t, a surface is either wet or dry. That means only two greyscale values are necessary to depict them – no need for the 15,000+ intensity values available with conventional cameras. By sacrificing the ability to resolve intensity, the scientists were able to use the camera sensor’s bit depth, or the amount of information the sensor can obtain, to increase the frame rate while retaining full spatial resolution. Temporal resolution can be improved even further by adjusting the timing of a light pulse.\nTime-lapse photos over extremely short periods \nVFT therefore breaks down a conventional photo of an object in rapid motion into thousands of images that show every step of the process. “It’s like taking time-lapse photos of a nearly instantaneous phenomenon,” says Kolinski. The scientists tested their technique on pictures taken by all kinds of devices, from smartphones to sophisticated professional cameras, and found that it consistently resulted in a faster frame rate. While careful illumination is required, the method is quite general, and has been used to record a rich variety of phenomena, from droplet impacts to fracture mechanics.", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed a new image-processing method that can capture extremely rapid phenomena using any type of camera.

The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nThe School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.\nThe font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge. The School profoundly affects the lives of those who study or teach there. As a hub of research and knowledge, EPFL is a source of personal and professional fulfillment.

The Delta robot made light work of hundreds of packets of Smarties at the Triennial Interpack Exhibition in Düsseldorf. The inventor of the concept, Reymond Clavel, was presenting in Germany the most recent version of the Delta robot, resulting of a collaboration with Bosch. The performance of “Delta Direct Drive” is impressive – the robot can achieve acceleration of over 15 g, and this represents an increase in performance of 50% compared to robots of the previous generation. \nIncreasing speed and maintaining precision\n The challenge in developing this new variant was daunting – it involved increasing the speed of the Delta robot, while maintaining its precision. Previously, less powerful motors required the addition of a mechanical component, enabling a more effective transmission of the movement, but this limited the maximum speed of the robot. Scientists have now been able to take advantage of the progress made in motorization – in both power and cost – and this avoids the use of any such linking components. Thus, they have really gone up a gear. Reymond Clavel reveals: “The idea of direct drive had been tucked away in a drawer for ages, but then again, twenty years ago the cost of such motors would have been much too high.”\nA success story\nFrom chocolates to neurosurgery\nOriginally conceived to manipulate small, light objects such as chocolates, over time the Delta has been used for many other applications.

They must spend 2–6 months working for a company, after which they can also opt for an in-company master’s project to cap off their studies (\nsee text box\n). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.\nA wellspring of innovation\nBut EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.\nThe reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”\nJosep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.\nSupport for small businesses\nThe students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&D.\n“The best possible transition”\nAs delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.\nEve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said. And it was clearly a positive experience on both sides, because the firm hired her as soon as she graduated. Indeed, many students go on to be hired by the companies they work for. “We hire about 20% of our interns,” said Solà i Carós. “The advantage is that they already know our company. Internships bring us a lot of benefits in the short and long term.”\nInternships also give businesses an opportunity to form ties with EPFL laboratories. That could open the door to broader joint research projects financed by Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which aims to encourage technology transfer to industry.\nEPFL internships and master’s projects\nInternships are in general paid and give engineering students an opportunity to spend several months working for a company. They take place away from an academic setting, and the subject must be approved by the school.\nMaster’s projects are students’ final research projects and are closely overseen by an EPFL professor.

Christelle Oltramare decided to do her Master’s project - EPFL Central Environmental Laboratory - in Burkina Faso – somewhat off the beaten path. For two months, she took hair samples from volunteers in several villages in order to measure how farmers are affected by their livelihood. She also wanted her research to include people who were not in direct contact with pesticides.\n “I did an internship last summer in occupational health, and I was really fascinated to discover how the environment can affect human health. Working with hair was an interesting new approach.” Many pesticides are known for being endocrine disruptors, or are assumed or known carcinogens. These toxic compounds are found in the environment, water and food.\nBurkina Faso does not have the same regulations or oversight that Switzerland does when it comes to using dangerous products. “Most of the farmers don’t know how to read and they don’t differentiate – a pesticide is a pesticide whether it's meant for cotton or vegetables. And they often apply the same quantity of the product to their patch of land – measuring no more than 100 square meters – that an industrial farm would use for a hectare.”\nHair can now be analyzed for trace amounts of drugs, and there is a protocol. But in the absence of an accepted procedure for identifying pesticides, Oltramare took a method of extracting pesticides from fruits and vegetables and applied it to hair.\nShe had to play with several parameters in order to properly analyze the samples, washing the hair first to remove any dust and then dipping the hair into a solvent for the purposes of extraction. “We ran several trials to find the best solvent and the best phase for purification while at the same time ensuring no fatty acids remained in our sample and spoiled the analysis.”\nShe analyzed 73 samples. Her results showed that people are exposed to a number of pesticides, and that this is not due solely to their work. The farmers are affected the most, but the village's inhabitants were also exposed to pesticides through other vectors, like food and water.", "summary": "Summer series on student projects – For her Master’s project in environmental sciences, Christelle Oltramare collected 110 hair samples in Burkina Faso and came up with a process for identifying several types of pesticides.", "claim": "Summer series on student projects – For her Master’s project in environmental sciences, Christelle Oltramare collected 110 hair samples in Burkina Faso and came up with a process for identifying several types of pesticides.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 638, "text": "This may be Switzerland’s last stand, since its eligibility for European research and funding programs is in jeopardy. The country had an excellent showing in the first two rounds of grant awards by the European Research Council under the Horizon 2020 program: Swiss researchers were awarded 42 Advanced Grants worth an average 2.5 million euros over five years.\nEPFL alone accounted for 11 of these prestigious prizes, with four in 2014 and seven in 2015 (see list below).\nEPFL researchers also came away with four Starting Grants, six Consolidator Grants and three Proof of Concept Grants, for a total amount exceeding 49 million euros.\nHowever, after the Swiss people approved the “Stop Mass Immigration” initiative on 9 February 2014, Swiss-based researchers were not allowed to compete for these grants. This restriction was temporarily lifted on 15 September 2014.\nThis grace period will end on 9 February 2017. Swiss researchers can therefore still respond to calls for proposals whose deadline falls before that date.\nEPFL H2020 Advanced Grants\nSmit, Berend – MaGic\nThe Materials Genome in Action\nIt is now possible to make an enormous spectrum of different, novel nanoporous materials simply by changing the building blocks in the synthesis of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) or related materials. This unique chemical tunability allows us to tailor-make materials that are optimal for a given application. The promise of finding just the right material seems remote however: because of practical limitations we can only ever synthesize, characterize, and test a tiny fraction of all possible materials. To take full advantage of this development, therefore, we need to develop alternative techniques, collectively referred to as Materials Genomics, to rapidly screen large numbers of materials and obtain fundamental insights into the chemical nature of the ideal material for a given application. The PI will tackle the challenge and promise posed by this unprecedented chemical tunability through the development of a multi-scale computational approach, which aims to reliably predict the performance of novel materials before synthesis. We will develop methodologies to generate libraries of representative sets of synthesizable hypothetical materials and perform large-scale screening of these libraries. These studies should give us fundamental insights into the common molecular features of the top-performing materials. The methods developed will be combined into an open access infrastructure in which our hypothetical materials are publicly accessible for data mining and big-data analysis. The project is organized in three Work Packages, each centered around finding better materials for carbon capture: (1) screen materials for gas separations and develop the tools to predict the best materials for carbon capture; (2) gain insights into and develop a computational methodology for screening the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials; (3) achieve an understanding of the amine-CO2 chemistry in diamine-appended MOFs and use this to predict their performance.\nDe Micheli, Giovanni – CyberCare\nIntegrated Sensing Architectures and Tools for Health Care\nThis proposal addresses high-risk, high-reward research of integrated sensing and computing architectures, as well as of models, methods and tools for their design and operation. Such architectures provide the bridge between bio-systems and information processing systems, where a bio-system is an abstraction of a human in terms of biophysical parameters. Breakthroughs in data acquisition, processing and decision making support will enable new smart-health applications.\n The essential research goals of this proposal are: biophysical data acquisition by novel programmable integrated sensor arrays and their design and test using a modular and structured architecture; data processing in situ and/or remotely using application-specific hardware and/or embedded software; a new robust synthesis methodology for data processing units based on a new logic structure; models, abstractions and software tools for reasoning about the acquired data, to validate health conditions and/or to provide remedies (i.e., therapy). The results of this research will be embodied in a demonstrator showing the effectiveness of these combined technologies in first-aid medical care.\n The outcome of this research will have a deep and broad impact on health care, because it will improve diagnosis and therapy in a variety of cases. Namely, it will boost the quality and quantity of the acquired biophysical data, possibly in real time, by leveraging multiple sensing modalities and dedicated computing architectures. The use of formal methods for design, data evaluation and decision making support will enhance the quality of the diagnostic platforms and will ease their qualification and adoption. Moreover, the integration of sensing and electronics and their in-field programmability will reduce production cost and lower the barrier of adoption, thus providing for better and more affordable health care means.\nForro, Laszlo – PICOPROP\nPhoto Induced Collective Properties of Hybrid Halide Perovskites\nThe recent discovery of the organo-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 as very efficient material in photoelectric conversion is multifaceted: it turns out that this compound is promising not only in photovoltaics, but it is lasing, it gives bright light emitting diodes, promising in water splitting and we are persuaded that it can play an important role in basic sciences, as well.\n We have recently realized that under white light illumination the photoelectrons, due to their very long recombination time, stay in the conduction band and the resistivity of a single crystal shows a metallic behavior. If the lifetime is sufficiently long and the density of these excited carrier is high enough they could condense into a Fermi sea. The project’s goal is to realize this highly unusual state and to document its properties by magneto-transport and spectroscopic techniques. We will check in our model compound the long-sought superconductivity of photo-excited carriers, extensively searched for in cuprates, if we could stabilize it by fine tuning the interactions by hydrostatic pressure under constant illumination.\n The availability of high quality samples is primordial for this program. It turns out that CH3NH3PbI3 is ideal compound, it seems to be almost free of charged defects (its room temperature resistance is 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of Phosphorus doped Silicon at 1013 cm-3 doping concentration) and we can grow excellent single crystals of it. Furthermore, it has a flexibility in material design: one can vary all the constituents, and even the dimensionality by making layered materials with the main chemical motifs. A special effort will be devoted to tune the spin-orbit coupling by different elements, since this could be at the origin of the long recombination time of the photo-electrons.\n We suspect that the highly tunable, clean and disorder-free doping obtained by shining light on these ionic crystals opens a new era in material discovery.\nDuboule, Denis – Regul\nHox\nTopological organization of vertebrate regulatory landscapes: The Hox genes paradigm\nThe aim of this grant is to understand how mammalian developmental genes, which are usually pleiotropic, are controlled via long-range regulations and how chromatin partitions into large and discrete regulatory domains, generally matching Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). We want to understand how such domains emerged in evolution, how they are built during development and how they help implement enhancer functions. We will use a large genomic interval in mouse chromosome 2 containing the HoxD cluster as a paradigm, as it is covered by a large allelic series re-organizing the topology of this interval. Since the syntenic human locus (2q31) is affected in numerous genetic syndromes involving CNVs or large DNA re-arrangements, we believe this work will also help understand the mechanistic bases of human regulatory mutations. The approach will capitalize on our knowledge of mouse embryos, the implementation of cutting-edge genomic technologies and the unique collection of engineered mammalian chromosomes kept into living mice, which represent as many targeted re-organizations of both chromatin and regulatory topologies. It will require important technological development, in order to apply to mammalian embryos, methods (HiC) currently used for cell cultures or adult tissues. We think that the feasibility of this novel program is high, due the portfolio of experimental tools recently developed in our laboratory. Also, pilot experiments have been initiated to identify problems and preliminary results including the use of HiC on embryonic tissues suggest that the proposed experiments can be realized within delay. The novelty and originality of this program are in the interdisciplinary and system approach of genomic re-arrangements, as analyzed in vivo using recently developed methodologies, allowing to associate topological variations with regulatory modalities in a physiological context, during normal or genetically impaired embryonic development.\nTrono, Didier – TRANSPOS-X\nTransposable elements, their controllers and the genesis of human-specific transcriptional networks\nTransposable elements (TEs) account for more than two thirds of the human genome. They can inactivate genes, provide novel coding functions, sprinkle chromosomes with recombination-prone repetitive sequences, and modulate cellular gene expression through a wide variety of transcriptional andposttranscriptional influences. As a consequence, TEs are considered as essential motors of evolution yetthey are occasionally associated with disease, causing about one hundred Mendelian disorders and possibly contributing to several human cancers. As expected for such genomic threats, TEs are subjected to tight epigenetic control imposed from the very first days of embryogenesis, in part owing to their recognition by sequence-specific RNA- and protein-based repressors. It is generally considered that the evolutionary selection of these TE controllers reflects a simple host-pathogen arms race, and that their action results in the early and permanent silencing of their targets. We have recently uncovered new evolutionary evidence and obtained genomic and functional data that invalidate this dual assumption, and suggest instead that transposable elements and their epigenetic controllers establish species-specific transcriptional networks that play critical roles in human development and physiology. The general objective of the present proposal is to explore the breadth of this phenomenon, to decipher its mechanisms, to unveil its functional implications, and to probe how this knowledge could be exploited for basic research, biotechnology and clinical medicine.\nChergui, Majed – DYNAMOX\nCharge carrier dynamics in metal oxides\nTransition metal (TM) oxides (TiO2, ZnO, NiO) are large gap insulators that have emerged as highly attractive materials over the past two decades for applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, etc., all of which rely on the generation of charge carriers, their evolution and their eventual trapping at defects or a self-trapped excitons. Despite the huge interest for such materials, the very nature of the elementary electronic excitations (Frenkel, Wannier or charge transfer exciton) is still not established, nor is the way these excitations evolve after being created: excitonic polaron or charged polaron. Finally, the electron and hole recombine is also not clearly established because of issue of defects and trapping.\n In order to tackle these issues, here we implement novel experimental tools that would provide us with hitherto inaccessible information about the charge carrier dynamics in TM oxides. Of importance is the ability to detect both the electrons and the holes. Some of these tools have been developed in the PI’s group: i) Ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will provide information about the final metal d-orbitals and about the structural changes around it; ii) Ultrafast X-ray emission (XES) will provide information about hole states. While these two approaches are ideal element-selective ones, the localization of the electron at metal atoms represents a small proportion of the electron population. Therefore, ultrafast Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) will be used to map out the band structure changes in the system and the evolution of the conduction band electrons. Ultrafast 2-dimensional (2D) UV (<400nm) transient absorption spectroscopy allows the mapping of the time evolution of both the valence and the conduction bands by its ability to pump and probe above the band gap. Last, Fourier Transform visible 2D spectroscopy will allow the probing of gap state dynamics at high time resolution.\nShaposhnikov, Mikhail – NuBSM\nFrom Fermi to Planck: a bottom up approach\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is a hugely successful theory that has been tested in experiments at ever increasing energies, culminating in the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. Nevertheless, some major riddles cannot be addressed by the Standard Model, such as neutrino oscillations, the existence of Dark Matter, the absence of antimatter in the Universe. New fundamental principles, interactions and unknown yet particles are required to address these questions. Much of the research done during the last three decades on physics ‘beyond the Standard Model’ (BSM) has been driven by attempts to find a ‘natural’ solution of the hierarchy problem: why the Planck and the electroweak scales are so different. The most popular approaches to this problem predict new particles with the masses right above the electroweak scale.\n This project explores an alternative idea that the absence of new particles with masses between the electroweak and Planck scales, supplemented by extra symmetries (such as scale invariance) may itself explain why the mass of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the Planck mass. This calls for a solution of the BSM problems by extremely feebly interacting particles with masses below the electroweak scale. Along the same lines we also explore the possibility that cosmological inflation does not require a new field, but is driven by the Higgs field of the Standard Model.\n The proposed model offers solutions for BSM puzzles and is among a few ones that can be tested with existing experimental technologies and are valid even if no evidence for new physics is found at the LHC.\n Constructing such a theory requires consolidated efforts in domains of high-energy theory, particle physics phenomenology, physics of the early Universe, cosmology and astrophysics as well as analyses of the available data from previous experiments and from cosmology. We will make predictions and establish the sensitivity goals for future high intensity experiments.\nUnser, Michael – GlobalBioIm\nGlobal integrative framework for Computational Bio-Imaging\nA powerful strategy for increasing the quality and resolution of medical and biological images is to acquire larger quantities of data (Fourier samples for MRI, projections for X-ray imaging) and to jointly reconstruct the complete signal by correctly reallocating the measurements in 3D space/time and integrating all the information available. The underlying image sequence is reconstructed globally as the result of a very large-scale optimization that exploits the redundancy of the signal (spatio-temporal correlation, sparsity) to improve the solution. Due to recent advances in the field, we are arguing that such a “bigger data” integration is now within reach and that our team is ideally qualified to lead the way. A successful outcome will profoundly impact the design of future bioimaging systems.\n We are proposing a unifying framework for the development of such next-generation reconstruction algorithms with a clear separation between the physical (forward model) and signal-related (regularization, incorporation of prior constraints) aspects of the problem. The pillars of our formulation are: an operator algebra with a corresponding set of fast linear solvers; an advanced statistical framework for the principled derivation of reconstruction methods; and learning schemes for parameter optimization and self-tuning. These core technologies will be incorporated into a modular software library featuring the key components for the implementation and testing of iterative reconstruction algorithms. We shall apply our framework to improve upon the state of the art in the following modalities: 1) phase-contrast X-ray tomography in full 3D; 2) structured illumination microscopy; 3) single-particle analysis in cryo-electron tomography; 4) a novel multipose fluorescence microscopy; 5) real-time MRI, and 6) a new multimodal digital microscope. In all instances, we shall work in close collaboration with the imaging scientists who are in charge of the instrumentation.\nIonescu, Adrian – Milli-Tech\nMilli-Volt Switch Technologies for Energy Efficient Computation and Sensing\nThe Milli-Tech proposal aims at a novel technology platform serving both computation and sensing: electronic switch architectures, called steep slope switches, exploiting new device physics and concepts in emerging 2D materials to achieve operation at voltages below 100 millivolts. Such switches will have a subthreshold slope below 10mV/decade, significantly more abrupt than MOSFET thermal limit of 60mV/decade at room temperature and in great advance to any beyond CMOS switches. Such characteristics will dramatically improve both the energy efficiency of logic circuits and the transduction sensitivity for many classes of sensors.\n The project will develop a technological platform called ‘millivolt technology’ focusing on low power digital and sensing/analog electronic functions exploiting steep slopes, with the goal of lowering the energy per useful function (computed and sensed bit of information) by a factor of 100x.\n Such ultra-low operation voltage will contribute to solving major challenges of nanoelectronics such as power issues and it will enable energy efficient super-sensitive sensors for Internet-of-Everything (IoE).\n Milli-Tech includes fundamental research on new solid-state steep slope device concepts: heterostructure tunnel FETs in 2D Transition-Metal-Dichalcogenides (TMD), 2D Van der Waals super-lattice energy filter switch and hybrid architectures combining two switching principles: band-to-band-tunneling and metal-insulator-transition or negative capacitance in VO2, used as additive technology boosters.\n Milli-Tech plans breakthroughs by precise demonstrators: (i) energy efficient computation blocks for Von-Neumann ICs at sub-100mV, (ii) Active Pixel Sensors based on 2D TMD/GeSn tunnel FETs for IR imagers, (iii) Terahertz detectors based on hybrid 2D VO2/TMD switches (iii) ultra-sensitive 2D steep slope charge detectors for biosensing. The high-risk ‘millivolt technology’ will be highly rewarding by enabling the energy efficient revolution for IoE.\nMartin, Olivier – NANOFACTORY\nBuilding tomorrow’s nanofactory\nThe aim of this project is to translate the concept of production line to the nanoworld to develop what could become tomorrow’s nanofactory. So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction – which will be studied numerically and experimentally – the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.\nVetterli, Martin – SENSIT*\nSense and Sensitivity: Inverse Problems between Sparsity and Data Deluge\nAround 90% of today’s exponentially growing Internet traffic is signal-based—a striking consequence of the proliferation of low-cost sensing. Beyond sheer quantity, these data span extremes of structure, modality, and quality. To make sense of this hodgepodge, new signal processing techniques are needed, and the paradigm of inverse problems is central to their design.\n In SENSIT, we address this need by developing theoretical tools and algorithms to push the boundaries in key areas of inverse problems coming from acoustics and imaging:\n 1. We investigate original sampling modalities that balance sparsity models and abundance of data. A particular emphasis is on sampling at unknown locations, which we identify as a common abstraction for numerous problems.\n 2. We study regularization of inverse problems based on powerful geometrical objects such as Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs). We pursue extensions of EDMs and new algorithms for combinatorial cases, e.g. for ab initio crystallography.\n 3. We attack problems in computational acoustics using geometrical tools and EDMs. We aim at a complete characterization of indoor channels with mobile nodes, with immediate implications in source localization, source separation, cocktail party processing and wave-based “simultaneous localization and mapping” (SLAM).\n 4. We apply our tools to computational imaging, where our results on sampling at unknown locations, as well as insights from SLAM, can be used to simultaneously acquire higher resolution images, depth maps and reflectance functions.\n In sum, we aim at providing theoretical foundations and tools for modern inverse problems in signal processing, where data deluge is prominent. We will investigate new models and algorithms, and a theory of their complexity, performance, and sensitivity. These advances will impact a wide range of applications including crystallography, wave-based signal processing, SLAM and computational imaging.\n*\n Martin Vetterli having been nominated as EPFL president, he decided not to take his grant.", "summary": "EPFL fared well in the competition for European Research Council (ERC) grants in 2014 and 2015 within the Horizon 2020 framework, with 11 researchers winning an Advanced Grant.

This process, lymphangiogenesis, also helps the tumor evade the patient’s own immune system, and it would be expected that inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, which are only effective in a minority of patients. But scientists from EPFL and the US found the opposite: lymphangiogenesis actually enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy against melanoma.

The ship, which is an icebreaker dedicated to scientific research, will carry 55 researchers at a time during each of the three legs of the journey. They will run a total of 22 projects that revolve around measuring the impact of climate change on the earth’s poles, which are both a fragile and crucial part of our planet.\nThe researchers hail from several disciplines, such as oceanography, climatology, biology and chemistry. Their topics include phytoplankton and their role in the carbon chain, the acoustic mapping of the whale population, chemical exchanges between the ocean and the atmosphere, changes in salt levels in seawater and microplastics in the Southern Ocean.\nKeep up with the ACE expedition on:\nthe expedition’s website: \nFacebook: \nTwitter: \nInstagram: ace_expedition", "summary": "The Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) arrived yesterday in Australia after 30 days at sea.

{"id": 642, "text": "Vaccines are one of the most effective interventions to prevent the spreading of infectious diseases. They trigger the immune system to produce antibodies that protect us against infection. However, we still lack efficacious vaccines for many important pathogens, like the flu or dengue fever. “When a vaccine doesn’t work well, we tend to think that it’s because the antibodies produced are not protective,” says Bruno Correia, a professor at the Laboratory of Protein Design & Immunoengineering (LPDI) in EPFL’s School of Engineering. “It’s usually because our immune system is simply making the wrong type of antibodies”. Scientists in Correia’s lab have now developed a strategy to design artificial proteins that very precisely instruct the body’s immune system which antibodies to produce. The study has been published in the journal Science.\nBuilding proteins like Legos\nThe EPFL team created artificial proteins designed using computational methods. “They don’t exist in nature,” says Che Yang, a PhD student and co-leading author in the study.\n “We developed a protein design algorithm called TopoBuilder.

{"id": 644, "text": "When the World Wide Web was invented at CERN 30 years ago, no one talked about open science. But the internet has become one of the pillars of open science, providing researchers with a way of sharing information with colleagues around the world.\nIn January 2017, soon after taking office, EPFL President Martin Vetterli launched the  in order to raise awareness about this important topic. One key element was the creation of the Open Science Strategic Committee (OSSC), whose members provide EPFL’s Senior Management with input on how to best promote open science. We met with Professor Katrin Beyer, who chairs the OSSC, to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by open science at EPFL and beyond.\nHow open is science today?\nScience is definitely more open now than it was five or ten years ago, and almost certainly less than it will be five or ten years from now. It is increasingly common to share research outputs beyond the traditional manuscript - such as code and data - and this practice will soon be ubiquitous. One thing we notice when discussing the topic of open science among colleagues is that significant differences exist between disciplines. This does not necessarily mean that some are more open than others – they’re simply open in different ways.\nIn some fields it is standard to share preprints; in others open data has a long tradition. Open data seems to be particularly well-established in places where researchers use a large shared infrastructure, such as CERN. These communities have worked for a long time on establishing data-format and documentation standards. It seems much harder to create such standards when everybody has their own laboratory and, often, their own experimental set-up.\nOpen science initiatives touch on several key aspects of the research process – publications, research evaluation, career promotion, funding allocation and so on. Does that mean the whole process is flawed?\nThe process is certainly flawed when it comes to access to scientific literature. Some big legacy publishers now control the majority of the journals in most fields and have profit margins of 30–40%, effectively channeling public money into the pockets of private investors. Many universities simply cannot afford to pay the subscription fees. And while illegal services such as Sci-Hub bring more equality to researchers around the globe, relying on pirated access to knowledge is not a sustainable strategy. We need to do better.\nThat said, open access as it is implemented today does not necessarily solve the economic or equality issue. If it becomes expensive to publish, everyone will be able to read the literature, but only a few will be able to publish it. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\nIn terms of career promotion and evaluating candidates for funding, in theory, the framework is already in place. Many universities, including EPFL, have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which states that researchers should be judged not just on how many articles write and the prestige of the journals in which they publish, but on all types of research output, and that quality should come before quantity. However, in practice, hiring committees evaluating large numbers of applications within a short period of time can find it difficult to implement DORA, because assessing the quality of a variety of research outputs is more time consuming than looking at numbers and journal titles. This remains a challenge.\nHow will open science affect the research community?\nOne major objective of open science is to increase the reproducibility and reusability of published work, and I think this will accelerate science in general and increase its impact. Open science also implies a more inclusive research environment. Being part of an established network of researchers is not necessary anymore to get access to data or code – any researcher anywhere in the world can build on these research outputs.\nYoung researchers may benefit the most from open science. They also have a key responsibility: they contribute a significant part of the research and need to make sure it’s produced and documented so that others can easily build on it. Research institutions need to support them in this endeavor and ensure they have all the methodological tools they need.\nWhat is EPFL’s strategy?\nThe OSSC wants to promote a bottom-up approach to open science. Researchers know best where their disciplines are going, how to innovate in the way their community shares information, and what will have a real impact in making their field more open. But it is EPFL’s responsibility to listen to its researchers and develop the services and infrastructure that will make a clear difference in supporting those striving to implement open science in their daily routine.\nIt is important for EPFL to provide training opportunities at the same time. The summer school session called “Open Science in Practice,” which took place in September, gave PhD students a look at projects and tools that other early career researchers have used in their research practice. Teaching by example is the best way to convince people that open science is possible and has a greater impact, and that good practice does not necessarily require a lot of time. The School’s library also offers a range of courses on tools that make it easier to implement open science, along with expert advice on topics such as open access and data management. We recommend expanding this catalogue even further.\nIs EPFL a pioneer in open science?\nI think EPFL is ahead of the curve, since it works hard to explore the most promising avenues and tries to be innovative in its support for open science on campus. Martin Vetterli is very outspoken about it. And to be fair, many EPFL researchers started working openly well before the OSSC was set up. The Swiss Data Science Center, for example, is a driving force in this area and a real asset. Its Renku platform may change how we track the research process, and it could significantly reduce the time required for careful documentation.", "summary": "As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, EPFL is highlighting his commitment for open and reproducible research through an exceptional Open Science Day, today.

Place it at a certain angle between a white wall and a light source, and a clear, coherent image appears of the face of Alan Turing, the famous British mathematician and father of modern computer science.\nThere’s no magic here; the only thing at work is the relief on the plaque’s surface and a natural optical phenomenon known as a “caustic,” which researchers in EPFL’s Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory have succeeded in bending to their will. Their research was presented recently at the Advances in Architectural Geometry Conference in Paris. A public demonstration will also be held November 16-17 at EPFL as part of the Alan Turing days, an event celebrating the 100th birthday of the famous scientist.\n“With the technique that we’ve developed, we can compose any image we want, from a simple form such as a star to complex representations such as faces or landscapes,” explains EPFL professor Mark Pauly, head of the laboratory, who conducted the study with four other scientists*.\nThis “caustic” effect is well known and easy to observe; a bit of sunlight shining on a pool of water produces patterns that dance on the surrounding tiles or walls. These undulating lines, apparently random, are generated by light that hits the moving surface of a pool or puddle. This effect, which is very mobile and dynamic in liquid, produces static patterns with solid transparent materials such as glass or transparent acrylic (better known as Plexiglass).\nDeviated trajectories\nScientifically, this phenomenon can be explained by light refraction. When light rays hit a transparent surface, they continue their trajectory but are bent as a function of the surface geometry and optical properties of the material. The light passing through is thus not uniformly distributed. It gets concentrated in certain points, forming some zones that are more intense and others that are more shaded.\nPauly and his colleagues studied the principles of this distribution, and were able to identify the curves and undulations they would need to give to the surface in order to direct the beams of light to a desired area. They then developed an algorithm, to calculate the trajectories very precisely and thus form a specific image.\nOne of the most interesting and eagerly awaited applications of this method is in architecture. It could be applied to display cases, windows, fountains, and ornamentations on museums and monuments. In design it could be used for decorating glasses, vases, carafes, jewelry and many other objects. It has considerable potential in other, more technical applications as well, such as automobile headlights and projectors.\n*Thomas Kiser (EPFL), Michael Eigensatz (Evolute), Minh Man Nguyen (WAO) and Philippe Bompas.", "summary": "When beams of light hit a pool of water or a glass object, they produce beautiful, seemingly random patterns on surrounding surfaces.

{"id": 646, "text": "Scientists from EPFL and WSL have been studying soils in oil palm cultivation for years, in an effort to develop more sustainable methods for growing this crop. Palm oil production has been criticized by environmentalists because of its large carbon footprint and negative impact on biodiversity. For instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia – the world’s two biggest producers – it has directly or indirectly caused large-scale deforestation, thereby reducing biodiversity and releasing significant amounts of CO\n2\n into the atmosphere. And planting oil palm trees in the deforested areas does not make up for the lost carbon storage capacity, according to a . \nBut the findings of a new study by EPFL and WSL – appearing today in \nScience Advances\n – indicate there may be a carbon-friendly alternative to deforestation. The scientists investigated oil palm crops that had been planted on former pastures in the Los Llanos region of Colombia, the world’s fourth-largest palm oil producer. There, large areas of pastures – which themselves had been planted in the past on savannas – were replaced by oil palm plantations 56 years ago. By calculating the crops’ carbon footprint since then, the scientists found that the total carbon storage – taking into account both vegetation and soil stocks – was unchanged relative to when the land had been used for pastures.\n“Our study is the first to look at the carbon footprint of palm oil production over the long term – that is, across two plantation cycles, since oil palm trees are replaced every 25–30 years,” says Juan Carlos Quezada, a PhD student at EPFL’s Ecological Systems Laboratory (ECOS) and the study’s lead author. “It’s also the first to explore how converting pastures into oil palm farms affects soil quality and fertility over the long term, looking at all soil layers, not just the surface.”\nCarbon capture\nIn tropical climates, pastures – especially those that have been neglected and degraded – commonly consist of large grassy areas with a few small trees scattered around. Planting dense populations of oil palm trees – which can reach 15 meters in height – on these pastures can increase the carbon capture rate per unit of surface area, thanks to the palm trees’ roots, trunks and leaves, as well as the vegetation around them.\nUnder typical farming methods, oil palm trees are cut down every 25–30 years and replaced with young trees to start a new plantation cycle. As the roots and other parts of the old trees decompose, they nourish the soil and partially offset the carbon initially lost in the upper soil layer when the pastureland was converted. As a result, over the long term cultivation period, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem remains unchanged compared to the initial level before land conversion took place. \nAn alternative worth exploring \n“We should bear in mind that palm oil in and of itself is not harmful – neither to our health, when eaten in moderation, nor to the economy. And we’re not talking just about multinationals – the incomes of hundreds of small farmers in Colombia and other countries depend on it,” says Alexandre Buttler, head of ECOS and a co-author of the study. “The problem lies with the negative carbon impact and loss of biodiversity caused by deforestation. But the main palm oil producing countries have large abandoned pastures that could be converted favorably, thus limiting the massive carbon loss resulting from deforestation.” \nThis study was conducted as part of the  project, a cross-disciplinary initiative funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and led by ETH Zurich. OPAL brings together project partners from Switzerland, Indonesia, Colombia and Cameroon. Local universities, research institutes and the WWF in the latter three countries have a stake in the project, raising awareness about this issue among their local communities in order to promote the development of sustainable alternatives.", "summary": "Turning an abandoned pasture into a palm tree plantation can be carbon neutral, according to a new study by EPFL and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL).

{"id": 647, "text": "Obviously, wind farms work best when it is windy. But aside from wind-speed and direction, there are other more subtle factors that influence their power output. Using a mathematical model, researchers from EPFL’s  have shown the impact of vertical movements of the air on the productivity of wind farms. They found that increased turbulence caused by convective movements, common on hot, sunny days, increased the output of wind farms by shortening the lifespan of the turbulent wake downstream of the individual turbines. They published their  in the journal Physics of Fluids early this month.\nMahdi Abkar and Fernando Porté-Agel, the authors of the study, used a mathematical model to study the turbulence generated by a wind turbine as its rotors slice through the wind that drives them. With turbines often set up to form dense wind farms, understanding the turbulent wakes generated by upwind turbines and how long it takes for them to recover are important in predicting the overall power output of these wind farms, as turbines set up in the wind shadow of others are driven by strong wind. Today, turbines are spaced between five and seven turbine diameters apart – about 500 to 700 meters for large turbines – to maximize the amount of power that can be produced on a given area.\nOptimizing production over a 24-hour cycle\n“What we were interested in was understanding the effect of thermal stability on the characteristics and dynamics of the turbulent wake behind wind-turbines,” says Abkar. In other words, how do temperature-driven vertical movements in the lower atmosphere influence the turbulent wind shadow cast by a wind turbine. On sunny days, the hot ground causes the air above it to heat up and rise. This vertical motion is a characteristic of an unstable, convective atmosphere. On a typical night, by contrast, the earth’s cold surface cools the air above it, leading to a stable situation.\nAbkar used simulations to study the power output of a wind farm under convective and stable conditions and found a significant difference between both cases. “In the convective case, downwind turbines were about 30% less productive than those in the front lines. Under a stable atmosphere, the losses were even higher, on the order of 60%,” he says. His findings are important to optimize the power output of wind farms over a 24-hour cycle, as the lower atmosphere goes its stable nocturnal state to the convective state typical of daytime.\nSo, why does the turbulence recover so much faster in the convective case? According to Abkar, this is mostly due to the higher levels of turbulence in the incoming wind, which enhances turbulent mixing within, thereby breaking apart the turbulent wake behind the turbines. By contrast, in the stable setting, the turbulence is allowed to linger on for much longer, as turbulent mixing remains low.\nAccounting for windfarms in weather models\nUnraveling the detailed physics at play within wind farms is not only important to optimize their power output. Wind turbines alter the atmospheric dynamics by absorbing some of the wind and increasing turbulence, which can modify a number of other properties, such as atmospheric humidity and temperature. That is why meteorologists are interested in improving how they account for them in weather models. In a second paper, published in the journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, Akbar and Porté-Agel propose a new way to account for wind farms in large-scale atmospheric models that considers the number of turbines in the wind farm, the way that they are set up, and the wind direction.", "summary": "When set up in groups, wind turbines in the front rows cast a wind shadow on those behind them, lowering their performance.

It will be one of the defining technologies of the future, with its influence and application expected to accelerate as we go through the 2020s. Yet, the stakes are high; with the countless benefits that AI brings, there is also growing academic and public concern around a lack of transparency, and its misuse, in many areas of life.\nIt’s in this environment that the European Commission has become one of the first political institutions in the world to release a  that could be a game-changer towards a regulatory framework for AI. In addition, this year the European Parliament  on how the EU can best regulate artificial intelligence to boost innovation, ethical standards and trust in technology.\nRecently, an all-virtual conference on the ‘\n Technology\n’ hosted by EPFL’s  (IRGC) and the  explored the principles needed to govern existing and emerging digital technologies, as well as the potential danger of decision-making algorithms and how to prevent these from causing harm.\nStuart Russell, Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and author of the popular textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, proposed that there is huge upside potential in AI, but we are already seeing the risks from the poor design of AI systems, including the impacts of online misinformation, impersonation and deception.\n“I believe that if we don't move quickly, human beings will just be losing their rights, their powers, their individuality and becoming more and more the subject of digital technology rather than the owners of it. For example, there is already AI from 50 different corporate representatives sitting in your pocket stealing your information, and your money, as fast as it can, and there's nobody in your phone who actually works for you. Could we rearrange that so that the software in your phone actually works for you and negotiates with these other entities to keep all of your data private?” he asked.\nReinforcement learning algorithms, that select the content people see on their phones or other devices, are a major problem he continued, “they currently have more power than Hitler or Stalin ever had in their wildest dreams over what billions of people see and read for most of their waking lives. We might argue that running these kinds of experiments without informed consent is a bad idea and, just as we have with pharmaceutical products, we need to have stage 1, 2, and 3 trials on human subjects and look at what effect these algorithms have on people's minds and behavior.”\nBeyond regulating artificial intelligence aimed at individual use, one of the conference debates focused on how governments might use AI in developing and implementing public policy in areas such as healthcare, urban development or education. Bryan Ford, an Associate Professor at EPFL and head of the  (DEDIS) in the , argued that while the cautious use of powerful AI technologies can play many useful roles in low-level mechanisms used in many application domains, it has no legitimate role to play in defining, implementing, or enforcing public policy.\n“Matters of policy in governing humans must remain a domain reserved strictly for humans. For example, AI may have many justifiable uses in electric sensors to detect the presence of a car - how fast it is going or whether it stopped at an intersection, but I would claim AI does not belong anywhere near the policy decision of whether a car's driver warrants suspicion and should be stopped by Highway Patrol.”\n“Because machine learning algorithms learn from data sets that represent historical experience, AI driven policy is fundamentally constrained by the assumption that our past represents the right, best, or only viable basis on which to make decisions about the future. Yet we know that all past and present societies are highly imperfect so to have any hope of genuinely improving our societies, governance must be visionary and forward looking,” Professor Ford continued.\nArtificial intelligence is heterogeneous and complex. When we talk about the governance of, and by, AI are we talking about machine learning, neural networks or autonomous agents, or the different applications of any of these in different areas? Likely, all the above in many different applications. We are only at the beginning of the journey when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, one that most participants agreed has geopolitical implications.\n“These issues may lead directly to a set of trade and geostrategic conflicts that will make them all the more difficult to resolve and all the more crucial. The question is not only to avoid them but to avoid the decoupling of the US from Europe, and Europe and the US from China, and that is going to be a significant challenge economically and geo-strategically,” suggested John Zysman, Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and co-Director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy.\n“Ultimately, there is a thin red line that AI should not cross and some regulation, that balances the benefits and risks from AI applications, is needed. The IRGC is looking at some of the most challenging problems facing society today, and it’s great to have them as part of IC,” said James Larus, Dean of the IC School and IRGC Academic Director.\nConcluding the conference, Marie-Valentine Florin, Executive Director of the IRGC reminded participants that artificial intelligence is a means to an end, not the end, “as societies we need a goal. Maybe that could be something like the Green Deal around sustainability to perhaps give a sense to today’s digital transformation. Digital transformation is the tool, and I don't think society has collectively decided a real objectivel for it yet. That’s what we need to figure out.”", "summary": "EPFL computer science professor tells conference that AI has no legitimate roll in defining, implementing, or enforcing public policy.", "claim": "EPFL computer science professor tells conference that James Larus has no legitimate roll in defining, implementing, or enforcing public policy.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "EntitySwap", "augmentation_span": [7, 8], "noise": false}
{"id": 649, "text": "Pilot and psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard just \"landed\" after 72 hours of simulated flight across the Atlantic Ocean in Solar Impulse, a solar airplane which is equipped with advanced renewable technology. This second virtual flight, which started Tuesday morning and took place at the military base in Dübendorf, Switzerland, was the chance for Piccard to test his mental and physiological boundaries during strenuous flight conditions. EPFL technology monitored his mental states and cardiac rhythm throughout the flight, both in real-time and for post-flight data analysis.\n In a collaboration between EPFL, Hirslanden and the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), twenty-seven electrodes placed on Piccard's head measured the electrical activity of his brain, also known as electroencephalogram (EEG). Mental states like sleep, fatigue and thinking can be detected in the fluctuations of these electrical signals. This information will be compared with a series of vigilance tests that were done during the 72 hour flight to evaluate Piccard's alertness and his ability to perform tasks.\n EPFL scientists also measured the electrical activity of the pilot's heart, also known as an electrocardiogram (ECG). The obvious reason is to detect an unusual heartbeat, or a cardiac arrest. But cardiac rhythms also contain information about mental alertness.\n “We are developing smart technology that can evaluate mental states in real-time by monitoring the heart alone,” explains EPFL scientist Francisco Rincon at the Embedded Systems Laboratory. “The 72 hours of data collected here – from the heart, the brain activity and the vigilance tests – will be helpful for developing this technology.”\n The flight simulator took Solar Impulse on one possible trajectory across the Atlantic Ocean, from Norfolk (US) to Almeria (ES), although it did not simulate all of the possible conditions one would experience in Solar Impulse's cockpit. \"Atmospheric pressure and temperature changes were not incorporated into the simulation at this stage, although both have an impact on human physiology,\" explains Solar Impulse pilot André Borschberg, \"not to mention the excitement of really flying Solar Impulse.\"", "summary": "Solar Impulse pilot Bertrand Piccard put his mental and physiological limits to the test during a 72 hour simulated flight across the Atlantic Ocean which ended today.

{"id": 650, "text": "Governments across Switzerland are embracing civic technology. This is one of the headline findings of the first Civic Tech Barometer, a survey conducted by researchers from EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory (LaSUR) in partnership with Geneva Canton’s Consultation and Communication Department. The team’s conclusions are based on responses to an online survey sent to municipal, city and cantonal authorities nationwide between August and November 2019. In total, 83 government employees from the French, German and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland submitted answers.\n The idea behind civic technology, or civic tech, is to change the way citizens participate in democratic processes. The LaSUR survey found that the Swiss civic tech landscape is far from uniform. The most common platform types include websites, blogs, open-data repositories, social media, participatory spaces where citizens can submit ideas and suggestions, and open forums for discussion and debate. Yet half of the technologies mentioned by survey respondents are not truly participatory because they are designed more for one-way communication than two-way interaction. \n The survey did, however, reveal a handful of more collaborative platforms, including Crossiety (dubbed the “digital village square”) and Decidim. With such a wide variety of options available, governments are free to choose how involved they want citizens to be in the decision-making process.\nPlanning leads the way\n “Swiss authorities use civic tech across a broad spectrum of policy areas,” says Armelle Hausser, a doctoral assistant at LaSUR who carried out the survey as part of her PhD research. “Chief among these are planning and development, youth services, sport, environment and social action.” In most cases, local executive bodies are the driving force behind civic tech usage – and legal requirements have little to no bearing on such initiatives. In fact, just one-third of the platforms and technologies reported by respondents were developed to meet a legal obligation. \n Conversely, other interested parties – such as project and department managers, citizens’ groups, charities and non-profits – rarely call for the use of civic tech in consultation and participation processes. “This finding is counter-intuitive,” says Professor Vincent Kaufmann, who heads LaSUR. “It suggests that, in Switzerland, citizens still prefer to voice their views through conventional channels, for instance by objecting to planning proposals or by taking part in popular initiatives and referendums.”\nLimited resources\n The team also found that local governments currently allocate little in the way of funding and human resources to civic tech initiatives, preferring in the majority of cases to outsource the process to external providers. “Authorities don’t yet have a clear idea of the roles and skills required for this kind of initiative,” explains Hausser. Yet expectations were high among the respondents, who said they planned to use civic tech to produce more information for public consumption, keep citizens better informed and understand their views, improve transparency, secure public support and widen participation more generally.\n “There are many other plans in the pipeline, including online surveys and participatory mapping platforms,” adds Hausser. “In terms of technology types, a general direction of travel seems to be emerging. But we’ll need to run the survey again to make doubly sure.” What is certain is that Swiss authorities are keen to embrace civic tech, with no fewer than 31 high-priority initiatives planned for the coming year. \nRoom to improve\n The LaSUR team found clear room for improvement in two areas. First, although citizens’ views obtained using civic tech are reflected in accompanying reports, Swiss authorities still tend not to give these views due weight in the final decision-making process. And second, it is still too early to properly assess the impact of the technology on citizen participation. The researchers will have a clearer picture after running their second survey, scheduled for fall 2020.\n The results of the initial survey will be presented at a special event – open to practitioners and other interested parties as well as the wider public – on 3 February 2020 at the 3DD Espace de Concertation in Geneva. Hausser will incorporate the findings into her thesis, which focuses on wider issues around the use of civic tech for public participation in planning processes in Switzerland. Her research is supervised by Prof. Kaufmann and Boris Beaude, in partnership with Geneva Canton.\n«Résultat de l’enquête Baromètre des civic tech en Suisse 2019», Armelle Hausser and Prof. Vincent Kaufmann, 3 February 2020 1.30pm, in French, 3DD espace de concertation, Rue David Dufour 3, Geneva.

{"id": 651, "text": "How can we bring to life a musical heritage now preserved in a digital format? How does this newly digitised heritage change our perception of the past? And what new cultural perspectives does it open? An interdisciplinary research project by the EPFL + ECAL Lab, Metamedia Center and the ALICE laboratory set out to address these questions. It all began when Audemars Piguet joined forces with Montreux Sounds and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) to digitise, restore and preserve the treasured archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival, which was founded by the late Claude Nobs exactly 50 years ago. The tremendous collection comprises thousands of hours of recordings by the finest musicians on the planet. It is the first audiovisual library to have earned the accolade of UNESCO Memory of the World. “The project was inspired by the work of Claude Nobs. He was a faithful friend and so we are delighted to take part in this initiative. We are proud to participate in the colossal technological efforts needed to transform this unique heritage into a first-class digitised resource for future generations,” says Olivier Audemars, Vice-Chairman of the Audemars Piguet Board of Directors.\nWork to preserve this legacy began in 2008 and is almost complete. Over the years the archives of the Montreux Jazz Festival have taken many different formats. “All the master copies have now been digitised and work on the original tapes will be finished by the end of the summer. We can now make full use of this heritage for research purposes,” continues Alain Dufaux, Operations Director at Metamedia Center. In the past 8 years, more than 11,000 hours of video recordings (in HD since 1991) and 6,000 hours of high-quality audio recordings have been preserved in uncompressed digital formats utilizing the very latest technology. Since 2010, this unique collection has used as a database for a number of research projects at EPFL.\nLiving heritage\n The study conducted by the EPFL+ECAL Lab, the research centre for design at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the ALICE architecture studio ALICE (at EPFL), proposes a new vision for this digitised heritage. The aim is not to reconstitute the past, but instead to create a specific experience for a digitised archive. “The original concert experience is the backdrop of Lake Geneva and the mountains, the ambiance of festival-goers in their thousands, the unfolding of events on-stage, and above all the flesh-and-blood presence of the musicians. We can’t recreate this. Instead we need to make the most of what digital has to offer to create an alternative experience, a complementary experience,” explains Project Manager Nicolas Henchoz. The first private booth was launched in 2012 and awarded the Design Preis Schweiz the following year.\nA ramped-up version of the booth, dubbed Montreux Heritage Lab2, opens to the public in November in the brand new Montreux Jazz Café at EPFL. Montreux Heritage Lab2 unlocks the lion’s share of the archive footage, immersing up to 20 viewers at a time in an intense audiovisual experience.\nEPFL was guided by three principles in developing the new booth. First, the content and its cultural value take front and center. Stunning, well-preserved archival footage dominates the space, appearing on a screen whose sophisticated geometry gives the viewer a sense of depth and proximity to the stage. Then comes the surround sound – so fundamental to the immersive effect – which was orchestrated by Audioborn and Illusonic (two startups founded by former members of the Audiovisual Communications Laboratory, LCAV) with help from Hervé Lissek's Acoustic Group (LTS2) and the Yverdon-les-Bains company Relec with its PSI Audio high-precision speakers. The viewer’s experience is thus shaped by live footage and music – the very essence of the archive. The sense of immersion is further enhanced by the lateral walls of the booth, where mirrors reflect the selected footage and display information and visuals through an LED underlay. The experience is rounded out by anecdotes on the history of the festival showing up on the screens. The booth is structured to direct its light toward the Montreux Jazz Café next door and, in the evening, towards the heart of the campus. \nPurpose-designed controls afford an overview of the archive footage, placing more than 44,000 tracks at your fingertips.\n---\nFrom the outset, the project saw the light of day thanks to the crucial support from Audemars Piguet, who has been involved since the beginning.

Equipped with an autopilot and a miniature high-definition camera, it is used by hundreds of professionals worldwide. This start-up installed at the gates of EPFL hopes to increase its sales tenfold in the next years and create dozens of new jobs in the field of airborne drones. It does so thanks to an investment of 5 million Swiss Francs from the publicly traded French company Parrot, making them a majority shareholder in senseFly.\nsenseFly drones demonstrate the full extent of their capabilities when combined with software developed by Pix4D, a spin-off of EPFL’s Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLAB). The algorithms developed by Pix4D make it possible to assemble hundreds of aerial pictures and, within minutes, to get an extremely accurate 3D and geo-referenced image of the observed terrain. This young company based at EPFL’s Science Park is also of interest to Parrot, which invested 2.4 million Swiss Francs for a minority share in Pix4D. “In the 1980’s the algorithms were really unreliable, and I was convinced it would take well over thirty years to become the basis of fully-automated, reliable and useful commercial products. This is a wonderful example of how curiosity-driven research, for example the ability of a human to make sense of the world around him through what he sees, eventually led to useful results,” said Pascal Fua, director of the CVLAB.\nLike an Insect\nUsing one of senseFly’s small high-performance drones is a breeze. The course can be programmed with software pre-flight and still be modified throughout the flight’s duration. No runway necessary: three movements back-and-forth are enough to start the engine, and the 500-gram wing takes off. The drone reaches a cruising speed of 40 km/h to autonomously map areas ranging from a few hectares to several square kilometers in one flight, with a resolution ranging from 3 to 30 cm/pixel depending on the distance above ground. Within a maximum of thirty minutes, the drone returns to its starting point without further assistance. All that is necessary for the next mission is to change the battery.\nThe technology on which these devices are based was created in 2001, when a team of robotics researchers in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) at EPFL began to investigate the strategies of control and navigation in flying insects. Early research led to the development of an integrated autopilot using intelligent control strategies similar to that of flies and bees. “By 2008 it was included in an ultra-light flying wing, which incorporated all the advantages of insects: efficient, elegant, light, elemental and intelligent,” recalls Jean-Christophe Zufferey, founder and CEO of senseFly. “I am very pleased that our robotic flying insect has not only helped to elucidate biological issues, but has also been able to promote the socio-economic development of our region by creating dozens of new high-value jobs. In collaboration with the newly created National Competence Center in Robotics, senseFly contributes to making EPFL and the surrounding region an important center for artificial intelligence and robotics,” says Dario Floreano, director of the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and of the National Competence Center in Robotics.\nWhile the legislation for the usage of drones is being discussed in most countries, the low mass and speed of these ultra-light drones gives them a unique advantage by limiting the potential damage they could cause and thereby favored for civilian use.\nEPFL’s Pole of Expertise in Civilian Drones\nParrot, a global leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones, has recently invested in drones for the consumer market. It has released a Wi-Fi controllable quadricopter, of which it has sold more than 300,000 since its launch in 2010. The collaboration with the French group will create synergies for both EPFL start-ups.\nThe increasing need of data for Geographical Information Systems (GIS), such as Google Earth & Street View, should drive the market of ultra-light professional civilian drones to one billion dollars by 2020. The combination of senseFly trouble-free hardware, Pix4D’s unique mapping software and Parrot high volume manufacturing expertise provide the key elements to address this fast emerging market. Furthermore, the collaborations with the National Competence Centers (www.nccr-robotics.ch & www.MICS.org), both managed by EPFL, provide a heart to this internationally recognized center of expertise in civilian UAV technologies.\nSenseFly, founded in 2009 in “Le Garage”, EPFL’s incubator, will remain in the region and its management team will stay at the helm. “We can benefit from the technological expertise of Parrot, from its externalized industrial organization and its financial strength to accelerate our worldwide distribution,” said Jean-Christophe Zufferey, senseFly CEO. This strategic investment will give the French company access to the expertise and the technology for specialized drones.\nAs for Pix4D, created in 2011, Parrot’s investment enables the exploration of new business horizons. “This reinforces our position as a leader in software for professional drones,” adds Christoph Strecha, the company’s CEO.", "summary": "The French company Parrot, world leader in wireless peripherals for mobile phones and already in the market for consumer drones, acquired for 5 million Swiss Francs a majority share in senseFly, a start-up from the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL.

{"id": 655, "text": "Many areas of fundamental research are interested in graphene owing to its exceptional characteristics. It is made of one layer of carbon atoms, which makes it light and sturdy, and it is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Despite its apparently limitless potential, however, few applications have been demonstrated to date. Scientists at EPFL’s Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory (BIOS) together with researchers from the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO, Spain) have now added another one. They have harnessed graphene’s unique optical and electronic properties to develop a reconfigurable highly sensitive molecule sensor. The results are described in an article appearing in the latest edition of the journal \nScience\n. \n Focussing light to improve sensing \n The researchers used graphene to improve on a well-­‐known molecule-­‐detection method: infrared absorption spectroscopy. In the standard method, light is used to excite the molecules, which vibrate differently depending on their nature. It can be compared to a guitar string, which makes different sounds depending on its length. By virtue of this vibration, the molecules reveal their presence and even their identity. This “signature” can be “read” in the reflected light. \n This method is not effective, however, in detecting nanometrically-­‐sized molecules. The wavelength of the infrared photon directed at a molecule is around 6 microns (6,000 nanometres – 0.006 millimeters), while the target measures only a few nanometres (about 0.000001 mm). It is very challenging to detect the vibration of such a small molecule in reflected light. \n There is where graphene comes in. If given the correct geometry, the graphene is able to focus the light on a precise spot on its surface and “hear” the vibration of a nanometric molecule that is attached to it. “We first pattern nanostructures on the graphene surface by bombarding it with electron beams and etching it with oxygen ions,” said Daniel Rodrigo, co‐author of the publication. “When the light arrives, the electrons in graphene nanostructures begin to oscillate. This phenomenon, known as ‘localized surface plasmon resonance,’ serves to concentrate light into tiny spots, which are comparable with the dimensions of the target molecules. It is then possible to detect nanometric structures.”\nReconfiguring graphene in real time to see the molecule’s structure\n There is more to it. In addition to identifying the presence of nanometric molecules, this process can also reveal the nature of the bonds connecting the atoms that the molecule is composed of.\nWhen a molecule vibrates, it does not give off only one type of \"sound.\" It produces a whole range of vibrations, which are generated by the bonds connecting the different atoms. Returning to the example of the guitar: each string vibrates differently and together they form one musical instrument. These nuances provide information on the nature of each bond and on the health of the entire molecule. “These vibrations act as a fingerprint that allow us to identify the molecule; such as proteins, and can even tell their health status” said Odeta Limaj, another co-­author of the publication.\nIn order to pick up the sound given off by each of the strings, it has to be possible to identify a whole range of frequencies. And that is something graphene can do. The researchers “tuned” the graphene to different frequencies by applying voltage, which is not possible with current sensors. Making graphene's electrons oscillate in different ways makes it possible to “read” all the vibrations of the molecule on its surface. “We tested this method on proteins that we attached to the graphene. It gave us a full picture of the molecule,” said Hatice Altug.\nA big step closer to using graphene for molecule sensing\n The new graphene-­‐based process represents a major step forward for the researchers, for several reasons. First, this simple method shows that it is possible to conduct a complex analysis using only one device, while it normally requires many different ones. And all this without stressing or modifying the biological sample. Second, it shows graphene’s incredible potential in the area of detection. “There are many possible applications,” said Altug. “We focussed on biomolecules, but the method should also work for polymers, and many other substances,” she added.\n Source :\nDaniel Rodrigo et al.

{"id": 656, "text": "Katie Bouman was one of 200 scientists who helped create the first-ever image of a black hole, released this past April. The 30-year old researcher, who was recently named an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), came to speak at EPFL’s Open Science Day. Martin Vetterli took advantage of that opportunity to sit down with her and ask her a few questions about their field of shared interest.\nMV: “It’s pretty unusual for someone to become a star researcher at such a young age. How did you get into science?\nKB: I was very interested in science as a kid. When I was in third grade, I remember looking under rocks all the time. And as I got older, I was constantly drawn to the different science topics covered in class. In sixth grade, I first got involved in science fair projects, and I continued doing that on and off through high school. Then, when I tried out research for the first time, I was thrilled: it was so different from a homework set, where you know there’s a solution even if it’s difficult to find. Research was a new way of thinking and problem-solving for me, and I found that very exciting.\nHow did you get into computer science?\nIt wasn’t until high school, when a friend convinced me to take a computer science class. At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago.

{"id": 657, "text": "A flock of birds suddenly taking off and flying in formation, acting like one entity, is a stunning and complex communication effort. But can flying robots imitate birds when flying in a flocking formation? Today, a demonstration of EPFL’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems technology will be presented at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2011) by Sabine Hauert. She shows how up to ten fixed-wing robots can fly in flock-like formation patterns by communicating with their neighbors.\n Hauert, who achieved this result within her PhD studies in Professor Dario Floreano’s Laboratory of Intelligent Systems, adapted an algorithm developed in 1986 by Craig Reynolds that simulates individual birds communicating with their flying neighbors in order to stay in a close formation. The robots, developed by EPFL spin-off senseFly, communicate by creating a one-to-one wireless network in the sky—each one can then tell the distance and direction of its closest neighbors, keeping the flock together without regard for all of the robots as a group.\n “Flocking requires three things. You need to move with the same speed and direction as your neighbors, you need to avoid hitting them and you need to stay close,” Hauert, now a post-doctoral student at MIT recently told Wired.com.\n Computer simulations at Floreano’s laboratory show that it is possible to flock up to 100 Micro-Air Vehicles or MAVs with this novel control algorithm. For the moment, Hauert’s achievement of 10 flocking MAVs in Lausanne’s blue sky, the largest grouping so far, once again shows the potential of taking principles from Nature to develop collaboration between “intelligent” robots.", "summary": "Up to ten autonomous flying robots flock like birds in a real-sky experiment.", "claim": "Up to three autonomous flying robots flock like birds in a real-sky experiment.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [2, 2], "noise": false}

The firms that make these items produce large amounts of CO\n2\n emissions and have a huge impact on the environment. At the COP21 climate conference in Paris, world leaders highlighted the prominent role that manufacturers could play in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nMaziar Kermani, a researcher at EPFL’s  group, which is headed by Professor François Maréchal, has come up with a pioneering mathematical model that could cut the amount of water and energy used in industrial processes. He has developed a way to recycle lost heat and energy and to employ biorefinery technologies – combining turbines and organic fluids – to boost power production.\nKermani applied his model to a Canadian paper mill. He found that, in theory, it could cut the amount of water the firm used from 820 kg to 230-300 kg per second (a drop of around 60%). It could also allow the mill to produce more than six times as much electricity (from 3 MW to around 20 MW). His findings have been published in \nEnergies\n.\nContinuous recycling of water and heat\nKermani tested out his theory on kraft pulping – by far the most popular paper-making method in the industry.\nWood chips are wetted, cooked (in digesters), washed, dried and bleached to make pulp. All of this produces vast amounts of steam which, in addition to being used in the process itself, generates more than enough electricity to power the plant. The surplus energy can then be sold.\nAccording to Kermani, however, the current system is far from optimal. “Huge amounts of water and energy go to waste because the stages of the process aren’t connected,” he explains. “For instance, the mill uses cold water to wash and cool the pulp. But that water, which contains valuable heat, is then discarded. Likewise, high-pressure steam is produced by burning black liquor at extremely high temperatures – around 1,200°C. The steam powers turbines to generate electricity and provides a heat source for other processes, but it’s too energy intensive to produce.”\nOrganic fluids\n In his paper, Kermani outlines several ways in which the heated water could be reused. He also recommends introducing organic Rankine cycles, which rely on a special property of organic fluids: the fact that they turn into high-pressure steam at relatively low temperatures (250°C). “Using organic fluids would allow the mill to produce the steam it needs using recovered hot water at low-to-medium temperatures,” he explains.\nThe Canadian firm has expressed interest in Kermani’s model. “As compared to strictly mathematical and limited methods, the proposed approach provides insightful information for the preliminary design of industrial heat exchanger networks involved in pulp and paper,” says Canadian industrial process expert Marzouk Benali, who is tasked with optimizing that company’s processes. “Its flexibility offers opportunities to assess the direct impacts of integrating emerging biorefinery technologies within existing large facilities.”\nKermani’s model has potential applications in other sectors and industries as well.\nCollaborations:\nThis research was conducted as part of a collaboration between EPFL and CanmetENERGY, a Natural Resources Canada research center.", "summary": "An EPFL researcher has developed a mathematical model for optimizing heat transfer in factories and dramatically reducing water and energy consumption.

{"id": 659, "text": "Vincent Kaufmann, a sociologist who specializes in mobility studies, decided to expand his usual focus on urban areas to include Switzerland and the European Union (EU). Kaufmann, who is also the head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, teamed up with Spanish researcher Ander Audikana to write an essay on mobility and the free movement of people in the EU and in Switzerland. The authors’ starting point was the “Stop mass immigration\" initiative, which was approved by voters on 9 February 2014.\nTheir essay provides a Swiss perspective that people concerned about a borderless EU and its unintended consequences might do well to consider. Clive H. Church, researcher at the University of Kent,\nalso draws an interesting parallel between Switzerland and post-Brexit UK in the book’s preface. Vincent Kaufmann tells us why this essay is important.\nWhat gave rise to this essay?\nSwitzerland has been dealing with mobility-related issues for decades: the introduction of the Erasmus program, truck traffic crossing the Alps, limiting trucks to 40 tons, the AlpTransit initiative, the free movement of people, the modal shift from road to rail, and so on. All these issues have one thing in common: mobility. And yet, they are never analyzed together. On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people voted on two separate questions that, in reality, were both rooted in mobility. On that day, the people approved the “Stop mass immigration” initiative, which called for immigration quotas. They also gave the go-ahead for a fund to upgrade the country’s rail infrastructure. In a way, Swiss people paradoxically voted for “less mobility” and “more mobility” at the same time. Since then, there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric but very little sociological analysis of what really happened in that vote. Seeing this, Ander Audikana and I wanted to show how important it is to look at all these mobility issues together, in Switzerland but also in the EU, in order to get a better idea of what the consequences will be.\nWhat are your main conclusions?\nIn the first part of our essay, we look at the EU’s founding documents. It’s clear that the free movement of people – much more than economic interests – was at the core of the European project. These documents show that mobility was considered the only way of unifying the member states and erasing the differences in their political and welfare systems. The Erasmus program, for example, clearly states this goal in its founding texts. But there are two sides to mobility: movement and “moorings”. Moorings refer to the connections a person makes once they have moved to a new place: building meaningful social relationships, absorbing the culture, learning the language, making use of public spaces, coming to identify with the place and building an emotional bond with it etc. Unfortunately, EU policies largely overlook this, and instead demand that people move from place to place while failing to assess the consequences of widespread geographical mobility on regional development, the ability of diverse groups of people to live alongside each other, and wage dumping. These problems are left to the individual member countries, and we think this is a major shortcoming.\nHow does this shortcoming affect Switzerland?\nIn theory, an EU company could win a contract to plant trees in a small Swiss town, and no local landscaping companies would be able to compete on price. This is a good example of mobility without moorings: the cross-border deal is encouraged without first looking at whether this scenario is fair. While people consider these types of situations totally unfair, the EU has created a legal apparatus that is simply oblivious to this. It’s this type of mechanism that Europeans are now rallying against, as we see in the rise in populism. The mobility demanded by the EU creates as many problems as it solves.\nYou interviewed the leaders of the six main political parties in Switzerland about this issue. Yet they are cited anonymously in your essay. Why did you do this?\nWe wanted to get away from partisan politics and take an anthropological approach. Rereading these interviews, we saw that mobility-related questions did not fit neatly into the left-right paradigm. We see, for example, very liberal views on both sides: the idea that the world will be a better place the more people move around. At the same time, there’s a need for the state to be more assertive and get a better grip on the flow of money, people and goods. We think that where these two positions meet is where we can find compromises and solutions. In Switzerland, local identity is important and is currently seen as being under threat. The people want the government to do something about this.\nIs this what the EU could learn from the Swiss experience when it comes to rethinking mobility and the elimination of borders? \nSwitzerland is seeking a better balance between mobility and moorings. The fact that the EU is so dogmatic about being borderless is a problem for Switzerland, since this country doesn’t work that way. The Swiss don't subscribe to dogmas – they reach compromises through discussion and direct democracy. For EU countries, Switzerland is an interesting laboratory. Debates that do not happen elsewhere take place here. We feel that the way in which the Swiss achieve compromises on questions of mobility and the free movement of people could help the EU overcome some of the hurdles it faces. Our analysis shows, for example, that the EU should not have focused so much on a policy of \nmobility\n in its founding documents but rather on a policy of \naccessibility\n: access to services, to infrastructure and to other countries. The EU’s overriding goal should not be to make sure that people move from here to there at all costs. It should be to guarantee a certain level of fairness when people, goods, and services move across borders. Returning to the example of EU companies competing in Switzerland: in order to gain access to the Swiss market, these companies should apply Swiss prices.\nIn your essay, you foresee a return to medieval, walled-in cities in Europe. Is the situation that dire? \nThe current border situation will require a strong political response by the EU. Failing that, we believe there’s a good chance that walls, watchtowers and barbed wire could indeed pop up all over Europe, transforming the continent into a gated community.\nVincent Kaufmann, Ander Audikana, \nMobilité et Libre circulation en Europe: un regard suisse\n, Fondation Jean Monnet, Economica - Les Cahiers rouges, Paris, 2017.", "summary": "Vincent Kaufmann, an EPFL researcher, has co-authored an essay on Switzerland’s recent referendums on mobility and the free movement of people.

{"id": 661, "text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, researchers are turning their attention to the virus’ biology, mechanism of action, and possible treatments. One of the targets are a group of immune cells called “neutrophils”, which have been reported to infiltrate the respiratory tract of patients who have died from COVID-19.\nThe idea is that in their attempt to attack the virus, neutrophils might be making the disease’s symptoms even worse by invading the lungs and exacerbating inflammation there. In order to find out if this is actually the case, scientists may use a mouse model whose neutrophils they deplete with “anti-neutrophil” antibodies.\nThe approach is used widely for studying neutrophils in a number of different conditions, including autoimmune diseases, chronic infection or inflammation, wound healing, and even some types of cancer. However, the neutrophil-depletion model is only partially effective, lacks specificity, and doesn’t last long enough.\nA neutrophil with its typical\n,\n segmented nucleus\n.\nA \nprotrusion of the nucleus \nacts like \na \n“\ndouble-edged sword\n”\n, \nwhich the neutrophil wields \nto kill \npathogens –\n but which \nalso \nsometimes damages tissues and exacerbates disease\ns\n. \nCredit: \nEtienne Meylan, EPFL\nNow, scientists led by Etienne Meylan at EPFL, have identified the source of the problem and have developed an alternative model that addresses its shortcomings.

The researchers have now identified these neutrophils, and determined that the reason they survive is because they have a lower chance of being targeted by the antibodies.\nTo address this, the scientists have developed a double antibody depletion strategy that enhances neutrophil elimination. The method increases the killing rate of the antibodies, resulting in a profound, specific and long-lasting reduction in neutrophil numbers in blood and tissues.\n“Our study could be useful to address the functional importance of neutrophils in acute or chronic infection, in inflammation or in cancer,” says Meylan. “In particular, transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection coupled to our standardized neutrophil depletion strategies may help establish a causal link between this innate immune cell type and COVID-19.”\nOther contributors\nLausanne University Hospital (CHUV)\nSwiss Cancer Center Léman\nINSERM, France\nMassachusetts General Hospital Research Institute\nUniversity Duisburg–Essen", "summary": "Neutrophils are critical immune cells for antimicrobial defense, but they can exacerbate a number of diseases, perhaps including COVID-19.

{"id": 662, "text": "In our information society, the synthesis, distribution, and processing of radio and microwave signals are ubiquitous in wireless networks, telecommunications, and radars. The current tendency is to use carriers in higher frequency bands, especially with looming bandwidth bottlenecks due to demands for e.g. 5G and the “Internet of Things”. “Microwave photonics”, a combination of microwave engineering and optoelectronics, might offer a solution.\nA key building block of microwave photonics is optical frequency combs, which provide hundreds of equidistant and mutually coherent laser lines. They are ultrashort optical pulses emitted with a stable repetition rate that corresponds precisely to the frequency spacing of comb lines. The photodetection of the pulses produces a microwave carrier.\nIn recent years there has been significant progress on chip-scale frequency combs generated from nonlinear microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers. These frequency combs rely on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons, which are ultrashort coherent light pulses circulating inside optical microresonators. Because of this, these frequency combs are commonly called “soliton microcombs”.\nGenerating soliton microcombs needs nonlinear microresonators, and these can be directly built on-chip using CMOS nanofabrication technology. The co-integration with electronic circuitry and integrated lasers paves the path to comb miniaturization, allowing a host of applications in metrology, spectroscopy and communications.\nPublishing in \nNature Photonics\n, an EPFL research team led by Tobias J. Kippenberg has now demonstrated integrated soliton microcombs with repetition rates as low as 10 GHz. This was achieved by significantly lowering the optical losses of integrated photonic waveguides based on silicon nitride, a material already used in CMOS micro-electronic circuits, and which has also been used in the last decade to build photonic integrated circuits that guide laser light on-chip.\nThe scientists were able to manufacture silicon nitride waveguides with the lowest loss in any photonic integrated circuit. Using this technology, the generated coherent soliton pulses have repetition rates in both the microwave K- (~20 GHz, used in 5G) and X-band (~10 GHz, used in radars).\nThe resulting microwave signals feature phase noise properties on par with or even lower than commercial electronic microwave synthesizers. The demonstration of integrated soliton microcombs at microwave repetition rates bridges the fields of integrated photonics, nonlinear optics and microwave photonics.\nThe EPFL team achieved a level of optical losses low enough to allow light to propagate nearly 1 meter in a waveguide that is only 1 micrometer in diameter –100 times smaller than that a human hair. This loss level is still more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value in optical fibers, but represents the lowest loss in any tightly confining waveguide for integrated nonlinear photonics to date.\nSuch low loss is the result of a new manufacturing process developed by EPFL scientists – the “silicon nitride photonic Damascene process”. “This process, when carried out using deep-ultraviolet stepper lithography, gives truly spectacular performance in terms of low loss, which is not attainable using conventional nanofabrication techniques,” says Junqiu Liu, the paper’s first author who also lead the fabrication of silicon nitride nanophotonic chips at EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi). “These microcombs, and their microwave signals, could be critical elements for building fully integrated low-noise microwave oscillators for future architectures of radars and information networks.”\nThe EPFL team is already working with collaborators in US to develop hybrid-integrated soliton microcomb modules that combine chip-scale semiconductor lasers. These highly compact microcombs can impact many applications, e.g. transceivers in datacenters, LiDAR, compact optical atomic clocks, optical coherence tomography, microwave photonics, and spectroscopy.", "summary": "Using integrated photonic chips fabricated at EPFL, scientists have demonstrated laser-based microwave generators.

{"id": 663, "text": "There is growing evidence that our clothing exposes us to particles and chemicals on a daily basis – and that this exposure could carry significant health risks. Scientists therefore need to better quantify this exposure so that we can develop strategies for mitigating those risks. At least that’s according to Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at EPFL’s Smart Living Lab in Fribourg, who has just published a critical review of research on this topic in Environmental Science and Technology.\n Our clothing acts as a protective barrier against physical and chemical hazards. However, it can also expose us to potentially toxic chemicals and biological particles by releasing millions of such substances every day, depending on how we use and treat the fabrics. Some substances are removed by washing, drying and storing clothing properly, while others stick around and become difficult to get rid of. \nAnalysis of 260 articles\n These potentially toxic substances include molecular compounds, abiotic particles and biotic particles (such as microbes and allergens), and can end up in our lungs. Common examples include nicotine residue from cigarette smoke, microbes from pets and hazardous compounds used in the farming, medical and manufacturing industries. Surprisingly, until now scientists have taken little interest in this issue. In the first part of his paper, Licina summaries the findings of 260 articles on the subject and identifies some serious knowledge gaps as well as specific avenues for further research. \n “We feel this issue has been understudied so far. The clothing and fabrics people wear have changed enormously over the past few years – today our clothes contain synthetic materials with antimicrobial, anti-UV, stain-repellent and water-repellent additives – but nobody can say whether these new materials expose us to more chemicals and particles than natural fibers,” says Licina. \nA significant impact \n He suggests requiring that all clothing include a label indicating not just what materials it is made from, but also what substances were used in the fabrication process – much like the ingredient and nutrition-information labels that are required on food. “Today there are no laws or regulations addressing this issue,” says Licina. In short, we know that clothing can have a significant impact on our daily exposure to particles and chemicals, through the air we breathe and the contact with our skin, but we don’t what the full ramifications are in terms of public health. \n Dusan Licina has been writing articles on this subject for several years. While he was performing research in the US (from 2016 to 2018), he spent a year continually monitoring indoor air quality at a neonatal intensive-care unit. He measured how particles are transported inside the unit and even to babies’ incubators. Licina found that when nurses entered the unit, the air-particle concentration increased by a factor of 2.5, and that some of those particles could be traced directly to the shirts that nurses wore during their commute to the hospital. These particles could feasibly play a major role in the development of the babies’ immune systems. But, once again, more research is needed.\nNon-smokers exposed\n Similar studies carried out on clothing worn in other settings revealed significant traces of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides – compounds that could be absorbed by fabrics in one place and released in another. “Research has already shown that an individual’s clothing can carry potentially toxic particles that can expose people nearby. For example, scientists have found that non-smokers who sit next to smokers with nicotine particles on their clothing have traces of nicotine in their blood and urine later on,\" says Licina. “What’s more, the particle concentrations that people are thus exposed to from clothing are substantial when compared with total exposure estimates in health effect studies. However, what’s missing are data on how that exposure affects us on a day-to-day basis.” \n To fill in those gaps, Licina calls on biologists and chemists to work closely with environmental engineers, in the interests of public health. He also suggests that until further research is conducted and better clothing-information regulations are adopted, consumers pay more attention to how their clothes are made and wash them regularly using gentle, all-natural detergents.", "summary": "Dusan Licina, a tenure-track assistant professor at the Smart Living Lab, EPFL Fribourg, has taken a critical look at how much we really know about our exposure to particles and chemicals transported by our clothing.

Place it at a certain angle between a white wall and a light source, and a clear, coherent image appears of the face of Alan Turing, the famous British mathematician and father of modern computer science.\nThere’s no magic here; the only thing at work is the relief on the plaque’s surface and a natural optical phenomenon known as a “caustic,” which researchers in EPFL’s Computer Graphics and Geometry Laboratory have succeeded in bending to their will. Their research was presented recently at the Advances in Architectural Geometry Conference in Paris. A public demonstration will also be held November 16-17 at EPFL as part of the Alan Turing days, an event celebrating the 100th birthday of the famous scientist.\n“With the technique that we’ve developed, we can compose any image we want, from a simple form such as a star to complex representations such as faces or landscapes,” explains EPFL professor Mark Pauly, head of the laboratory, who conducted the study with four other scientists*.\nThis “caustic” effect is well known and easy to observe; a bit of sunlight shining on a pool of water produces patterns that dance on the surrounding tiles or walls. These undulating lines, apparently random, are generated by light that hits the moving surface of a pool or puddle. This effect, which is very mobile and dynamic in liquid, produces static patterns with solid transparent materials such as glass or transparent acrylic (better known as Plexiglass).\nDeviated trajectories\nScientifically, this phenomenon can be explained by light refraction. When light rays hit a transparent surface, they continue their trajectory but are bent as a function of the surface geometry and optical properties of the material. The light passing through is thus not uniformly distributed. It gets concentrated in certain points, forming some zones that are more intense and others that are more shaded.\nPauly and his colleagues studied the principles of this distribution, and were able to identify the curves and undulations they would need to give to the surface in order to direct the beams of light to a desired area. They then developed an algorithm, to calculate the trajectories very precisely and thus form a specific image.\nOne of the most interesting and eagerly awaited applications of this method is in architecture. It could be applied to display cases, windows, fountains, and ornamentations on museums and monuments. In design it could be used for decorating glasses, vases, carafes, jewelry and many other objects. It has considerable potential in other, more technical applications as well, such as automobile headlights and projectors.\n*Thomas Kiser (EPFL), Michael Eigensatz (Evolute), Minh Man Nguyen (WAO) and Philippe Bompas.", "summary": "When beams of light hit a pool of water or a glass object, they produce beautiful, seemingly random patterns on surrounding surfaces.

{"id": 667, "text": "Looking for life on other planets is not straightforward. It usually relies on chemical detection, which might be limited or even completely irrelevant to alien biology. On the other hand, motion is a trait of all life, and can be used to identify microorganisms without any need of chemical foreknowledge. EPFL scientists have now developed an extremely sensitive yet simple motion detector that can be built easily by adapting already-existent technology. The system has proven accurate with detecting bacteria, yeast, and even cancer cells, and is considered for the rapid testing of drugs and even the detection of extraterrestrial life. The work is published in the \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)\n.\nGiovanni Dietler, Sandor Kasas and Giovanni Longo at EPFL have developed a motion detector that uses a nano-sized cantilever to detect motion. A cantilever is essentially a beam that is anchored only at one end, with the other end bearing a load. The cantilever design is often used with bridges and buildings, but here it is implemented on the micrometer scale, and about 500 bacteria can be deposited on it.\nThe idea comes from the technology behind an existing microscope, the atomic force microscope. This powerful microscope uses a cantilever to produce pictures of the very atoms on a surface. The cantilever scans the surface like the needle of a record player and its up-and-down movement is read by a laser to produce an image.\nThe motion sensor the Dietler and Kasas developed works the same way, but here the sample is attached on the cantilever itself. For example, a bacterium attaches to the cantilever. If the bacterium is alive, it will inevitably move in some way, e.g. move its flagellum or simply carry out normal biological functions. That motion also moves the much smaller and sensitive cantilever and it is captured by the readout laser as series of vibrations. The signal is taken as a sign of life.\nThe EPFL scientists successfully tested their novel system with isolated bacteria, yeast, mouse and human cells. They even tested soil from the fields around the EPFL campus and water from the nearby Sorge river. In each case, they were able to accurately detect and isolate vibration signatures from living cells. When they used drugs to kill anything alive, the motion signals stopped.\n\"The system has the benefit of being completely chemistry-free,\" says Dietler. \"That means that it can be used anywhere - in drug testing or even in the search for extraterrestrial life.\" The scientists envision a large array of cantilever sensors used in future space exploration probes like the Mars rover. As it relies on motion rather than chemistry, the cantilever sensor would be able to detect life forms in mediums that are native to other planets, such as the methane in the lakes of Titan.\nHowever, the more immediate applications of the cantilever system are in drug development. Used in a larger array, the cantilevers could be covered with bacteria or cancer cells and incubated with various drug compounds. If the drugs are effective against the attached cells, the motion signals would decrease or stop altogether as the cells die off. This approach would be considerably quicker than current high-throughput systems used in by pharmaceutical companies when looking for candidate antibiotics or anticancer drugs.\n\"This is really the next step,\" says Dietler. \"But we're still calling ESA and NASA to see if they're interested.\"\nThis work represents a collaboration of EPFL’s Laboratory of Physics of Living Matter with the University of Lausanne and the Vlaams Institute for Biotechnology.\nReference\nKasas S, Simone Ruggeri FS, Benadiba C, Maillard C, Stupar P, Tournuc H, Dietler G, Longo G. \nDetecting nanoscale vibrations as signature of life.\nPNAS\n 29 December 2014. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1415348112", "summary": "EPFL scientists have developed an extremely sensitive device that can detect life forms by sensing the slightest motion.

Drones races certainly, but research and innovation were also in the spotlight with booths presenting the drones of the future, an exhibition of robotics, conferences, demonstrations and workshops for young and old. Switzerland’s fastest drone pilot was crowned following a spectacular race.\n12.09.17 - A new drone, developed at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems with funding of NCCR Robotics, uses cutting-edge technology to deliver parcels weighing up to 500 grams. The device will never get stuck in traffic, it’s programmed to avoid obstacles, and it can reach destinations on steep or uneven terrain. Its protective cage and foldable design mean that it can be carried around in a backpack and used in total safety.\n13.09.17 - Many cancers are known to metastasize and spread by expanding nearby lymphatic vessels. This process, lymphangiogenesis, also helps the tumor evade the patient’s own immune system, and it would be expected that inhibiting lymphangiogenesis, could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, which are only effective in a minority of patients. But scientists from EPFL and the US found the opposite: lymphangiogenesis actually enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy against melanoma. The study has significant implications for new types of cancer therapies.\n15.10.17 - The Swiss team and their solar house, the NeighborHub, has won the prestigious Solar Decathlon 2017 competition in the Unites States. The Swiss Living Challenge and its multidisciplinary team - 4 schools, 250 students (44 in Denver), 150 supervisors from the professional and academic sectors, and close to 50 sponsors - received the highest award.

{"id": 669, "text": "Bees and fish don’t often have the occasion to meet, nor would they have much to say to each other if they did. However, under the ASSISIbf project, engineers from EPFL and four other European universities* were able to get groups of bees and fish to communicate with each other. The bees were located in Austria and the fish in Switzerland. Through robots, the two species transmitted signals back and forth to each other and gradually began coordinating their decisions. The study was published today in \nScience Robotics.\n“We created an unprecedented bridge between the two animal communities, enabling them to exchange some of their dynamics,” says Frank Bonnet, a researcher at EPFL’s Mobile Robots Group (MOBOTS), which is now part of the school’s Biorobotics Laboratory (BioRob). Researchers at MOBOTS have designed robots that can blend into groups of animals and influence their behavior. They have tested their robots on communities of cockroaches, chicks and, more recently, fish – one of these  was able to infiltrate a school of fish in a circular aquarium and get them to swim in a given direction.\nFor this study, engineers took the fish experiment and went one step further, connecting the robot and school of fish with a colony of bees in a laboratory at the Karl-Franzens-University of Graz, Austria. There the bees live on a platform with robot terminals on each side which they naturally tend to swarm around.\nActing as a go-between \nThe robots within each group of animals emitted signals specific to that species. The robot in the school of fish emitted both visual signals – in terms of different shapes, colors and stripes – and behavioral signals – like accelerations, vibrations and tail movements. The robots in the bee colony emitted signals mainly in the form of vibrations, temperature variations and air movements. Both groups of animals responded to the signals; the fish started swimming in a given direction and the bees started swarming around just one of the terminals. The robots in the two groups recorded the dynamics of each group, exchanged that information with each other, and then translated the information received into signals appropriate for the corresponding species.\n“The robots acted as if they were negotiators and interpreters in an international conference. Through the various information exchanges, the two groups of animals gradually came to a shared decision,” says Francesco Mondada, a professor at BioRob.\nDuring the experiment, the two animal species “talked” to each other even though they were some 700 kilometers apart. The conversation was chaotic in the beginning, but eventually led to a certain amount of coordination. After 25 minutes, the animal groups were synchronized – all the fish swam in a counterclockwise direction and all the bees had swarmed around one of the terminals.\nSwapping certain characteristics \n“The species even started adopting some of each other’s characteristics. The bees became a little more restless and less likely to swarm together than usual, and the fish started to group together more than they usually would,” says Bonnet.\nThe study’s findings could help robotics engineers develop an effective way for machines to capture and translate biological signals. And for biologists, the study could enable them to better understand animal behavior and how individuals within an ecosystem interact. Further out, the research could be used to develop methods for monitoring natural habitats by using animals’ exceptional sensory capabilities. For instance, scientists could encourage birds to avoid airports and the related dangers or direct pollinators toward organic crops and away from crops with pesticides.\n*University of Lisbon, Portugal; Karl-Franzens-University Graz, Austria; University of Paris Diderot, France; and University of Zagreb, Croatia", "summary": "Through an imaginative experiment, researchers were able to get two extremely different animal species located far apart to interact with each other and reach a shared decision with the help of robots.", "claim": "Through an imaginative experiment, researchers were able to get one extremely different animal species located far apart to interact with each other and reach a shared decision with the help of robots.", "label": "INCORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": "NumberSwap", "augmentation_span": [10, 10], "noise": false}
{"id": 670, "text": "Will it be possible one day to reconfigure electronic microchips however we want, even when they are in use? A recent discovery by a team at EPFL suggests as much. The researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to create conductive pathways several atoms wide in a material, to move them around at will and even to make them disappear. Their research is the subject of a recent article appearing in Nature Nanotechnology.\nAdaptable electronics is generating significant interest in the scientific community because of the many applications. Imagine for a moment that one single microchip was capable of accomplishing the tasks of several different circuits. For example, a circuit assigned to process sound information could, when not being used for this purpose, be reassigned to process images. This would allow us to miniaturise our electronic devices.\nAt the same time, it would become possible to develop resilient circuits. Whenever a microchip is damaged, it could theoretically reconfigure itself so that it could still function using the components that remain intact. \"An effective way to keep faulty devices working when they are in hard-to-reach places, like space,\" says Leo McGilly, the article's lead author.\nUnderlying this promising technology are so-called 'ferroelectric' materials in which it is possible to create flexible conductive pathways. These pathways are generated by applying an electric field to the material. More specifically, when the electric current is applied, certain atoms moves either \"up\" or \"down,\" which is known as polarisation. In recent years, the academic world has observed that conductive pathways several atoms wide - called 'walls' - form between these polarized zones. The only problem is that, until now, it was impossible to control how these pathways form.\nAt this point, the researchers have tested their research on isolated materials. The next step consists in developing a prototype of a reconfigurable circuit. Leo McGilly would go even further. \"The fact that we can generate pathways wherever we want could allow us to imitate in the future phenomena that take place inside the brain, with the regular creation of new synapses.

{"id": 671, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.

We caught up with him for a short interview. \nIn a globalized market where competition is extremely fierce, is Swiss manufacturing still profitable in the area of microengineering?\n When it comes to mass-producing basic parts, such as engine parts for example, we can't compete with countries like China and India due to our higher labor costs. However, we do have an advantage when in comes to high-value-added products, or in other words sophisticated and innovative products. This is the case for medical and electronic devices, as well as everything related to watch-making. Generally speaking, Swiss know-how and training guarantee a certain quality that is very much appreciated by clients and partners. They also guarantee profitable production.\nYet several companies have recently left Switzerland, causing a wave of redundancies. Is there a crisis in Swiss manufacturing?\n No, this is not the case for high-value-added products. Some Swiss companies have moved production offshore to Asia or Eastern Europe only to change their minds and come back to Switzerland due to problems of quality. Having to regularly send engineers abroad to resolve such problems is just too expensive in the end. It's also easier if the production site and the R&D site are not too far apart.\nBut some multinationals are quick to relocate...\n Multinationals are different because the decision-makers are not necessarily in Switzerland anyway.

Under the supervision of professors Matthias Grossglauser and Patrick Thiran, Vincent Etter and Julien Herzen, PhD students in the Computer Communications and Applications Laboratory, explored these data to reveal a number of interesting facts. They are currently continuing their research by creating a platform, Predikon.ch, that will be able to predict the results of a federal vote based on initial results coming in from municipalities and past data.\nYes, the “Röstigraben” exists! “And it was a bit of a surprise,” admits Etter. They performed a dimensionality reduction on the municipal results for all votes since 1981. This is a standard tool used by statisticians who specialize in data analysis to produce a graphical representation of data. Two groups emerged: one French-speaking and one of German-speaking. (You can see it at ). “The municipalities closest to the intersection of the groups on the graph are also those that are geographically closest to the linguistic border,” notes Herzen.\nWhile the linguistic divide is easy to see on this representation, it’s a bit more difficult to make sense of the graph’s axes, obtained by the dimensionality reduction. “It’s not the traditional left-right and conservative-liberal divisions,” explains Etter. Over time, the Italian-speaking regions seem to move away from the French-speaking districts to join their German-speaking compatriots.

This low-power device plugs directly into a computer or mobile phone to add another dimension to the applications they run. The force feedback lets users feel the texture, stiffness and shape of virtual objects. This little robot joystick, which clearly punches above its weight, has already been presented at a number of specialized trade shows. From 23 to 27 April, visitors at the Hannover Messe – the leading industrial technology trade show in the world – will be able to give it a try.\nHaptic-feedback systems, which are used mainly for gaming, hit the market a few years ago but had until recently disappointed users. They were just not very realistic in the way they simulated a collision by vibrating or imitated acceleration by increasing the feeling of resistance. “Systems offering more refined tactile force feedback have come out recently,” says Marco Salerno, the cofounder of Foldaway Haptics. “But they are bulky, hard to carry around and very expensive.” His company’s foldable joystick offers a very similar experience to that of the newer systems but is easy to stow in a laptop bag or even in your pocket.\nWith the help of a small magnet, this ultralight device opens up into a joystick with an upward flick of the wrist. It goes from flat – less than two millimeters thick – to three dimensions in a fraction of a second. It is stable and solid thanks to its origami-like folding mechanism and the composite materials used to make it. When closed, it is so flat that you may wonder where the sensors and motors are. It took several years of research in the Reconfigurable Robotics Laboratory for the researchers to overcome a number of technical challenges.\nThe little robot’s leading feature is the way it is manufactured, through a combination of thin layers of various materials already cut into the shape required for the folding mechanism to work. Because assembly is automated, it will be easy to mass-produce. “The fact that no manual action is required keeps manufacturing costs relatively low,” says Stefano Mintchev, the other cofounder of the startup, which received funding from NCCR Robotics to develop its technology. NCCR Robotics will also set up a .\nFoldaway Touch, a haptic button for virtual reality joysticks\nThe layer-by-layer manufacturing process means that the system can be configured in different sizes and shapes. The company used the same model to develop a retractable device that can be placed on VR joysticks.

{"id": 677, "text": "Making a foray into the business world is an essential rite of passage for all EPFL engineering students. They must spend 2–6 months working for a company, after which they can also opt for an in-company master’s project to cap off their studies (\nsee text box\n). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.\nA wellspring of innovation\nBut EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.\nThe reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”\nJosep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.\nSupport for small businesses\nThe students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&D.\n“The best possible transition”\nAs delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.\nEve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said. And it was clearly a positive experience on both sides, because the firm hired her as soon as she graduated. Indeed, many students go on to be hired by the companies they work for. “We hire about 20% of our interns,” said Solà i Carós. “The advantage is that they already know our company. Internships bring us a lot of benefits in the short and long term.”\nInternships also give businesses an opportunity to form ties with EPFL laboratories. That could open the door to broader joint research projects financed by Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which aims to encourage technology transfer to industry.\nEPFL internships and master’s projects\nInternships are in general paid and give engineering students an opportunity to spend several months working for a company. They take place away from an academic setting, and the subject must be approved by the school.\nMaster’s projects are students’ final research projects and are closely overseen by an EPFL professor. They are graded (unlike internships), and typically take place in a laboratory. However, EPFL is also looking into ways to have the projects carried out at company sites, which would more effectively combine the research with business aspects.", "summary": "As part of their degree programs, EPFL students spend several months far from the academic world, working on internships or master’s projects.

{"id": 678, "text": "They are a group of 30-odd architecture students from EPFL, ETH Zurich, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW, Basel) and Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany), and they are preparing to don hardhats and work boots. Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.\nThis Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”\nThe structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.\nBetween tradition and modernity\nYannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction. So while the base of the pavilion can be constructed with conventional rammed earth – erected and dried on the building’s foundations – the upper floor of the pavilion will be composed by earthen blocks that will be used as prefabricated components. This approach will help cut down the building time. The earth needed for the columns of the mock-up will be taken from local construction sites and tested by experts.\nThe two students continue to marvel at the wonders of rammed earth: “We think that the sensible thing to do is to use materials available to us, and that includes earth – which is 100% recyclable,” says Claessens. “In our project, the earth walls – and not the concrete – are load-bearing. We are turning normal building codes on their head.” Pretolani is equally enthusiastic: “We felt we had a free hand in terms of project design because there is so much potential in rammed earth, which is not a contemporary material in terms of its aesthetics and does not have well-developed building standards.”\nPilot project\nThe mock-up could also serve as a pilot project for a new technique – prestressed rammed earth – in which steel cables, linked together to meet seismic standards, will run through the building’s earthen columns from top to bottom. For that reason, the engineers backstopping the students will monitor the project once it’s completed, making up for the lack of building standards.\nMany architects steer clear of earth as a building material, since they feel it slows the speed of construction and leads to higher costs. The St. Gallen pavilion could upend such conventional thinking, according to Boltshauser, since it will only take a month to build: “By combining prefabricated earth blocks with other prefabricated concrete components, the pavilion is a glimpse at what could be the future of rammed-earth construction. It will also allow us to calculate the associated savings in terms of costs and gray energy.”\nTextiles and rammed earth go way back \nThe Sittertal valley was a manufacturing region, specializing in dyeing textiles, until the 19th century. The buildings, located between the Sitter river and a canal, have been maintained and renovated and are now dedicated to the visual arts and artisanal crafts. They play host to artist residences, a library, material archives and exhibitions. “Expertise in earth building spread from France to Switzerland through the linen trade, starting in the 17th century. Using the rammed-earth technique for a building on a site that was once devoted to textiles is our way of acknowledging that history,” adds Boltshauser.\nOne week after the construction work begins, an exhibition describing the history of this building technique, called “Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” will open. This exhibition was first shown at EPFL’s Archizoom space in the spring of 2017. In St. Gallen, it will be set up in the Sitterwerk library, just opposite the students’ pavilion project.\n“Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” Sittertal, from 21 August to 15 October 2017.

{"id": 680, "text": "In 2017, startups around the world raised some 4.6 billion dollars by issuing virtual tokens that can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies or services. And much of this activity is taking place in Switzerland, where ICOs brought in 850 million dollars last year according to figures published by IFZ (Institut für Finanzdienstleistungen). But so far, few manufacturers have gotten in on the act.\nLakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that develops customized, highly pure diamonds, is an exception. It is set to launch its own ICO, selling machine-hours in the form of virtual tokens. Over two million tokens – worth a total of 60 million francs – will be issued. The company plans to use this money to significantly ramp up its production capacity. Once the ICO has been completed, buyers will be able to sell their tokens or exchange them for diamonds, thereby creating the first-ever crowd-funded diamond “mine.”\nThe smaller the more expensive\n“With natural diamonds, prices go up as the stones get bigger. But with us it’s the opposite,” says Pascal Gallo, the startup’s founder and CEO. The diamonds produced by LakeDiamond are much purer than natural diamonds. The company’s manufacturing process, in which layers of carbon atoms – the sole ingredient of diamonds – are built up through vapor deposition, eliminates nearly all impurities. These industrial diamonds allow for much greater precision thanks to their hardness, thermal and electrical conductivity, and optical properties.\nThe carefully calibrated size of the diamonds – down to the micron – and the high tech processing they undergo are what set these diamonds apart. The method used to customize the diamonds was developed in conjunction with Niels Quack’s lab at EPFL. The carefully sized diamonds can be set in complex mechanical systems such as watch movements and used in high powered lasers, transistors and photonic platforms.\nThe vast majority of companies that have launched ICOs also use blockchain technology. Their main motivation is simplicity: the companies can deal directly with their investors, and this reduces paperwork and saves time. For LakeDiamond, there’s also the question of independence. “We tried traditional fundraising methods, but most potential investors were in the military sector,” says Gallo. “And we don’t want to take the company in that direction.”\nA smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain\nThe “user,” in the company’s parlance, buys a certain number of tokens secured by an Ethereum smart contract. Ethereum is one of several types of blockchain, which are used to record and share information without any external oversight. Blockchains are so safe because all transactions are verifiable and transparent. A white paper describes the project in detail and includes the transaction clauses and the code used to create the tokens (“ether”) that are issued against the cryptocurrency.\n“Our project is unique: we connect diamond growth reactors to the Ethereum blockchain, which lets token holders produce their own diamonds,” says Romain Braud, the company’s blockchain specialist. LakeDiamond’s tokens are referred to as Time-based Machine Tokens (TMT) because they represent hours of use of the reactors. They also give holders a preferential right to “mine” the diamonds ordered by the company’s industrial clients. This means that token holders can support a client project by trading in their tokens for that project – and ultimately benefiting from the value of the client’s order. Tokens can also be sold on secondary markets, just like traditional cryptocurrencies.\nThe first phase of LakeDiamond’s ICO is meant for professional investors (“token users”). The ICO will be opened to the public this fall once the company has obtained authorization from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).", "summary": "LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that produces and customizes ultra-pure diamonds for industrial use, is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) today.

{"id": 681, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process.

{"id": 682, "text": "They are a group of 30-odd architecture students from EPFL, ETH Zurich, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW, Basel) and Bauhaus University (Weimar, Germany), and they are preparing to don hardhats and work boots. Their mission? To construct a rammed-earth “mock-up” at Sittertal, a prototype of a big scale pavilion which will be realized in Summer 2018.\nThis Summer School project came into focus after two semesters of courses taught at EPFL by Zurich-based architect and visiting professor Roger Boltshauser: “I asked my Master’s students to come up with urban densification projects that use rammed earth and would be suitable for the post-industrial site in St. Gallen,” says Boltshauser. “We believe there is significant potential for both hybrid building techniques, which combine earth and other materials, and highly energy-efficient designs. So that's what we worked on last semester, in conjunction with the building industry and qualified experts.”\nThe structure will consist mainly of rammed-earth pillars, an age-old building technique that uses earth that has been compacted in formworks. The building planed in 2018 – 23 meters long, 6 meters tall and 6 meters wide – will look like an open exhibition pavilion, but it will have other possible uses as well. The Sitterwerk Foundation, which runs the site, may want to use the building as a warehouse at some point, and for this reason insisted that it accommodate forklifts. Other requirements included the use of both recycled materials – including wood – and corrugated metal roofing. Prefabricated concrete components will also have their place the building.\nBetween tradition and modernity\nYannick Claessens and Mattia Pretolani, architecture students in the first year of their Master’s program, came up with the idea. Their project was selected on the strength of a daring approach that uses two types of rammed-earth construction. So while the base of the pavilion can be constructed with conventional rammed earth – erected and dried on the building’s foundations – the upper floor of the pavilion will be composed by earthen blocks that will be used as prefabricated components. This approach will help cut down the building time. The earth needed for the columns of the mock-up will be taken from local construction sites and tested by experts.\nThe two students continue to marvel at the wonders of rammed earth: “We think that the sensible thing to do is to use materials available to us, and that includes earth – which is 100% recyclable,” says Claessens. “In our project, the earth walls – and not the concrete – are load-bearing. We are turning normal building codes on their head.” Pretolani is equally enthusiastic: “We felt we had a free hand in terms of project design because there is so much potential in rammed earth, which is not a contemporary material in terms of its aesthetics and does not have well-developed building standards.”\nPilot project\nThe mock-up could also serve as a pilot project for a new technique – prestressed rammed earth – in which steel cables, linked together to meet seismic standards, will run through the building’s earthen columns from top to bottom. For that reason, the engineers backstopping the students will monitor the project once it’s completed, making up for the lack of building standards.\nMany architects steer clear of earth as a building material, since they feel it slows the speed of construction and leads to higher costs. The St. Gallen pavilion could upend such conventional thinking, according to Boltshauser, since it will only take a month to build: “By combining prefabricated earth blocks with other prefabricated concrete components, the pavilion is a glimpse at what could be the future of rammed-earth construction. It will also allow us to calculate the associated savings in terms of costs and gray energy.”\nTextiles and rammed earth go way back \nThe Sittertal valley was a manufacturing region, specializing in dyeing textiles, until the 19th century. The buildings, located between the Sitter river and a canal, have been maintained and renovated and are now dedicated to the visual arts and artisanal crafts. They play host to artist residences, a library, material archives and exhibitions. “Expertise in earth building spread from France to Switzerland through the linen trade, starting in the 17th century. Using the rammed-earth technique for a building on a site that was once devoted to textiles is our way of acknowledging that history,” adds Boltshauser.\nOne week after the construction work begins, an exhibition describing the history of this building technique, called “Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” will open. This exhibition was first shown at EPFL’s Archizoom space in the spring of 2017. In St. Gallen, it will be set up in the Sitterwerk library, just opposite the students’ pavilion project.\n“Pisé - from Lyon to St. Gallen,” Sittertal, from 21 August to 15 October 2017.

Some of the best ideas that come out of the hackathon will be developed further either by EPFL students as part of their semester projects, or outside of EPFL.\nThe event will last 72 hours. Mentors will help project teams plan out and organize their work – then participants will work day and night to develop open-source prototypes of their applications. The hackathon will end on Monday so that the mentors and judges have enough time to provide useful feedback. “We hope that our event will lead to some tangible, actionable ideas that can be implemented quickly, like the ventilators that an Italian doctor created out of scuba masks to help treat COVID-19 patients,” says Blagovesta Kostova, the president of LauzHack. A panel of judges will select the best projects.

{"id": 685, "text": "The “Métropole Lémanique” is experiencing a unique surge in the field of neuroscience. This area has large international teams of researchers, dedicated to the economic and industrial development of the region. How best to take advantage of this unique opportunity and offer researchers a place to work, while increasing the visibility of this promising scientific momentum? It is in response to these global issues that NEUROPOLIS was conceived. The project meets a major challenge of the 21st century: understanding the human brain while creating a unique space in which researchers can interact with the public.\nOne Project, Two Sites\n To achieve this, the NEUROPOLIS project will construct two entities:\n —A research infrastructure in Lausanne constructed on the grounds of the institutions of higher learning, UNIL-EPFL. This spot will also have a public space dedicated to the brain;\n —A Geneva-located infrastructure near the University Hospital will house a new Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging. \n The construction of these two sites is estimated to cost 110 million Swiss Francs. They would be able to accommodate as many as 1,000 scientific and technological collaborators.\nPublic-Private Partnership (Canton of Vaud :: Swiss Confederation :: Rolex)\n The realization of this ambition wouldn’t have seen the light of day without the outstanding contribution of several actors from both the public and private sectors. The Canton of Vaud provided an essential piece in the foundation of this project through a financial contribution of 35 million Swiss Francs for the construction of the building in Lausanne – and if necessary, offering a site on the university campus. Neuropolis will be launched thanks to the renewed support of the Rolex Group. The brand seeks to encourage research and a pioneering spirit in a leading sector that concerns all of humanity. “A strong historical connection exists between Rolex and EPFL, with the Rolex Learning Center as one of the most iconic examples of that relationship. With NEUROPOLIS, Rolex reiterates its strong sense of social responsibility on the local and global levels, and is pleased to assist in a world-class project that represents a fundamental advance in the field of neuroscience. The participation of Rolex in such a visionary project, such a decisive human and scientific adventure, echoes the brand’s perpetual quest for innovation and excellence,” said Bertrand Gros, President of Rolex, SA.\n The Swiss Confederation and EPFL, through both their usual building program and a private funding campaign, will be responsible for the remainder of the investment.\nLausanne – The Nerve Center of the Blue Brain (EPFL) and the Human Brain Project (EU)\n NEUROPOLIS hosts the simulation platform of the Blue Brain Project and will manage the supercomputer’s resources remotely. The platform will host the huge databases necessary for neuroscience and other fields, as well as the simulation cockpit coordinated by teams of computer scientists and neuroscientists. Scientists worldwide will be able to use the computing power and software developed there; laboratories and workspaces for top international visitors will be installed. If selected by the European Union, the center will also host the “flagship” Human Brain Project (EU), a project that now has about 120 teams in 90 scientific institutions from 22 countries, including those in the partner hospital CHUV in Lausanne. The application has been submitted for a decision expected in early 2013.\nLausanne – A Bridge Between Science and the Public\n NEUROPOLIS is also for the general public. For the first time in Europe, an open and interactive space will be dedicated to neuroscience and the conquest of the brain. The Center for Scientific Simulation will provide the entertainment and the multiple mechanisms of thought will be illuminated there for everyone to enjoy and discover.\nLausanne – A New Research Platform with UNIL\n UNIL has begun refocusing its campus toward skills of basic neuroscience and is already home to the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). NEUROPOLIS will help accelerate the development strategy of simulation-based science, such as evolutionary biology and oncology, and continue the trajectory of Computational Science (involving significant resources for integrating large amounts of data) in other fields which require the prediction and analysis of interactions between many sub-systems: environmental and earth sciences (continental drift or natural disasters), economics, as well as finance and the human and social sciences.\nGeneva – A New Institute of Molecular Imaging (UNIGE)\n Taking advantage of the expertise developed in the Geneva area and of existing infrastructure in the field of Neuroscience, The University of Geneva and the Canton Hospital, in collaboration with EPFL, will construct an Institute of Translational Molecular Imaging in Geneva. These activities, involving several parallel imaging techniques and built-in analysis, will focus on neuro-imaging, chronic diseases, neurological degeneration, and aging. The new institute is part of Geneva’s development plan of Translational Molecular Imaging, which will be articulated around four axes: animal imaging, nanotechnology, radiation chemistry, and modeling. Research conducted in conjunction with existing clinical programs will consider medical applications in the treatment of cancer as well as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. These projects will extend the cognitive and behavioral research aspects of Geneva’s “Nouvelle Jonction. Art, Neurosciences, Cité” project.\nComing Deadlines\n This project will establish an institute of international stature. Like CERN in the field of physics, NEUROPOLIS unites neuroscientists and biologists from around the world. This fall an international architecture competition will be launched.

{"id": 686, "text": "EPFL’s Doctoral School turns 15 this year, marking a decade and a half of courses and research programs designed specifically for PhD students. The school – modelled after PhD programs in the US – offers young engineers a comprehensive range of educational and support services. We spoke with Pierre Vandergheynst, Vice President for Education, and Andreas Mortensen, Vice President for Research and the professor who spearheaded the school’s creation, about how they set up the only doctoral school of its kind in Switzerland.\nWhy did you decide to create a doctoral school?\nAndreas Mortensen (A.M.):\n The school was a long time in the coming. Patrick Aebischer initially put forward the idea soon after he became EPFL president. Before, each EPFL lab recruited its own PhD students – sometimes just by posting an ad on the wall! And there were huge disparities in the qualifications required by each lab. So we wanted to improve the recruitment process, but also provide better support to PhD students. We especially wanted to give them an opportunity to develop skills in ways beyond just their thesis projects, as is done at US graduate schools. For the first few years that the Doctoral School was open, professors could choose whether or not to follow the new system; I’m proud to say that most of them did. Our system is the result of a decision and a collective effort, and it has stood the test of time.\nHow do you select which students to admit?\nA.M.:\n Each of our 21 PhD programs is managed separately. Students wishing to enroll in a program must submit an application that is similar to those required at US universities, complete with three letters of recommendation, their grades and their research objectives. An admissions committee reviews all the applications and decides which ones to accept. The selected students must find a thesis supervisor, obtain the necessary credits and pass an entrance exam – this process takes about a year – and then they are officially enrolled. We currently have over 2,000 PhD students, and our students typically obtain their degrees in four years.\nPierre Vandergheynst (P.V.): \nBecause our focus has been on creating a collegial atmosphere, the Doctoral School benefits everyone involved. Our professors no longer have to rely solely on their reputations to attract top PhD students, and in turn our students can count on valuable support from the school.\nWhat are the advantages of having a separate doctoral school?\nA.M.: \nWe are better equipped to recruit and instruct our students, and can continually enhance our PhD programs within a solid framework. The Doctoral School gives PhD students a community extending beyond their research lab and offers a host of activities they can take part in. What’s more, we can better detect conflict situations and spot students who are struggling – students have more people they can talk to since each one is teamed up with a mentor who is not his or her thesis supervisor.\nP.V.: \nWe’ve seen that we can attract higher quality students and share best practices more easily, whether in terms of recruitment, course planning, mentorship or guidance. Our PhD students get all-around support and form part of a vibrant community.\nHow would you define a good PhD student?\nP.V.: \nPhD research is not a 9-to-5 job. You have to be passionate about what you’re doing and willing to put in long hours. You have to enjoy coming up with solutions to open-ended problems and be very creative – while being willing and able to adapt to the world of academia.\nA.M.: \nGood PhD students are those who are highly motivated, committed to their fields and eager to push the boundaries of existing knowledge. They should be creative and have bold ideas, and they should be ready to learn how to lead a large-scale research project so that one day they can set out on their own.\nDo your graduates generally pursue careers in research? \nP.V.: \nNo, most of them leave teaching and research and go into industry. But studies have shown that salaries rise more rapidly for people with a PhD degree.\nA.M.: \nIn Switzerland – unlike in other countries – PhD degrees are recognized for their intrinsic value and not seen as a way for people to prolong their studies.\nWhat do you remember from your own thesis projects?\nP.V.: \nI did my thesis in mathematical physics at the University of Louvain. That was my first real experience conducting research and it felt like groping around in the dark for a light switch. It’s exciting to work on a problem nobody has solved, even if you hit some dead ends along the way and occasionally get things seriously wrong. For instance, I spent a year developing a theory, but then realized – after a few long days and sleepless nights – that my initial hypothesis was wrong. At that point I was glad beer is cheap in Belgium.\nA.M.:\n My thesis was in materials science, at MIT, and at one point I almost threw in the towel. I had destroyed a machine and changed my thesis topic twice. But I hung in there because I really liked my thesis supervisor – even though I didn’t see myself becoming a researcher or a teacher. It wasn’t until my final year that I decided to pursue an academic career. Never say never!", "summary": "Anyone who wishes to do a PhD at EPFL must enroll in the Doctoral School.

{"id": 687, "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an extremely common herpes-family virus that infects people for life. It infects 60% of the population in industrialized countries, and almost everybody in poorer regions. Its symptoms are easily fought off by a healthy immune system, but can be devastating to individuals with defective immunity, e.g. newborn babies, people with AIDS, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs after receiving organ transplants. After infection, HCMV hides (\"lies dormant\") in blood-making stem cells, occasionally reactivating as these cells mature. Scientists at EPFL have now discovered the molecular switch that allows HCMV to either lie dormant in these cells or reactivate and start infecting again. The switch can be manipulated with simple drugs to force HCMV reactivation, making the virus easy to target and kill. Published in \neLife\n, the study shows how HCMV could be fought in high-risk patients and purged from organs before transplantation.\nThrowing the switch\nThe lab of Didier Trono at EPFL discovered a protein that switches HCMV between dormancy and reactivation. They found this protein to be bound to the HCMV genome in latently infected hematopoietic stem cells and, upon a variety of external stimuli, to undergo a modification that allows for viral activation. The researchers were able to control this switch with a drug called chloroquine, usually used against malaria. When they treated blood-making stem cells that contained dormant HCMV with chloroquine, the virus reactivated and became exposed, opening the door to maneuvers aimed at eliminating virus-infected cells.\nThe simplicity of the study’s design underlies its enormous significance. On one hand, it sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which HCMV becomes dormant in hematopoietic stem cells, possibly offering insights into similar infections by other herpes viruses. On the other hand, the study provides a straightforward method for forcing HCMV out of dormancy in infected tissue. Coupled with a simultaneous dose of an antiviral, this could become a standard regimen for eradicating HCMV from high-risk patients and purging it from tissue before transplantation.\nTrono’s team is now testing the method’s efficiency in purging HCMV from cells to be used for bone marrow transplantation. Following that step, the group will be developing the first trials in humans.\nReference\nRauwel B, Jang SM, Cassano M, Kapopoulou A, Barde I, Trono D. \nRelease of Human Cytomegalovirus from latency by KAP1/TRIM28 phosphorylation switch.\neLife\n DOI: 10.7554/eLife.06068", "summary": "EPFL scientists have discovered the switch that can awake a dormant cytomegalovirus, a dreadful pathogen in immuno-compromised patients.

Just as she does with sports, she has given her all to reach that goal. “People don’t always understand, but it takes a great deal of work to get to this point. It requires a considerable amount of sacrifice.

I hope that the next generation of researchers will not see this as barrier.”\nMaartje Bastings in full effort. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nIn her lab and in the mountains, Bastings lives by one and the same motto: no pain, no gain. “If you want to achieve something, whether in sports or science, you have to put in the effort, knowing that there will be some less enjoyable moments. Two straight days of sampling is no fun. Neither is climbing a slope for several kilometers. But if you keep your mind on your goal – the one that drives you forward – you can overcome any hurdle.”\nNothing like cooling your feet in the water. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nAn insatiable curiosity\nTo summon the energy needed to tackle her research and train for her sport – she considers herself an amateur-professional trail runner – Bastings is highly organized and makes to-do lists. “I try to remain focused and efficient. I map out my day so that I don’t waste any time.” The most important thing is maintaining a balance between her work and the mountains. “Do I get tired? No, because everything I do interests me.

{"id": 692, "text": "Vincent Kaufmann, a sociologist who specializes in mobility studies, decided to expand his usual focus on urban areas to include Switzerland and the European Union (EU). Kaufmann, who is also the head of EPFL’s Urban Sociology Laboratory, teamed up with Spanish researcher Ander Audikana to write an essay on mobility and the free movement of people in the EU and in Switzerland. The authors’ starting point was the “Stop mass immigration\" initiative, which was approved by voters on 9 February 2014.\nTheir essay provides a Swiss perspective that people concerned about a borderless EU and its unintended consequences might do well to consider. Clive H. Church, researcher at the University of Kent,\nalso draws an interesting parallel between Switzerland and post-Brexit UK in the book’s preface. Vincent Kaufmann tells us why this essay is important.\nWhat gave rise to this essay?\nSwitzerland has been dealing with mobility-related issues for decades: the introduction of the Erasmus program, truck traffic crossing the Alps, limiting trucks to 40 tons, the AlpTransit initiative, the free movement of people, the modal shift from road to rail, and so on. All these issues have one thing in common: mobility. And yet, they are never analyzed together. On 9 February 2014, the Swiss people voted on two separate questions that, in reality, were both rooted in mobility. On that day, the people approved the “Stop mass immigration” initiative, which called for immigration quotas. They also gave the go-ahead for a fund to upgrade the country’s rail infrastructure. In a way, Swiss people paradoxically voted for “less mobility” and “more mobility” at the same time. Since then, there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric but very little sociological analysis of what really happened in that vote. Seeing this, Ander Audikana and I wanted to show how important it is to look at all these mobility issues together, in Switzerland but also in the EU, in order to get a better idea of what the consequences will be.\nWhat are your main conclusions?\nIn the first part of our essay, we look at the EU’s founding documents. It’s clear that the free movement of people – much more than economic interests – was at the core of the European project. These documents show that mobility was considered the only way of unifying the member states and erasing the differences in their political and welfare systems. The Erasmus program, for example, clearly states this goal in its founding texts. But there are two sides to mobility: movement and “moorings”. Moorings refer to the connections a person makes once they have moved to a new place: building meaningful social relationships, absorbing the culture, learning the language, making use of public spaces, coming to identify with the place and building an emotional bond with it etc. Unfortunately, EU policies largely overlook this, and instead demand that people move from place to place while failing to assess the consequences of widespread geographical mobility on regional development, the ability of diverse groups of people to live alongside each other, and wage dumping. These problems are left to the individual member countries, and we think this is a major shortcoming.\nHow does this shortcoming affect Switzerland?\nIn theory, an EU company could win a contract to plant trees in a small Swiss town, and no local landscaping companies would be able to compete on price. This is a good example of mobility without moorings: the cross-border deal is encouraged without first looking at whether this scenario is fair. While people consider these types of situations totally unfair, the EU has created a legal apparatus that is simply oblivious to this. It’s this type of mechanism that Europeans are now rallying against, as we see in the rise in populism. The mobility demanded by the EU creates as many problems as it solves.\nYou interviewed the leaders of the six main political parties in Switzerland about this issue. Yet they are cited anonymously in your essay. Why did you do this?\nWe wanted to get away from partisan politics and take an anthropological approach. Rereading these interviews, we saw that mobility-related questions did not fit neatly into the left-right paradigm. We see, for example, very liberal views on both sides: the idea that the world will be a better place the more people move around. At the same time, there’s a need for the state to be more assertive and get a better grip on the flow of money, people and goods. We think that where these two positions meet is where we can find compromises and solutions. In Switzerland, local identity is important and is currently seen as being under threat. The people want the government to do something about this.\nIs this what the EU could learn from the Swiss experience when it comes to rethinking mobility and the elimination of borders? \nSwitzerland is seeking a better balance between mobility and moorings. The fact that the EU is so dogmatic about being borderless is a problem for Switzerland, since this country doesn’t work that way. The Swiss don't subscribe to dogmas – they reach compromises through discussion and direct democracy. For EU countries, Switzerland is an interesting laboratory. Debates that do not happen elsewhere take place here. We feel that the way in which the Swiss achieve compromises on questions of mobility and the free movement of people could help the EU overcome some of the hurdles it faces. Our analysis shows, for example, that the EU should not have focused so much on a policy of \nmobility\n in its founding documents but rather on a policy of \naccessibility\n: access to services, to infrastructure and to other countries. The EU’s overriding goal should not be to make sure that people move from here to there at all costs. It should be to guarantee a certain level of fairness when people, goods, and services move across borders. Returning to the example of EU companies competing in Switzerland: in order to gain access to the Swiss market, these companies should apply Swiss prices.\nIn your essay, you foresee a return to medieval, walled-in cities in Europe. Is the situation that dire? \nThe current border situation will require a strong political response by the EU. Failing that, we believe there’s a good chance that walls, watchtowers and barbed wire could indeed pop up all over Europe, transforming the continent into a gated community.\nVincent Kaufmann, Ander Audikana, \nMobilité et Libre circulation en Europe: un regard suisse\n, Fondation Jean Monnet, Economica - Les Cahiers rouges, Paris, 2017.", "summary": "Vincent Kaufmann, an EPFL researcher, has co-authored an essay on Switzerland’s recent referendums on mobility and the free movement of people.

{"id": 693, "text": "One of the biggest obstacles in successfully treating metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, fatty liver etc, is the variation in the way patients respond to medication. The key to this variation lies in the inherent biological differences between individuals, which cannot all be explained genetically. At the same time, this variation makes it very difficult to develop \"standard\" treatments for certain diseases. In a groundbreaking initiative, EPFL and ETHZ scientists have developed a strategy that can define and explain metabolic differences between individuals, essentially paving the way for precision medicine. The work, which also highlights significant issues with animal-based drug studies, is .\nWe are increasingly learning that medical interventions can be more successful when they are tailored to the specific profile of the individual patient. The problem is that defining that profile is extremely difficult, as it involves information on the person's genome, proteins, fats, and all sorts of other layers of biology that make up their tissues and body. And so far, the only differences that we have been seriously taking into account are those found between genes.\nThis is what the labs of  and  set out to solve with their recently published study. Looking at 40 different mice strains, the researchers successfully connected the variation between individuals' genomes to the variation between their proteomes -- their full set of proteins. In this way, they took a giant leap in profiling the biology of a particular individual.\n\"There is a black box between a patient's genome and their disease,\" says Johan Auwerx, whose lab handled the genome side of the study. \"What we have done here is find a way to fill the black box by obtaining information on the patient's proteome.\"\n\"It's much more complex to measure the set of proteins than to sequence the entire genome,\" says Yibo Wu, co-lead author of the study. The scientists used protein data from mice, which they obtained from a new mass spectrometry technique that Aebersold's group developed, known as SWATH-MS. This is a technique that combines the advantages of high-throughput mass spectrometry with high reproducibility and consistency. In short, it is able to identify thousands of different proteins in hundreds of samples much faster and accurately than conventional techniques, allowing the researchers to measure the concentrations of a broad spectrum of liver proteins in the mice.\nThe researchers measured a total of 2,600 different proteins from tissue samples of 40 mice strains, all of which came from the same two ancestors, meaning that they were genetically related to each other. \"We wanted to keep the genetics simple in order to observe differences in the impact of environment (diet) on the proteome, other layers of biology, and their predisposition to develop diseases,\" says Auwerx.\nThe mice were divided into groups of representing each of the 40 strains, and the groups were fed either a high-fat diet - essentially junk food - or a healthy, low-fat diet. Over a few weeks, the scientists charted the mice's physiological data, and tested how fast they could gain weight on the junk-food diet and lose weight by exercising. Despite their similar genetic make-up, the mice on the high-fat diet showed varied responses to diet and exercise. For example, some developed metabolic disorders like fatty liver, while others did not.\nThe researchers then combined the physiological data with data for their genome, their proteome, and their transcriptome, which is essentially their full set of RNAs - another biological \"layer\" in the black box. Through this combination, the scientists were able to better understand the role several proteins play when it comes to metabolizing fat and producing energy from it.\n\"Like the mouse strains in this study, each patient with a disease is genetically different\", says Ruedi Aebersold. \"The approach we used in the mouse cohort can now be applied one-for-one in research on human diseases, and particularly for personalized medicine.\" The SWATH-MS approach is now ready to use in human cohort studies, as the researchers in his group have produces a corresponding database for thousands of human proteins.\n\"The aim here is to be able to customise medical intervention for each patient based on their individual biological makeup, the 'black box',\" says Auwerx. In this vein, his group is now looking at specific drugs that can be used more effectively with this approach to treat metabolic disorders.\nThis work involved a collaboration between EPFL's Interfaculty Institute of Bioengineering with the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology at ETH Zurich, with additional contribution the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the University of Zurich. It was funded by EPFL, ETHZ, the European Research Council, the Swiss Initiative for Systems Biology (AgingX program), the Swiss National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health.\nReference\nWilliams EG, Wu Y, Jha P, Dubuis S, Blattmann P, Argmann CA, Houten SM, Amariuta T, Wolski W, Zamboni N, Aebersold R, Auwerx J. \nSystems proteomics of liver mitochondria function.\nScience\n June 10, 2016; 352:6291.

The objective of this grant program is to ensure that there is a new supply of graduate scientists, to encourage mobility, and to support women’s careers. “The number of grants is limited, while the number of doctoral students with the required level to aspire to these grants has largely increased”, observes Caroline Vandevyver, responsible for the preparation of the application forms. “This is the result of the strict selection of doctoral students performed by the Doctoral School. Only 15% of them applied in 2005, compared to 27% in 2010.” In a market which is becoming more and more competitive, doctoral students are increasingly aware of the value of doing research abroad. While not all of them become professors, many find interesting opportunities in universities, as well as in industry.\n An FNS grant constitutes a first-rate opportunity, since it enables the doctoral student who has completed his/her thesis to continue his/her education in the university and the topic of his/her choice. The grant is awarded for a period of 18 months, and includes an allowance for personal expenses, an amount for travel expenses, and possibly also a contribution towards research and symposium costs. The amount granted depends on marital status, family-related responsibilities, and the cost of living in the country of residence. They are awarded independently of nationality, sex or family situation. Only the applicants’ competencies are taken into account. The researchers are thus able to devote their entire attention to their research work. The only condition for applying is to have obtained a doctoral degree at EPFL. “All those who received one of these grants said that it had been a springboard for their professional career”, adds Caroline Vandevyver.\n EPFL and its teachers strongly encourage these research periods abroad. They constitute an almost inevitable step in a scientific career, are practically essential in becoming a professor, and a major asset in being selected for important positions. The likelihood of becoming a professor is greater for someone who has benefited from a grant. In a recent study, the EPFL Research Commission has observed that 17% of post-doctoral scholarship students began an academic career, but that only 23% of them came back to Switzerland to pursue it. We might therefore wonder: what is the benefit for a university such as EPFL to see its best people leave? This question of brain drain versus brain gain has been assessed in depth both at EPFL and the FNS, and the two institutions have reached the conclusion that the benefits of this type of sponsorship is extremely positive, and contributes to increasing the visibility of Switzerland internationally. FNS scholarship students are ambassadors for EPFL worldwide: they increase the institutions renown, and stimulate other researchers to come to study or work in Switzerland.

{"id": 696, "text": "Why do virtual reality headsets make users nauseous? One reason is latency, or the almost imperceptible amount of time it takes for a display image to change in response to a user’s head movement. However, the  (JPEG) has just introduced a new image compression standard that could resolve this problem. This working group is headed by Touradj Ebrahimi, a professor in EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI).\nWith JPEG XS, images and videos maintain an extremely high level of quality thanks to a compression process that is simpler and faster – and thus more energy efficient. The compressed files end up being larger, but that’s not a problem thanks to broadband networks such as Wi-Fi and 5G: the aim is to stream the files instead of storing them in smartphones or other devices with limited memory.\nThis means that you could use your smartphone, tablet or computer to project a high-definition movie or a video game onto a large-screen display almost instantaneously. No cables would be required, and the image quality would be extremely high.\n\"We want to be smarter\"\n “For the first time in the history of image coding, we are compressing less in order to better preserve quality, and we are making the process faster while using less energy,” says Professor Ebrahimi, who runs EPFL’s . “We want to be smarter in how we do things. The idea is to use less resources, and use them more wisely. This is a real paradigm shift.”\nJPEG compression, which has been widely popular over the past 25 years (see inset), typically reduces image file sizes by a factor of ten. This compression process was developed so that images could be stored in cameras, with their limited memory, and easily shared over communication networks. Yet the process needs to evolve in response to new applications, more efficient broadband networks and technological advances. The JPEG XS standard compresses files by no more than a factor of six and is not meant to replace the popular JPEG format. “Compressing the images with JPEG XS doesn’t compromise quality at all: even experts can’t tell the difference between an original and a compressed picture or movie,” adds Ebrahimi.\nWide array of applications\nJPEG XS could come in handy whenever images and videos need to be sent to a processor as fast as possible. Potential applications include the “eyes” of drones and self-driving cars – technologies where long latency represents a danger for humans.\nThe new format has also attracted the attention of the European Space Agency (ESA). The low-power algorithms used by JPEG XS would be a boon for space probes, which need to take very high-quality photos using only a tiny source of energy. Smartphones and other everyday devices with limited memory will continue to use the legacy JPEG format to store pictures.\nAnother advantage of JPEG XS is that, like all previous JPEG formats, it is open-source. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), based in Hollywood, is already considering adopting JPEG XS as its editing format. “With JPEG XS, professional movie editors can take images created with different devices and import them directly into their editing software,” says Ebrahimi. Currently, every brand of video camera that uses high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging techniques has its own proprietary coding format. That means individual files must be transcoded before they can be edited. JPEG XS will change this situation by providing a universal format.\nTested and approved at EPFL\n In addition to coordinating the development of the JPEG family of standards, Professor Ebrahimi came up with a new evaluation methodology together with his team in order to assess how well JPEG XS performs. These tests proved that the technological side of the new format is sound. The multimedia industry is currently awaiting final approval by the member states of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Once that is obtained, JPEG XS-based products and services can be launched.\n “In the immediate future, JPEG XS will be put to use in professional applications like movie editing, space imagery and professional-grade cameras. Consumer electronics will come next, including self-driving cars, virtual reality, augmented reality, and wireless connections between multimedia devices and TV monitors or projectors,” says Ebrahimi. “To be able to use JPEG XS, consumers will need to own the next generation of devices. In terms of software, they will probably just need to run an update, like they do from time to time on their computers and smartphones anyway.”\n10 to 15 billion.

{"id": 697, "text": "When the World Wide Web was invented at CERN 30 years ago, no one talked about open science. But the internet has become one of the pillars of open science, providing researchers with a way of sharing information with colleagues around the world.\nIn January 2017, soon after taking office, EPFL President Martin Vetterli launched the  in order to raise awareness about this important topic. One key element was the creation of the Open Science Strategic Committee (OSSC), whose members provide EPFL’s Senior Management with input on how to best promote open science. We met with Professor Katrin Beyer, who chairs the OSSC, to discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by open science at EPFL and beyond.\nHow open is science today?\nScience is definitely more open now than it was five or ten years ago, and almost certainly less than it will be five or ten years from now. It is increasingly common to share research outputs beyond the traditional manuscript - such as code and data - and this practice will soon be ubiquitous. One thing we notice when discussing the topic of open science among colleagues is that significant differences exist between disciplines. This does not necessarily mean that some are more open than others – they’re simply open in different ways.\nIn some fields it is standard to share preprints; in others open data has a long tradition. Open data seems to be particularly well-established in places where researchers use a large shared infrastructure, such as CERN. These communities have worked for a long time on establishing data-format and documentation standards. It seems much harder to create such standards when everybody has their own laboratory and, often, their own experimental set-up.\nOpen science initiatives touch on several key aspects of the research process – publications, research evaluation, career promotion, funding allocation and so on. Does that mean the whole process is flawed?\nThe process is certainly flawed when it comes to access to scientific literature. Some big legacy publishers now control the majority of the journals in most fields and have profit margins of 30–40%, effectively channeling public money into the pockets of private investors. Many universities simply cannot afford to pay the subscription fees. And while illegal services such as Sci-Hub bring more equality to researchers around the globe, relying on pirated access to knowledge is not a sustainable strategy. We need to do better.\nThat said, open access as it is implemented today does not necessarily solve the economic or equality issue. If it becomes expensive to publish, everyone will be able to read the literature, but only a few will be able to publish it. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\nIn terms of career promotion and evaluating candidates for funding, in theory, the framework is already in place. Many universities, including EPFL, have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), which states that researchers should be judged not just on how many articles write and the prestige of the journals in which they publish, but on all types of research output, and that quality should come before quantity. However, in practice, hiring committees evaluating large numbers of applications within a short period of time can find it difficult to implement DORA, because assessing the quality of a variety of research outputs is more time consuming than looking at numbers and journal titles. This remains a challenge.\nHow will open science affect the research community?\nOne major objective of open science is to increase the reproducibility and reusability of published work, and I think this will accelerate science in general and increase its impact. Open science also implies a more inclusive research environment. Being part of an established network of researchers is not necessary anymore to get access to data or code – any researcher anywhere in the world can build on these research outputs.\nYoung researchers may benefit the most from open science. They also have a key responsibility: they contribute a significant part of the research and need to make sure it’s produced and documented so that others can easily build on it. Research institutions need to support them in this endeavor and ensure they have all the methodological tools they need.\nWhat is EPFL’s strategy?\nThe OSSC wants to promote a bottom-up approach to open science. Researchers know best where their disciplines are going, how to innovate in the way their community shares information, and what will have a real impact in making their field more open. But it is EPFL’s responsibility to listen to its researchers and develop the services and infrastructure that will make a clear difference in supporting those striving to implement open science in their daily routine.\nIt is important for EPFL to provide training opportunities at the same time. The summer school session called “Open Science in Practice,” which took place in September, gave PhD students a look at projects and tools that other early career researchers have used in their research practice. Teaching by example is the best way to convince people that open science is possible and has a greater impact, and that good practice does not necessarily require a lot of time. The School’s library also offers a range of courses on tools that make it easier to implement open science, along with expert advice on topics such as open access and data management. We recommend expanding this catalogue even further.\nIs EPFL a pioneer in open science?\nI think EPFL is ahead of the curve, since it works hard to explore the most promising avenues and tries to be innovative in its support for open science on campus. Martin Vetterli is very outspoken about it. And to be fair, many EPFL researchers started working openly well before the OSSC was set up. The Swiss Data Science Center, for example, is a driving force in this area and a real asset. Its Renku platform may change how we track the research process, and it could significantly reduce the time required for careful documentation.", "summary": "As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, EPFL is highlighting his commitment for open and reproducible research through an exceptional Open Science Day, today.

{"id": 698, "text": "Hepatoblastoma is a rare pediatric liver cancer, usually diagnosed in the first three years of life. Histological methods are used to distinguish between the different subtypes of hepatoblastoma. EPFL scientists have now found metabolic differences between hepatoblastoma subtypes, and identified several biomarkers that can help obtain more accurate subtyping of the disease. The work is .\nThere are many subtypes of hepatoblastoma, the two major ones being fetal and embryonal. Clinically, pure fetal cases have the best prognosis. The way oncologists distinguish between the different subtypes is by staining biopsies and observing the tumor architecture. However, this is not satisfactory.\n“When we compare tumors on the microscope, we know almost nothing about their differences,” says Etienne Meylan, whose led this study. “It’s a little like comparing cars: only when we look inside at the engine we begin to understand what makes them so fundamentally different to each other. Our study shows that different types of hepatoblastoma use different nutrients, or fuels, to grow. Some use glucose, others might rely on fatty acids. In the era of personalized medicine this is important, as we want to be sure we block the right fuel for the right tumor.”\nMeylan’s lab built on the genetics of hepatoblastoma, which involves frequent mutations in the gene CTNNB1. This gene produces the protein beta-catenin, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription. Because of its dual function, mutations of the CTNNB1 gene can have diverse and far-reaching consequences, including in cancers like hepatoblastoma. Beta-catenin is a component of a signaling pathway called Wnt/beta-catenin, which is responsible for regulating the expression of multiple genes. What is of interest is that many components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are affected and overactive in various tumors.\nSomething that is becoming increasingly significant in oncology is that different types of cancers show characteristic metabolic profiles, e.g. in the way they produce, store, and use glucose, glutamine, fatty acids etc. Based on this, the EPFL researchers looked at the relationship of the CTNNB1 gene and the cell’s metabolism.\nThe researchers first showed that beta-catenin, as part of the Wnt signaling pathway directly regulates the expression of a gene that produces a glucose transporter protein (GLUT3).\nNext, they used RNA sequencing to identify molecular and metabolic features that are specific to hepatoblastoma. This approach revealed that several enzymes involved in the metabolism of glucose are overexpressed in embryonal hepatoblastoma cells as compared to fetal hepatoblastoma cells. \nFinally, the scientists found that embryonal hepatoblastoma cells show high levels of glucose uptake. In addition, they also found that these cells are very sensitive to the perturbation of an enzyme involved in the cell’s use of glucose, which might hint to a metabolically driven therapy in the future.\nWorking off their discoveries, the researchers used immunohistochemistry of three metabolic biomarkers to better distinguish embryonal from fetal components out of a large panel of human hepatoblastoma biopsies, collected from French and Swiss university hospitals.\nThe study shows that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is crucial for reprograming the energy management of tumor cells. It also provides a new, metabolic classification of human hepatoblastoma that can help oncologists develop novel diagnostic methods and even treatments.\n\"This paper is a milestone of upmost importance for our children with hepatoblastoma,” says , Surgical Director of the Swiss Reference Centre for Liver Diseases in Children (Hospital University of Geneva), who was not involved in the study. “As a further step towards personalized medicine, these discovered biomarkers allow for individual characterization of the children' liver tumor, helping us in risk stratification, and eventually allowing for an adjusted, personalized treatment.”\nContributors \nSIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics\nGeneva University Hospitals\nFaculté de Médecine Université Paris Sud\nLudwig Center for Cancer Research and Department of Oncology\nFunding\nSwiss National Science Foundation\nFondation Recherche sur le Cancer de l’Enfant ()\nReference \nStefania Crippa, Pierre-Benoit Ancey, Jessica Vazquez, Paolo Angelino, Anne-Laure Rougemont, Catherine Guettier, Vincent Zoete, Mauro Delorenzi, Olivier Michielin, Etienne Meylan. \nMutant CTNNB1 and histological heterogeneity define metabolic subtypes of hepatoblastoma. \nEMBO Molecular Medicine \n18 September 2017.

One feels dizzy in such a remote spot, nestled among meadows ready for the harvest. This is the setting Maartje Bastings has chosen for our interview. The professor in the Programmable Biomaterials Laboratory is about to embark on a 16-kilometer training run, with 1,400 meters in positive altitude change. But it’s all in a day’s work for this trailblazing scientist: her run will clock in at 2 hours and 40 minutes.\nDeparture from the small hamlet of Commeire above Orsières. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nBastings expertly combines a career as a research scientist with her enthusiasm for mountain running. For her, the two are inseparable: “Running requires physical effort, but in return, it fuels my mental energy. Without it, I’d never be able to work as efficiently as I do. I see training in the mountains as part of my work,” she says. In fact, it is precisely when the 36-year-old researcher is running along the ridges that she finds solutions to scientific problems. Up there, she can step back and take in the big picture. Most of her ideas come to her while running. \n\"At this altitude, nothing is level: it’s either up or down.\" ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nNo pain, no gain\nCompetitive by nature, Bastings knew ever since her first university class that she wanted to become a professor. Just as she does with sports, she has given her all to reach that goal. “People don’t always understand, but it takes a great deal of work to get to this point. It requires a considerable amount of sacrifice. But I have no regrets, since I have a job I love.”\nIt's in the mountains that Maartje Bastings finds the mental energy. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nThe mother of a one-year-old boy, Bastings spends weekends in her campervan roaming the Alps.

I hope that the next generation of researchers will not see this as barrier.”\nMaartje Bastings in full effort. ©Alain Herzog/EPFL 2020\nIn her lab and in the mountains, Bastings lives by one and the same motto: no pain, no gain. “If you want to achieve something, whether in sports or science, you have to put in the effort, knowing that there will be some less enjoyable moments. Two straight days of sampling is no fun. Neither is climbing a slope for several kilometers.

{"id": 701, "text": "Do you speak Scala? Many big companies active on the Web now reply in the affirmative. Twitter, Foursquare , LinkedIn and the internet site of the British newspaper The Guardian (guardian.co.uk) have adopted this programming language, developed at EPFL by Martin Odersky, Professor in the computer science section of the school.\nLast week, its creator announced the launch of a new company, with its offices at the Science Park at Ecublens. It’s called Typesafe, has just raised three million dollars, and will give a serious boost to the Scala language. The main investor in this round of financing – Greylock, based in Boston and in Silicon Valley – is not just any old investor. The company supported Facebook at the time when the social networking site was opening to a mass audience, and had also invested in LinkedIn, from 2004.\nScala is becoming more and more popular with programmers, especially for internet applications. But what’s behind this success? “This language is concise, and enables reductions of on average 50% of the lines of code”, Martin Odersky begins by explaining. What’s more, being very close to Java and completely compatible, it’s very easy to adopt for programmers who are familiar with Java, which has become a true standard on the Internet. Finally, it’s open source, which means that the people who contribute to its development exist in their hundreds, spread across the whole world – although EPFL remains the owner of the copyright.\nLeveraging the multiplication of “cores”\n One of the strengths of Scala is to combine two approaches that are popular in the programming world. One is “object-oriented” – which has always up to now been preferred by industry – and the other “functional programming”, which has been used mainly in academia. The advantage of the latter is that it’s very efficient when it comes to distribute tasks to several processors working in parallel. “Today, progress in IT is exemplified by the multiplication of the number of ‘cores’ in the processors, and no longer in terms of increases in speed”, explains the Professor. “Creating new applications that take advantage of this aspect of the processors is a natural development in programming.” Another advantage is that this approach is perfectly suited to distributed computing, or “cloud computing”, which is becoming more popular with big companies that are active on the Internet. This approach –concentrating on the distribution of tasks to multiple processors – gives Scala its name (from “scaling”).\nWith his new company, Martin Odersky is paving the way for the future of computing. Typesafe provides free-of-charge downloading of a pack of software including Scala, a development tool, and also the Akka platform, created in Sweden, whose inventor Jonas Bonér is also a co-founder of Typesafe. Complementary to Scala, Akka is a middleware designed for the distribution of tasks in large computing centers.\nIn parallel, Typesafe is putting in place a technical support service for its clients. “From around 15 employees today, our team will increase to 25 by the end of the year”, continues Martin Odersky. Most of the employees are developers, working in the EPFL Science Park, Cambridge, Boston – where the company is headquarted – and Uppsala. In just over a couple of weeks, Typesafe will be in the limelight during the second annual « Scala days » event – a meeting of programmers – whose initial occurrence last year at EPFL attracted many specialists.\nTypesafe should thus give a real boost to the Scala language. With a smile on his lips, Martin Odersky expresses his confidence that the “really big players” in this domain will soon be joining in. But as for their names, we’ll just have to be patient . . .", "summary": "Thanks to the raising of three million dollars, Martin Odersky has just created the company Typesafe.

{"id": 702, "text": "In our information society, the synthesis, distribution, and processing of radio and microwave signals are ubiquitous in wireless networks, telecommunications, and radars. The current tendency is to use carriers in higher frequency bands, especially with looming bandwidth bottlenecks due to demands for e.g. 5G and the “Internet of Things”. “Microwave photonics”, a combination of microwave engineering and optoelectronics, might offer a solution.\nA key building block of microwave photonics is optical frequency combs, which provide hundreds of equidistant and mutually coherent laser lines. They are ultrashort optical pulses emitted with a stable repetition rate that corresponds precisely to the frequency spacing of comb lines. The photodetection of the pulses produces a microwave carrier.\nIn recent years there has been significant progress on chip-scale frequency combs generated from nonlinear microresonators driven by continuous-wave lasers. These frequency combs rely on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons, which are ultrashort coherent light pulses circulating inside optical microresonators. Because of this, these frequency combs are commonly called “soliton microcombs”.\nGenerating soliton microcombs needs nonlinear microresonators, and these can be directly built on-chip using CMOS nanofabrication technology. The co-integration with electronic circuitry and integrated lasers paves the path to comb miniaturization, allowing a host of applications in metrology, spectroscopy and communications.\nPublishing in \nNature Photonics\n, an EPFL research team led by Tobias J. Kippenberg has now demonstrated integrated soliton microcombs with repetition rates as low as 10 GHz. This was achieved by significantly lowering the optical losses of integrated photonic waveguides based on silicon nitride, a material already used in CMOS micro-electronic circuits, and which has also been used in the last decade to build photonic integrated circuits that guide laser light on-chip.\nThe scientists were able to manufacture silicon nitride waveguides with the lowest loss in any photonic integrated circuit. Using this technology, the generated coherent soliton pulses have repetition rates in both the microwave K- (~20 GHz, used in 5G) and X-band (~10 GHz, used in radars).\nThe resulting microwave signals feature phase noise properties on par with or even lower than commercial electronic microwave synthesizers. The demonstration of integrated soliton microcombs at microwave repetition rates bridges the fields of integrated photonics, nonlinear optics and microwave photonics.\nThe EPFL team achieved a level of optical losses low enough to allow light to propagate nearly 1 meter in a waveguide that is only 1 micrometer in diameter –100 times smaller than that a human hair. This loss level is still more than three orders of magnitude higher than the value in optical fibers, but represents the lowest loss in any tightly confining waveguide for integrated nonlinear photonics to date.\nSuch low loss is the result of a new manufacturing process developed by EPFL scientists – the “silicon nitride photonic Damascene process”. “This process, when carried out using deep-ultraviolet stepper lithography, gives truly spectacular performance in terms of low loss, which is not attainable using conventional nanofabrication techniques,” says Junqiu Liu, the paper’s first author who also lead the fabrication of silicon nitride nanophotonic chips at EPFL’s Center of MicroNanoTechnology (CMi). “These microcombs, and their microwave signals, could be critical elements for building fully integrated low-noise microwave oscillators for future architectures of radars and information networks.”\nThe EPFL team is already working with collaborators in US to develop hybrid-integrated soliton microcomb modules that combine chip-scale semiconductor lasers. These highly compact microcombs can impact many applications, e.g. transceivers in datacenters, LiDAR, compact optical atomic clocks, optical coherence tomography, microwave photonics, and spectroscopy.", "summary": "Using integrated photonic chips fabricated at EPFL, scientists have demonstrated laser-based microwave generators.

The logo, composed of the School’s four letters, is simple yet sophisticated, and it proudly bears Switzerland’s hallmark red color. “We wanted a logo that reflects our school’s energy, pioneering spirit, technological leadership and international reach. In other words, our identity as a startup that has grown rapidly and is now an adult,” says EPFL President Martin Vetterli.\nThe School worked with Lausanne-based branding agency Moser Design to develop its new brand identity. Two online surveys were carried out to evaluate how EPFL is perceived both within its community and by the general public. Some 20,000 people participated in the survey, pointing to brand attributes such as excellence, international reputation, engineering, innovation, research and Swiss-based.\nThe font selected for the new logo, Helvetica Neue, was created in Switzerland and is well-known around the world. It was born in the 1960s, like EPFL, and it symbolizes Switzerland’s place at the forefront of technology at the time. The agency reworked the original font slightly to make it more contemporary, easier to read and unique, and to better reflect where EPFL is today. “Developing a new brand identity for an institution like EPFL was an exciting challenge. The School profoundly affects the lives of those who study or teach there. As a hub of research and knowledge, EPFL is a source of personal and professional fulfillment.

{"id": 705, "text": "The “classical” role for a gene is to produce proteins, which are essential for the functioning of cells. However, our genomes also encode genes that produce long non-coding RNAs, whose functions are more mysterious. Yet, since four or five years ago we know that thousands of these still poorly understood genes are present in the human and mouse genomes. How and in which organs are they activated? Is this biological “dark matter” much ado about nothing or is there something more interesting to it?\nA team led by Professor Henrik Kaessmann at UNIL’s Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) compiled an authentic catalog of long non-coding RNAs in eleven species. By adopting an evolutionary approach, they discovered that about 2500 long non-coding RNAs first appeared at least 90 million years ago in the common ancestor of most placental mammals. From a functional point of view, these “ancient” genes turned out to be particularly interesting.\nFirst author of the \nNature\n article, Anamaria Necsulea, scientist at the Laboratory of developmental genomics of EPFL, expanded the scope of the investigation on these long non-coding RNAs to six primate species (man, macaque, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and orangutan), and to mouse, opossum (a marsupial mammal), platypus (a monotreme mammal that lays eggs and nurses its young with milk), as well as to an \"external group\" composed by a bird (chicken) and an amphibian (frog). The common ancestor of all these species goes back over 350 million years.\nGenes maintained during evolution\nThe biologists used the CIG genomics platform and the Vital-IT computing center at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to identify long non-coding RNAs in several major organs of the 11 species under scrutiny. \"Thanks to bioinformatics, we discovered RNA sequences produced from genome locations where no genes had been previously mapped,\" she said. \"We then analyzed these genes to find out whether or not they encoded proteins. Thus, we could identify between 3000 and 15000 long non-coding RNA genes, depending on the species.\"\nIn the second phase of the research, a comparison among the different species allowed the scientists to pinpoint the emergence of these genes in the evolutionary history. While 11,000 long non-coding RNAs are shared by all primates, 2,500 go back to an ancestor common to man and mouse, about 90 million years ago. Only a hundred genes of this kind stem from an ancestor common to all eleven species considered, including birds and amphibians. \"One of our main findings is that the activity of these non-coding genes is controlled by the same transcription factors that regulate protein-coding gene activity. Even more strikingly, we found that the 2,500 oldest long noncoding RNA genes are regulated by factors that are important for embryonic development. This suggests that, among the 2500 long non-coding RNAs conserved during the evolution of placental mammals, a large percentage may function specifically in embryonic development.\"\nNew network of interactions\nThe third phase of the research allowed the scientists to highlight a network of interactions (specifically, co-expression interactions, that is: genes are activated in the same organs or cell types) involving both long non-coding RNAs and protein-coding genes. For instance, they found that some non-coding genes are strongly associated to protein coding genes involved in brain function or in spermatogenesis, which suggests similar functions for these long non-coding RNA genes.\n In the case of the H19X gene - one of the most ancient long noncoding RNA genes identified in this study - its association to the placental mammals’ H19 gene (which was the first long non-coding RNA identified years ago) helped to uncover its functioning: \"The H19 prevents the placenta from excessively growing inside the mother's womb,\" said Anamaria Necsulea. \"We can assume that H19X also contributes to this function. We now plan to disable this gene in mice to test its functions in the placenta.\"\nAmong the subcategories of RNA producing genes, are these long RNA genes more useful than it originally seemed? By tracking them in 11 different species, this new study of unprecedented scale suggests that some of our genomes’ \"dark matter\" may play a role in the development and functioning of the most vital organs of our bodies. Future experimental studies will further clarify the role of these genes that have just revealed their first secrets to us.", "summary": "Biologists have studied the functionality of a poorly understood category of genes, which produce long non-coding RNA molecules rather than proteins.

{"id": 706, "text": "On 12 June 2019, EPFL was officially designated as a  of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the fields of open-source data and code development for nuclear applications. The IAEA is the world's central inter-governmental forum for scientific and technical co-operation in the nuclear field. It works for the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, contributing to international peace and security and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. For its work, the IAEA won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.\nThe IAEA endorses the EPFL for spearheading the creation of an international network of industries and research institutions that will develop an advanced, open-source simulation platform for the analysis of nuclear reactors. “This will be a unique opportunity to work on a major paradigm shift in the nuclear sector towards open, collaborative, and efficient R&D,” says Carlo Fiorina, the main initiator of this activity and a researcher at EPFL’s , headed by Professor Andreas Pautz.\nThe need for a new development strategy in the nuclear sector comes from its ever more stringent safety requirements, but also from the vibrant worldwide research activities dedicated to the development of new nuclear technologies for CO\n2\n-free energy generation, production of medical radioisotopes, incineration of existing nuclear waste, water desalination, and hydrogen production.\nThe EPFL Collaborating Centre’s objective will be to step beyond traditional development strategies, which are based on relatively old and often proprietary software and data. At the core of the Centre’s activities will be the promotion of R&D work fostering the concepts of open-source and shared development. This will boost R&D activities and contribute to a safe operation of nuclear plants by increasing synergies, limiting inefficiencies, promoting networking, and contributing to standardization.\nIn addition to leading this international effort, EPFL will produce new, open, and high-quality validation data at its . “This is an exciting chance to use our unique facility to bring about a real impact in the nuclear sector,” says Pavel Frajtag, who heads the reactor.\nThe open software and experimental data produced during the project will be distributed to the IAEA member states. This will empower innovation and spread IAEA’s safety culture, notably in developing countries that aim to include nuclear technologies as part of their strategic development targets for public welfare and reduced CO\n2\n emissions.\n“The designation as an IAEA Collaborating Center is a big honor and a strong recognition of EPFL’s reputation, the high nuclear safety standards in our country, and the excellence of nuclear research in Switzerland,” says Andreas Pautz. “It will put the CROCUS reactor on the map of outstanding nuclear facilities, and open pathways to global collaboration.”\nDuring the inauguration ceremony on 12 June, the IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy Mikhail Chudakov presented Professor Andreas Mortensen, vice president of research at EPFL, with the official nomination document (photo).

But the ceremony had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. So Joël Mérou, the president of ETH Zurich, stood alone in front of a camera as he presented the new design developed by his communications team.\nThe similarities with EPFL’s logo are obvious – and intended. “EPFL and ETH Zurich had already started the process of coming closer together, as people have seen in the news,” says Mérou. “And it seemed odd that our logos didn’t reflect the fact that we are sister schools.”\nThe next step would be for their parent institution, the ETH Board, to adopt a “family” logo as well. “We don’t have any rebranding plans for the near term, but we could consider it,” says Gian Carlett, the ETH Board’s spokesman. “The idea of a single Swiss Institute of Technology with a strong identity isn’t a new one.

{"id": 708, "text": "Obviously, wind farms work best when it is windy. But aside from wind-speed and direction, there are other more subtle factors that influence their power output. Using a mathematical model, researchers from EPFL’s  have shown the impact of vertical movements of the air on the productivity of wind farms. They found that increased turbulence caused by convective movements, common on hot, sunny days, increased the output of wind farms by shortening the lifespan of the turbulent wake downstream of the individual turbines. They published their  in the journal Physics of Fluids early this month.\nMahdi Abkar and Fernando Porté-Agel, the authors of the study, used a mathematical model to study the turbulence generated by a wind turbine as its rotors slice through the wind that drives them. With turbines often set up to form dense wind farms, understanding the turbulent wakes generated by upwind turbines and how long it takes for them to recover are important in predicting the overall power output of these wind farms, as turbines set up in the wind shadow of others are driven by strong wind. Today, turbines are spaced between five and seven turbine diameters apart – about 500 to 700 meters for large turbines – to maximize the amount of power that can be produced on a given area.\nOptimizing production over a 24-hour cycle\n“What we were interested in was understanding the effect of thermal stability on the characteristics and dynamics of the turbulent wake behind wind-turbines,” says Abkar. In other words, how do temperature-driven vertical movements in the lower atmosphere influence the turbulent wind shadow cast by a wind turbine. On sunny days, the hot ground causes the air above it to heat up and rise. This vertical motion is a characteristic of an unstable, convective atmosphere. On a typical night, by contrast, the earth’s cold surface cools the air above it, leading to a stable situation.\nAbkar used simulations to study the power output of a wind farm under convective and stable conditions and found a significant difference between both cases. “In the convective case, downwind turbines were about 30% less productive than those in the front lines. Under a stable atmosphere, the losses were even higher, on the order of 60%,” he says. His findings are important to optimize the power output of wind farms over a 24-hour cycle, as the lower atmosphere goes its stable nocturnal state to the convective state typical of daytime.\nSo, why does the turbulence recover so much faster in the convective case? According to Abkar, this is mostly due to the higher levels of turbulence in the incoming wind, which enhances turbulent mixing within, thereby breaking apart the turbulent wake behind the turbines. By contrast, in the stable setting, the turbulence is allowed to linger on for much longer, as turbulent mixing remains low.\nAccounting for windfarms in weather models\nUnraveling the detailed physics at play within wind farms is not only important to optimize their power output. Wind turbines alter the atmospheric dynamics by absorbing some of the wind and increasing turbulence, which can modify a number of other properties, such as atmospheric humidity and temperature. That is why meteorologists are interested in improving how they account for them in weather models. In a second paper, published in the journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, Akbar and Porté-Agel propose a new way to account for wind farms in large-scale atmospheric models that considers the number of turbines in the wind farm, the way that they are set up, and the wind direction.", "summary": "When set up in groups, wind turbines in the front rows cast a wind shadow on those behind them, lowering their performance.

{"id": 709, "text": "At  – educational facilities designed to promote cross-disciplinary research – a groundbreaking new device is in the works. Eight Master’s students in microengineering, bioengineering and life sciences () developed a portable biosensor for the  competition, which was held at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands on 7–8 September 2018. Their device can provide precise measurements of the amount of vancomycin, an antibiotic used as a last-resort treatment, in a patient’s blood plasma. This information will help doctors deliver exactly the amount of drug needed and therefore reduce the occurrence of harmful side effects. For instance, vancomycin is known to cause damage to the kidneys and to hearing.\n“We started working on the biosensor last fall alongside our coursework, and this summer have been working on it full-time. Being able to use the DLL has made our research a lot easier, since they have all the equipment we need,” says Alix Faillétaz, a Master’s student in bioengineering. This is the second year in a row that EPFL is participating in SensUs, where its team will be up against students from 12 other universities from around the world. “The competition was launched three years ago. It’s really demanding and is a huge challenge for the students. They must overcome a series of problems and learn to work together, trust each other and delegate tasks based on each individual’s specific skills,” says Professor Philippe Renaud, who is coaching the team.\nPolarization-based measurements\nSensUs aims to encourage the development of biosensors, targeting a different application each year – although the objective always relates to measuring a biomarker with an impact on public health. The objective is chosen by a panel of experts that includes Professor Renaud. Existing tests to measure vancomycin require a great deal of time, a considerable amount of blood and a special machine that costs tens of thousands of Swiss francs. But the EPFL team’s portable biosensor can take measurements in less than five minutes with just a few drops of blood, and costs under 5,000 francs. Their device shines polarized light on a sample containing a homogeneous mixture of the patient’s blood plasma and a synthetized peptide (an amino-acid sequence) solution.\nHow does it work? “We first created a peptide that bonds specifically to vancomycin, and then we added a fluorescent compound,” says Faillétaz. “As the vancomycin bonds to the fluorescent peptide, the peptide’s movement slows and the light it emits becomes more and more polarized. By measuring the degree of light polarization, we can calculate the vancomycin concentration in a patient’s blood.” According to Professor Renaud, this method already exists but has never been used to make a portable biosensor.\nAt the competition, the EPFL team will have to not only prove their biosensor’s efficacy by analyzing various samples, but also demonstrate its benefits for the healthcare industry and its market potential. “By changing the synthesis compound, our biosensor could be used to detect other antibiotics and biomarkers,” says David Vilela, a Master’s student in life sciences.\nEPFL on the first step of the podium\n The SenSwiss team won the most awards in the SensUs international competition. They won the technical award, and placed second for the awards related to creativity and entrepreneurship. Their biosensor has proven to be the most effective in accurately measuring the amount of vancomycin in blood plasma samples. This can be done in less than five minutes, with only a few drops of blood and innovative technology. The team also demonstrated the commercialization potential of his invention, its usefulness to medical personnel and the possibility of adapting the test to other antibiotics.\nThe SenSwiss team: \nMatthieu Pinto (microengineering student) optical detection part, Victor Steininger (bioengineering student) electrical and mechanical parts, Mathieu Jeckelmann (bioengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Jacopo Oswald (microengineering student) microfluidic and optical parts, Paul Philipp (life sciences student) biological part, Aly Makhlouf (bioengineering student) biological part, David Vilela (life sciences student) biological part, Alix Faillétaz (bioengineering student) electrical part.", "summary": "A team of eight EPFL students won the technical prize in the SensUs international competition, designing a portable biosensor that can measure the amount of vancomycin in a patient’s blood stream, enabling doctors to better control the dosage and reduce harmful side effects.

{"id": 710, "text": "“Dare to know.” Kant’s words were the inspiration behind the keynote address given by Pierre Vandergheynst, EPFL’s Vice President for Education, at Education Day on Friday, 17 May. The event was held at the Swiss Tech Convention Center, where over 300 people – mostly education professionals – took a close look at the discipline and, more specifically, at how to teach science more effectively and how to help students manage the transition from high school to college. “We were delighted to see so many high-school teachers from across Switzerland attending our event,” says Sabrina Rami Shojaei, head of EPFL’s Education Outreach Department (SPE), which organized the conference.\nThe first speaker – Eric Mazur, a physics professor at Harvard University – addressed the important challenge of capturing students’ attention and, above all, making sure they learn the material. As an expert in the topic, Mazur gave the audience a demonstration of his peer instruction method by turning a metal plate with a hole in it into a subject of debate for the entire room. The trick is to ask a lot of questions and get people involved in the learning process. “You don’t learn by watching. You learn by doing,” says Mazur – whom EPFL President Martin Vetterli called “the rock star of education.”\nPutting students in researchers’ shoes \nEducation Day also marked the first year of the LEARN Awards, handed out by SPE in association with EPFL’s new . The goal is to recognize initiatives at the high-school level that take a new approach to education. This year’s first-place winner was Sébastien Morard, a teacher at St. Michel high school in Fribourg. His idea was to put seven students in his elective geography class into the shoes of geography researchers. How? By asking them to analyze green transportation methods at all Fribourg high schools. “They managed the entire project, from collecting data to making suggestions for improvements,” says Morard, who had spent ten years working as a geographer. And his effort paid off, as reflected in the students’ enthusiastic feedback. “Teaching through the use of student projects requires ten times more preparation time. And you have to be ready to take risks, because things don’t always go the way you plan,” he says. Morard will receive CHF 20,000 with his LEARN Award, which he will use to expand his approach to larger groups of second-year students and to purchase scientific instruments that students can use to measure environmental impacts. “For instance, sensors to measure CO\n2\n concentrations or water purity,” he says.\nThird place went to Thibault Rossel, a chemistry teacher at the French high school in Biel/Bienne, who also challenges students to think like researchers in order to stimulate their curiosity. “My students are tasked with creating colorimetric biosensors for detecting potentially hazardous substances. This year we worked on sensors for detecting glyphosate, since there aren’t many already out there. It’s a genuine research project; I work side by side with my students and I don’t know ahead of time what we will discover,” says Rossel, who holds a PhD in bioorganic chemistry. With the CHF 10,000 he received, Rossel plans to purchase an automatic pipetting station so that students can practice using the latest technology and develop their computational thinking skills. He also plans to distribute the research kit he created so other teachers can follow his approach.\nA scientific escape game \nSecond place went to Solothurn cantonal high school, where the administrators decided to rethink the school’s teaching methods after observing that many of its graduates struggled upon entering university. The school therefore undertook a large-scale change program designed to give students more autonomy in the learning process. “We wanted to lighten the course load so that students can better concentrate on the core subjects, and to give students more freedom and encourage them to be more independent. We also changed our evaluation process, introduced more regular exams and adopted new skills assessment methods,” says Stefan Zumbrunn, the school’s principal. The biggest challenge in the program was getting all the school’s 200 teachers and 1,800 students on board. “We want our school to be up to date with the latest teaching practices. Fortunately we have a dynamic culture, and we got a lot of positive feedback on our initiative,” says Dieter Müller, the school’s co-rector. The CHF 15,000 prize money will go towards further expanding the program.\nThe public award (with a CHF 5,000 prize) went to Gabriel Palacios, a physics teacher at Hofwil high school in Bern. In 2013 he and his colleagues built a scientific escape game by reconverting an old cellar in Bern. The game – which took eight months to construct – walks students through several different scientific phenomena, piquing their curiosity and enticing them to learn more. Palacios found that after playing the game, students inundated him with questions about the different things they experienced in the cellar, giving him the perfect opportunity to explain physics-related concepts. He still employs the game today and his idea is now used in over 180 escape games worldwide, including 38 in Switzerland. Over a hundred of his former students have helped develop the games – further illustrating the power of getting students involved in the learning process. After all, as Mazur noted, “we are all born as scientists.” Who dare to know.", "summary": "EPFL held a special Education Day last Friday, 17 May, as part of events commemorating its 50\nth\n anniversary.

But how will we make the transition from a handful of autonomous and connected cars today to a true smart system offering enhanced safety, comfort and seamless and robust operation, in just 15 years’ time? Researchers who worked on the European AutoNet2030 project believe it can be achieved by combining driving assistance technologies and inter-vehicle communications. They have shown that it is possible for vehicles with or without drivers to operate in high-speed, multi-lane traffic autonomously under real-life conditions. This is a key step in the ongoing shift towards autonomous driving. \n06.02.17 - Switzerland has launched a National Center for Data Science in order to innovate in the realm of data and computer science, and to provide an infrastructure for fostering multidisciplinary research and open science, with applications ranging from personalized health to environmental issues. It is a joint venture between EPFL and ETH Zürich with offices in both Lausanne and Zürich. The initiative will ensure that Switzerland possesses expertise and excellence in data science while striving to be globally competitive.\n27.02.17 - EPFL researchers can now measure a slalom skier’s exact time at each gate all the way down the slope. The team at the Laboratory of Movement Analysis and Measurement has now come up with a way to closely track performance on each section of the slalom course by drawing on several different technologies. They started with accelerometers and gyroscopes, which measure the skiers’ acceleration and angular speed. The researchers then added a magnetic system to measure the elapsed time at each gate. Their system also calculates the skiers’ speed and trajectory more accurately than GPS.\n20.03.17 - On Sunday, 19 March, the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) reached Cape Town, South Africa. This marked the end of its trek around the southernmost continent, which began in this same port on 20 December 2016. The expedition was organized by the Swiss Polar Institute (SPI) and carried by the \nAkademik Treshnikov\n, a Russian research ship. By the end of the three-month voyage, a total of some 150 researchers had carried out the 22 projects selected.\n30.03.17 - One of the goals in pharmacology is to increase the efficiency of drugs by minimizing their side effects. Recently, this effort has led to combining unrelated drugs to exploit their synergistic effects. This “drug-drug synergy” relies on interactions between the individual biological pathways on which each drug acts. Scientists at EPFL and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have discovered a synergistic effect between an anticancer and an antirheumatic drug, improving the former’s ability to kill off cancer cells. \n05.04.17 - It’s too easy to fake fingerprints, and current biometric authentication systems are simply not secure enough. EPFL's Security and Cryptography Laboratory joined forces with startup Global ID to develop an encryption technique for processing biometric data captured via 3D finger vein recognition – a system that’s next to impossible to counterfeit that could be particularly useful for hospitals, law enforcement and even banks.\n06.04.17 - Imagine taking pictures of thousands of snowflakes from three different angles with a specialized instrument installed at an altitude of 2,500 meters. Then imagine using 3,500 of these pictures to manually train an algorithm to recognize six different classes of snowflakes. And, finally, imagine using this algorithm to classify the snowflakes in the millions of remaining pictures into those six classes at breakneck speed. That’s exactly what researchers at EPFL’s Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory did. Their aim is to improve the accuracy of snowfall measurements and winter weather forecasts.\n27.04.17 - EPFL’s new Swiss EdTech Collider ultimately will be home to around 30 startups involved in developing new education technologies. This coworking space will give these companies the chance to enhance their visibility among both clients and investors and to generate synergies. The startups will also have the opportunity to become involved in the cutting-edge research conducted by EPFL professors who specialize in education technology.\n10.05.17 - First, there is the Swiss genome center with a DNA sequencing capacity that is unmatched elsewhere in Europe. Then there is the gene therapy platform, which will work on developing new drug carriers to directly target defective parts of DNA. These two projects, which were simultaneously announced on 10 May, will give genetics research in the Lake Geneva region a real shot in the arm thanks to the extensive funding that will go into Campus Biotech in Geneva.\n17.05.17 - Coral reefs in the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba can resist rising water temperatures. Scientists at EPFL and UNIL, and Bar Ilan University and the InterUniversity Institute of Marine Sciences in Israel, performed the very first detailed physiological assessment of corals taken from the Gulf of Aqaba after exposure to stressful conditions over a six-week period.

The models offer the prospect of a new understanding of the human brain and its diseases and of completely new computing and robotic technologies. On January 28, the European Commission supported this vision, announcing that it has selected the HBP as one of two projects to be funded through the new FET Flagship Program.\nFederating more than 80 European and international research institutions, the Human Brain Project is planned to last ten years (2013-2023). The cost is estimated at 1.19 billion euros. The project will also associate some important North American and Japanese partners. It will be coordinated at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, by neuroscientist Henry Markram with co-directors Karlheinz Meier of Heidelberg University, Germany, and Richard Frackowiak of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne (UNIL).\nThe Swiss Contribution \nSwitzerland plays a vital role in the Human Brain Project. Henry Markram and his team at EPFL will coordinate the project and will also be responsible for the development and operation of the project’s Brain Simulation Platform. Richard Frackowiak and his team will be in charge of the project’s medical informatics platform; the Swiss Supercomputing Centre in Lugano will provide essential supercomputing facilities. Many other Swiss groups are also contributing to the project. Through the ETH Board, the Swiss Federal Government has allocated 75 million CHF (approximately 60 million Euros) for the period 2013-2017, to support the efforts of both Henry Markram’s laboratory at EPFL and the Swiss Supercomputing Center in Lugano. The Canton of Vaud will give 35 million CHF (28 million Euros) to build a new facility called Neuropolis for in silico life science, and centered around the Human Brain Project. This building will also be supported by the Swiss Confederation, the Rolex Group and third-party sponsors.\nThe selection of the Human Brain Project as a FET Flagship is the result of more than three years of preparation and a rigorous and severe evaluation by a large panel of independent, high profile scientists, chosen by the European Commission. In the coming months, the partners will negotiate a detailed agreement with the Community for the initial first two and a half year ramp-up phase (2013-mid 2016). The project will begin work in the closing months of 2013.\n---\nA scientific portrait of the Human Brain Project \nThe Human Brain Project will provide new tools to help understand the brain and its fundamental mechanisms and to apply this knowledge in future medicine and computing.\nCentral to the Human Brain Project is Information and Computing Technology (ICT). The project will develop ICT platforms for neuroinformatics, brain simulation and supercomputing that will make it possible to federate neuroscience data from all over the world, to integrate the data in unifying models and simulations of the brain, to check the models against data from biology and to make them available to the world scientific community. The ultimate goal is to allow neuroscientists to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to human cognition and behavior.\nA novel medical informatics platform will federate clinical data from around the world, allowing medical researchers to unlock the clinically valuable information they contain and to incorporate it in computer models of disease. The goal is to develop techniques for the objective diagnosis of the brain’s diseases, to understand their underlying mechanisms and to speed up the search for new treatments.\nFinally, the HBP will build new platforms for “neuromorphic computing” and “neurorobotics”, allowing researchers to develop new computing systems and robots based on the architecture and circuitry of the brain. The new systems will use detailed knowledge of the brain to address critical problems facing future computing technology: energy efficiency, reliability, the huge difficulties involved in programming very complex computing systems.\nThe HBP will fund independent scientists to use the new platforms for their own research, reserving a substantial part of its budget for this purpose.

Switzerland Innovation is designed to give Swiss and foreign companies with significant research activities the opportunity to be present in one of five innovation hubs across the country: Park Basel Area, Park innovaare, Park Zurich, Park Biel/Bienne and Park Network West EPFL. Switzerland Innovation Park Network West EPFL is unique in that it is made up of six sites from five cantons: Campus Biotech (Geneva), Bluefactory (Fribourg), Microcity (Neu-châtel), EPFL Innovation Park (Vaud), Biopôle (Vaud) and Energypolis (Valais).\n To maintain its place at the forefront of global innovation, Switzerland must be proactive and take initiatives. This was the message conveyed by Swiss President Johann N. Schneider-Ammann in his introductory remarks: “We want to position Switzerland among the best of the best in terms of research and innovation. That’s how we will maintain our global competitive-ness, our economic prosperity and our strong jobs market.” Hence the need for spaces in which Switzerland's specialized schools and universities can work closely with companies and together create an innovation-friendly environment. Switzerland Innovation now provides these spaces to Swiss and foreign companies through five high-tech sites that are close to the specialized schools and designed to support their ambitions.\n“Five cantons in French-speaking Switzerland have joined forces around EPFL, which is a driving force in the area of innovation. The six sites that together form Switzerland Innovation Park Net-work West EPFL all have links to EPFL-related entities, which means they will operate side by side with academia and the labs.

{"id": 716, "text": "Like far away galaxies, powerful tools are required to bring the minute inner workings of neurons into focus. A team of neurobiologists, psychiatrists, and advanced imaging specialists from Switzerland’s EPLF and CHUV report in The Journal of Neuroscience how Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) can now be used to observe neuronal activity in real-time and in three dimensions—with up to 50 times greater resolution than ever before. The application, borrowed from materials science, has immense potential for testing out new drugs to fight neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It has already been commercialized by the EPFL start-up LynceeTec.\nNeurons come in various shapes and are transparent. To observe them in a Petri dish, scientists use florescent dyes that change the chemical composition and can skew results. Additionally, this technique is time consuming, often damages the cells, and only allows researchers to examine a few neurons at a time. But these newly published results show how DHM can bypass the limitations of existing techniques.\n“DHM is a fundamentally novel application for studying neurons with a slew of advantages over traditional microscopes,” explains Pierre Magistretti of EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute and a lead author of the paper. “It is non-invasive, allowing for extended observation of neural processes without the need for electrodes or dyes that damage cells.”\nSenior team member Pierre Marquet adds, “DHM gives precious information not only about the shape of neurons, but also about their dynamics and activity, and the technique creates 3D navigable images and increases the precision from 500 nanometers in traditional microscopes to a scale of 10 nanometers.”\nA good way to understand how DHM works is to imagine a large rock in an ocean of perfectly regular waves. As the waves deform around the rock and come around the other side, they carry information about the rock’s form. This information can be extracted by comparing it to waves that did not smash up against the rock, and an image of the rock can be reconstructed. DHM does this with a laser beam by pointing a single wavelength at an object, collecting the distorted wave on the other side, and comparing it to a reference beam. A computer then numerically reconstructs a 3D image of the object—in this case neurons—using an algorithm developed by the authors. In addition, the laser beam travels through the transparent cells and important information about their internal composition is obtained.\nNormally applied to detect minute defects in materials, Magistretti, along with DHM pioneer and EPFL professor in the Advanced Photonics Laboratory, Christian Depeursinge, decided to use DHM for neurobiological applications. In the study, their group provoked an electric charge in a culture of neurons using glutamate, the main neurotransmitter in the brain. This charge transfer carries water inside the neurons and changes their optical properties in a way that can be detected only by DHM. Thus, the technique accurately visualizes the electrical activities of hundreds of neurons simultaneously, in real-time, without damaging them with electrodes, which can only record activity from a few neurons at a time.\nA major advance for pharmaceutical research \nWithout the need to introduce dyes or electrodes, DHM can be applied to High Content Screening—the screening of thousands of new pharmacological molecules. This advance has important ramifications for the discovery of new drugs that combat or prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, since new molecules can be tested more quickly and in greater numbers.\n“Due to the technique’s precision, speed, and lack of invasiveness, it is possible to track minute changes in neuron properties in relation to an applied test drug and allow for a better understanding of what is happening,” Magistretti says. “What normally would take 12 hours in the lab can now be done in 15 to 30 minutes, greatly decreasing the time it takes for researchers to know if a drug is effective or not.”\nCitation\n: The Journal of Neuroscience, August 17, 2011 • 31(33):11846 –11854\nTitle\n: Determination of Transmembrane Water Fluxes in Neurons Elicited by Glutamate Ionotropic Receptors and by the Cotransporters KCC2 and NKCC1: A Digital Holographic Microscopy Study.\nAuthors\n: Pascal Jourdain, Nicolas Pavillon, Corinne Moratal, Daniel Boss, Benjamin Rappaz, Christian Depeursinge, Pierre Marquet, and Pierre J.

{"id": 717, "text": "Croatia and EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland) officially announced their intention to create a centre of scientific-technological excellence. Located in Croatia, its goal will be to launch the careers of young, high-potential researchers in order to stimulate strategic research and economically relevant technological innovation and limit the loss of intellectual capital from the country. The project proposal will be submitted to the European Commission as part of the Horizon 2020 framework programme. If approved, it will receive up to €20 million in funding from the EU, bring together more than 70 collaborators and give creative young talents who are just setting out in their careers the stimulating opportunity to lead their first teams and to conduct visionary research in selected fields that are considered of key importance to the future of Croatian economy. EPFL, recognized in Europe for its success in applying a strategy based on recruiting and developing the careers of young researchers, hopes to help transfer its demonstrated successful expertise in this important strategic area to Croatia. The partners have been in discussions since summer 2013, and their ambition is to make this centre into an international leader in its specific domains by 2020. \n Such a platform should help strengthen other Croatian-EU cooperation projects.\n The official project announcement took place in Zagreb on March 7, 2014, in the presence of the Croatian Vice-Minister of Science, Education and Sport Saša Zelenika, the Croatian Vice-Minister of Regional Development Jakša Puljiz, the Swiss State Secretary of Education, Research and Innovation Mauro Dell Ambrogio, the President of the Swiss National Science Foundation Martin Vetterli, and EPFL President Patrick Aebischer.\n The centre will host a dozen scientific teams in Croatia, each one led by a promising young professor, selected after an open excellence competition. In all, more than 70 individuals could be working in the centre. The research areas concerned – notably engineering, health-related and electronics – correspond to activity sectors identified as crucial for Croatia’s improved economic development. \nInvesting in young researchers – a strategy for a scientific Europe\n EPFL has established a highly effective means of recruiting promising young scientific talents and giving them the means to realize their potential: the “Tenure Track” system, in which they are placed at the head of a research team with a significant budget at their disposal for a seven-year probationary period. Currently, EPFL has 60 of these young tenure track assistant professors in its faculty. In a sign of its success, out of 100 Tenure Track professors who have started their careers at EPFL, more than a third obtained an ERC starting grant – the most prestigious grant awarded by the European Research Council to young researchers, carrying up to €2 million in funding. \n According to EPFL President Patrick Aebischer, measures such as these are necessary not only to stimulate research, but also to enable Europe to retain its most talented researchers. “Young European scientists must often wait for many years before a professorship becomes available. Many of them leave for the U.S., never to return,” he explains. “Whether it’s in Switzerland or in Croatia, we must put a system in place that allows them to reach their full potential and establish their careers in Europe, and in doing so make a local contribution to value and job creation.” \nThe project proposal will soon be submitted to the European Commission \n \"We must promote the career of our young researchers. This is the main expectation of our joint project with EPFL,” explains Saša Zelenika, Croatia’s Vice-Minister of Science, Education and Sports.\n Based on its experience, EPFL will take responsibility for launching and initial management of the institute, with help from international and Croatian scientific committees. The project will be part of the European Horizon 2020 programme, which includes a section entitled “Teaming” that is dedicated to the transfer of expertise and strategies between countries.\n The project proposal will be submitted in September 2014. If approved by the European Commission, EPFL and the Croatian partners will have an additional year to submit a detailed action plan. After a second round of approvals, the winning “Teaming” projects will be funded by the European Commission for up to €15-20 million over a maximum period of seven years.", "summary": "Croatia and EPFL have unveiled the outlines of a project proposal they are jointly submitting to the European Commission that will create a stimulating centre to launch the careers of young professors and stem the “Brain drain” tide.", "claim": "Croatia and EPFL have unveiled the outlines of a project proposal they are jointly submitting to the European Commission that will create a stimulating centre to launch the careers of young professors and stem the “Brain drain” tide.", "label": "CORRECT", "extraction_span": null, "backtranslation": false, "augmentation": null, "augmentation_span": null, "noise": false}
{"id": 718, "text": "Katie Bouman was one of 200 scientists who helped create the first-ever image of a black hole, released this past April. The 30-year old researcher, who was recently named an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), came to speak at EPFL’s Open Science Day. Martin Vetterli took advantage of that opportunity to sit down with her and ask her a few questions about their field of shared interest.\nMV: “It’s pretty unusual for someone to become a star researcher at such a young age. How did you get into science?\nKB: I was very interested in science as a kid. When I was in third grade, I remember looking under rocks all the time. And as I got older, I was constantly drawn to the different science topics covered in class. In sixth grade, I first got involved in science fair projects, and I continued doing that on and off through high school. Then, when I tried out research for the first time, I was thrilled: it was so different from a homework set, where you know there’s a solution even if it’s difficult to find. Research was a new way of thinking and problem-solving for me, and I found that very exciting.\nHow did you get into computer science?\nIt wasn’t until high school, when a friend convinced me to take a computer science class. At first, I thought: “This isn’t very fun, what will I use it for?” But it opened up a totally new area for me! We didn’t solve any big problems or anything, but because I had done this class and learned this new computing language, I was offered a position the following summer to work in a lab at Purdue University, in my hometown, helping the graduate researchers with their projects. Some were working on imaging problems, such as in the field of forensics. It was so exciting to see how we could pull information out of images and use it to recover hidden properties about the world. From that point on, I got more and more interested in imaging and electrical engineering and eventually computer vision. My path has always been guided by a love of research and images, because I really like the fact that you can visualize what you’re working on.\nThe black-hole imaging project was very cross-disciplinary. What was it like to work on this team?\nIt was quite a new experience, and I had a lot of fun! At that point, the team had already worked extensively on the instrumentation side and was just getting started on the imaging part. They really needed someone who could interpret the data and develop new ways of dealing with the challenges. I first heard about the project through a presentation and, actually, I understood pretty much nothing, it was like gibberish [laughter]. Still, I left that presentation thinking “I want to be part of this!”, because I could see that the tools needed for this project were so similar to the ones we were developing for other problems, like in medical imaging. When I joined the team, I didn’t know anything about black holes. But I was working with an amazing group of researchers. They kindly taught me everything I needed to know about radioastronomy, astrophysics, black holes, and so on. I also got to spend about a month and a half behind a telescope learning about the technical system. And I think that process was important, because when you’re developing an imaging method, you have to understand not only how problems arise during observations and make their way into the data you’re analyzing, but also what you can expect to find. In order to get the most out of the data, you need to learn as much as possible in the related fields. That’s why working in cross-disciplinary teams is so crucial now for many big science projects to go forward.\nHelping create the first image of a black hole is a major accomplishment so early in your career. What’s next for you as a young researcher at CalTech?\nI’m really excited to do new things. For example, I’m starting to work on seismology – trying to image earthquakes – which is crucial for the California region. I’m very excited about this job because CalTech is a small school, which makes it easier to connect with people in other fields. I’m so fortunate to already be working with a lot of people in different areas. My ultimate goal is to think about how we can help scientists discover new things. We are so used to coming up with our own hypotheses and figuring out what we should observe to test them. But we can now develop machines to find trends and data that we might not see or be aware of as humans. I’m really interested in how to design machines that can tell us how to do our experiments, and what new wavelength or data domain to look at in order to discover something we would not otherwise see. In general, I’m very much into how we do data-driven scientific discovery.\nA couple of guys just won the Nobel Prize for discovering the first exoplanet 25 years ago. Initially, they didn’t believe their results and reran the experiment several times. Some things have changed since then, but we’re still dealing with noisy data, right?\nYes, when we first created the black-hole image, or at least the day we got the data, we entered it into an imaging script and a ring appeared. I actually went from being really excited to being mad at the colleagues who gave us the data – which I was convinced were fake. It just seemed too good to be true! Nothing ever works like that the first time. It was just so much more beautiful than any synthetic data we had created. It actually took weeks before I believed the data were real, and that our colleagues weren’t trying to trick us or test us.", "summary": "The first-ever image of a black hole was unveiled to the public this past April.

{"id": 719, "text": "In 2017, startups around the world raised some 4.6 billion dollars by issuing virtual tokens that can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies or services. And much of this activity is taking place in Switzerland, where ICOs brought in 850 million dollars last year according to figures published by IFZ (Institut für Finanzdienstleistungen). But so far, few manufacturers have gotten in on the act.\nLakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that develops customized, highly pure diamonds, is an exception. It is set to launch its own ICO, selling machine-hours in the form of virtual tokens. Over two million tokens – worth a total of 60 million francs – will be issued. The company plans to use this money to significantly ramp up its production capacity. Once the ICO has been completed, buyers will be able to sell their tokens or exchange them for diamonds, thereby creating the first-ever crowd-funded diamond “mine.”\nThe smaller the more expensive\n“With natural diamonds, prices go up as the stones get bigger. But with us it’s the opposite,” says Pascal Gallo, the startup’s founder and CEO. The diamonds produced by LakeDiamond are much purer than natural diamonds. The company’s manufacturing process, in which layers of carbon atoms – the sole ingredient of diamonds – are built up through vapor deposition, eliminates nearly all impurities. These industrial diamonds allow for much greater precision thanks to their hardness, thermal and electrical conductivity, and optical properties.\nThe carefully calibrated size of the diamonds – down to the micron – and the high tech processing they undergo are what set these diamonds apart. The method used to customize the diamonds was developed in conjunction with Niels Quack’s lab at EPFL. The carefully sized diamonds can be set in complex mechanical systems such as watch movements and used in high powered lasers, transistors and photonic platforms.\nThe vast majority of companies that have launched ICOs also use blockchain technology. Their main motivation is simplicity: the companies can deal directly with their investors, and this reduces paperwork and saves time. For LakeDiamond, there’s also the question of independence. “We tried traditional fundraising methods, but most potential investors were in the military sector,” says Gallo. “And we don’t want to take the company in that direction.”\nA smart contract based on the Ethereum blockchain\nThe “user,” in the company’s parlance, buys a certain number of tokens secured by an Ethereum smart contract. Ethereum is one of several types of blockchain, which are used to record and share information without any external oversight. Blockchains are so safe because all transactions are verifiable and transparent. A white paper describes the project in detail and includes the transaction clauses and the code used to create the tokens (“ether”) that are issued against the cryptocurrency.\n“Our project is unique: we connect diamond growth reactors to the Ethereum blockchain, which lets token holders produce their own diamonds,” says Romain Braud, the company’s blockchain specialist. LakeDiamond’s tokens are referred to as Time-based Machine Tokens (TMT) because they represent hours of use of the reactors. They also give holders a preferential right to “mine” the diamonds ordered by the company’s industrial clients. This means that token holders can support a client project by trading in their tokens for that project – and ultimately benefiting from the value of the client’s order. Tokens can also be sold on secondary markets, just like traditional cryptocurrencies.\nThe first phase of LakeDiamond’s ICO is meant for professional investors (“token users”). The ICO will be opened to the public this fall once the company has obtained authorization from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).", "summary": "LakeDiamond, an EPFL spin-off that produces and customizes ultra-pure diamonds for industrial use, is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) today.

A version is available for everyone at . It’s most interesting feature is that it takes into account all the forms of transport – road, rail and air. It enables you to plan a complete journey, practically door-to-door. Imagine that I’d like to go from Ecublens to Cambridge in the UK: there are hundreds of combinations of ways to get there. I can take the metro to Lausanne and then the train to Geneva, where I can fly to London Luton and finish my journey by taxi. Or I could drive to Basel, then fly to London Stansted, where I could take a train to Cambridge. Routerank allows you to categorize all your itineraries according to different criteria, such as travel time, cost, and even CO2 emissions.\nCould this recognition from the USA herald a phase of international expansion for the company?\n To be frank, I rather underestimated its importance to begin with.

{"id": 721, "text": "Gone are the days when the United States and the Soviet Union competed to achieve firsts in spaceflight capability – first in space, first to the moon. That golden age cast a decades-long shadow over space exploration. But that is all changing now, not least with the arrival of new players on the scene. The EPFL Space Center (eSpace) is marking UN World Space Week, the annual October celebration that officially starts today, with a clear statement of its intent to capture the opportunities offered by this decisive turning point.\neSpace, founded in 2014, is expanding and redefining its research priorities with the launch of a new initiative dubbed Sustainable Space Logistics. The move is part of the unit’s ambitious plans to become a center of excellence in equipment and data for space exploration, and in the development of lasting, sustainable space infrastructure.\n“There’s growing talk in space circles of mankind returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent base there,” says eSpace director Jean-Paul Kneib. “But before we can do that, we need to think long and hard about how we design consumables – energy, fuel, water and food – from the standpoint of both recycling and sustainability.”\nIn recent years, more and more governments have launched space programs. Countries like China and India are rising rapidly up the list of world space powers. But the biggest change has been the arrival of private companies on the scene. Firms like SpaceX and EPFL spin-off Astrocast are now sending their own rockets and satellites into space, bringing incredible energy and ground-breaking ideas to the table.\nSatellite constellations\nIn the new space age, satellites are becoming ever smaller – and smarter. Looking ahead, it seems as though satellite constellations are the future, with smaller devices such as CubeSats operating in tandem and forming a robust network that covers more of the Earth’s surface. This development owes much to advances in Internet of Things (IoT) systems.\n“It’s incredible to see how fast technology is evolving,” says Muriel Richard, an engineer at eSpace who specializes in space debris. “We’re on the cusp of the space research 4.0 era.”\nSince the world’s first satellite was launched over 60 years ago, space has become increasingly cluttered with junk – thousands of pieces of debris ranging from tiny paint chips to rocket stages and entire obsolete satellites. All that debris orbiting the Earth poses a major collision risk, with serious implications for space exploration. In fact, the problem has become so acute in recent years that scientists are having to rethink mission design with junk in mind. The need for sustainable solutions has never been greater.\nSought-after expertise\nEPFL is ideally placed to make the most of this new landscape. “Our skills and expertise are exactly what the space industry is looking for,” says Sonia Ben Hamida, a researcher who recently joined the eSpace team. “In many respects, it’s the perfect fit.”\neSpace’s logistics services could support operations and activities across a broad spectrum of fields, ranging from transport, storage, packaging and distribution, to location, telecommunications, navigation, repair and resupply. Other potential applications include in-orbit manufacturing and assembly, drilling, human presence, surveillance, cleaning, recycling – and more.\nTechnologies developed for other applications by various EPFL labs and startups – especially in microengineering, electronics and robotics – could also be repurposed for use in the space industry. Examples include solar radiation and cosmic ray protective equipment, cleaner propulsion systems, next-generation transport vehicles, and space robots designed to capture junk or move objects around in space. And, of course, artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize viewing, tracking, orientation recognition, and in-orbit assembly systems.\neSpace will define its research priorities after consulting with the European Space Agency (ESA), the Swiss Space Office and other bodies. Pending that decision, manufacturers, scientists, students and other interested parties are invited to contact the center to express their interest.\nTo get in touch with the Sustainable Space Logistics initiative, please write to: \nEPFL Space Center invite participants of all ages, from all around the world to take part in an essay competition to introduce new ideas on the topic of how to develop space logistics services, in a sustainable way:", "summary": "Things are changing in outer space: it is filling with debris, attracting private companies, and raising new technological challenges.

{"id": 722, "text": "Neurons communicate with each other at synapses through complex mechanisms. The synapses establish contact between the neurons and convert their electrical signals into chemical signals, the release of neurotransmitters. Study of these phenomena is one of the essential keys to understanding the brain. The team from the EPFL’s Laboratory of Synaptic Mechanisms, headed by Ralf Schneggenburger, has shed some light on previously unknown functions of proteins in the release of neurotransmitters.\n In the first paper (1), the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to deactivate a protein selectively in the calyx of Held, the brain’s largest synapse. This novel method enabled them to discover a direct, unexpected role for the protein RIM (Rab3 interacting molecule), which increases the density of calcium ion (Ca2+) channels, a type of ion channel that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release.\n In the second article (2), the scientists used mice that had been genetically modified so they would not produce a specific protein, synaptotagmin. This Ca2+-sensing protein is known to bind calcium ions (Ca2+), thus initiating neurotransmitter release. The researchers used a virus to reintroduce the missing gene in the nerve terminal and reestablish the gene function at the calyx of Held.\nA Protein’s Double Life\n Subsequently, the scientists used viruses expressing slightly modified versions of the gene coding for the protein. Careful comparison enabled them to reveal a double role of this protein. The function of synaptotagmin is in fact not limited to initiating neurotransmitter release; it also inhibits other Ca2+- sensing proteins present in the nerve terminal. In doing so, it increases the amplitude of the release signal while suppressing background release events. In other words it optimizes the signal quality, similarly to what occurs in an electronic circuit.\n The approaches developed by Ralf Schneggenburger’s team are promising. They should also help us gain more insight into the function of other proteins that are active in the synapses. Since synaptic transmission is the basis of all fast communication between neurons in the brain, misfunction at synapses can underlie several neurodegenerative- and psychiatric disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's Disease. \"Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular bases of synapse function will contribute to the development of treatment strategies of these disorders in the future,” the researcher explained.\n (1)Neuron, January 27, 2011, “”\n (2)Neuron, February 24, 2011, “”", "summary": "EPFL researchers have made a step forward in understanding signal transmission in neuronal networks, thanks to new methods to molecularly influence the nerve terminal.

{"id": 723, "text": "Making a foray into the business world is an essential rite of passage for all EPFL engineering students. They must spend 2–6 months working for a company, after which they can also opt for an in-company master’s project to cap off their studies (\nsee text box\n). EPFL carefully selects which businesses can work with its students. “We try to make sure the internships are really worthwhile, which we gauge during the selection process, by keeping in touch with the students throughout the internship and in the students’ final report ,” said Daniele Mari, deputy director and internship coordinator of the physics section.\nA wellspring of innovation\nBut EPFL’s strict requirements haven’t dented companies’ interest – there are twice as many positions available than students seeking them. “Last year 2,000 internships were offered to the 1,024 students in our 18 master’s programs,” said Catherine Marselli Pasquier, EPFL’s internship coordinator.\nThe reason why businesses are so enthusiastic is that EPFL students are known for delivering concrete results – and for bringing a healthy dose of creativity to the table. “Students look at the challenges we face in a different way, leveraging new skills and taking a different approach,” said Jean-Michel Chardon, Senior Director at Logitech and an EPFL alumnus. He finds that with its dozen interns every year, his company clearly comes out ahead. “They allow us to launch 12 projects at a time. And they are brimming with ideas. It’s a rewarding program that lets us innovate in so many different areas.”\nJosep Solà i Carós, a biomedical expert at CSEM in Neuchâtel, agrees. “Students often surprise us with their bright ideas for solving problems. This is especially true in project development, where they frequently come up with suggestions that are easy to implement,” he said.\nSupport for small businesses\nThe students’ self-motivation is something else that businesses appreciate. “They are quickly capable of taking on new projects,” said Sylvain Monnier-Benoit from Novigenix, a startup based in Epalinges. “The support provided by our interns allowed us to move forward at key points in our business development. We were happy to have them.” Another local company, Dentsply Sirona in Ballaigues, takes on one or two students a year. “These internships are really a win-win situation. We have to spend a month training them, but afterwards they are very productive and enable us to try things out that we wouldn’t be able to with our regular staff,” said Yanik Tardy, Vice President of R&D.\n“The best possible transition”\nAs delighted as businesses are by their interns, the feeling goes both ways. Luc Conti, an EPFL microengineering student, spent several months at Debiotech in Lausanne, excited “to be able to work as part of a team on a real product, making a tangible impact.” Electrical engineering student Firmin Manoury completed an internship at Romande Énergie and then a master’s project at Renault in France, in a laboratory specialized in vehicle connectivity systems. “That crystallized my interest in this specific field. Taking the first steps into the business world while still receiving the support of my EPFL professor was the best possible transition from academia into professional life,” he said.\nEve Carletti, an electrical engineering student, completed both a six-month internship and a master’s project at Microchip Technology. “I had the supervision I needed but was still encouraged to take the initiative,” she said. And it was clearly a positive experience on both sides, because the firm hired her as soon as she graduated. Indeed, many students go on to be hired by the companies they work for. “We hire about 20% of our interns,” said Solà i Carós. “The advantage is that they already know our company. Internships bring us a lot of benefits in the short and long term.”\nInternships also give businesses an opportunity to form ties with EPFL laboratories. That could open the door to broader joint research projects financed by Switzerland’s Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI), which aims to encourage technology transfer to industry.\nEPFL internships and master’s projects\nInternships are in general paid and give engineering students an opportunity to spend several months working for a company. They take place away from an academic setting, and the subject must be approved by the school.\nMaster’s projects are students’ final research projects and are closely overseen by an EPFL professor. They are graded (unlike internships), and typically take place in a laboratory. However, EPFL is also looking into ways to have the projects carried out at company sites, which would more effectively combine the research with business aspects.", "summary": "As part of their degree programs, EPFL students spend several months far from the academic world, working on internships or master’s projects.

{"id": 724, "text": "“Ouay, ask the nurse what time she’s coming.” “Ouay, tell John to go run errands.” Or “Ouay, I don’t feel well, call the nurse.” The round smart speaker developed by the student team acts on the sound of a user’s voice. And it can connect users with people outside the home – caregivers, friends or family members can send text or voice messages to Ouay through a special app and Ouay reads the messages out loud. By providing a constant connection, the system allows elderly patients to remain independent while at the same time reassuring everyone involved that help is never far away. It has already been tested by several organizations that provide home-care services to the elderly.\nToday there is a host of new systems for helping the elderly or handicapped live on their own, as well as a growing number of specially equipped apartment buildings. These developments are often motivated by the dual goals of improving patients’ lives and keeping costs down. And recent technological advancements, such as in sensors and alert systems, are supporting this trend. But the two people behind the idea for Ouay – Sven Borden, a first-year Master’s student in microengineering at EPFL, and Loïc Rochat, a student in mechanical engineering – found that there was one key element missing, based on their personal experience with elderly people. “We needed a reliable device that patients can use to easily communicate with people outside the home. That would help them feel more independent,” says Borden. They fleshed out their idea at the Zurich hackathon, a weekend-long brainstorming marathon where would-be entrepreneurs come with a business idea and draft a business plan. Once the hackathon was over, the duo took their business plan and decided to run with it.\nA reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit at EPFL \nBorden and Rochat teamed up with other students from EPFL, HEC and HE-ARC, and then spoke with local caregivers and patients in order to pinpoint their needs. “I think Ouay is a good reflection of the entrepreneurial spirit we have here at EPFL,” says Borden. The students initially set up an association to build up their network and pool their funds. Since this initial investment, Ouay has expanded its reach considerably; the student team received an XGrant (financial support that EPFL provides to student startups) as well as a CHF 20,000 FIT Digital grant from Vaud’s Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). The proceeds were used to create the prototypes that are currently being tested by home-care providers.\nHelping people fall asleep with remote hypnosis \nFor elderly patients, even minor inconveniences – like not being able to find something in their apartment or a nurse showing up late – can cause a great deal of stress. And caring for elderly patients can also cause stress for friends and family. To help alleviate these factors, Ouay has a number of useful features including alerts for taking medication, reminders for doctor’s appointments and messages that can reassure someone feeling anxious. These features work through the mobile telephone network. Jean-Luc Tuma, who heads up the local home-care group Uniquecare santé et soins à domicile, sees the clear benefits of the device, which his staff tested: “It’s an excellent way to help patients live autonomously, independently and safely.” And his staff discovered new uses for Ouay as they tried it out in real-life situations. “The most remarkable thing we’ve done so far is having a hypnotherapist use the device to help a patient fall asleep through remote hypnosis,” says Tuma. He believes Ouay will eventually become a standard tool for caregivers.\nThe students officially launched their company and want to bring in more people. They plan to seek out “motivated students aiming to become professional developers, prototype builders or electronic device designers, and give them another opportunity to work on concrete problems,” says Rochat.", "summary": "Two students from EPFL have developed a smart speaker with voice-activation technology that connects patients directly to their loved ones as well as caregivers and emergency services.

{"id": 725, "text": "Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers that affect white blood cells of the immune system called B-lymphocytes or B cells. Like cells in all cancers, the B cells begin to grow out of control, creating tumors in the lymph nodes, spleen or other tissues. In 2010 alone, it was estimated that non-Hodgkin lymphomas caused 210,000 deaths worldwide.\nOne of the driving forces behind non-Hodgkin lymphomas is the over-activation of a receptor on the surface of B cells. This receptor normally stimulates the growth of B-cells only when it is needed, but in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the growth signal is constantly on, making B-cells grow uncontrollably.\nTo block this signal, recent clinical studies have focused on inhibiting the activation of the B-cell receptor as a treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, but with variable success. For example, a drug called ibrutinib has been tested in clinical trials to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Ibrutinib blocks the enzyme BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase), which is involved in maturing and activating B cells as part of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway. Unfortunately, the response to ibrutinib has been limited only to a subgroup of DLBCL patients.\nThe  has now carried out a study to identify mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib. Using tumor cells from DLBCL patients, the scientists discovered that the inactivation of BTK in resistant tumors triggers the over-activation of alternative signals that promote tumor cell survival and proliferation.\nTo prevent this mechanism of resistance and block the B-cell receptor signaling at its root, Elena Battistello, the PhD student who led this project, targeted the three enzymes (LYN, FYN, and BLK) that initiate the propagation of the signals.\nRepresentation of the B-cell receptor’s signaling pathway (right).

{"id": 726, "text": "Primary liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with current treatments being very limited. Liver cancer cells are particularly addicted to the amino acid glutamine, which fuels their proliferation. EPFL scientists have now found that a liver protein called “liver receptor homolog 1” (LRH-1) is responsible for the digestion of glutamine into smaller molecules, which are avidly consumed by liver cancer cells. Therefore, blocking LRH-1 causes cancer cells to starve and greatly reduces the development of liver cancer in mice, while preserving normal cells. The discovery is published in \nGenes & Development\n, and can introduce new drugs that target LRH-1 to effectively treat liver cancers.\nLRH-1 is a receptor in the cell nucleus, where it regulates the expression of various genes. In this study, scientists from different groups at EPFL led by , discovered that LRH-1 coordinates several key genes that are involved in the metabolism of glutamine – an amino acid to which liver cancer cells become addicted. The researchers found that LRH-1 drives the development of liver tumors by helping cancer cells to convert glutamine into molecules that are directly needed for proliferation.\nThis would also mean that disrupting the function of LRH-1 in the liver of mice would protect against the development of liver cancer. That is exactly what the scientists found when they studied mice that had been genetically modified to not express LRH-1 – so called “knockout” mice. After exposing them to chemical carcinogens, the livers of knockout mice showed dramatically less development of tumors. “Shutting down this pathway by inhibiting LRH-1 abrogates the utilization of glutamine as a fuel and brings the cancerous cells in tremendous metabolic distress,” says Pan Xu, the first author of the study.\nBased on the study, LRH-1 could be a new drug target to prevent the development of liver cancer. Because cancer cells, unlike normal cells, are very often addicted to glutamine, drugs that inhibit glutamine metabolism have been proposed as new highly efficient chemotherapy agents.\n“Inhibiting LRH-1 can thus be an effective way to starve only liver cancer cells, while leaving normal cells intact,” says Kristina Schoonjans. Her lab is now actively trying to identify new chemotherapeutic agents to treat liver cancer by developing specific compounds that inhibit LRH-1. The researchers also hope that these findings may extend to other types of cancer, since LRH-1 is also abundant in the pancreas and ovaries.\nThis work involved a collaboration of Kristina Schoonjans’ lab with EPFL’s Institute of Bioengineering and Institute of the Physics of Biological Systems, and the University of Groningen.

{"id": 727, "text": "One day, a virtual version of your own heart pumping may help doctors diagnose heart disease and determine the best treatment for you, without the need of surgical intervention or other invasive clinical practices. EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni’s goal is precisely this as he builds mathematical tools to simulate heart function with increasing accuracy and that can be personalized to your heart based on medical scans. He recently added the behavior of a patient-specific aortic valve to his overall functioning heart model. The results are published June 7th in \nBiomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology\n.\nA personalized virtual heart for preventing cardiovascular disease\nThe human heart is an extraordinarily complex organ that pumps an estimated 180 million liters of blood, which would fill more than seven Olympic-sized swimming pools in one’s lifetime, thereby ensuring that oxygenated blood reaches the entire body. Cardiovascular problems may lead to malfunction, disease, or death. Heart disease causes 40% of deaths in the EU and costs an estimated 196 billion a year, yet 80% of acquired heart diseases and stroke episodes are preventable.\nQuarteroni aims to help prevent or treat cardiovascular disease by providing a personalized virtual heart to patients, essentially a detailed mathematical description of a patient’s heart and how it functions – or malfunctions.\nEvery person’s heart is unique. Correctly modeling the intricacies of each individual heart therefore requires a customizable mathematical description of both its geometry and its dynamics. But doing so in a mathematically sound way is no easy task; it requires large amounts of patient-specific data and computational power to solve complex equations. Thanks to increasingly powerful computers, building a realistic virtual heart is becoming a reality.\nHow to build a virtual aortic valve\nIn constructing a virtual heart that is complete and functional, the aortic valve cannot be neglected. Quarteroni and his team recently added to their heart model the way blood flows from inside the heart into the aorta, taking into account the complex shapes and properties of the aorta’s physiological membranes: the valve leaflets.\n“A mathematical description of the aortic valve and its interaction with blood flow exists in the literature, but not at this level of detail for a specific patient,” says Quarteroni.\nFrom MRI scans of a patient, they reconstructed the shape of the aorta, which they represented using a 3D computational mesh. Using mathematical tools to characterize the mechanics of the valve, they described the movement of three triangular-shaped leaflets that make up the aortic valve. To determine how blood flows inside of the atria, the heart’s cavities, they next approximated and numerically solved the mathematical equations (Navier-Stokes) that describe viscous fluid dynamics, adapting them for a patient-specific geometry. Even with this preliminary work, it is a relatively easy task to personalize the model to another patient by using a new set of MRI scans.\nAs the director of iHeart, an EU-funded project, Quarteroni’s long-term vision is to build patient-specific virtual models of the entire cardiovascular system, including the heart, all of the body’s blood vessels, and of the approximately five liters of blood flowing through the body. \n“If successful, \niHeart \nwill help clinicians to tackle important questions efficiently, both in diagnostics and treatment, with a tremendous impact for society,” says Quarteroni. “It will provide a unique, unprecedented research environment for exploring the heart with an immensely powerful and non–invasive mathematical microscope, making it possible to simulate cardiovascular disease, like carotid stenosis and aneuryisms that can affect the heart, the abdomen, the brain and other parts the body.”\nQuarteroni believes that a personalized virtual heart model may become clinically available in less than a decade. Earlier prototypes of the virtual model may be developed and tested sooner, possibly within a five-year horizon. This will require significant investment in the development of robust mathematical and numerical tools to simulate heart function that is tailored to a specific patient.", "summary": "EPFL mathematician Alfio Quarteroni and his team are building a virtual heart model based on personalized medical images that may one day help cardiologists and cardiac surgeons non-invasively diagnose pathological heart conditions.

{"id": 729, "text": "For years, mini versions of organs such as the brain, kidney and lung—known as “organoids”—have been grown from stem cells. Organoids promise to cut down on the need for animal testing and offer better models to study how human organs form and how that process goes awry in disease. However, conventional approaches to grow organoids result in stem cells assembling into micro- to millimeter-sized, hollow spheres. “That is non-physiological, because many organs, such as the intestine or the airway, are tube-shaped and much larger” says Matthias Lütolf, a professor at EPFL's Institute of Bioengineering, who led the study published today in \nNature Materials\n.\nTo develop larger organoids that resemble their normal counterparts, Lütolf and his team turned to bioprinting. Just as 3D-printers allow people to create everyday objects, similar technology can help bioengineers to assemble living tissues. But instead of the plastics or powders used in conventional 3D-printers, bioprinters use bioinks—liquids or gels that encapsulate living cells. “Bioprinting is very compelling because it allows you to deposit cells anywhere in 3D space, so you could think of arranging cells into an organ-like configuration such as a tube,” Lütolf says.\nThe researchers designed a customized bioprinting set-up consisting of a microscope and a device that can aspirate and deposit cells through a thin nozzle coupled to a syringe pump. On the microscope stage, the team installed a plate containing a gel that resembles the complex extracellular environment found in many tissues. This type of gel, Lütolf notes, “is incredibly potent to allow cells to form a tissue, but because it’s difficult to handle people haven't really exploited it for bioprinting.”\nBy moving the microscope stage and monitoring constantly the process through the microscope lens, the researchers were able to deposit into the gel a line of intestinal stem cells that measured a few centimeters in length. “The cool thing about using a microscope is that you can always see what you're doing and you can watch what cells do—you're not blind,” Lütolf says. “In other bioprinting approaches, you don't see what's going on.”\nOnce stem cells were seeded, Lütolf says, “magic happened”: the cells started to grow and interact with each other, forming a continuous, tube-shaped tissue that mimicked many of the anatomical and functional features of a regular gut. The lab-grown guts, which reached up to three centimeters in size, were composed of crypt-shaped pockets with stem cells and they contained the same specialized absorptive and secretory cells as those found in a full-sized intestine. The mini-guts’ secretory cells were also able to secrete antimicrobial molecules in response to specific stimuli.\n© 2020 EPFL\nWhat makes the newly developed approach different—and more successful—than other methods to grow organoids is that it combines the flexibility and precision of 3D-printing with the ability of stem cells to grow and organize themselves. “We allow the biology to happen—that’s absolutely crucial,” Lütolf says.\nBy bioprinting organoid-forming cells from the gastrointestinal tract, the researchers also generated portions of the stomach, small intestine and colon, which then formed interconnected mini versions of their parent organs. With traditional methods for growing organoids, Lütolf notes, “you can grow either stomach organoids or intestinal organoids—whereas with bioprinting, you can combine different cell types and arrange them in different ways,” he says.\nWhile the mini-organs perform the functions of their normal counterparts, their use in regenerative medicine, including for replacing human tissues and organs, is still years away, Lütolf says. But he notes that the newly developed approach could be used to build tissue models for human diseases, including cancer, and for testing how drug candidates act on specific cell types within a tissue.\nLütolf’s team now hopes to use bioprinting to build airway tubes to study viral infection, for example with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The infected mini-airways could then help to test different treatment approaches. “A big advantage is that, with a microscope, you can watch as infection evolves, so you can quantify and study what happens,” Lütolf says. “That’s an exciting perspective.”", "summary": "Researchers at EPFL have developed an approach to print tiny tissues that look and function almost like their full-sized counterpart.

{"id": 730, "text": "Why do virtual reality headsets make users nauseous? One reason is latency, or the almost imperceptible amount of time it takes for a display image to change in response to a user’s head movement. However, the  (JPEG) has just introduced a new image compression standard that could resolve this problem. This working group is headed by Touradj Ebrahimi, a professor in EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI).\nWith JPEG XS, images and videos maintain an extremely high level of quality thanks to a compression process that is simpler and faster – and thus more energy efficient. The compressed files end up being larger, but that’s not a problem thanks to broadband networks such as Wi-Fi and 5G: the aim is to stream the files instead of storing them in smartphones or other devices with limited memory.\nThis means that you could use your smartphone, tablet or computer to project a high-definition movie or a video game onto a large-screen display almost instantaneously. No cables would be required, and the image quality would be extremely high.\n\"We want to be smarter\"\n “For the first time in the history of image coding, we are compressing less in order to better preserve quality, and we are making the process faster while using less energy,” says Professor Ebrahimi, who runs EPFL’s . “We want to be smarter in how we do things. The idea is to use less resources, and use them more wisely. This is a real paradigm shift.”\nJPEG compression, which has been widely popular over the past 25 years (see inset), typically reduces image file sizes by a factor of ten. This compression process was developed so that images could be stored in cameras, with their limited memory, and easily shared over communication networks. Yet the process needs to evolve in response to new applications, more efficient broadband networks and technological advances. The JPEG XS standard compresses files by no more than a factor of six and is not meant to replace the popular JPEG format. “Compressing the images with JPEG XS doesn’t compromise quality at all: even experts can’t tell the difference between an original and a compressed picture or movie,” adds Ebrahimi.\nWide array of applications\nJPEG XS could come in handy whenever images and videos need to be sent to a processor as fast as possible. Potential applications include the “eyes” of drones and self-driving cars – technologies where long latency represents a danger for humans.\nThe new format has also attracted the attention of the European Space Agency (ESA). The low-power algorithms used by JPEG XS would be a boon for space probes, which need to take very high-quality photos using only a tiny source of energy. Smartphones and other everyday devices with limited memory will continue to use the legacy JPEG format to store pictures.\nAnother advantage of JPEG XS is that, like all previous JPEG formats, it is open-source. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), based in Hollywood, is already considering adopting JPEG XS as its editing format. “With JPEG XS, professional movie editors can take images created with different devices and import them directly into their editing software,” says Ebrahimi. Currently, every brand of video camera that uses high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging techniques has its own proprietary coding format. That means individual files must be transcoded before they can be edited. JPEG XS will change this situation by providing a universal format.\nTested and approved at EPFL\n In addition to coordinating the development of the JPEG family of standards, Professor Ebrahimi came up with a new evaluation methodology together with his team in order to assess how well JPEG XS performs. These tests proved that the technological side of the new format is sound. The multimedia industry is currently awaiting final approval by the member states of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Once that is obtained, JPEG XS-based products and services can be launched.\n “In the immediate future, JPEG XS will be put to use in professional applications like movie editing, space imagery and professional-grade cameras. Consumer electronics will come next, including self-driving cars, virtual reality, augmented reality, and wireless connections between multimedia devices and TV monitors or projectors,” says Ebrahimi. “To be able to use JPEG XS, consumers will need to own the next generation of devices. In terms of software, they will probably just need to run an update, like they do from time to time on their computers and smartphones anyway.”\n10 to 15 billion. That’s the estimated number of JPEG images shared daily over social media around the world.\n25 years.

{"id": 731, "text": "Every year, more than a million fish are used for toxicity testing and scientific research in the EU alone, and around 400 fish are needed for a single fish early-life stage test. Such toxicity tests are often required by regulatory authorities for new chemical substances, as fish are particularly sensitive to contaminants in water at early developmental stages. However, the increasing use of experimental animals is ethically questionable. In addition, conventional tests are complex, expensive and take weeks or months to complete. Alternative approaches are therefore being sought by scientists, regulators and industry.\nA promising new method has now been demonstrated by an Eawag study, conducted in collaboration with the ETH, the EPFL and the University of York (UK). The results have been published in the journal Science Advances\n1\n : rather than using live fish (in vivo), the tests are performed with fish cells (in vitro). After just five days, cell-population growth, inhibited to a greater or lesser extent under chemical stress – combined with modelling of toxicological effects – shows excellent agreement with data from independently conducted in vivo experiments.\nEnvironmental toxicologist Professor Kristin Schirmer, who is leading Eawag’s efforts to reduce the use of experimental animals, comments: “This is a major step towards simpler, less expensive and more rapid toxicity testing for the authorisation and use of new chemicals. It’s the first time we’ve been able to use cell cultures to accurately predict chemical effects on growth which would only emerge after weeks or even months in live fish.”\nThe mechanism underlying the new method appears simple: the pesticides used in the study inhibit fish growth – the higher the concentrations to which the animals are exposed, the more their growth is reduced. The same effects were shown for the gill cell populations cultured in the laboratory. Kristin Schirmer explains: “The reason why the results can be extrapolated so well is that bigger fish don’t have bigger cells, but more cells, and we calculate the concentration of the substance in the cells.” The model thus predicts what happens if the fish is exposed to the test substance in water – which in turn can help to refine other tests and predictive models.\nThe new approach is not, however, as simple as it initially appears. To determine what concentrations in cultured cells have the same effects as in live fish requires elaborate modelling and a detailed knowledge of substance properties. In addition, it is not clear whether gill cells will prove to be representative for all types of fish tissue. Other cells may react differently, and other substances may be biotransformed. Nonetheless, the study is of considerable interest for experts because of the novel approach pursued.\nDr Roman Ashauer, who initiated the study and is now working at the University of York, says: “The traditional work flow for chemical risk assessment has been ‘test first, interpret later’. We’ve taken a different approach, by first modifying a relatively simple mathematical model of fish growth and then feeding the necessary experimental data into this model.” The authors hope that this approach will be taken up by other scientists to test its wider applicability, and the initial signs are en-couraging: at a recent Annual Meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC Europe) held in Glasgow, Dr Julita Stadnicka-Michalak, the study’s first author, received the prestigious Young Scientist Award.\n15,000 new substances a day\nAs recently reported\n2\n, the 100 millionth substance has now been registered in the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry – the world’s largest database of chemical substances. With around 15,000 new substances added every day, very few are regulated and even fewer have undergone chemical safety testing. In the past, only about 10 high production volume chemicals have been assessed per year, and throughput would need to be increased 300-fold in order to comply with the EU REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). The main goal of chemical risk assessment is to prevent environmental pollution, thus maintaining a balance between the social and economic benefits of synthetic compounds and the risks they pose to ecosystems.\nOriginal article and reference: \n1\nToxicology across scales: cell population growth in vitro predicts reduced fish growth; Julita Stadnicka Michalak, Kristin Schirmer, Roman Ashauer (2015); Science Advances.

{"id": 732, "text": "Optical circuits are set to revolutionize the performance of many devices. Not only are they 10–100 times faster than electronic circuits, but they also consume a lot less power. Within these circuits, light waves are controlled by extremely thin surfaces called metasurfaces that concentrate the waves and guide them as needed. The metasurfaces contain regularly spaced nanoparticles that can modulate electromagnetic waves over sub-micrometer wavelength scales.\nMetasurfaces could enable engineers to make flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics for a host of applications, ranging from flexible tablet computers to solar panels with enhanced light-absorption characteristics. They could also be used to create flexible sensors to be placed directly on a patient’s skin, for example, in order to measure things like pulse and blood pressure or to detect specific chemical compounds.\nThe catch is that creating metasurfaces using the conventional method, lithography, is a fastidious, several-hour-long process that must be done in a clean room. But EPFL engineers from the have now developed a simple method for making them in just a few minutes at low temperatures – or sometimes even at room temperature – with no need for a clean room. The EPFL's School of Engineering method produces dielectric glass metasurfaces that can be either rigid or flexible. The results of their research appear in \nNature Nanotechnology\n.\nTurning a weakness into a strength\nThe new method employs a natural process already used in fluid mechanics: dewetting. This occurs when a thin film of material is deposited on a substrate and then heated. The heat causes the film to retract and break apart into tiny nanoparticles. “Dewetting is seen as a problem in manufacturing – but we decided to use it to our advantage,” says Fabien Sorin, the study’s lead author and the head of FIMAP.\nWith their method, the engineers were able to create dielectric glass metasurfaces – rather than metallic metasurfaces – for the first time. The advantage of dielectric metasurfaces is that they absorb very little light and have a high refractive index, making it possible to effectively modulate the light that propagates through them.\nTo construct these metasurfaces, the engineers first created a substrate textured with the desired architecture. Then they deposited a material – in this case, chalcogenide glass – in thin films just tens of nanometers thick. The substrate was subsequently heated for a couple of minutes until the glass became more fluid and nanoparticles began to form in the sizes and positions dictated by the substrate’s texture.\nThe engineers’ method is so efficient that it can produce highly sophisticated metasurfaces with several levels of nanoparticles or with arrays of nanoparticles spaced 10 nm apart. That makes the metasurfaces highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions – such as to detect the presence of even very low concentrations of bioparticles. “This is the first time dewetting has been used to create glass metasurfaces. The advantage is that our metasurfaces are smooth and regular, and can be easily produced on large surfaces and flexible substrates,” says Sorin.", "summary": "One of the key building blocks of flexible photonic circuits and ultra-thin optics are metasurfaces.
